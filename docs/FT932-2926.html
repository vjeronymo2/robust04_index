			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (6): Faster, cheaper, more reliable - Value-added services / EDI and electronic mail THE paperless office remains a dream that seems to slip ever further into the future. Nevertheless, the growth of electronic trading, using electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail, is having a profound effect on a growing number of business and other users. EDI is a value-added telecommunications network service which enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange routine business documentation such as orders and invoices using standard electronic forms and their own computers linked through a service provider. It is often a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging information than the traditional paper-based business transaction and can play a crucial role in automating a transaction chain. For example Tesco, one of the pioneers of EDI use in the UK, has automated its entire transaction chain of recording sales, amending and checking stock records, re-ordering goods, receiving and checking invoices and making payments. By reducing the time taken to process a transaction, manufacturing companies and retailers can reduce their level of stocks and adopt management techniques such as just-in-time inventory control. Trading information electronically can also help suppliers and their customers match their operations more closely to sales patterns and other variables, and lead to a closer 'partnership' between supplier and customer. EDI also automatically sets up an 'audit trail' which enables an organisation to check and validate electronic documentation. These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated, and in the UK which leads Europe in EDI usage in the private sector, although France has made a co-ordinated effort since 1989 to implement EDI in the public sector. In other countries such as Germany and Japan, electronic trading does take place domestically but is limited because the systems depend on non-standard software implementations or industry-based proprietary systems which are not interconnected. About 7,000 companies and other organisations in Britain are estimated to be using electronic trading and the number is growing by between 20 and 30 per cent a year. But there is still much room for growth. Some recent estimates have suggested that less than 5 per cent of business transactions in the UK are currently handled by EDI. Of the top 1,000 companies, roughly 300 use EDI. International Network Services (INS) is the biggest of the UK-based EDI services providers with more than 55 per cent of the market and a 35 per cent share of the overall European market. INS, jointly owned by ICL and GEIS, the US-based network services company, provides three main EDI 'communities', INS-Tradanet, the main service for retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector. Its nearly 4,500 UK corporate customers cover 35 market sectors and include 78 of the top 100 UK companies, nine of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceuticals companies, 17 of the top 20 non-life insurers and four clearing banks. Altogether 15,000 organisations worldwide use its network services which link 100 countries and 750 cities. INS-Tradanet handles more than 6m documents a month and Mr Lee Tate, INS managing director, says the group signed more than 1,100 new companies up for the service last year. However he acknowledges that the market is becoming more competitive. 'The competition is much tougher,' he says. Other EDI network service suppliers in the UK include ATT-Istel, IBM and, since October 1991, British Telecom. In response, INS has dropped its prices. 'We are going after higher volumes,' says Mr Tate. Earlier this year, INS cut its charges following price changes by competitors in 1992. A basic start-up package including Intercept-Plus PC software, joining fee and 12 months usage of INS-Tradanet now costs Pounds 1,450. The price cuts were designed primarily to encourage small companies to adopt EDI. A new 'unbundled approach' to charges means that companies wishing to exchange documents with a single trading partner can buy a minimum package at the outset and then take advantage of the integrated INS-Mail facility to add features as their EDI usage develops. Companies use these EDI service suppliers because they provide a central 'post office' function, directing message traffic to the appropriate recipient and providing any 'data translation' needed between different computers or message standards. Service suppliers, software companies and even the big EDI trading partners offer software packages which handle links into the different services and the conversion of data from business systems into the correct message format standards. UK sectors which have pioneered the use of EDI include the motor and electronics industries and the retail trade, particularly the supermarket chains, and in the financial services sector, the insurance industry. EDI is a relatively new value added service - INS, for example, was only set up in 1985. Nevertheless some key trends have already emerged. In particular, EDI is becoming far more international. There is an increasing use of Edifact, EDI for Administration, Commerce and Transport, an emerging group of international message standards which avoids the need for conversion from one national or industry standard to another. Between 15 and 20 per cent of INS's customers now have international links. For example, retailers, led by Tesco and Boots which have developed extensive domestic supplier networks using EDI, are now doing the same with overseas suppliers. In addition, Mr Tate says that a large number of countries are beginning to set up EDI services in their own right, often using the software and technical know-how of established EDI players such as INS, IBM and BT. For example, INS has franchised local companies in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Portugal and South Africa to operate the INS-Tradanet service locally and is negotiating other deals in Malaysia, Taiwan and with the PTT in India. Other UK-based service providers have franchised operations in Singapore and Korea. 'Our software runs under Unix so we can put it onto any hardware platform,' says Mr Tate. The system in Ireland, for example, runs on an IBM RS6000 but INS is working with Unisys in south-east Asia and with Hewlett-Packard in India. In Ireland, Portugal and India, where the franchisee is the local PTT, the service runs, or will run, over their own networks. In other cases, for example South Africa, it is delivered via a managed network. EDI users are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Originally, EDI tended to be used only for basic transactions such as ordering and invoicing. However, as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has the range of information transmitted over EDI links. Tesco now exchanges 13-week sales forecasts with a quarter of the 1,200 suppliers which trade with it electronically. Tesco has also started communicating with individuals in its supplier companies through the INS electronic mail service. There are 4,000 electronic mail users in Tesco and they can communicate with 3,000 contacts in 200 suppliers. EDI is also being integrated with existing internal electronic mail systems and other computer applications. Using EDI in this way enables a customer to link two incompatible Email systems, for example in different departments or divisions of the same company. Finally, EDI is gradually reaching a wider audience including government departments such as the Education Department and HMSO in the UK, and new sectors such as the book industry.</p>

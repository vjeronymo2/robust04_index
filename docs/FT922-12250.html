			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (18): The prospect of fewer road holes - Mercol Descaling GAPING holes in city streets for days on end while water mains are replaced may be a less common sight in the future. Crumbling and scaled-up water mains had become a curse of many British cities, but Mercol, a Chesterfield company, has developed a possible solution to the problem. It has developed an epoxy resin that can be used to line the inside of pipes, and a quick and efficient way of applying it. The invention has won the Queen's award for technology. Mercol has been in existence since 1937, when its main activity was manufacturing degreasants and descalers for heavy industry. It later moved into refurbishing water mains, and developed a successful asphaltic bitumen lining for mains in the 1960s - the first direct application method for spray-applied linings. By the late 1970s, however, it was clear that the days of the bitumen system were numbered. Its quality was variable, and its lifespan insufficient, so Mercol set about developing a new product. It came up with Geopox GX014, an epoxy resin made up of two constituent parts which harden when they are mixed - rather like some commercial adhesives. Every aspect of the new material was tested and field trials were conducted over nine years. The final 18 months were spent on toxicological tests at the Department of the Environment's water research centre in Swindon, to ensure that none of the chemicals in the resin would leach out into water. 'This is probably the most durable lining you could have,' says Mr Noel Miller, Mercol's chief executive, 'Tests have shown that it should be sound for 100 years without any deterioration.' Before the system could be fully approved, the DoE insisted that Mercol should develop an independent monitoring system which could be fitted to the machine applying the lining to ensure uniform quality and adherence to quality standards throughout the application process. In response, Mercol developed a positive displacement meter capable of accuracies of better than 1 per cent in all conditions. These meters are fitted to all lining rigs. When a section of main needs lining, it is no longer necessary to dig up the road. Besides the time saving, and the reduction in disruption to supplies, the process is 75 per cent cheaper than relaying a water main. Mercol has completed a number of contracts in Tyne and Wear, Kent and Yorkshire. It already supplies six of the 20 contractors who carry out this kind of work. Last year, its turnover was around Pounds 6m, although a profit figure is not yet available. The Mercol process is not suitable for every type of situation. Some mains are simply too weak to be re-lined. But so far the company has been able to use its process in 95 per cent of the cases referred to it.</p>

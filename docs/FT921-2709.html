			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage buying fails to lift Nikkei above 20,000 THE NIKKEI average failed to recover to above the critical 20,000 level in spite of arbitrage-related activity which pushed up share prices late in the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 80.47 better at 19,917.63 after a day's high of 19,990.68 and low of 19,687.94. Selling by companies and investment trusts initially depressed the market, but arbitrage-related buying and bargain hunting lifted the index in the afternoon. Volume picked up to 350m shares from 200m on active cross-trading ahead of the March year-end book closing. In spite of the rise in the Nikkei, other statistics reflected the market's continued bearishness. Declines led advances by 728 to 271, with 121 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 10.99 to 1,433.87, extending its fall to 11 consecutive trading days, the first time in 35 years. A total of 337 issues set new lows since the beginning of last year. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was just 0.62 easier at 1,101.05. Traders said the improvement in the Nikkei was supported by gains in illiquid component stocks. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew commented: 'The Nikkei is not really a benchmark any more, since most blue chips are losing very heavily.' Many analysts have attributed the fall in equities to the weakness in the economy. However, hopes that the Bank of Japan will respond to the decline in confidence by cutting the official discount rate have been dashed by recent central bank comments that the economy was stable. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, chairman of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, yesterday called for fiscal and monetary measures to stimulate the economy and help the stock market. Large-capital issues such as steel makers lost ground, with Nippon Steel ending Y7 down at Y302 and NKK Y9 off at Y281. Exporters also fell, with Hitachi slipping Y9 to Y756 and Toshiba Y6 to Y564. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone weakened for the 14th consecutive trading day, losing Y9,000 to Y642,000. Sanrio, the novelty goods maker, fell Y120 to Y1,260 on reports that it may not pay a dividend. The company is renowned for its extensive financial investments, and faces mounting losses due to the fall in share prices. Financial issues were lower on profit-taking ahead of the year-end. Industrial Bank of Japan receded Y20 to Y2,520 and Sumitomo Bank dipped Y20 to Y1,730. Foreigners were seen bargain hunting in blue chip exporters. Matsushita Electric Industrial put on Y20 to Y1,260 and Kyocera added Y60 at Y4,030. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 250.77 to 21,337.87 in volume of 441.4m shares. Activity surged on trading by companies realising profits ahead of the March book-closing. Roundup PACIFIC RIM markets continued to be pulled lower by the weakness in Tokyo. HONG KONG retreated moderately, with the news that HSBC is in merger talks with Midland Bank, of the UK, coming after the market had closed. The Hang Seng index finished 15 points off at 5,044.86 in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn. Analysts expect the market to shed over 100 points today as investors react negatively to the merger talks. HSBC closed 25 cents down at HKDollars 45.25. MANILA's fall continued on uncertainty about the tender price to be set for the additional share offering in Philippine National Bank, down 11 pesos at 249 pesos. The composite index ended 23.60 lower at 1,083.01 in turnover of 132.7m pesos. The weakness in the US of Philippine Long Distance Telephone also depressed general sentiment and the stock closed 20 pesos down at 855 pesos. TAIWAN dropped nearly 150 points before rallying modestly to end a net 122.64, or 2.5 per cent, off at 4,890.32. Turnover came to TDollars 29.3bn, against TDollars 26.4bn. The market remained burdened by political uncertainty over democratic reform proposals. SEOUL drew comfort from a government announcement that it would provide loans totalling Won250bn to both small and medium-sized companies. The composite index rose 6.83 to 615.19 in turnover of Won209.8bn. SINGAPORE remained dull in low volume. The Straits Times Industrial index lost 4.30 to 1,445.36 in turnover of 19.73m shares, down from 30.56m. NatSteel, which has announced that it is cutting steel bar prices by 4 per cent, put on 6 cents to SDollars 4.02. KUALA LUMPUR improved slightly in thin trade, the composite index closing 2.75 up at 594.49 in volume of 27m shares. BANGKOK edged forward, helped by gains in the property and finance sectors. The SET index firmed 3.47 to 795.76 in turnover of Bt4.67bn. BOMBAY weakened as state-owned investment houses sold shares. The BSE index fell 51.42 to 3,198.78. AUSTRALIA took little encouragement from data which showed an upturn in the economy during the December quarter. The All Ordinaries index finished 7.9 easier at 1,578.9. NEW ZEALAND turned downwards, the NZSE-40 index dipping 3.74 to 1,454.45 in turnover of some NZDollars 17m.</p>

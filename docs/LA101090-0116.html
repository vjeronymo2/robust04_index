			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> UCLA;  </P> <P> MADDOX IMPRESSES FRIENDS, FOES  </P> <P> Quarterback Tommy Maddox threw three interceptions when UCLA lost to Arizona,  28-21, Saturday at the Rose Bowl. However, he earned the respect of an opponent  and a teammate.  </P> <P> Arizona free safety Jeff Hammerschmidt, who intercepted one of Maddox's passes,  said the Bruin quarterback is the best his team has faced this year. "He's such  a leader," Hammerschmidt said. "I don't know how many times he came up to the  line, saw our defense and checked off to another play.  </P> <P> "He's incredible, and the team really believes in him. He's just a big winner,  and I can see why people love him over (in Los Angeles)."  </P> <P> UCLA wide receiver Reggie Moore said last year's team didn't always believe it  could win. "This was a hard loss for us," Moore said. "We thought all along we  were going to win it. But we're not going to fold. This team isn't going to  quit."  </P> <P> He added that Maddox is a major reason for UCLA's new attitude. "Tommy has  tremendous poise," he said. MAL FLORENCE  </P></p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Heathrow road link plan dropped An Pounds 800m plan to improve road and rail links between Heathrow airport and south-west London has been dropped by the government two months before the end of the consultation deadline. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said there had to be a strong case for a plan which would mainly benefit local communities at a time when there was pressure on public spending. The Department of Transport would consider more limited measures if local authorities were prepared to make suggestions, he said. The decision was criticised by Movement for London, a pressure group headed by the British Road Federation and including organisations such as the Automobile Association, the Confederation of British Industry and the Road Haulage Association. It said: 'Government-appointed consultants have spent years and millions of pounds looking at the problems of road and rail access to the world's busiest airport. For the Department of Transport to reject proposals before consultation has even finished is a disgrace.' The group said transport problems around Heathrow were not a local issue and were of strategic significance. Consultants spent five years preparing a report that was published last August. It recommended a new road link between the A3 at Kingston and Heathrow, including a new Thames crossing, costing Pounds 580m. It also proposed a rail link between Kingston, Heathrow and Waterloo station in central London costing up to Pounds 250m. The early decision to drop the plans was taken to end uncertainty, Mr Norris said. A Pounds 300m rail link between Heathrow and Paddington station in west London is not affected by the decision. The service is due to start in 1997.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTEREY PARK BUILDING BAN EXTENDED 1 YEAR  </P> <P> To give city officials more time to revise design standards for apartments,  condominiums and townhouses, the City Council last week unanimously extended  for one year its building moratorium on multiple-family units.  </P> <P> The ban applies only to new construction in the community's most congested  area, the northeast section. Although it was authorized for another year,  council members and city officials say the ban will probably last no longer  than 60 to 90 days.  </P> <P> The moratorium was enacted last May so that city planners could consider  downzoning more than 400 acres of residential property zoned for  multiple-family housing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reject Proposals  </P> <P> But last month the City Council rejected all of the downzoning proposals  suggested by the planners. In doing so, council members Judy Chu and  Christopher F. Houseman said revising the zoning was not the best way to solve  the problems of overcrowding in Monterey Park. Angry residents told the council  that downzoning could hurt their property values.  </P> <P> During that meeting, on April 27, Chu and Houseman said they wanted to find out  what design restrictions might be placed on new construction to limit the  number of units allowed in apartment and condominium complexes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ban Extended  </P> <P> Although the ban was extended unanimously last Monday, some council members  raised the issue of how long it would actually remain in effect.  </P> <P> Houseman questioned the need to extend the moratorium for another year, arguing  that the extension should be for only a few months. And Mayor Barry L. Hatch  said: "I think we need to allay any fears that there is going to be an extended  moratorium."  </P> <P> Even though Hatch voted to continue the ban for another year, he said it should  take no more than 60 to 90 days for the city staff to propose revised building  guidelines and for the City Council to adopt any changes.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who has been accused of taking a 10  million yen bribe from a major construction firm, said Tuesday  [8 March] he will take his fight to court.    Nakamura said in a statement through his lawyer that the  truth and substance of the bribery scandal would be distorted if  he were to agree to be questioned by prosecutors.    He said he would rather have prosecutors issue a warrant of  arrest to "get it settled once and for all in court."    Prosecutors have requested permission to issue an arrest  warrant against Nakamura, who has repeatedly refused to  voluntarily present himself to prosecutors for questioning on  suspicion of taking the 10 million yen bribe from leading  general contractor Kajima Corp. in 1992.</p>

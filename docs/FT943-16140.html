			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / OECD criticises record of Tecs The performance of training and enterprise councils, the employer-led bodies charged with transforming vocational training in England and Wales, has 'fallen short of initial expectations', says a report from the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, David Goodhart writes. The judgment is contained in an unpublished note on the UK labour market produced for last month's OECD jobs study. It is critical of the UK's educational and skills base. 'Improvements are required if the UK is to reduce the large discrepancy between its ratio of skilled to unskilled workers compared with those of Germany and Japan,' it says. But it praises the Re-Start programme for the long-term unemployed and the general approach to labour market deregulation which has made the UK labour market 'one of the least regulated in Europe, if not the entire OECD area'. The OECD researchers seem puzzled why this has not led to better results. The report says: 'It may be that the positive effects of structural reform take longer to bear fruit than originally assumed.' The report is critical of continuing real-wage rigidity. 'Real wage growth during the most recent cycle continued long after the recession had started,' it says.</p>

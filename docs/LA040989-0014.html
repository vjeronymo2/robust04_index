			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOME, THE OSCAR SHOW WAS ONE BIG CARR CRASH  </P> <P> Carr deserves a "raspberry" despite all the misplaced accolades he has received  in the press and on television. I have had the pleasure of hearing or seeing  about 55 of the academy programs in the last 62 years, and by far this was the  worst.  </P> <P> RON LAWRENCE  </P> <P> Agoura Hills  </P></p>

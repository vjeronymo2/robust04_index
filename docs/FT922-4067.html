			<p>920608 FT  08 JUN 92 / Observer: Explained It won't be all plain sailing at actuaries R. Watson's forthcoming seminar. The first session is called 'A plain man's guide to the US benefit scene', and the second 'A plain man's guide to the Canadian benefit scene'. But the next is 'Expatriates: benefits and related tax issues.' The reason for the style-change isn't hard to find. While men will present the first two, the third will be run by Ruth Ryals of George Beram &amp; Co in Boston. 'A plain woman's guide . . .' would be less than politically correct.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN TO HIKE KEY RATE TO STEM INFLATION  </P> <P> The Bank of Japan, which has been battling to secure an increase in the  official discount rate in the face of opposition from other Japanese government  agencies, appears to have won the day after weeks of intense debate.  </P> <P> The bank announced Friday that it will raise the official discount rate next  week for the first time in nine years in response to increases in official  rates abroad and fears of a resurgence in inflation at home.  </P> <P> The central bank will lift the rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25% at a  policy board meeting on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The bank made the announcement following the publication of figures Friday that  showed sharper-than-expected increases in consumer prices in April and May.  These came at the end of a week in which fears of a resurgence of inflation had  already been exacerbated by a sharp decline in the international value of the  yen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Price Rise  </P> <P> Central bank officials declined to comment directly on the possibility of a  rise in the official discount rate from its all-time low. However, on Friday  night they indicated to Japanese newspapers and television stations that rates  would be raised.  </P> <P> The prices data published Friday showed that in April, consumer prices rose by  2.4% from a year earlier, the highest monthly increase in 12 years. The  increase is not as significant as it seems because it is boosted by the  introduction of a 3% consumption tax in April. But both the central bank and  private sector economists detected signs of underlying increases in prices.  </P> <P> These concerns were reinforced by consumer price figures for Tokyo for May,  also published Friday.  </P></p>

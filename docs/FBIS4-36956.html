			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Jordan Considers Its Position </F> `Identical' to the Syrian Position"]    [Text] Amman -- A reliable Jordanian source said yesterday  that the forthcoming Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on Israeli  withdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territory before entering  into "normalization agreements" are identical with the Syrian  position which calls on Israel "to withdraw fully in return for  full peace."    The source told AL-HAYAH that Jordan's demands for the  return  of its occupied territory and for the definition and demarcation  of its international borders are "equal to the Sryian call for  Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Golan in return for peace  with Israel." The source noted that Damascus "called for  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for peace, not  withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories including the  Jordanian, Palestinian, and Lebanese territories." He added  that a definition and demarcation of the Jordanian borders  "would help in the demarcation of the border of the future  Palestinian state...east of the West Bank."    The informed source stressed that "when the question of the  Palestinian Golan was mentioned, Jordan's aim in talking about  it was to support the Syrian position that that territory is  Syrian...certainly not Israeli."    Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali had said at a  closed session of the House of Representatives last week that a  dispute over the ownership of al-Himmah triangle known as the  "Palestinian Golan" was one of the most important obstacles  standing in the way of a draft agreement with Israel on the  Syrian Golan Heights.</p>

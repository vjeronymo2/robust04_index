			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / France's siege eases but shortages grow MORE THAN a third of the roadblocks which have paralysed France for the past nine days were lifted by yesterday afternoon, but the economic damage continued to mount. Truck drivers slowly rolled back their siege as government officials visited the blockades to explain the contents of an accord on pay and conditions, reached by drivers' representatives and the government in the early hours of the morning. The most vulnerable industries, cars, petrol, food, tourism and chemicals, have already had to make temporary lay-offs, especially in Rhone-Alpes and the south. Shops were running low on stocks throughout France. The Leclerc chain of supermarkets said its stocks were half as high as usual in fresh fruit and staples, such as sugar and flour. There were fears that worse was to come on the roads as it remained unclear when all the barriers would go, let alone when truckers would resume deliveries. The Interior Ministry claimed that 60 blockades, involving 3,200 trucks, out of the original 160 roadblocks had been dispersed by lunchtime. By evening the ministry claimed that all main routes except for one section of the A6 north of Lyon. Violent clashes between truckers and police were reported. The A1 from Paris to Lille, the main route for traffic from northern Europe and the Channel ports, was fully open in both directions, it said. The A6 from the capital to Beaune in eastern France and the A7 from Lyons towards the Spanish frontier, were also open, said the ministry. Blockades were reported to be disappearing in Brittany. Progress was slow, as some truckers regrouped to form new barriers elsewhere and others staged operations escargot (go-slows). Business leaders warned that supply shortages could force some companies to close. It was proving impossible to compensate adequately by shifting to rail and air, said the Conseil National de Commerce. Nice airport had only 24 hours' aviation fuel left. Renault, the motor group, closed three of its four French assembly plants yesterday morning, though they reopened in the afternoon after fresh supplies arrived. The situation was 'literally changing from hour to hour', said Renault. Peugeot stopped two assembly lines and a kit packaging plant in eastern France, employing 17,000 people, and warned that more lay-offs will be needed this morning. Its Citroen subsidiary closed a plant at Aulnay. Michelin, the tyre maker, warned employees that lay-offs could come at any time. Motorway operators said they had lost FFr150m (Pounds 15.4m) on the main north-south routes alone, while the hoteliers' association estimated that occupancy was down by between 10 and 50 per cent and warned that some chains could face serious cashflow problems.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / ITV is angered by OFT assault ITV YESTERDAY expressed outrage over an Office of Fair Trading report that condemned its proposed new network system as anti-competitive, Raymond Snoddy writes. The OFT ruling against the system is likely to cause uncertainty in the ITV sphere for at least the next year and is almost certain to lead to an appeal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said yesterday the arrangements proposed 'are likely - indeed were in part intended - to have an anti-competitive effect on the television programme-making and the television broadcasting businesses.'

Independent producers could submit ideas to the network centre, but the programmes would be commissioned through a sponsoring ITV company which would see that all the rules were followed. Sir Bryan ruled that in deals with the network centre a contract should run for no more than five years, with an optional additional two. He also said independent producers should have the option of being commissioned directly from the centre to reduce the cost, inconvenience and possible unfairness of finding a sponsoring ITV company. The OFT also decided that the exclusive option for ITV to acquire rights to further programmes in a series and the programme format - which can often be sold to other countries - should be removed from standard contracts. British broadcasters have to buy 25 per cent of their programmes, apart from news and current affairs, from independents. Mr John Woodward, chief executive of Pact, the body representing independent producers, said: 'What this means is that for the first time independent producers will be able to sell programmes to the ITV network on the same terms as ITV companies.'</p>

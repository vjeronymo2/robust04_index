			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: GLENDORA;  </P> <P> HILLSIDE CONSERVANCY PANEL  </P> <P> The City Council appointed a nine-member steering committee to create a private  Hillside Conservancy, which will be dedicated to preserving the natural state  of the foothills above Glendora.  </P> <P> After the vote Tuesday, Councilman Marshall Mouw said the council's appointment  of a steering committee is the last city involvement with the organization. All  support for the conservancy will be from private sources, he said.  </P> <P> To accomplish its mission, he said, the conservancy could purchase land it  wants to preserve, receive donations of land, or persuade landowners to place  deed restrictions on their properties that would restrict development.  </P></p>

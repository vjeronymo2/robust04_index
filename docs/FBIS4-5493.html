			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Friday [8 April] the  party has no plan to appoint former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe as its vice president.    Mori told a press conference that he has no intention of  asking Watanabe to become LDP vice president to meet calls for  such a move within the party to strengthen the party leadership.  "I don't think the leadership is so weak as to need  reinforcement," Mori said, rejecting a charge from an intraparty  group that the leadership is weak in fighting the coalition  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Mori criticized moves by some party members to have Watanabe  promoted to the vice presidency, saying it could lead to an  intraparty struggle.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Last ditch attempt to keep Pepe in business PEPE, the jeans designer and distributor, is to make a last ditch attempt to stay in business based on a Pounds 9.1m open offer underwritten by a new management team and Novel, the Hong Kong textile group, writes Matthew Curtin. Pepe's much-delayed results for the year to end-March showed a Pounds 13m plunge from pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.74m to losses of Pounds 10.3m. The directors said the group would continue to make losses this year. Pepe was in 'severe financial difficulties' and unless the offer was approved by shareholders, it would have to cease trading. Should the group go into receivership, shareholders were unlikely to realise any return on their investment after creditors were paid. Mr Andrew Davison, non-executive director, said Pepe's longer-term survival would depend on the successful revival of its marketing efforts to re-establish the Pepe brand name and lift sales. Turnover slipped to Pounds 156.1m (Pounds 158.8m). The closure of the group's Norwegian and Canadian operations and losses on the sale of minor brand businesses resulted in extraordinary charges of Pounds 2.6m. Pepe's rescue - from an ill-timed and badly-managed expansion overseas after becoming the leading UK jeans brand behind Levi's in the late 1980s - is being led by an investment management consortium, put together by Mr Silas Chou. He replaced Mr Arun Shah, who founded the group, as chairman when Novel bought its 29.6 per cent stake in March this year. The consortium includes Mr Maurice Marciano, the former president of Guess Jeans who becomes chief executive (Americas), and Mr Lawrence Stroll - a director of Tommy Hilfiger, the US clothes group - who becomes group chief executive. They and Novel have formed a new company, SML, to underwrite the offer and will end up owning between 56.4 per cent and 65 per cent of Pepe. The Shah family will retain a stake in the group. The offer involves the issue of 726 new shares, at 5p a share, for every 100 held. The group and its bankers are negotiating Pounds 35m worth of new facilities which will only be provided once the offer is successful.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The users trial for the surface-to-surface missile,  Prithvi, began today with the successful launch of the missile  from the interim test range near Balasore in Orissa. The  indigenously built missile soared into clear sky at 1144 [0614  GMT] hitting the built-up target in (Tentulichura) island of  Bhadrak Coast in Bay of Bengal. Defense Ministry officials said  today's launch fully met the mission's requirements. The  150-to-250-km-range missile was launched from a mobile platform  in the presence of senior officials of the Indian Army and the  Defense Research and Development Organization, DRDO. The second  trial will be conducted on Monday [6 June] with a target in the  high seas which will be followed by other trials in battlefield  conditions. Prithvi is one of the five missiles developed under  DRDO's integrated missile development program. The other four  are Agni, Trishul, Akash and Nag.</p>

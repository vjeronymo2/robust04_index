			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Pepper added to Maxwell bean-feast - Robert Rice and John Mason examine the fall-out from a House of Lords' ruling The House of Lords' recent ruling in Pepper v Hart that Hansard - the official journal of UK parliamentary debates - could be used to assist in interpretating legislation was seen at the time as a decision likely to cause many a legal hiccup. So it has proved. Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of four men charged in connection with the collapse of Robert Maxwell's empire, used the ruling to challenge the power of the Serious Fraud Office to compel suspects to answer questions. The SFO's power is granted under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act. Section 8 of the act allows suspects to claim a 'reasonable excuse' for not answering questions, and this was used by Mr Trachtenberg. Mr Trachtenberg's 'reasonable excuse' was that he was being asked to give an account of the theft and fraud charges he faced before the prosecution had stated its own case. In effect, he argued, he was being asked to provide the case against him. This, he said, was contrary to a fundamental principle of English criminal law: that the prosecution must prove its case, unaided by the accused. It is clear from Hansard reports of the passage of the 1987 bill that parliament did not intend that this principle should be overridden by the section 2 powers, Mr Trachtenberg said. Mr Christopher Bourke, the stipendiary magistrate, agreed. However the magistrate's decision to dismiss the charge that Mr Trachtenberg refused to answer questions came as a surprise after a related lords' ruling last summer. That ruling concerned a similar refusal by Mr Wallace Duncan Smith to answer SFO questions. He had argued that the SFO's powers ceased once the accused had been charged. In any event, once charged, the SFO director was obliged to caution him under the terms of the code of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (Pace); under the code suspects are not obliged to answer questions, but anything they say could be used in evidence against them. The law lords rejected both arguments. As a matter of interpretation, the lords said, the powers of the SFO director did not cease after charges had been made and common sense dictated that the general provisions of the Pace code yielded to specific provisions of the 1987 act when the act applied. But Mr Bourke said the Smith case had not dealt with the issue of 'reasonable excuse' and had come before the Pepper v Hart decision last November. Therefore the law lords had not been able to refer to Hansard to determine the parliamentary intent behind the legislation. Mr Bourke said it was clear from reading Hansard that the Criminal Justice Act did not reverse the rule that the prosecution has the burden of proving the charges unaided by the accused. 'Parliament did not, either by silence or implication, abandon that rule. On the contrary, parliament was astute to preserve it,' Mr Bourke said. His decision was welcomed by law firms specialising in white collar crime defence work. 'This is a welcome reassertion of the rights of the defendant within the criminal justice system,' said Mr Monty Raphael of Peters and Peters, the firm representing Mr Trachtenberg's co-defendant, Mr Kevin Maxwell. The SFO says it is reviewing its position. However an appeal seems certain since the ruling raises serious implications for both the powers and procedures of the SFO. If the decision to dismiss the charges against Mr Trachtenberg is not overturned, the implications for the SFO could be considerable. The number of section 2 notices issued to people already charged are relatively few. The vast majority of the almost 800 notices issued each year are served either before charges are made or on banks. However in the often long and complex investigations handled by the SFO, the emergence, late in the day, of fresh evidence and new avenues of inquiry is not unusual. If a wall came down on the use of section 2 powers after charges were laid it could prevent the prosecution obtaining crucial evidence necessary for conviction. One solution, observers note, is the possibility of fresh legislation being passed. One amendment in the current Criminal Justice Bill would be enough to resolve the matter and render obsolete any arguments based on Pepper v Hart. But it is not just the powers of the SFO that have been upset by the Pepper v Hart ruling. The drafting of new insider dealing legislation has already hit choppy waters. Defining precisely at what point information becomes public has antagonised many in the City of London. Treasury ministers taking the bill through parliament have been forced onto the defensive, issuing verbal reassurances from the despatch box that the government has no intention to fundamentally alter current market practice. In the light of Pepper v Hart, such reassurances could rebound badly on the legislators, leaving the door wide open for legal challenges. One lawyer said: 'Unless the bill is more tightly drafted, they could get 'Peppered and Harted' all over the shop. It will be an absolute bean-feast for lawyers, but who else?'</p>

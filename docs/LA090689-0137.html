			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FACTORY WORKERS LEAD WAY AS U.S. PRODUCTIVITY RISES  </P> <P> American workers posted a modest productivity improvement in the second quarter  of the year, with significant gains by factory workers leading the way, the  government said today.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said productivity in the non-farm portion of the economy  increased at an annual rate of 0.7% in the April-June period, up from the 0.2%  gain reported in preliminary data last month and much better than the 1.3%  decline in the first quarter.  </P> <P> The department said unit labor costs -- a key inflation indicator -- increased  at an annual rate of 4.9% in the quarter, down from the 6.2% jump reported for  the first quarter but nonetheless a sign of persistent underlying inflation.  </P> <P> Analysts said the small productivity gain is consistent with the recent slowing  of the economy's growth rate.  </P> <P> They also said, however, that poor performance in the non-financial corporate  sector -- a category, including most service industries, in which productivity  fell and labor costs rose at a rapid 11.1% annual rate -- suggests that  inflation was still around.  </P> <P> "The future in overall productivity growth is not encouraging" because the  service-producing sector makes up roughly 80% of the economy, said Allen Sinai,  chief economist for Boston Co. Economic Advisors.  </P> <P> The second-quarter improvement occurred because output grew at an annual rate  of 2.4% and hours worked expanded by 1.7%.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said that hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of  5.6% in the quarter but that consumer inflation continued to more than erase  the wage gains. Real hourly compensation -- hourly compensation minus consumer  inflation -- fell 0.7%, the department said.  </P></p>

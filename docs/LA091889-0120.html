			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NASHWAN'S RACING FUTURE IN DOUBT  </P> <P> The future of Nashwan, one of Europe's top racehorses, was in serious doubt  today, 24 hours after the thoroughbred was beaten for the first time in his  six-race career in a warm-up for the prestigious Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.  </P> <P> Nashwan, winner of the Epsom Derby, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes  and 2,000 Guineas, put on a lifeless performance and finished third in Sunday's  Prix Niel at Longchamp outside Paris.  </P> <P> Tests are to be carried out on the colt, recently put up for syndication at  $28.8 million, and a decision is expected later this week whether Nashwan will  retire or race in the Arc on Oct. 8. The horse's owners originally wanted  Nashwan to bow out in a blaze of glory at the Arc before beginning stud duties.  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Thorp inquiry completion date A GOVERNMENT inquiry into the future of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd's Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria may be finished by early January. Discussions chaired by the Cabinet Office between the Environment Department, the Agriculture Ministry, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, which began several weeks ago, will produce a paper assessing the economic and environmental case for starting the Pounds 2.8bn plant. The BNF estimates the eventual decommissioning costs of the plant at more than Pounds 1bn if it starts and becomes radioactive. The government paper should be completed at about the same time as the public consultation by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, which ends on January 11. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is responsible for deciding whether to hold a public hearing, that might further delay the start of the plant - originally expected at the end of the year.</p>

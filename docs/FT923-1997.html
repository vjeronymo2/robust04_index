			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Profits warning by Philips sends share price tumbling SHARES in Philips, the Dutch electronics group, tumbled by nearly 7.5 per cent yesterday after the company cautioned that profits would likely be halved this year. Philips said that full-year results from normal business operations were expected to be halved from the 1991 level of Fl 981m (Dollars 557m) because of the failure of world economic recovery to emerge, the continued malaise in consumer electronics industry and the steep decline in the value of the dollar. The warning, which followed June's statement that 1992 results were likely to fall below 1991 levels, caused Philips's shares to close down Fl 1.80 at Fl 22.80, though above the new 12-month lows of about Fl 22.00 reached earlier in the day. Philips is scheduled to publish third-quarter figures on November 5. Last month it said second-quarter net profit before extraordinary items dropped by 56 per cent, reflecting difficult trading conditions in consumer electronics, a sector which accounts for almost half of group turnover of Fl 57bn. Difficulties prompted by fierce price wars in television sets, video cassette recorders and other types of consumer electronics have been exacerbated since the summer by the steep decline in the dollar, which recently touched a series of new lows against the guilder. Ironically, the latest profit warning came on the day that Mr Jan Timmer, company president, officially opened the world's first factory for the production of digital compact cassettes (DCC), a new audio product that Philips hopes will prove to be as successful as the analogue audio cassette. The factory, located in the Dutch town of Amersfoort, has been operational since July. It is owned by London-based PolyGram, Philips's 80 per cent owned music company, whose good profit performance in the software side of the consumer electronics industry has not been able to compensate entirely for the slide in prices commanded by the Dutch company's hardware. DCC players, which Philips is counting on to revitalise consumer interest in hi-fi equipment, are scheduled to go on sale in Japan on Monday, to be followed by parts of western Europe in October and the US in November.</p>

For document references to the above and for additional related documents, see the References section of the SQL/ERI Server Profiles specification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Objective. The primary objective of this FIPS PUB for SQL Environments is to specify SQL profiles that can be used by Federal departments and agencies to support integration of legacy databases and other non-SQL data repositories into an SQL environment. The intent is to provide a high level of control over a diverse collection of legacy or specialized data resources. An SQL environment allows an organization to obtain many of the advantages of SQL without requiring a large, complex, and error-prone conversion effort; instead, the organization can evolve, in a controlled manner, to a new environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Applicability. This standard is applicable in any situation where it is desirable to integrate a client-side productivity tool or a server-side data repository into an SQL environment. It is a non-mandatory standard that may be invoked on a case-by-case basis subject to the integration objectives of the procuring department or agency. It is particularly suitable for specifying limited SQL interfaces to legacy databases or to specialized data repositories not under the control of a full-function SQL database management system. It can be used along with other procurement information to specify SQL interface requirements for a wide range of data management procurements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One special area of application envisioned for this standard is Electronic Commerce, a National Challenge Application area of the National Information Infrastructure. The primary objective of Electronic Commerce is to integrate communications, data management, and security services in a distributed processing environment, thereby allowing business applications within different organizations to interoperate and exchange information automatically. At the data management level, electronic commerce requires a logically integrated database of diverse data stored in geographically separated data banks under the management and control of heterogeneous database management systems. An over-riding requirement is that these diverse data managers be able to communicate with one another and provide shared access to data and data operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access control mechanisms. FIPS SQL provides a powerful database language for data definition, data manipulation, and integrity management to satisfy many of these requirements. It is unrealistic to expect that every data manager involved in electronic commerce will conform to even the Entry SQL level of the FIPS SQL standard; however, it is not unrealistic to require that they support a limited SQL interface, even a read-only interface, provided by one of the SQL/ERI Server profiles. New procurements to add components to the National Information Infrastructure, or to upgrade existing components, can define the necessary SQL schemas and point to appropriate SQL/ERI Server profiles as procurement requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This standard may also be applicable, on a case-by-case basis, in many of the following areas: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Legacy databases <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Full-Text document databases <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Geographic Information Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bibliographic information retrieval <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

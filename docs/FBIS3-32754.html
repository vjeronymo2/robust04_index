			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo has reiterated that  the Cali Cartel has promoted the campaign against the presence  of U.S. troops on the Pacific coast to keep them out of the  country. Miriam Ortiz has the report.    In his latest speeches, President Cesar Gaviria always  linked  the Cali Cartel to the controversy over the presence of U.S.  military personnel in Juanchaco.    The defense minister today reiterated his position, which  many people are now viewing as plausible.    [Begin Pardo recording] When the whole thing began, we  noticed that drug traffickers were interested in some aspects of  this scandal. I also think that the debate has had its own  dynamics, and in many cases it is also a product of some  people's deep-rooted ideas. We are not discarding the  possibility that some sectors linked to drug trafficking are  interested in this situation. [end recording]    Pardo also said that as long as applicable international  agreements are in effect, U.S. troops will continue to come to  Colombia.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAND THEFT;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDS TO THE RISING TIDE OF VANISHING VEHICLES  </P> <P> He had parked his new used car on the street in front of his Garden Grove  apartment, reasoning that if he could see the car from his bedroom window it  would be safer than in the parking lot where his mini-pickup truck had been  stolen two years ago.  </P> <P> But only nine days after buying his 3-year-old Nissan 200 SX, Duc Nguyen went  out to go to work and the car was gone.  </P> <P> Garden Grove police found it a day later, stripped and abandoned on a  residential street three miles away. The engine was intact, but the two front  fenders were missing. So was the hood, the grill and a rear window. The car's  wheels and new tires were gone, replaced by an odd assortment of wheels and  undersized spare tires. And there were gaping holes where the tail lights had  been.  </P> <P> Standing in the towing company impound yard, hands on his hips, Nguyen, a  26-year-old computer operator, wasn't sure what he was going to do to help  prevent his car from being stolen again.  </P> <P> "Maybe I should find somewhere else to park," he said, shaking his head. "I  can't believe it. Why did they pick on me?"  </P> <P> Nguyen, of course, is not alone -- not when he lives in a city that averages  140 stolen cars a month -- 1,642 in 1989.  </P> <P> Based on the number of vehicle thefts per 100,000 population, Garden Grove is  among the top 100 cities under siege in what law enforcement officials call a  national epidemic of vehicle thefts. Others included in that category are Buena  Park, Santa Ana, Long Beach and San Diego.  </P> <P> The surge in thefts has not only caused many owners to arm their cars and  trucks with expensive alarm systems but has prompted law enforcement agencies,  car manufacturers and insurance companies to work together in finding ways to  stem the tide of vanishing vehicles.  </P> <P> According to the National Automobile Theft Bureau, vehicle theft is the worst  of the property crimes: It accounts for only 11% of the nation's property crime  offenses, yet represents 48% of property crime costs: an estimated $7.3  billion.  </P> <P> Over the past decade, the number of stolen cars in the United States has  increased 44% -- from 991,600 in 1978 to 1.4 million in 1988, the most recent  year for which national figures are available from the National Automobile  Theft Bureau.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, car-crazy California leads the pack with 295,789 stolen  vehicles in 1989, a 10.7% increase over the previous year, according to the  California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Indeed, when it comes to having a car, truck, van or motorcycle stolen, Duc  Nguyen lives in the heart of the vehicle theft capital of the nation: Southern  California.  </P> <P> Of California's 58 counties, Los Angeles is No. 1 with 129,275 stolen vehicles  in 1989. No. 2 is San Diego County with 41,756 and Orange County is No. 3 with  19,223.  </P> <P> But there's no solace in statistics for a motorist who walks out to his  driveway in the morning to go to work, or who returns to the mall parking lot  after shopping, only to find his car has been stolen.  </P> <P> In response to the increasing vehicle theft rate, many law enforcement agencies  are beefing up their investigative units, expanding public awareness and  meeting with car manufacturers to discuss ways to improve vehicle lock and  ignition systems.  </P> <P> "Heretofore, vehicle theft was something given a low priority, mainly in how it  is categorized: as a victimless crime and as a property crime," said Sgt.  Michael Williams of the California Highway Patrol's investigative services  section. "And it wasn't given the attention, I'd say, by any segment of society  as our more violent or emotional crimes: drugs, murder and robbery."  </P> <P> But vehicle theft is not an insignificant crime, Williams said. And it is far  from being victimless. "In fact," he said, "it probably has more of an impact  than burglary."  </P> <P> If your home is burglarized, he said, you may lose a TV, a VCR or a stereo. But  when your car is stolen, "your work and social activities outside the home are  altered dramatically. If you lose a vehicle, you can consider lost wages, lost  time, inconveniences. Vehicles are an integral part of our lives, especially in  California."  </P> <P> Various theories are presented for the surge in vehicle thefts in the '80s.  </P> <P> "No. 1, it was considered a low-risk, high-profit crime," said Williams, adding  that a car thief was less likely to go to jail than a residential burglar. "And  that was strictly because of California statutes. The law just did not specify  that a vehicle thief had to go to jail if convicted."  </P> <P> Enhanced penalties for residential burglaries in 1982 also caused some burglars  to turn their attention to vehicles. Observed Terry Cramer, an auto theft  investigator for the Orange County Sheriff's Department: "Some of the people  I've interviewed have told me that they've gone to cars because there is not as  much chance of getting caught and if they are caught, they're not going to get  as stiff a sentence."  </P> <P> Although first-time offenders still generally receive probation, a new state  law went into effect in January that doubles the penalties for car thieves with  prior convictions: up to six years in state prison, depending on the  circumstances.  </P> <P> The new law also gives law enforcement the right, as with convicted drug  dealers, to seize the assets of those profiting from vehicle theft. And,  Williams said, it addresses juvenile offenders by requiring a probation officer  to immediately review a case and, if there is sufficient evidence, to prosecute  the juvenile rather than just give him probation.  </P> <P> The popularity of Japanese vehicles has been another factor in the wave of car  thefts.  </P> <P> Said Cramer: "When we talk to the crooks when we catch them, they say Japanese  cars are easier to take: They're easy to punch the ignitions. And their parts  are readily salable. The parts are expensive, therefore there is a good market  for them."  </P> <P> In fact, nine of the top 10 stolen cars in California are Japanese. A South  Korean-made 1988 Hyundai Excel leads the list, followed by nine different  models of Toyotas.  </P> <P> "Just in sheer numbers the Toyotas and Hyundais are popular and in sheer  numbers they're going to be stolen," said Williams.  </P> <P> Car thieves use a variety of methods to gain access to a vehicle, but they  generally prefer a $5 dent puller, which can be purchased at any auto parts  store.  </P> <P> The device, which resembles an oversized screwdriver, can be used to pull out a  door lock by attaching a screw on the end and sticking it into the lock  mechanism. The same can be done with the ignition switch. Once the ignition is  removed, a thief merely sticks a screwdriver or a tapered key into the ignition  cavity to start the car.  </P> <P> Investigators say an experienced car thief can break into a vehicle, pull out  the ignition and drive away in about 30 seconds. "That's quicker than most  people get in with their car keys," said Williams.  </P> <P> If a car is stolen, however, the odds are good it will turn up.  </P> <P> According to the CHP, 91% of the vehicles stolen in California were recovered  in 1989. The bad news is about half had been stripped. That means everything  from just a missing radio or seats to an entire body strip, including doors,  fenders, tires, engine and transmission.  </P> <P> "Toyota interiors are a real big item because they're very expensive to  replace," said officer Bill Sharff of the CHP's investigative services section.  </P> <P> The interior of a Toyota Supra, for example -- everything from the headliner to  door panels -- will cost more than $8,000 to replace new at a dealership,  Sharff said. But replacement parts may not be immediately available from the  dealer and, to save money, insurance companies typically replace the missing  items with less-expensive used parts. Sharff said used parts can be purchased  for about half the price from a wrecking yard or parts shop, which may  knowingly or unknowingly be selling stolen parts.  </P> <P> As a crime, he said, vehicle theft "is kind of self-perpetuating."  </P> <P> Sharff estimated that at least 25% of stolen cars are taken by organized theft  rings, which can range from a group to an individual who steals cars and knows  someone who is good at cutting them up or who has access to black-market  wholesalers.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of groups of individuals who have been stealing cars for years  -- it's all they do for a living," said Sgt. Bill Lovold of the Los Angeles  Police Department's auto theft detail. "With the drug situation, these  individuals know they can steal a car and take the parts and get money for  cocaine. It's very simple."  </P> <P> To help turn the tide, many police departments are strengthening their auto  theft investigation units. The Santa Ana Police Department, for example, has  seven full-time auto theft investigators, with two whose sole job is to be on  the street looking for stolen vehicles (4,411 in 1989 compared to 1,666 in  1983).  </P> <P> Other departments such as Huntington Beach and San Clemente are following the  lead of New York City and San Diego and initiating CAT (Combat Auto Theft)  programs in their cities.  </P> <P> Participants in the program authorize police to stop their vehicles if they are  spotted on the road between 1 and 5 a.m. Car owners are given a sticker for  their rear windows as a signal to patrol officers that the vehicle should not  normally be operating during those hours.  </P> <P> For their part, car manufacturers have been meeting with vehicle theft  investigators to discuss what they can do to lessen vehicles thefts.  </P> <P> Last fall, for example, a design team from Toyota in Japan met with auto theft  investigators in Orange County to get a firsthand look at a problem that is  virtually non-existent in Japan, where motorists regularly leave their car  windows open and even leave the keys in the ignition without fear.  </P> <P> Norm Adams, senior product engineer for Toyota Motor Sales USA, said Toyota has  sent two major design teams to meet with auto-theft investigators in recent  years.  </P> <P> "We've taken a lot of measures to improve the theft resistance of our specific  products," he said.  </P> <P> One result is improved door and ignition locks, which have been included on  each model as it undergoes a design change. The locks, Adams said, "are more  pick-resistant and harder to slide hammer, a process in which (thieves) slide  them out of the car."  </P> <P> Toyota also has begun using hardened steel on the face plate of the ignition  lock cylinder. "This precludes them from easily screwing screws in there (to  remove it) and because it is tough it is more difficult to pull out." The  serrated cylinder also will break off in the ignition lock and will not allow a  thief to start the car with a screwdriver, he said.  </P> <P> Toyota also began installing anti-theft radios last year on its pickup truck  and various car models. The owner punches in his own security code and if the  radio is removed it must be reprogrammed with the same code in order to  operate.  </P> <P> General Motors, which met with law enforcement representatives from about 100  major cities around the county in April to discuss auto theft, has made similar  strides.  </P> <P> Already in place on 11 GM car lines is a theft-deterrent pass-key system in  which the car's electronic system must read a special code contained in a  resister pellet embedded on the ignition key. Without a key bearing the correct  code, the car's fuel system will shut down for two minutes before another  attempt can be made to start the car. And, said a spokeswoman, "it'll happen as  many times as you try to start the car improperly."  </P> <P> According to preliminary theft data on Firebirds and Camaros, the spokeswoman  said, there has been about a two-thirds reduction in the theft rates of those  vehicles. By the 1995 model year the system is expected to be on almost all GM  cars.  </P> <P> But help is also coming from other quarters as well.  </P> <P> Later this month, a Los Angeles-based company called LoJack is expected to  implement its high-tech solution to the problem of tracing stolen vehicles.  </P> <P> Under the system, a homing device about the size of a chalkboard eraser is  installed in a hidden location on the vehicle. When the owner reports his car  stolen to the police, the car's homing device is activated. The device will  then begin transmitting a signal to police vehicles armed with mobile tracking  computers.  </P> <P> Forty-seven police agencies throughout Los Angeles county, including the Los  Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the CHP,  have agreed to participate in the system. The company also has begun making  presentations to Orange County law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> The homing devices, which will be available primarily through new car  dealerships, will cost about $600 to buy and have installed.  </P> <P> More than 50,000 of the units already have been sold in Massachusetts where,  LoJack officials said, more than 1,000 stolen vehicles equipped with the homing  device have been tracked down. Florida, New Jersey and Michigan also have  launched the system.  </P> <P> Los Angeles-based International Teletrac Systems, which expects to launch its  stolen vehicle locater service by the end of the year, claims to go LoJack one  better.  </P> <P> Instead of waiting for the owner to discover that his vehicle has been stolen,  a hidden Teletrac radio location unit on the vehicle will be activated as soon  as the car is moved unlawfully. Within two seconds, the vehicle's location will  appear on a computerized map at Teletrac headquarters. The company will notify  the police which, company officials say, will have similar software.  </P> <P> The cost to buy and install the Teletrac unit will be about $500, with a $10  monthly service charge. (The LoJack system does not require a service charge.)  </P> <P> The CHP's Sharff views such technology as "a milestone."  </P> <P> But whether the system will be the answer to the car theft problem, Sharff is  not sure "because as soon as we develop that technique there will be thieves  out there to find ways to circumvent it. But it's certainly going to help."  </P></p>

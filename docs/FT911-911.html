			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Polly Peck may never repay Pounds 650m warn administrators SOME Pounds 650m of the Pounds 1.15bn debts of Polly Peck International may never be repaid, administrators of the group warned yesterday in their first formal report on the group's finances. The three court-appointed administrators also reported serious misgivings that the group did not hold legal title to assets bought with its money and said accounting deficiencies had thrown up 'serious reservations as to the reliability and fairness of the published results'. News of Polly Peck's financial situation, which was worse than had been generally expected, came in a report to creditors from the three - Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte and Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross. If the proposals outlined yesterday are approved by creditors at a meeting on May 24, Mr Asil Nadir will be replaced as chairman and chief executive. The bulk of the group's operations would be continued, rather than sold off. Only about Pounds 500m of Polly Peck's debts are likely to be refinanced or repaid, according to the report. This would amount to an average of 44p for every Pounds 1 owed, compared with only 20p in the event of an immediate liquidation. Most of the rest of the debt would be converted into an instrument which would pay a return based on the future performance of the group's food, packaging and leisure businesses in northern Cyprus and Turkey. The administrators offered little hope of this instrument paying a substantial return. They said they had gained virtually no access to the businesses in the Near East, and had 'serious reservations' about claims in Polly Peck's reports that these businesses had generated two thirds of group profits last year. To ensure the maximum possible return to creditors, Mr Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot, may be given a role in the Near East. 'It is too early to decide what his role might be; he has influence that can be of benefit to the creditors,' said Mr Stone. Mr Nadir has been charged with 18 counts of theft and false accounting involving sums exceeding Pounds 20m. In their report, the administrators warn that the Pounds 1.16bn value put in the group's accounts on its net assets in the Near East 'cannot now be relied on upon'. 'These do not appear to have been fully under the control of the main board of PPI,' they said, adding: 'The administrators understand that certain assets are not held in the name of Group companies.' Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner of Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's auditor, said: 'The administrators have had full access to our audit working papers (those dealing with the group accounts) and no queries have been raised with us.'

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF&hyph;270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special HUD instructions for electronic funds transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. HUD may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) When the reimbursement method is used, HUD shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and HUD has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, HUD may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, HUD shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, HUD shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, HUD shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (h)(2) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A&hyph;129, ``Managing Federal Credit Programs.'' Under such conditions, HUD may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, HUD shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women- owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraphs (k)(1), (k)(2), or (k)(3) of this section apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules (31 CFR part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this rule, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD has adopted the SF&hyph;270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. HUD has the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF&hyph;271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SF&hyph;271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD has adopted the SF&hyph;271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, HUD may substitute the SF&hyph;270 when HUD determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;84.23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Cost sharing or matching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If HUD authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / A painful birth: Ukraine's increasing nationalism Relations between Russia and Ukraine, the two largest Slav states, are worsening to the point of alarm. At the weekend the Ukrainian foreign ministry sent a note to Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander of the Black Sea fleet, protesting that he had distorted the Ukrainian position on the fleet. Soon, it may call for his dismissal. An announcement that Ukraine has agreed with Iran to build a pipeline from Iran to Ukraine to supply the latter with oil is thought hazardous because it must run through Russian territory, and is vulnerable to being blocked. Where Russia claims to see the Commonwealth of Independent States as a stabilising force to preserve a forum for joint decisions among the former members of the Soviet Union, Ukraine scorns it as a hollow sham, to be discarded as soon as possible. The force of the national movement in Ukraine is the largest threat to the Commonwealth's continued existence - as all Russian politicians recognise. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian deputy prime minister, said recently that disintegration of the CIS threatened reform: but disintegration is precisely what Ukraine wants. The new leaders (many of whom were part of the old) are striving to build a modern nation state. There can be no doubt about the depth of the commitment of the new powers to this task, nor about the concomitant and apparently deepening distaste for the Russians, perceived increasingly as imperialists (ironically, as they begin the painful process of trying to cease to act like imperialists). The Ukrainian flag flies everywhere: symbols are being designed, including notes for a new currency - the hryvnia - printed in Canada. Meetings begin with the singing of a Ukrainian hymn. In west Ukraine, which is more nationally minded because of its more uniformly Ukrainian population and proximity to central Europe, the Central (Moscow) TV is blocked. Passages from once-banned Ukrainian historians are read on the radio during the breakfast show. Early next month, Ukrainian jurists and scholars will meet with foreign advisers in Prague to finalise the Ukrainian constitution. No Ukrainian politician sees the CIS as more than a temporary garment, to be discarded as soon as possible. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president and a man deeply disliked in Russia, told foreign journalists last week that he adhered to the agreements of the CIS that underscored the full independence of its members. In a separate interview, Professor Mykola Mykhailchenko, his chief political adviser, was less guarded, saying that the next summit of the CIS on March 20 in Kiev might be its last; that the Ukrainian leadership had 'very little optimism' about its future and that 'the member states will soon all have their own armies because they all have their own territorial problems'. Ukraine wants its own armed forces for the most basic of all military reasons: to protect the integrity of the state. Any delay in the division of forces is regarded as intolerable, because it prolongs the existence on its territory of a foreign army - a concept that the Russian-dominated CIS military, accustomed to seeing the Union as their recruiting ground and defensive space, simply refuses to grasp. The division of the Black Sea fleet, a leading cause of conflict between the two states, illustrates this. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has described the fleet as Russian; Marshal Shaposhnikov, tactfully correcting the president in an interview in Paris, described it as a CIS force. Either way, the Ukrainians see it as a non-Ukrainian navy occupying Ukrainian ports in the Crimea. Mr Kravchuk said last week a division must be made, with his own preference being for one third of it to be assigned to Ukraine. The protest that Marshal Shaposhnikov had distorted the Ukrainian position was because he had accused Ukraine of wishing to take over the entire navy. In this struggle, Russian politicians have had no inhibition about playing the 'Crimean card': demanding that the Ukrainian parliament review the status of Crimea, an area conquered by Russia, still dominated by Russians and arbitrarily switched from Russian to Ukrainian possession in 1954 by Mr Nikita Kruschev, the former first secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party. man of the important inter-republican committee of the Russian parliament, said in a recent interview that the 1990 agreement between the two states to respect each other's borders was no longer valid because it was signed when both were members of a third state, the Soviet Union. So firm is the Ukrainians' wish to be wholly independent that they have renounced all nuclear weapons. The architect of this decision, Professor Volodymyr Vasylenko, an adviser on the constitution, said that 'you cannot have a nuclear force which is not tied to the Russian nuclear force, because of technology and control systems. By being a nuclear power we would not have full independence. It was this argument which persuaded the government'. To these territorial tensions must be added political and economic disputes. Ukraine wants to 'join Europe' as rapidly as possible (in part to provide for protection against border wars), and to conduct its own economic reform. In both cases, it feels crowded out by Russia. Mr Ivan Plyushch, the head of the Ukrainian parliament, last week accused Russia of blocking the Ukrainian path to the Council of Europe and ultimately to the European Community by presuming to negotiate for the CIS as a whole. Mr Oleksander Savchenko, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian National Bank, said that Russia was sabotaging the Ukrainian economy through non delivery of goods, refusing to supply enough roubles (printed by the Russian Central Bank), and conducting reform without regard to Ukraine's interests. The suspicion and dislike operates at every level - including that of the radical parliamentarians, who in the past had forged a comradeship with their counterparts in Russia. Now, says Ms Laryssa Skrylyk, a deputy from Kiev, 'the democrats are no different: they have the same imperial thinking as the other Russians'. These judgments are unfair: but fairness is not now the point. National imperatives are influencing all the actors on the Ukrainian political stage, forcing them to label as 'western propaganda' - as Professor Vasylenko has done - the foreign press reports that cast doubt on the Ukrainian nationalist case. Perversely, it causes them to close round the figure of their president - perversely, because Mr Kravchuk was a lifelong and senior functionary of the party whom all (including he) now blame for Ukraine's oppression. Yet to raise this issue is again to be accused of 'western propaganda'. Mr Kravchuk enjoys wide support which, alarmingly, led him to say last week that opposition to him was impossible, because he and all political parties were for Ukrainian independence. What, then, he asked, was there to oppose? The reasons for his support were put by Mr Levko Lukyanenko, one of Ukraine's honoured political dissidents, who spent a total of 27 years in jails and camps for his nationalist activity before being released in 1989. For him, as for other Ukrainians, Mr Kravchuk's past has ceased to matter: it is his present policy that matters. Asked if he was bitter to see a former oppressor in power, he emphatically said 'no'. 'I am glad Kravchuk has come to the nationalist point of view. If he can continue to work in this way and achieve independence, I will support him.' Mr Kravchuk's metamorphosis from chief ideological opponent of the nationalists - his assignment when they first formed their mass organisation, Rukh, in 1989 - into their leader was completed last week, when he opened formal negotiations with the nationalist opposition on the formation of a coalition cabinet. After months of promises, Mr Kravchuk seems to be on the verge of replacing his communist comrades, who currently dominate the inert cabinet, with his erstwhile opponents. Western observers hope that such a switch will bring long overdue market reforms to Ukraine's wilting economy. This is the attempted birth of a nation: a birth that is painful to the heart of the former 'motherland', Russia. Like any severance between states in such a relationship - Britain and Ireland, say, or Sweden and Finland - there is an over-rich diet on both sides of hypocrisies, false charges, propagandist nonsense and downright lies. But what matters is the process: and at the end of that process comes separation.</p>

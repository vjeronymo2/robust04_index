These are listed in section III. of this NOFA, Checklist of Application Submission Requirements, above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any technical deficiency. Information received after 3:00 p.m., local time, on the fourteenth calendar day of the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be rejected as being incomplete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

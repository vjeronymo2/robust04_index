			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Senate office led by Firmin Jean-Louis asks  Senate employees not to show up for work in the aftermath of  incidents that took place on 8 March in the Senate, while they  await clarification of the situation. In a statement read on  Radio Metropole, the Senate quaestor made reference to  brutalities committed against employees. He also denounced the  behavior of legislators who used force to control the Senate.    [Begin Larosilliere recording] The Senate office strongly  condemns the acts of violence and the brutalities against Senate  employees not only by senators elected in the contested 18  January 1993 elections, but by other senators as well. Despite  the threats by members of the so-called office, threats on  radio, and the arbitrary arrest of the assistant chief of the  Senate supply service under the instigation of those same  citizens, one did not imagine that they would move from words to  action. In fact, some Senate employees were ill-treated, some  beaten by this same group and other armed individuals working  for them.    Since the office has no means of dealing with this situation  except those provided by the Constitution and the Senate's  internal rules, the office is obliged to take the following  extraordinary and limited measures:    1. While waiting for the office to take all necessary  measures to guarantee the security of all senators and staff,  the quaestor's office asks employees not to show up for work on  Avenue Marie-Jeanne in the Biscentenaire area.    2. The office asks the staff to keep in touch with the  quaestor's office in order to receive their paychecks and all  other important communications.    Thank you. 8 March 1994, Julio Larossiliere, senator of the  Republic, quaestor in the Senate. [end recording]</p>

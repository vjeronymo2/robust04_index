The official radio station reported that the number of taxis  participating in the protest could reach 200 vehicles and that  police have intervened to guarantee the free movement of  vehicles and pedestrians in the area.    Meanwhile, Sandinist Deputy William Ramirez told the media  that police have stopped transferring 65 of the 225 arrested  strikers to the Police Processing Unit out of fear of strikers  staging a "rescue attempt." Police have charged the strikers  with meeting with criminal intent and disrupting public order.  The strikers were arrested after they set up the first  barricades and "blockaded" streets with buses and taxis.    After reports by relatives of police beatings, Nicaraguan  Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta authorized representatives  of Human Rights Commissions to visit the prisoners to verify  their situation.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Jorge Pinto Mazal, Mexican  deputy secretary of foreign relations, has said, here, Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba will  strengthen ties between both countries and create new  opportunities for Mexican investments on the island.    The Mexican diplomat has announced Salinas will meet with  Cuban President Fidel Castro and members of the Cuban Councils  of State and Ministers on 13 June.    Salinas will reaffirm the friendly and fraternal ties  between  Mexico and the Cuban people. We are neighboring countries  sharing the same cultural values," Pinto Mazal said in an  interview with NOTIMEX. [no opening quotation mark as received]    He added the principles guiding Mexico's foreign policy were  reinforced with a negotiated [words indistinct] solution for the  Haitian crisis and the proposals to end Cuba's isolation  presented by Canada and Brazil. "We are very pleased to see  other countries share that position and do not want to see Cuba  isolated," he said.    Pinto is participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly in  Belem, the capital of the Brazilian State of Para, which will  end 10 June.    Pinto has said the flow of Mexican tourists as well as  Mexican investments in Cuba have increased considerably. He  added that the Mexican Government and investors view Cuba as a  "suitable" place for investments under the current commercial  conditions which attract investments to the island. He said the  National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext) views Cuba as a safe  country for Mexican capital.    According to a Bancomext report, there is a "favorable  [words  indistinct] worldwide tendencies "is a situation" that  encourages a greater volume of business activities between  Mexico and Cuba.    During the past five years, small- and medium-size Mexican  investors have shown interest in exploiting the Cuban market and  obtaining a clear knowledge of the facilities offered by  Castro's government for foreign investments, particularly from  Latin America.    Based on figures released by the Cuban Government, trade  between both countries totals approximately $200 million, a  figure that has increased in the past few years.    During the morning session of the 24th OAS General Assembly,  Brazil and Canada proposed an end to Cuba's isolation [word  indistinct] a mechanism to promote the "democratic transition"  that "can already be seen" on the Caribbean island.    "We are all expecting a democratic change in Cuba, a country  with which Brazil maintains friendly relations," Brazilian  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said during the assembly.    Amorin said positive actions can be perceived in the Cuban  reforms, which "should be strengthened." He ruled out, however,  economic and political isolation as the best way to contribute  to encouraging that transition, which was "already initiated."    In her speech, Christine Stewart, Canadian secretary of  state  for Latin American affairs, said her country believes that "due  to its nature, isolation is unhealthy, especially at this  important time of transition for Cuba."    "It is in our interest and that of the Cuban people for us  to  support the process of transition taking place on the island, a  transition which is positive and orderly," Stewart said.    The official said the Canadian Government is evaluating new  steps to intensify dialogue with the Cuban authorities. "We  believe it is important for the OAS and Cuba to examine how to  bring about the founding fathers' vision of [words indistinct]  inter-American organization for hemispheric participation," the  Canadian representative added.    "Cuba is part of that vision," Stewart added while demanding  the [words indistinct] in the debate about its possible  readmittance into the inter-American system.    The foreign ministers have been participating in the OAS  General Assembly since 6 June and up until [words indistinct] in  this city located approximately 2,000 km north of Brasilia.</p>

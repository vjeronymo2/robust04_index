			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: PHILLIE RELIEVER HAS SUBMARINE DELIVERY  </P> <P> Philadelphia reliever Greg Harris has a special glove because he can throw with  either hand. Pittsburgh outfielder Andy Van Slyke didn't know that, and he did  a double take when Harris came into a game against the Pirates.  </P> <P> Van Slyke, who was on third, asked third base coach Gene Lamont, "Why does he  wear a glove like that?"  </P> <P> Phillie third baseman Randy Ready, overhearing the question, said, "Because  he's amphibious."  </P> <P> Said Van Slyke: "Does that mean he can throw underwater?"  </P> <P> Bright remark: Said umpire Bruce Froemming to a player who complained that a  play was too far away for Froemming to see it: "The sun is 93 million miles  away, and I can see it."  </P> <P> Grounded: Moss Klein of the Sporting News reports that the New York Yankees  have banned all liquor on team flights after a couple of airlines complained of  rowdyism by the players and threatened to withdraw their charters.  </P> <P> Klein: "A group of players had turned flights into frights for the airlines,  destroying property, engaging in food fights and upsetting flight attendants."  </P> <P> Said one veteran Yankee: "You walk off the plane and feel embarrassed. There's  food all over the floor, pats of butter stuck to the ceiling, seats torn out .  . ."  </P> <P> Trivia time: What were the real names of Dizzy and Daffy Dean?  </P> <P> A loss at home: Washington Redskins quarterback Doug Williams, who sought to  have his wife Lisa arrested for stealing a $75,000 check, told the Washington  Post after she filed for separation: "Lisa's a con artist. She sold me. I  thought she was apple pie and ice cream until the ice cream melted and the pie  was cold.  </P> <P> "I had said, 'This girl is exactly what I'm looking for, the kind of  personality who could deal with people.' But she was a con artist. It's the  worst sack I've ever had in my life."  </P> <P> Alphabet soup: Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, on the latest of  boxing's title-recognizers, the World Boxing Organization: "The WBO's  international headquarters is a phone booth outside a candy store in Hoboken.  Send $10 by check or money order and the WBO will send you your choice of a  championship boxing belt or a mail-order degree in divinity."  </P> <P> Numbers game: From Bill Sangster, dean of the engineering school and faculty  athletic representative at Georgia Tech: "Statistics in the hands of an  engineer are like a lamppost to a drunk. They're used more for support than  illumination."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Jay Hanna Dean and Paul Dee Dean. Dizzy also went by the name of  Jerome.  </P> <P> Add Dizzy: Explaining why he gave out three different birthplaces to reporters,  he said, "I give 'em each a scoop, so their bosses can't bawl the three of 'em  out for writing the same piece."  </P> <P> Quotebook: Bob Hope, complaining about his golf game: "Titleist offered me $50  not to use their balls."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Zhurun (2621 4554 3387) and Li Jun (2621 </F> 7165)]    [Text] Beijing, 20 May (XINHUA) -- China is preparing to  take a series of measures to improve protection for intellectual  property rights in the near future. First of all, China will  improve the legislation for intellectual property rights as well  as a legal system for the protection of intellectual property  rights, said Justice Minister Xiao Yang here today.    Xiao Yang made the remarks when he addressed the opening  ceremony of an international symposium on intellectual property  rights held in Beijing. The symposium was sponsored by the  China Intellectual Property Rights Research Society, the China  Copyright Research Society, and the Zhongcheng Intellectual  Property Rights Protection Service Co. Ltd. National People's  Congress Vice Chairman Cheng Siyuan, Supreme People's Court  President Ren Jianxin, and others attended the meeting. Over  130 people, including relevant experts, scholars, lawyers, and  representatives of prestigious companies from China, Australia,  Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand,  the United States, and Hong Kong and Taiwan regions, attended  the symposium. European and German patent bureaus, the UN  Development Program, and some foreign embassies in China also  sent their representatives to participate.    Xiao Yang said: China is prepared to formulate laws and  provisions on punishment for infringement of copyright to more  effectively punish and put an end to violations of intellectual  property rights. To comply with the relevant provisions  contained in the "Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial  Intellectual Property" and in the "Berne Convention on  Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" to which China has  acceded, and to improve the protection of intellectual property  rights related to foreign economic relations, foreign  technology, and foreign trade, China will pay close attention to  formulating laws and regulations on border control over products  that infringe on intellectual property rights, and will improve  the customs' functions of protecting intellectual property  rights and of stopping the entrance and exit of products that  infringe on intellectual property rights.    He said: With regard to the improvement of law enforcement,  the focal point is to beef up the organs responsible for  enforcing copyright law at all levels to guarantee the effective  enforcement of copyright law. As regards some important cases  that produce relatively great influence on the public,  administrative organs responsible for enforcing laws on  intellectual property rights may make joint efforts with the  departments in charge of science and technology, the economy,  culture, public security, and industry and commerce to  investigate and deal with them. To effectively crack down on  such criminal activities as infringing on intellectual property  rights, people's courts in many areas have already established  or are about to establish special courts for trial of  intellectual property rights violations. Meanwhile, they are  beefing up the organs responsible for such judicial work to  ensure that various cases of intellectual property rights are  justly and timely handled. As regards serious violations that  constitute crimes, relevant personnel shall be investigated for  their criminal responsibility to enforce law and discipline, to  practically protect the legitimate rights and interests of  owners of intellectual property rights, and to uphold the unity  and dignity of our socialist laws and regulations.    Xiao Yang said: In addition, China will vigorously  strengthen supervision over and inspection of the enforcement of  laws on intellectual property rights. The state will organize  relevant departments to conduct joint, general inspection of the  enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights by all areas  and departments at irregular intervals, to focus attention on  investigating some important cases of intellectual property  rights infringement that produce influence on the public, and to  supervise the solution of such problems as lax law enforcement  or ineffective punishment for infringement of intellectual  property rights that exist in some areas.    Xiao Yang said: While taking the measures mentioned above,  China will draw support from nongovernment sectors to improve  its system of protection for intellectual property rights.  Various professional associations in the spheres of science and  technology, the economy, and culture; social groups specializing  in intellectual property rights; and organizations offering  socialized services constitute an important force for promoting  the enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights and for  improving the work of intellectual property rights protection.  The state will encourage and support the development of these  organizations, and guide them to take advantage of their own  flexible mechanisms to conduct various intellectual property  rights-related legal consultations and services, and to match  their efforts to the needs of the society. The state will set up  a number of organs that provide intellectual property  rights-related legal services to assist litigants in conducting  investigation of intellectual property rights violations, in  collecting evidence, and in handling disputes over such  violations through legal channels.    Xiao Yang said: China attaches great importance to the  work of protecting intellectual property rights, and is stepping  up efforts to enact laws in this regard. In recent years we  have adopted a series of laws on trademarks, patents, technical  contracts, copyright, and unfair competition, as well as related  rules for the implementation of such laws, and formulated the  "Regulations on Protecting Computer Software" and "Provisions  for Implementing the International Copyright Treaty." Last 2  July, the Second Meeting of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC] Standing Committee adopted a "Decision of the NPC  Standing Committee on Punishing Offenses in Producing and  Marketing Shoddy Goods" to supplement certain provisions in  China's "Criminal Law." The facts show that Chinese legislation  on intellectual property protection has been improved with each  passing day. In addition, China has acceded to a number of  international conventions on intellectual property protection.  China's efforts to establish an intellectual property system  and to adapt it to the international trend show that Chinese  protection of intellectual property rights has initially  converged with world standards. Moreover, law enforcement, on  the whole, is good.    Meanwhile, the minister pointed out: As the system of  intellectual property protection was established in China not  long ago, people's awareness of intellectual property is  relatively weak. Due to the lack of sufficient understanding of  the importance of rights protection, rights violations have  occurred from time to time in some localities and departments.  This has not only damaged the lawful rights and interests of  intellectual property holders but also undermined the authority  of the laws.    He said: Intellectual property protection is an important  part of China's policy of reform and opening up to the outside  world, as well as the socialist legal system. To establish a  legal system for protecting intellectual property rights is  crucial for promoting the thriving of science, technology, and  cultural undertakings, and for ensuring normal operation of the  socialist market economy. China will continue to make  unremitting efforts in this regard.</p>

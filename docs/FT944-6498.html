			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: BHF Bank's account trading hit BHF Bank yesterday blamed the collapse in world bond market prices for a sharp slide in profits from trading on its own account in the first 10 months. However, it said this was almost entirely offset by earnings from normal customer business. Operating profits at the German bank were 0.7 per cent lower at DM265m (Dollars 170m), after a 22.5 per cent rise in partial operating profits (which exclude own-account trading in securities, foreign exchange and other financial instruments) to DM375m. The bank managed to increase its interest earnings by 16 per cent to DM598m, with commission profits up 4.9 per cent to DM298m. Operating costs were held to a 5.5 per cent increase at DM521m. Profits on the bank's own-account trading were 85 per cent lower at DM14m, continuing the decline of earlier months which reflected write-downs on BHF's bond portfolio. It increased its bad-loan provisions by 13 per cent to DM149m. The bank is exposed to both the Schneider property and Balsam/Procedo factoring collapses. Two months ago, the bank announced plans to turn itself into a joint stock company and strengthen its asset management and corporate finance business throughout Europe. The costs of the reorganisation will weigh on next year's result, and probably that of 1996, but should eventually lead to increased returns on capital. Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, recently disclosed a 5 per cent holding in BHF.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Irish eyes are smiling at the punt in their pockets IRISH national pride has undergone an unexpected and unprecedented boost in the past week. Sterling's abandonment of the exchange rate mechanism has meant that for the first time since the Irish punt broke parity with sterling in 1979, the pound in an Irishman's pocket is worth more than one in an Englishman's in London or an Ulsterman's in Belfast. Players of slot machines on the Dublin-Holyhead ferries can finally feel a stir of satisfaction rather than disappointment on discovering that the jackpot payouts include mostly 10p and 50p pieces which have a harp and 'Eire' stamped upon them on them instead of the queen's head. Neither will British Telecom any longer have to suffer losses on the tens of thousands of Irish coins stuffed into its call-boxes every week. But national pride has quickly been displaced by practical economics. While everyone else around the world is still selling sterling, the Irish are buying it faster than Dublin's banks can supply their branches. According to Mr Larry O'Connor, a spokesman of Allied Irish Bank in Dublin, one of the country's biggest clearing banks, 'there has been a 200 per cent increase in demand for sterling in the past two weeks. Branches normally stock up with foreign exchange on Monday for the week. Last Tuesday many had already sold out of sterling.' Similar reports have come from the other main clearing banks. Some branches have had to ration their sterling balances, making maximum cash payments of Pounds 200 over the counter. Mr O'Connor said: 'Many people have been coming in off the street to buy sterling, so we have endeavoured to look after our own customers first.' Sterling was yesterday trading at around Pounds 1.04 to the punt, its lowest rate ever against the Irish currency. For many people planning holidays, weekend breaks on the mainland or shopping sprees in Belfast, sterling's devaluation has added 10 per cent to the available budget. Sterling has never been so cheap, and expectations of a realignment of the punt have therefore fuelled an unprecedented demand. At the Stena Sealink ferry group, which operates services from Ireland to the UK mainland, an official said: 'There has been an appreciable upsurge in bookings for our short-break trips in the past week. It could be as high as double the normal level. We are also anticipating a increase in bookings in the lead-up to Christmas as a result of the devaluation.' Shopkeepers just across the border in Newry and Derry, Northern Ireland, also report a surge in shoppers travelling up from the Irish Republic to take advantage of their sudden once-off increase in wealth. Foreign exchange traders in Dublin say there has also been a big increase in sterling demand from businesses, as Irish importers seek to take out forward positions in sterling. Some 40 per cent of Ireland's imports are sourced in the UK. Most people in Ireland therefore seem to be seeing Britain's distress as Ireland's opportunity. As Mr Ian French, managing director of Hamilton Osborne King, one of Dublin's leading estate agents, said yesterday, 'In times of financial upheaval such as these, it is important to recognise the opportunities that can be created. The current strength of the punt against the sterling makes property prices in the UK an extremely inviting opportunity for Irish investors and developers interested in the UK market.' They might be well advised to move quickly, though. Money market rates surged to 25 per cent in Dublin yesterday, 14.25 percentage points above the base rate. The pressures for realignment are growing.</p>

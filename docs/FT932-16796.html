			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Wellcome Investing in pharmaceuticals has always involved playing roulette with both industry regulators and the medical community. Yesterday's 7 per cent fall in Wellcome's share price shows how frayed the market's nerves have become. The medical study questioning the effectiveness of Wellcome's Retrovir in slowing the development of Aids could hardly have come at a worse time. Last week's interim figures pointed to a slowing in Wellcome's rate of growth. SmithKline Beecham has been trumpeting a possible competitor to Zovirax, Wellcome's biggest selling drug which has been growing much faster than Retrovir. Yet assessing the impact of the latest study is little more than guesswork. Retrovir's growth prospects turn on convincing HIV patients to take the drug before the onset of Aids. If the medical evidence dissuades them from doing so, the 10-15 per cent annual growth expected from Retrovir might crumble. Since Retrovir accounts for 13 per cent of Wellcome's sales, that would mean scaling back profits forecasts once again. But that outcome is by no means certain. It is already clear the future of Aids treatment lies with combinations of drugs rather than single products. With the shares down 25 per cent in two weeks - and now 108p below the level at which Wellcome Trust sold last summer - Wellcome's premium to the sector has been erased. Having been burned by the experience, the market is clearly inclined to mark down first and ask questions later.</p>

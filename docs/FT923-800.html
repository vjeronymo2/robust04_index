			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Residential Property: Take your pick of English vineyards - What is on offer for budding vignerons THE OMENS are good for grapes on the south-facing slopes of England and Wales; the darling buds of May set earlier than usual and 1992 could produce a bumper crop. But, although vines in many parts of England are groaning under the weight of seven or more tons to the acre, compared with the usual two or three, it remains to be seen whether 1992 will be a vintage year. Many vineyards are feeling the pinch, with stocks left over from last year. The public's perception of English wine is, alas, as fickle as the climate. But the welcome renaissance of viticulture continues apace and this summer saw the sale of the vineyard that started it: Hambledon, birthplace of English cricket and, in 1951, site of the first new vineyard since the first world war. There are now 440 commercial vineyards in England and Wales, plus hundreds of hobby enterprises. Not that there is anything new about English wine. The Romans made it, even up near Hadrian's wall; and more than 400 vineyards were recorded in the Domesday survey. It is a sign of the growing importance (and quantity) of English wine that this year sees the introduction of a quality testing scheme. Only those passing a stern examination will receive the 'quality wine PSR' (produced in specified region) label. Hambledon vineyard was established in 1951 by Sir Guy Salisbury Jones, the father of modern English wine. It was sold six years ago to John Patterson, of Dateline International, who increased the planting from seven to 15 acres. All the vines are French varieties including Chardonnay, Seyval Blanc (the most a successful variety yet grown in the UK), Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. Production in a good year should exceed 50,000 bottles. Patterson recently put Hambledon on the market again. The estate has a main house with seven bedrooms, a second house and a cottage, plus the vineyard and winery, covering 19 acres in all. It caught the eye of Canadians Margaret and James Rock who were renting a house nearby. They had already fallen in love with the village; now, they have decided to buy the estate, paying close to the Knight Frank &amp; Rutley guide of Pounds 750,000. Close to Kingsbridge, in south Devon, Loddiswell vineyard attracts 15,000 visitors every year to its 14 acres. The vines produce about 17,000 bottles of wine annually and facilities include a tea room, children's playground and picnic park. Owners Reg and Betty Sampson have devoted the past 15 years to establishing and developing the vineyard and are now calling it a day. This beautiful corner of the South Hams is being offered by Luscombe Maye for Pounds 495,000. Theobald's Westbury vineyard, in Wiltshire, which covers about 16 acres, is also up for sale. It is part of a 180-acre farm that also has three lakes. The land, gravel over chalk, is perfect for viticulture. More than 20 different wines are produced there, all surely better than that made by the Romans at Tidmarsh, just one mile away. Savills is selling the house, farm and vineyard, suggesting a price of around Pounds 650,000. Finally, in Saffron Walden, Essex, a Victorian house called The Vineyard and five acres are for sale. Hamptons says there are no grapes there now, but its location, on Windmill Hill facing south, indicates that it must at one time have supported vines. The house has been on the market for a year or so and the original guide price of Pounds 1m has been reduced to Pounds 795,000.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Africa Urged To Solve Own Problems -- "The `new vision for  Africa' outlined by President Mugabe of Zimbabwe last week is  yet another expression of what appears to be a growing  determination throughout the continent to overcome its problems  of poverty, backwardness, foreign debt and ethnic strife,"  begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 7 June in a  page-10 editorial. "His vision of an Africa that will `take  charge of its own development and learn from the lessons of the  past' will have the ardent support of all Africans and of many  of their First World creditors." The editorial continues,  however, by warning that these solutions "must be more than  interim remedies." "Whatever methods are adopted -- whether by  the Southern African Development Community, the OAU or any other  body -- they are unlikely to be effective unless they are based  on two proven realities. First, that disputes are best resolved  through negotiations and, second, that poverty is best combated  by free enterprise."  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   White Referendum Issue Viewed -- "There is widespread  appreciation for President Mandela's attempts to enter into  negotiations with all parties and organizations as head of  state. His willingness to negotiate with the right wing, even  though they severely criticized him and his party during the  election, is an example of his fairness," begins a page-6  editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg BEELD on 6 June.  "However, the time has come for the president and his advisers  to decide what course of action to follow as far as the right  wing is concerned." "President Mandela has mentioned the  possibility that a referendum could be held among whites or  Afrikaners to test support for a homeland. Although that  possibility will not be easily realized, it creates expectations  and injects new life into a dying idea." "President Mandela  should guard against creating the impression that he and his  advisers are pandering to the demands of the far-right. It  seems as if they have not fully realized that Dr. Ferdi  Hartzenberg and Mr. Eugene Terreblanche do not really have  noteworthy support. There is no burning desire among Afrikaners  and/or whites for a referendum on a homeland. The overwhelming  majority want to be part of the new order and want to be left in  peace to make their contribution."    Peacekeeping Force Disbandment Welcomed -- A second  editorial  on the same page notes that "few people will shed tears over the  disbanding of the National Peacekeeping Force. The project went  ahead despite warnings that one would be looking for trouble if  one took people with different backgrounds and threw them  together for a quick training exercise." "The project costed  the country millions. The old defense force gave 34 million rand  from its budget to the peacekeeping force. In addition to this  the huge salaries they demanded and received had a ripple effect  on other sectors of the security forces. Maybe some of these  soldiers can be drawn into the South Africa National Defense  Force's planned service brigade. We only hope that if some of  them are roped in to build roads and bridges that their work  will be satisfactory."</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio  Guterres and Communist Party (PCP) official Luis Sa provided  their views on an alliance between their respective parties.    In an interview with Guterres by Jeronimo Pimentel and Raul  Vaz published in the 3 January Lisbon daily PUBLICO, the  interviewers pointed out that since the PS failed to "crush" the  communist electorate during the recent municipal elections, a  leftist majority cannot be achieved without the support of the  PCP. Denying that the PS intended to "crush" the communists,  Guterres replied that his party's goal was to defeat the  governing Social Democratic Party (PSD). In addition, he argued  that since the PS won 39 percent of the vote, close to a  majority, it is "perfectly normal" that the "useful" vote  penalize the PCP in favor of the PS. Asked how the PS will  attract the traditional PCP electorate's "useful" vote, Guterres  answered this can be done by providing a credible alternative to  the PSD government, not through an alliance with the PCP. The  PS, he said, will run alone in the next legislative elections.  Guterres also refused to speculate whether he would ask the left  for an "understanding" if the PS failed to achieve an absolute  majority. When the interviewers stressed that rejecting an  alliance with a PCP that openly desires an alliance is telling  the communists their vote is not "useful," Guterres replied he  would explain to the communist electorate that "the best way to  defeat the PSD is to vote for the PS."    The interviewers also noted that Guterres seems to be  addressing one of the PS's "great anxieties," the direction in  which the party will grow. Asked whether it will be toward the  center, Guterres replied that the PS's main objective is "to  grow with the voters who chose the PSD two years ago because  they believed this party would solve the country's problems, but  now are disillusioned." Turning to the next presidential  elections, the interviewers noted that the municipal elections  produced two winners, Lisbon Mayor Jorge Sampaio and Porto Mayor  Fernando Gomes, both "almost natural" candidates for the  presidency. Asked which of the two men Guterres would choose,  the PS leader said that both are "possible and strong" PS  candidates who can defeat any rightist candidate, including  Cavaco Silva. According to Guterres, the prime minister will  gradually understand he has no strategy to solve Portugal's  problems and choose the presidency as an "increasingly appealing  solution."    PCP official Luis Sa was interviewed by Leonidio Paulo  Ferreira and Paula Sa in the 7 January Lisbon daily DIARIO DE  NOTICIAS. Sa was asked whether he thought the statement Guterres  made in his recent interview -- that "the PCP is not a credible  partner for a government alliance"-- was "offensive." Sa replied  that only the Portuguese people can determine if the PCP is a  credible partner. The interviewers also asked Sa whether the  PS's "obstinacy" in rejecting an alliance with the PCP stems  from its fear of losing centrist voters. Sa pointed out that  this was the PS's "pretext" for rebuffing the PCP for a long  time; however, when an alliance was concluded for the Lisbon  mayoralty race, the cooperation resulted in gains for the  centrist vote. When Sa advocated a postlegislative election  PCP/PS alliance to add credibility to a project and gain votes,  the interviewers asked whether the PCP is being "masochistic" in  always calling for unity on the left and projecting a "weak  image." Sa replied that an alternative to a rightist policy is  more important than the issue of alliances.    As reported by Leonidio Paulo Ferreira in the 5 January  DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, PCP luminary Carlos Brito expressed his  belief that the Socialists' "blustering" on the possibility of  their winning an absolute majority by eschewing alliances is  both indicative of the PS's "arrogant hegemonic ambition" and an  "incitement to civil war within the Left."</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Keeping track of the challenges to Zantac, Glaxo's big-selling ulcer drug, is turning into a full-time job. Judging by the 10 per cent fall of the shares this week, the market is taking the latest threat - from Geneva Pharmaceuticals of the US - seriously. Geneva's claim to be able to manufacture the active ingredient of Zantac without falling foul of Glaxo's patents has some credibility. Whether it can also convince the US regulators to approve its new product without years of clinical trials is impossible to judge. Since Zantac's US sales amounted to Dollars 2bn last year, though, there must be a slim chance of a serious setback for Glaxo. The more imminent danger is posed by the expiry in May of the US patent covering Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's rival ulcer treatment. generic versions of Tagamet will tempt the new breed of cost-conscious US healthcare providers either to switch from Zantac altogether or to demand a lower price. There must be a fair chance that Glaxo's rate of growth is about to slow. Until the outlook is clearer, it is hard to see the shares forging ahead. Glaxo has already underperformed the UK market by 50 per cent since its peak early in 1992. But that is par for the course among drugs companies. Merck has underperformed Wall Street by almost exactly the same percentage over that time. The wider squeeze on margins is the underlying cause of this malaise. How much Glaxo's customers are prepared to pay for Zantac will be an acid test.</p>

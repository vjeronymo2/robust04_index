			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / MPs call for new child support rules The all-party Commons social security committee will today propose sweeping changes to the running of the controversial Child Support Agency. But the committee's report falls well short of recommending its abolition, accepting instead the principle behind the agency - that fathers should recognise responsibility for their children from a previous marriage. This conclusion has infuriated Mr Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour MP for Islington North, who has submitted a dissenting note calling for the agency's replacement with a system of maintenance payments upheld by court orders. The report on the operation of the Child Support Act makes four main proposals: Fathers who face big rises in maintenance bills from the agency should be given more time to pay so they can adjust their own budgets. The committee favours allowing payments to be phased in over as long as two years, depending on the circumstances of the case. Some men are being presented with bills as much as 200 per cent higher than those fixed under court orders, prompting many complaints that second families are being made to suffer. Divorced fathers who have to pay maintenance to their first family should be left with more money for their second family. The report suggests that the father's protected income support - income support plus Pounds 8 - should be increased to a minimum of income support plus Pounds 20 and a maximum of income support plus Pounds 40. The agency should target fathers who are dodging payments altogether, instead of those who are already paying. The agency recently admitted that it was mainly targeting fathers who were already paying some maintenance. The agency is also criticised for being too slow in assessing what fathers should pay. The agency should look again at how it calculates a father's assessable income, particularly in the case of fathers who have handed over matrimonial property in return for reduced payments. The MPs are concerned that the agency's rigid formula, that richer fathers should on average pay 25 per cent of assessable income, is not always fair. The report's conclusions follow the announcement of a review of the agency. While Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is likely to be pleased with the MPs' backing for the principle of the agency, he is expected to resist some of their recommendations. It is understood that Mr Corbyn's decision to dissent came after the committee took only oral evidence from Mr Alistair Burt, the minister responsible for the agency, and Ms Ros Hepplewhite, its chief executive, though it took written evidence from other sources.</p>

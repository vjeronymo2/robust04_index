			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Risk and Reward: Derivatives rush to catch up with emerging markets TAKE the following blueprint for a market. Turnover: officially reckoned at Dollars 120bn in the first 10 months of this year, though some market estimates put it at twice this level. Performance: the best-performing dollar-denominated debt markets in 1990 and 1991, though total return to investors in 1992 was only around 5 per cent. Future prospects: unstable political background and uncertain economic outlook likely to lead to continued extreme volatility. This is the secondary market in the debt of lesser-developed countries (LDCs), one of the fastest-growing financial markets since the late 1980s. Sophistication, in the form of over-the-counter risk-management (or risk-enhancing) instruments, is only just catching up. Derivatives are particularly suited to LDC markets (now usually lumped together under the fashionable 'emerging markets' banner). Many institutions have not been able to buy the actively traded external bank debt of these countries: to do so would effectively constitute making a loan, something that many investors are forbidden by their trust deeds from doing. The only alternative for these institutions has been to buy options over the traded debt, or to buy structured instruments which pay a return based on the performance of the debt. However, as more countries have reached official debt-reduction agreements, this has become less of a motivation. Another reason for buying derivatives rather than investing directly in the cash market has been the generally weak credit standing of most of the countries involved. A banker faced with a low exposure limit to, say, Argentina could gear up by buying call options on the country's par bonds, rather than buying the bonds themselves. The privatisation programmes of countries like Argentina also generate demand for options. Argentina accepts its own external debt in part payment when selling state-owned companies: bidders may therefore think it worthwhile to buy options over the country's debt, against the possibility that they are successful and will need the debt in the future. There is also a growing 'retail' market in derivatives based on the debt of these countries - that is, for investors with upwards of Dollars 250,000 to put aside. This year has seen the creation of warrants on debt from Brazil to Poland, giving many investors their first chance to bet on these debt markets. Given the low (or falling) rates of interest available in many developed countries, there has been a steady market for such products, tied as they are to dollar-denominated instruments. The strong performance in many LDC debt markets at the beginning of the 1990s may have blinded some investors to the very real risks that remain. The return to international financial respectability of some parts of Latin America (which accounts for the lion's share of the debt outstanding, and therefore most of the weighting in any emerging markets debt index) explains the strong performance. But recent political turmoil in Venezuela - one of the stars of the debt-reduction era - and Brazil point to the dangers. The degree of risk is born out by the implied volatility levels in the options markets - that is, the extent to which secondary market debt prices are expected to move, implicit in the pricing of an option. There has been a steadily declining trend in volatility levels in the past three years, with Mexico now down to a range of 7 to 13 per cent. Implied volatility on Venezuelan debt is also less than 20 per cent, though on Argentina it is 20 to 25 per cent and on Brazil, 30 to 35 per cent. These figures reveal the substantial risks that remain. Nor is the option market as liquid as is sometimes claimed. True, the market has improved greatly over the past year: bid/offer spreads have narrowed from around a half to a quarter of a point in that time, according to one bank which buys but does not trade in options. This is due to the advent in New York of a group of active option market-makers. Most traders there point to Merrill Lynch and Chase Manhattan as the most aggressive, with J. P. Morgan, ING and Chemical also active. However, there are still complaints about the difficulty of cashing in an option position when the market has moved in the holder's favour. A number of banks have invested heavily in these derivatives markets over the past year. Usually, they have brought in experts from other markets, hoping to transplant skills learnt in other over-the-counter markets. Typical are Mr Mark Brickell, of J. P. Morgan, and Mr Christopher English, of Merrill Lynch. Both had spent several years in the swaps markets (Mr Brickell is a former chairman of the International Swaps Dealers Association) before being appointed to run emerging markets derivatives groups at their respective banks this year. Given the scale of the LDC debt markets - and the new international interest in emerging equity markets - other banks look likely to follow suit.</p>

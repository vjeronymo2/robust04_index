French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur meanwhile told a  cabinet meeting "he had personally asked for an ultimatum" to be  given to the Serbs, government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said.    Balladur said he was following the situation with  "particular  vigilance" and that a "turning-point" had been reached over  Bosnia, Sarkozy added. "Everyone must understand that nothing  will be easy", Balladur was quoted as saying.    The French officials said the Franco-American proposal was  that the Serbs withdraw or regroup their artillery, tanks and  mortars outside a 20-kilometer (12 miles) radius of Sarajevo or  face air strikes, the officials said.    They said the French and the Americans agreed on a joint  proposal Tuesday evening after intense consultations among the  allies that followed Saturday's killing of 68 people by a mortar  shell in Sarajevo.    The French had proposed a 30 kilometer (18 miles) radius,  but  the two sides finally cut it to 20 kilometres, the officials  said. However, an exception was made for a small area around  Pale, seat of the Bosnian Serb parliament, on the heights above  Sarajevo.    The proposal made no mention of regrouping Bosnian Moslem  heavy weapons.    The officials said that after the 10-day deadline, all heavy  weapons found in the exclusion area would be liable to  destruction.</p>

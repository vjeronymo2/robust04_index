			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Hanover/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In contrast to  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe favors the  early accession of Poland, Hungary, and other reform states to  NATO. There are also leading deputies within the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union]  parliamentary group who do not agree with Kohl's rejectionist  stance, the HANNOVERSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (Friday [7 January]  edition) reports.    Within CDU/CSU circles in Bonn it was being said on Thursday  that Ruehe is very disappointed that the Chancellor has  "apparently changed" his stance following his talks with Russian  President Boris Yeltsin shortly before Christmas. This came as  a shock to the Defense Ministry, the newspaper writes. Hence  Ruehe is "quite relieved" not to have to attend the NATO summit  next week.    Ruehe, it is being said within his entourage, is "very  unhappy" that Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel attach great  weight to U.S. concerns about broadening membership to the East.  If Kohl takes the same view on the issue as he does, he should  not relinquish that view because of diplomatic considerations,  Ruehe says.    The report goes on to say that it is not enough to say  simply  that one does "not totally rule out" NATO membership for those  states. Attempts must be made to bring about their entry.  Support must be given in the political, economic, and military  spheres. The Defense Ministry sees reform of the armed forces  as a criterion for membership. Structures must be comparable  and the military leadership must embrace the same values. There  are reservations within the Defense Ministry on isolated  membership for the Baltic states because here the risks are in  reality greater than the benefits. [Passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent The renewed weakness in Shanks &amp; McEwan's shares yesterday was a reminder that the waste management sector will struggle to regain its premium rating of old. It is perhaps instructive, then, to recall that many of the privatised water companies, notably Severn Trent and Wessex, have high hopes for the waste business as a source of non-regulated earnings. Severn Trent paid Pounds 212m last May to buy Biffa from BET, an acquisition which was always going to dilute its earnings in the short term, but which appeared justified by its long-term promise. At the time of the interim results seven months later, it acknowledged that Biffa was not doing as well as expected. The subsequent further deterioration in its markets has almost certainly again deferred the date when it will make a return. Judging by the waste sector's recent experience, it is unlikely that Biffa will make much more than Pounds 10m pre-tax this year: it could make significantly less. Take off a reasonable Pounds 25m estimate for financing costs, and it looks as if Severn Trent will suffer a Pounds 15m hit this financial year, equivalent to earnings dilution of 6 per cent. There will be further dilution in 1992-93. While it is probably too early to judge the long-term case for diversification into the waste business, it would seem reasonable for investors at least to question Severn Trent's judgment. The question is whether its shares will have to yield more than their prospective 7.7 per cent as a result.</p>

As Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar reported at a press  conference in Tallinn Tuesday [18 January], several days ago  President Lennart Meri conferred on V. Reinart the diplomatic  rank of special envoy, "the same as Russian delegation head  Vasiliy Svirin." The premier noted that V. Reinart had  previously been a member of the Estonian delegation and knows  well the specific nature of the negotiations.    In conversation with an INTERFAX correspondent, M. Laar  refuted the accusations made in Moscow by Sergey Stepashin,  first deputy director of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence  Service, that the Estonian secret services were engaged in  intelligence work against Russia. "Estonia does not engage in  intelligence work against Russia," the prime minister emphasized.</p>

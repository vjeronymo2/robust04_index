			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Kim - reformer or political prisoner?: South Korea watches and waits as delicate balancing act takes shape THERE are two contrasting images of Mr Kim Young-sam, who will be inaugurated today as South Korea's first civilian president since 1961. One is the courageous dissident who challenged the country's military dictatorship for almost three decades and saw his efforts rewarded with the introduction of democracy in 1987. The other is the skilful, and his critics would say opportunistic, politician who abandoned the opposition in 1990 and joined his former adversaries in the ruling party. The defection, which gave the ruling party a parliamentary majority, eventually earned him the nomination as the government candidate in the December presidential election. The main question surrounding Mr Kim is whether his reformist tendencies will predominate during his single five-year term, or will he be beholden to the conservative political interests that helped elect him president. Mr Kim is well aware of the contradiction. His campaign slogan was 'reform amid stability' and his recent appointments reflect the delicate balancing act he must perform. Reformers were named to his personal staff in the Blue House, the executive mansion, while conservative politicians are expected to hold most of the cabinet postions under Prime Minister Hwang In-sung, a former general and cabinet minister during the military dictatorship. In many respects, Mr Kim's policies differ little from those of his predecessor, Mr Roh Tae-woo. In foreign affairs, for example, he is expected to maintain a tough stance against North Korea until it resolves suspicions about its possible development of nuclear weapons. The changes he proposes include making the government more accessible to the public and removing the last vestiges of its authoritarian past. Mr Kim would curb the power of the National Security Planning Agency, the intelligence agency that harassed him and other dissidents during military rule. Another goal is to fight the corruption that plagues the government, although that has also been promised by previous administrations to little effect. The personal assets of senior officials, for example, will be audited. One aspect of the anti-corruption campaign is the investigation of bribes and illegal election funding by the country's large industrial conglomerates, or chaebol, to gain business favours from the officials who closely regulate the economy. Partisan considerations, however, have apparently been a factor in recent probes, which have focused on chaebol that opposed Mr Kim last year. Most prominent has been the investigation of Hyundai and Mr Chung Ju-yung, its founder, who stood against Mr Kim in the presidential election. Other companies now under tax investigation for possible misuse of funds are Pohang Iron and Steel and Daewoo Corporation, whose leaders also criticised Mr Kim. The new president, however, has dismissed speculation that he will dismantle the chaebol in response to popular feeling against them. The public considers the chaebol an obstacle to social equality because of their economic dominance and the past favours granted to them at the expense of the small business sector. Indeed, Mr Kim has criticised as ineffective the credit restrictions imposed by President Roh on the chaebol to curb their growth. He believes a radical restructuring of Korea's industrial structure would harm the country's economic performance, particularly when the nation is undergoing a difficult transition phase from being a low-cost producer of bulk goods to a high-tech manufacturer. Instead, Mr Kim hopes to promote the chaebol's gradual dissolution by enforcing anti-trust laws. Family ownership of these industrial groups would be weakened by tougher inheritance taxes and the listing of all chaebol subsidiaries, many of which are now privately held, on the Seoul bourse. A key ingredient would also be deregulation, chiefly through reform of the financial system, which remains the government's chief instrument in managing the economy. The government is expected to announce extensive financial liberalisation next month and proposals for restructuring the inefficient banking sector and other financial institutions by June. But Mr Kim could face a hard time in implementing these changes since they represent a loss of power for the bureaucracy and the political establishment. Mr Kim's advisers in the Blue House appear firmly committed to reform, but he still must appease the conservatives within the ruling Democratic Liberal party. Whether Mr Kim has the strength and perseverance to push through the reforms remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Arts: Youthful expertise discovered - Wexford Festival Many leading composers have written journeyman operas which we never hear - youthful efforts, or tame, ineffectual ones, or unstageable mistakes. The intrepid Wexford Festival has tried on perhaps two or three of those, but it wisely prefers obscure operas with some dramatic spark worth fanning. Young Wagner's Das Liebesverbot ('The ban on love') is another case altogether: a sparky, vital piece which happened to be composed before Wagner had learned to be Wagner. Had it been by, say, Goetz, it might have had a secure little niche in the repertoire these many years. Wagner wrote it at 21; it had a single, ruinous performance and no other in his lifetime. His successes with Rienzi and The Flying Dutchman were soon to come, and after that a revival of his juvenile comedy would have been beside the point. (He did later make a gift of the score to King Ludwig, deprecating it as a 'Jugendsunde', a youthful sin.) The fact is that hardly anything in Das Liebesverbot betrays the mature composer; and yet it has the expertise, the pace and even the artful characterisations of a thorough professional. Lessons from Meyerbeer and Auber had been well learned. The piece is drawn from Shakespeare's Measure from Measure: brashly, for everything problematic or disturbing in that 'dark comedy' has been heedlessly jettisoned. Das Liebesverbot simply waves a banner for youthful love and lust against hypocritical moralising - especially Teutonic moralising, as Wagner stressed by transferring the action to a hedonistic Sicily, and turning Shakespeare's baneful Angelo into Friedrich, the German Regent. At Wexford the conductor Yves Abel strikes sparks from the start, with a crackling operetta-dash. In no time at all Luzio, Antonio and Angelo (a different one]) are embattled with the Bill, who want to tear down the carnival decorations. Soon we recognise Claudio and his pious sister Isabella (Peter Svensson and Marie Plette - both excellent), the one threatened with death for the crime of falling in love (or something like that) and the other - secretly - with having to grant Friedrich her favours to save her brother. In due course Friedrich himself appears, in the properly heavy, brooding person of Robert Holzer. In his dark music lie almost the only hints of the Wagner to come - a touch of Tannhauser, to add to the simple pre-echoes of Lohengrin. But he has strong competition from the comics: an exuberant, stentorian Police Chief (Gidon Saks), a pert maid Dorella (Majella Cullagh), the eccentric Pontio Pilato (Valentin Jar). And the climax of the piece is the wild carnival, thriftily staged by Dieter Kaegi with everybody in their underwear and some exiguous masks, at the end of which they all - even Isabella, and a contrite Friedrich  - find somebody to marry at once. I must also mention the cool, attractive mezzo Marit Sauramo as Friedrich's forsaken wife Mariana, who holds the key to the denouement. Even then, there are other singers who deserve warm notice; but it will have to suffice to insist that this bright, fleet comedy (judiciously trimmed to make it swifter still) is another clear Wexford hit, well-aimed and irresistibly carried through. Perhaps after all, Das Liebesverbot may now come to slip into the repertoire as a rewarding Wagnerian sport, with the hearty welcome it deserves.</p>

A ministry source said that relations between the ROC and  Lesotho ran into difficulties last April, when Lesotho's new  administration enthusiastically sought to establish close ties  with Beijing.    The Foreign Affairs Ministry is still trying to safeguard  the  existing relationship, according to the source, who said the ROC  Embassy in Lesotho is still in operation.    He said the reported diplomatic breakup could be confirmed  after the end of New Year's celebrations in the African country.</p>

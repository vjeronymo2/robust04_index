			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme tops Pounds 4m Shares in Wolstenholme Rink put on 37p to 695p yesterday as the company reported pre-tax profits up by 52 per cent from Pounds 2.89m to Pounds 4.4m for the year to end-December. The improvement was achieved on turnover up by Pounds 7m to Pounds 57m. Earnings per share came out at 39.6p (23.4p) and a proposed final dividend of 11.2p (10.5p) raises the total for the year to 18p (17p). Based in Lancashire, Wolstenholme Rink has reorganised its activities into three sections: supplies to the printing ink industry; supplies to the printing industry; and other businesses. Mr Tony Rink, joint chairman, said the business climate in the group's more developed markets, particularly Europe and America, remained somewhat disappointing. However, the wide geographic spread of its sales had assisted in offsetting those markets suffering from recession. Mr Rink said the last quarter of 1993 had shown signs of recovery in the UK printing industry and added that this trend had continued into the the current year. International business remained at encouraging levels.</p>

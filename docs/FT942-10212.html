			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs bounce A strong push by NatWest Securities transformed the recently battered electricity sector. Yesterday, NatWest advised its clients that the steep falls in share prices had gone far enough and that a prospective yield premium of 30 per cent in the regional electricity companies (recs) made them a 'strong buy'. The broker said the recent heavy selling was caused by a leaked letter from Offer to all the recs hinting at possible price cuts of 20 per cent or more as the basis for opening negotiations for the electricity distribution review now taking place. NatWest stressed, however, that the letter was merely an opening gambit in the negotiating process and that the recs will be able to negotiate their way to a better deal. East Midland, up 19 1/2 at 567p, was NatWest's prime selection, after the big job cuts and Dollars 80m assets writedown. The broker also recommended Norweb, 7 1/2 firmer at 612p, Seeboard, up 4 1/2 at 310p, and Midlands, 13 1/2 stronger at 572p. Lasmo shares attracted persistent keen buying interest, with dealers hinting at further support from some of the market's leading long term investors. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has announced that it has built a declarable stake of almost 22m shares in Lasmo, while Philips &amp; Drew Fund Management is thought to have continued to buy the stock, as has Legal &amp; General. Lasmo closed 2 1/2 up at 151 1/2 p after turnover of 7.1m. Royal Bank of Scotland put on another powerful display in front of this morning's interims; the shares jumped 12 1/2 more to 440 1/2 p, with bank specialists confidently expecting an interim dividend increase of around 25 per cent. The composite insurance sector's first-quarter reporting season started on a rather subdued note as General Accident produced profits in line with expectations, but disappointing figures for its solvency margin and net asset value. One analyst said the solvency margin, excluding its life interest, dipped from 57 per cent to 47 per cent. GenAcc settled 4 ahead at 563p. A broadcasting deal struck between the BBC and Pearson lifted the latter 28 to 650p. The reporting season in the drinks sector was kicked off by Vaux, its figures being in line with market expectations, although there was some disappointment over the size of the dividend. The shares slid 9 to 278p. Vaux's good hotel performance helped Greenalls add 8 at 475p. Sentiment in Guinness was said to have been helped by BSN's purchase of a Spanish beer group. Guinness, which has extensive Spanish interests, climbed 5 to 489p. Discount food retailer Kwik Save eased 2 to 570p after reporting a one per cent drop in like-for-like value sales since mid-March, although interim profits for the 28 weeks were up 7.2 per cent to Pounds 65.4m. The announcement that J. Sainsbury was backing down in its row over its own label cola with Coca-Cola, which had complained over the supermarket's aped product design, left the market unruffled and the shares gained 5 1/2 at 391 1/2 p. British Aerospace firmed 2 1/2 to 476p as it hosted an analysts visit to its defence operations. The stock was also helped by a positive note from NatWest Securities. The broker said: 'Our valuation suggests a further 20 per cent share upside.' Strong trading in British Steel brought volume of 9.6m by the close and the shares hardened 1 3/4 to 151 1/4 p after Kleinwort Benson was said to have recommended the stock. Cable and Wireless added 19 at 463p as the market responded to a recent upgrade for Hong Kong Telecom - a subsidiary of C&amp;W - by Goldman Sachs, and the upturn in Hong Kong markets overnight, a move which was said to have broken a trend relative to the US market. Telecoms specialists also pointed out that Hong Kong Telecom's preliminary figures are due on May 19, with those of C&amp;W expected a week later. 'C&amp;W are cheap on fundamentals,' said an analyst. Turnover in Tomkins rose to 7.3m and the shares firmed 2 to 239p after recommendations from UBS and Nomura.</p>

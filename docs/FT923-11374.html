			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Germany 'should consider effects of interest rate rise': The warning highlights French sensitivities in the run-up to the Maastricht referendum GERMANY should consider its neighbours' monetary problems when setting interest rates, Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said yesterday. However, he thought the markets had overreacted to last week's rise in the Bundesbank's discount rate. His warning, which highlights French sensitivities in the run-up to the September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty, came during a regular meeting with Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, which was also attended by the presidents of the two countries' central banks. France must 'understand what is at stake in German unification and its economic consequences and it is absolutely necessary that the German authorities also keep in mind the external consequences of of their decisions on internal matters,' said Mr Sapin. 'We must understand the problems of German and Germany must understand the problems of France,' he said. The French government fully understood that the Bundesbank had done its best to restrict the impact of its monetary tightening to Germany, by choosing to raise the discount rate - which only affects a limited amount of commercial bank borrowings from the central bank - rather than a more important official rate. 'I would have liked things to be understood this way by all the markets, which have shown a disproportionate anxiety over the sense of the decision,' said Mr Sapin. The German rate rise was followed by a renewed fall in the dollar's value and in equity prices across Europe. However, Mr Sapin believed that Monday's intervention by the leading central banks to support the dollar was well timed and co-ordinated. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank's president, accepted that France already had high real interest rates, but stressed that German monetary stability was important to the world economy. The Bundesbank would watch the progress of German money supply and 'draw the conclusions at the appropriate moment,' said Mr Schlesinger.</p>

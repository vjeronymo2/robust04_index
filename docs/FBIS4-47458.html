Putin, Chemistry SRI, Tambov, Chemical  Machine Building Institute, Tambov; UDC614.894]    [Abstract] In a previous work, a mathematical model was  presented for an individual respiratory device having a  reciprocating type system of air movement. Another group of  individual respirators employs a cyclic system, where the  exhaled air passes through a layer of regenerative product into  a breathing bag; on inhalation, the air passes from the  breathing bag to the face mask. The advantage of the cyclic  system over that of the reciprocating system lies in a lower  temperature of the inhaled air and less respiratory resistance,  thereby improving the ergonomic characteristics of the device.  Due to the two-way passage of air through the regenerative  product in the reciprocating devices, the regeneration process  is intensified, and for this reason these devices received  greater dissemination. However, this advantage holds only for  relatively small devices. The proposed model may thus be used to  determine which system of air movement is most effective in any  given case. In the present work the model was expanded to  include devices designed to the cyclic system of air movement  and used to compare the two systems. Figures 2; references 2  (Russian).</p>

Following a tight agenda and after opening the plenary  session of the IDB's Eighth Central America, Belize, and Panama  Governors Meeting, Iglesias went to the presidential palace  where he stated the Nicaraguan economic program must be made  flexible to adjust to the nation's needs. Iglesias was referring  to the upcoming signing of the so-called ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] with the IMF. The agriculture  sector will receive $16 million to increase the production of  basic agricultural products for local consumption and exports.    Microindustry businessmen will be granted $23.6 million from  the loan. Shortly after signing the loan, Iglesias said: "These  credits are part of our conviction that Nicaragua's development  is on the right road." He said: "I believe the most difficult  part of the adjustment process is behind; it is very important  that organizations like ours support the nation's development  now."    Iglesias emphasized that our people have gone through many  years of adjustments; now the true battle for production and  growth starts. He indicated that the IDB believes it is possible  to realize a development program in Nicaragua. This financial  institution has approved approximately $400 million in credits  in the past three years.    Economy Minister Pablo Pereira reported that the program to  support small-scale industry is being transformed from a simple  ministry program to a mixed institute in which private and  public sectors as well as the banks will participate.    Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger said this week was  outstanding after prestigious personalities in the financial and  political sector concluded their visits here. Yesterday, Kruger  signed an exchange of notes with Kuniji Suzuki, charge d'affairs  of the Japanese Embassy, for an $8.5 million donation to  purchase agriculture and industrial supplies.    The IDB president continued his agenda today by holding a  work meeting with the Economic Cabinet. He also met with  ministers of the social sector: Health, Social Action, and  Emergency Social Funds. A group of advisers and Joel Riley, IDB  representative in Nicaragua, accompany Iglesias at these  meetings. At the meeting with the economic and social team, all  matters relating to the loans the IDB approved for the next four  years are being discussed. Yesterday, Iglesias met with  Legislative Assembly President Luis Humberto Guzman and  Sandinist National Liberation Front leaders.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WHITE ASKS 3RD TIME FOR TRADE  </P> <P> Oilers halfback Lorenzo White has asked to be traded, and General Manager Mike  Holovak said he will honor that request, the third by White.  </P> <P> "Sure, I'll try," Holovak said Wednesday. "There's interest in Lorenzo because  he's a darn good back, but nothing's hot right now." White, the Oilers' No. 1  pick in 1988, has languished on the bench behind Mike Rozier and Allen Pinkett  for the last two seasons.  </P> <P> Because the Oilers are going to the run-and-shoot offense, which employs only  one back, officials said White and Rozier can be traded for draft choices or  other players.  </P></p>

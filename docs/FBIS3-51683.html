Cauca Department Governor Temistocles Ortega Narvaez said  that other more democratic means should be adopted to face the  Guerrilla Coordinating Board violence and said that Gaviria's  announcement is outside all constitutional order. Gaviria has  invoked the Public Order Law. "I am convinced that all  Colombians have to decidedly fight to strengthen democracy and  this calls for civilian society to have the responsibility of  guiding the state at its various levels," the governor said.  Temistocles Ortega added that for this very reason he differs  from the president's views that members of the Armed Forces  should fill the vacancies in those municipalities where the  mayors have been murdered.    Norte de Santander Department Governor Alvaro Salgar  Villamizar said that the fact that a mayor is murdered justifies  the president's reasons, but this places the president against  the spirit of the Constitution and the mayors' popular election  mandate.    Antioquia Governor Juan Gomez Martinez said that the measure  seems extreme to him and said that in the case of Antioquia  Department, the situation has substantially improved, including  the Uraba banana area.    President Gaviria Trujillo assured all governors that they  will have the government's full support in its struggle against  the guerrillas and in the consolidation process for the upcoming  elections. The president said that the Colombian guerrillas  have their military capacity undermined and have been incapable  of interpreting the Colombian people's wishes and have found  less support among the population. He said that for this reason  no one wants to listen to their outdated speeches full of  bullets and threats, arguing that all Colombians reject the  attack suffered by Finance and Public Credit Minister Rudolf  Hommes.    The president said that those guerrillas do not know that  Colombians must be spoken to with the language of democracy,  respect for life, and tolerance. He said that the decided and  clear response by the Colombian people should show those who are  violent that their weapons do not intimidate us and that their  crazy behavior leads us to persist in the policies that will  lead Colombia down the path of peace and progress.</p>

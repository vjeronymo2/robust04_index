			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: WH Smith confirms Virgin/Our Price merger WH Smith, the retail and distribution group, yesterday confirmed it was merging its Our Price music chain with Virgin Retail, its joint venture with Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group. Smith will put all its 305 Our Price stores into the venture, and increase its stake from 50 to 75 per cent. Virgin, which operates 24 megastores in the UK and Ireland, will reduce its stake to 25 per cent. No cash is changing hands. The enlarged group will be the UK's biggest music retailer with annual sales of Pounds 350m - 20 per cent of the market. It will be managed by a team of Virgin and WH Smith executives headed by Mr Simon Burke, currently Virgin Retail's managing director for the UK and Ireland. Other directors will be Mr Peter Troughton, WH Smith's managing director of UK retailing, and Mr Trevor Abbott, managing director of Virgin Retail. Mr Branson will be president. The merger is subject to approval by the regulatory authorities. Virgin also announced a 50/50 venture with Saehan Media Corporation of South Korea to open Megastores there. The first is expected to open in Seoul in mid-1995. Saehan manufactures video tape and magnetic media, and has affiliations with Samsung, one of South Korea's largest groups.</p>

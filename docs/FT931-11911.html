			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Ireland hits out at Bundesbank and UK on punt: Finance minister criticises failure to come to aid of smaller nations THE IRISH government hit out yesterday at the Bundesbank, Britain and the management of the European exchange rate mechanism, after the punt's 10 per cent devaluation on Saturday. Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, said on Irish state radio: 'We fought a ferocious battle with the markets. 'We hoped for a change in a number of policy directions. We had hoped for a realignment of the currencies under attack, mainly the French and the Danes. We had hoped that the multilateral aid that we were requesting from the Community and particularly from the Bundesbank . . . would happen. Instead (there was) bilateral aid for the French which worked against us.' The devaluation followed three days of heavy selling of the punt on the foreign exchange markets, triggered by the 1 percentage point cut in UK base rates on Tuesday and the subsequent weakening of sterling. Mr Ruari Quinn, employment and enterprise minister, criticised Britain over the effects of its exchange-rate policy: 'We are not here because the Irish economy has suddenly nosedived. We are here because of a series of political decisions . . . some reflect Britain's basic antipathy towards European union.' Mr Ahern was particularly bitter about the failure of the ERM to rescue smaller members of the system. 'One of the great difficulties with the ERM is that not only is there not equal help for all members but the larger members seem to be able to negotiate side agreements. So, a small country with a small currency is expected to take on a bigger burden in the fight against the markets, even though its economic fundamentals are correct, while a country like France can get a separate deal.' These factors, together with a threatened rise in domestic mortgage and commercial lending rates and a collapse of the domestic political consensus to defend the currency, persuaded the government to devalue, he said. The Bundesbank refused to comment directly on Mr Ahern's complaints. 'The aim of our activities is to support (the monetary system) and therefore, all member currencies, including the punt,' an official said. The UK government played down Mr Quinn's criticism. However, some officials said the punt's devaluation was a further example of the 'fault lines' identified by the UK when sterling left the ERM in September. Downing Street took the rare step yesterday of denying a Sunday Times report that Mr John Major was seeking further interest rate cuts - of up to 2 points - and had taken control of economic policy away from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. The decision to deny the story came after consultation between Mr Major and Mr Lamont, and with the Bank of England. 'There was total agreement between the Treasury, the Bank of England and Number 10 that the move to 6 per cent interest rates was justified by the various monetary and other indicators.' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, seized on the statement, saying the government had no clear economic strategy. Whether it was the prime minister or the chancellor in charge 'the British economy is paying a terrible price for a cabinet which has lost its way'.

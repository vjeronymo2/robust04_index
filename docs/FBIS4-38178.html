			<p>BFN     [Text] Nabil Sha'th will come to Jerusalem on 1 July and  will watch a joint Palestinian-Israeli theater production.  According to Minister Shulamit Aloni, the prime minister  approved the visit.    At the same time, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said this  morning that this is not about a theater performance; rather,  the Sha'th visit is a political demonstration by the PLO, and he  will have no part of it. Minister Aloni said that at this  stage, Jerusalem is a religious issue and that there is nothing  more wonderful than having the capital of the Jewish people open  to all.    Olmert said he is pleased that in his meeting with the prime  minister yesterday they did not deal with philosophy, because  the issues at hand are political. The Jerusalem mayor said he  is pleased with what he heard from the prime minister, but added  that he gives Mr. Rabin and the government six months to prove  their intentions in deeds, such as allocating resources for the  city, expanding construction there, building roads, and  developing the education system in both parts of the city.    Aloni and Olmert spoke to Qol Yisra'el this morning.</p>

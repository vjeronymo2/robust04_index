			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Own-account losses lead to sharp drop at Dresdner Dresdner Bank yesterday announced a sharp fall in profits at the 10-month stage as the weakness in world bond markets pushed its financial trading activities into the red. Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman, also hit out at the official investigation into allegations that the bank had helped investors to evade tax by transferring funds to Luxembourg. The resulting debate was damaging for Germany's status as a financial centre, he said. The authorities' actions, he added, set a 'questionable signal' and 'criminalise the financial centre of Luxembourg'. Group operating profits dropped by 17 per cent to DM1.33bn (Dollars 850m) in the January-October period. Heavy write-offs on its bond holdings, caused by rising capital market interest rates, meant Dresdner's own-account trading - including securities, foreign exchange and other financial dealings - produced a net loss of DM301m against a profit of DM536m. Two-thirds of the loss stemmed from derivatives business by a Paris-based subsidiary but was more than compensated for by profits elsewhere on linked interest rate transactions. The deterioration in Dresdner's performance is in line with the figures presented by its competitors. Commerzbank has reported a 27 per cent fall in operating profits to DM660m, although asset disposals lifted its pre-tax figure. BHF-Bank's own-account trading result was 85 per cent lower at DM14m, although its operating result was steady at DM265m. Deutsche Bank announces its 10-month results today. Dresdner's partial operating profit, reflecting its basic lending, deposit and investment business and excluding own-account trading, was 17.5 per cent higher at DM2.8bn. The surplus on interest rate business, including the profits on derivatives-linked business, increased by 12 per cent to DM5.7bn Commission income rose by 7 per cent to DM2.5bn. Preventing an even steeper slide in operating profits was a 16 per cent reduction in loan loss provisions to DM1.05bn. Mr Sarrazin said the need for provisions on domestic loans was well below the 1993 level. Referring to the probe over alleged abetting of tax evasion, he said German financial authorities misunderstood the concept of free capital movements. Only if investors could depend on open borders for their money would Germany continue to attract much-needed foreign capital. The bank has denied wrongdoing and sharply criticised the probe by tax officials and the state prosecutor's office into allegations it was covering up transfers of funds to Luxembourg to help investors avoid German withholding tax.

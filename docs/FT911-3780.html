			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / World News in Brief: Iraq accused over Kuwaiti prisoners Kuwait accused Iraq of holding more than 5,400 Kuwaiti civilians and soldiers and of failing to return property, as required by the UN Security Council. The Kuwaiti ambassador to the UN, Mr Mohammad Abol Hassan, said in a letter to the council that Iraq's continuing failure to adhere to the articles of Security Council resolution 686 'puts the credibility and motives of the Iraqi regime under suspicion'. Baghdad had pledged to enact the resolution 'swiftly' two days after the end of the Gulf war. Page 20; Kuwaiti politics; Kurdish camps effort, Page 4; Parliament, Page 11</p>

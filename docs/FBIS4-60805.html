			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday the State Duma Committee for Economic  Policy drew up a recommendation on a draft of the Russian  federal budget for 1994. It proposes that the document should  be rejected because it does not take into account a large number  of the proposals made by the State Duma committees. The draft  budget, which was sent to the State Duma, was elaborated by the  government in accordance with a decision of the lower chamber of  the parliament of 15 April. The committee's main arguments show  that the amendments introduced into the budget strengthen the  orientation of the government's economic policy on the  preferential development of raw material industries without  solving problems in other spheres of the economy.</p>

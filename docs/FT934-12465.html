			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (19): Serious conflict of priorities - Business protection and IT risk management BUSINESS protection now offers some of the highest growth rates in the information technology sector. In the next five years to 1997, companies in the UK will spend Pounds 2.5bn on protection, representing a compound annual growth rate of almost 30 per cent, Research by the International Data Corporation shows that 40 per cent of this IT business protection will be 'outsourced.' The report examines four areas: database recovery, access control, contingency planning and disaster recovery in sectors ranging from banking and insurance to retailing and manufacturing. One phenomenon that emerges from the IDC survey is that while, alarmingly, only 12 per cent of organisations were 'totally confident' in their ability to recover from a serious IT incident leading to business disruption, more than 20 per cent considered IT security to be 'a prime concern' and a significant item for IRT expenditure. This apparent conflict in priorities provides a measure of the level of opportunity available to computer services vendors. Even though companies are becoming increasingly dependent on information technology, more than 35 per cent do not consider IT security to be a 'major priority,' according to the survey. Finance directors, who are generally beginning to view IT strategy and expenditure more critically, still tend to consider IT business protection as 'more of a technical issue than a commercial necessity.' With UK commercial losses due to computer security lapses now running at well over Pounds 1bn a year, 'awareness of the problem is the first stage for treatment - and recognition has to come from the top of an organisation,' says the new Director's Guide to Business Security, produced by the Institute of Directors and Digital Equipment. Having been through its own worldwide review of internal security, Digital advises companies on security strategies and then helping the customers to implement them. Consultancy begins with a 'threat assessment' to identify risk areas and their impact on the business. The risks evaluated include theft, industrial espionage and even bomb attacks. Digital's approach to network security has been learned in the harsh light of experience: in 1990, a fire destroyed one its UK office complexes - although only 18 months old, the structure which also housed a large Digital computing facility, was 80 per cent destroyed in less than an hour. The IOD/Digital survey suggests a range of sources of advice on IT security. These include: The Confederation of British Industry which has two relevant groups: the Computer Security Working Group and the Computer Misuse Working Group. Details from Wendy Rainbow at the CBI on 071 379 7400. The British Computer Society which has a committee on data security. Details from the BCS on 0793 480 269. The Computer Crime Unit of the Metropolitan and City Police - described as the only police unit in the UK which specialises in the investigation of computer-related crime. Details on 071 230 1189. The European Security Forum: an independent, non-profit group dedicated to resolving issues of IT security. Details on 071 583 1745. International Information Integrity Institute (I4): formed in 1986 by SRI International; member-companies include both suppliers and advanced users of information technology. Details from Ken Lindup on 081 685 5555. In the aftermath of the bomb disaster at Bishopsgate in the City, Safetynet, a leading supplier of business continuity services, has made an extensive report listing 20 areas of 'lessons learned' regarding contingency planning. Among the findings in the report are:*** A bad plan is worse than no plan at all. Business continuity budgets are often inadequate - and 'business as usual' is a myth. Third party involvement is critical to success in contingency planning. Weekend 'disasters' are easier to survive. Supplier goodwill is not enough. Off-site storage must be comprehensive. Insurance alone does not usually cover losses. Multi-site organisations recover more quickly. As an example of the the new awareness of IT security in the City of London, AST Trans-Act - a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada - has won five contracts worth Pounds 3.5m - just three months after launching its business recovery facility. This is one of the first 'shared subscription' facilities for City businesses wanting contingency plans for serious trading disruptions. Following a disaster, clients have the use of an office complex and dealing room for 180 staff. The facility is guarded around the clock and has an uninterruptable power supply *Report: 'UK IT Business Protection: a Window of Opportunity for Computer Services Vendors'; from IDC, London, telephone 081 995 8082. **Director's Guide to Business Security; Institute of Directors, London; Pounds 9.95; details on 071.497.3001. *** 'After Bishopsgate: the Lessons Learned'; report available from Caroline Davy; Safetynet, telephone 0344 869 933</p>

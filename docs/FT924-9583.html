			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Indian share issue postponed INDIAN Petrochemicals Corporation, India's largest petrochemicals company which was set to become the country's first state-owned company to offer equity to foreign investors, has postponed its planned issue until the second quarter of the financial year to March 1994. The issue, expected to raise around Rs6.5bn (Dollars 228m), was slated for the first quarter of 1993-94. The company had proposed to offer about 14 per cent of its equity in two tranches to foreign investors. One reason for the delay was the lukewarm response companies floating similar issues had receiv-ed. A board meeting this week decided not to proceed with the issue until it had been thoroughly discussed with Mr K. G. Ramanathan, the chairman who took over this month. The company will, however, go ahead with a local share issue on November 16 to raise Rs200m and reduce the government stake to 51 per cent.</p>

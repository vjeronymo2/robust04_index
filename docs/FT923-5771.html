			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / De Klerk grasps a dangerous nettle: A cultural change for working-class Afrikaner policemen ASK ALMOST any black South African: who is responsible for the violence that has destroyed so many lives since political reform began in South Africa? The answer will be: the police. Even members of the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, who are alleged to enjoy close links with police, often accuse them of complicity in the violence. Such charges are at best exaggerated, at worst completely false. But the fact remains that most black South Africans believe police are directly involved in township violence. Now President F W de Klerk has decided to face this problem head-on. He has forcibly retired fully one-quarter of the force's top generals, and agreed to set up an independent, largely civilian, body to investigate alleged police crimes. Officers are to be retrained in the art of community policing, and a vigorous affirmative action policy adopted to promote non-white officers quickly to top ranks. The South African Police is to be made accountable to the public, after decades in which policemen enjoyed a freedom of action which would not be tolerated in any civilised country. Those who resist the new mood of co-operation with blacks will be sacked or retired; white officers will find themselves reporting to senior blacks for the first time. Most white officers come from the section of the white population most at risk from political reform: working class Afrikaners, for whom black rule means an end to guaranteed employment in the public sector. Understaffed and poorly trained in riot control, many genuinely fear for their lives when the stones begin to fly. Black policemen - some 56 per cent of the force is non-white, including the bulk of officers assigned to township duty - suffer more immediate fears of political change. They have been the target of the African National Congress, which called on its supporters to kill policemen and their families as part of its campaign to make South Africa ungovernable. Changing their attitudes will be difficult: but Mr de Klerk has finally decided - at considerable political risk to himself - to try. After months in which he appeared unable or unwilling to confront his own security forces, he has opened the police to public scrutiny and implicitly admitted its weaknesses. He has taken to heart the criticisms voiced by British investigators who last month found that the police were incompetent and the lower ranks out of control. Since then, pressure has mounted with allegations by a prominent pathologist that 90 per cent of deaths in detention were caused by police. These measures alone will not stop the violence: they do not affect the military, which is alleged to be involved in a continuing campaign of 'dirty tricks' against the ANC, nor the so-called 'Third Force', the secret network of former and serving security force and intelligence officers alleged to be behind much of the violence. But they could help prevent the large number of deaths which can be attributed to poor policing.</p>

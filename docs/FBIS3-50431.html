			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Morning Paper" newscast] </F>   [Text] Carlos Sosa Cuello, PINU [Innovation and Unity  Party] deputy has charged that the U.S. position of supporting  the clearing up of missing persons cases in Honduras is  hypocritical because the people in Washington originally  promoted and fostered this type of criminal action. Meanwhile,  Sosa fears that actions may be taken against witnesses in these  cases after the release of the preliminary report by Human  Rights Ombudsman Leo Valladares. The report could revive the  memories of the violent actions that led to more than 100  missing persons.    This morning, Deputy Sosa levied serious allegations against  the U.S. Government, saying it is greatly responsible for the  more than 100 disappearances during the 1980's. Likewise, he  insinuated that a controversy could arise between the relatives  of the missing persons and those accused of being responsible  for the disappearances. Here is what Deputy Sosa Cuello said:    [Begin recording] [Sosa] I think the United States,  specifically the Reagan administration, had a leading role in  this matter. They trained our forces; they armed the Honduran  forces; and they trained them in torture, interrogation  techniques, and methods that led to the disappearance of people.  Now, from Washington, they have the gall to cry out, as if  horror-stricken, in favor of human rights. Only a decade ago,  these very rights were violated under U.S. instructions,  encouragement, and support. The United States almost demanded  this. This is typically hypocritical of the empires that preach  one set of morals and practice another. This is very  characteristic of the Calvinist moral system: It upholds success  as the only human goal, regardless of the means or mechanisms  used in achieving this success. It has a philosophical  antecedent in Machiavellianism; it is typically Calvinistic and  Protestant; it is very characteristic of this empire's moral  values.    [Reporter] What they applauded before, they now reject,  right?    [Sosa] Concerning what they fostered and demanded before,  they are now horror-sticken. On certain occasions it is the  very same actors who participated.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] in this case the U.S. empire.    [Sosa] This is what they call political pragmatism. It is  the securing of results as the primary goal of men of state.  This is not true. The means should be in keeping with the ends  to allow our actions to ethically respond to the goals for which  we are fighting. One cannot champion democracy and liberty by  murdering or, even worse, by fostering murder and then  subsequently appearing horror-sticken by what one has fostered.  To me, this is philosophically and ethically unacceptable.    [Reporter] Who is more guilty, the United States or the  Hondurans who were in power at that time?    [Sosa] I think we Hondurans should place historical and not  criminal responsibility on those who held high-ranking positions  at that time in our nation. It would be wrong for us to judge  the foreigners without first judging our own people. When I  make this statement regarding the imperialists' hypocracy, I do  this from an Honduran point of view, and I am doing this in an  effort to prevent this from ever happening again in Honduras.    [Reporter] Do you not fear that this report will create  discord between the two sides?    [Sosa] I would like this report, its final conclusions, and  the actions that the attorney general -- still unknown to us as  of this time -- could or not take to put an end to this chapter.  I would like this report not to refresh memories of an era that  we Hondurans should forget, precisely so that it is not repeated  and not relived.    [Reporter] What does this refreshing of memory mean?    [Sosa] It means the possibility of leaving the door open --  a  green light, so to speak -- for actions against possible  witnesses, against possible depositions, or that this could be  used by certain sectors against their adversaries.    [Reporter] Currently, are there threats between the groups?    [Sosa] I hope not. I hope that the investigations, the legal  actions, and the meaning of the amnesty granted by Congress will  put an end to the situation and create one in which the Honduran  state has greater interest in compensating the relatives and  descendants of these victims of violence than in seeking  revenge. We should do more to educate the children of the  missing persons to guarantee them a future instead of procuring  vengeance, which is one of humanity's basest emotions.</p>

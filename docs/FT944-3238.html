			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Berkeley 41% ahead to Pounds 17.8m Continuing stability in the new housing market helped Berkeley Group record a 41 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 12.6m to Pounds 17.8m, for the six months to October 31. Berkeley, which specialises in executive homes and is prominent in the south-east, said that the average sale price had risen by Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 190,000. Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, said that the price improvement had come from the change in the mix of units sold, rather than any significant rise in prices. He described the current price environment as 'stagnant but solid', with the London market the most buoyant. However, he did not foresee any further price rises during the coming year. 'The feelgood factor is still missing for most potential buyers,' he said. With land prices rising strongly this year and building costs also increasing, Mr Pidgley said that margins had come under pressure, although the group had managed to increase profitability through its large landbank and by responding to changes in customers' specifications. 'You cannot afford to be an inefficient building group in this market,' he said. He added that land prices were now beginning to ease off, although they still remained 'ridiculously high'. The group's landbank was steady during the period and now stood at 5,000 units. The group also maintained a net cash balance, with Pounds 10m in the bank. Turnover advanced 24 per cent to Pounds 128.7m (Pounds 103.9m). Earnings per share rose 40 per cent to 15.4p (11p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.9p to 2.1p. Berkeley has also been pursuing developments in the commercial property market through two joint venture companies as well as its own division.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Save &amp; Prosper's bond THE guaranteed equity bond may just be the marketing man's ideal investment product for the 1990s. It is not without flaws, but it could be the only way of persuading nervous investors to put their money into shares. This week, Save &amp; Prosper became the latest company to launch a product into this crowded field. Its Guaranteed Stock Market Bond offers a near-exact matching of the FT-SE 100 Index's capital growth over five years with the promise of your money back if the index does not rise. Save &amp; Prosper says that 99 per cent of the original investment will increase in line with the Footsie; and those who invest before November 27 will get a 1 per cent bonus, effectively increasing the index-matching promise to 100 per cent. There is a further option available, for those who fear that the market might plunge in the period just before the bond is encashed. Every time the market rises by 10 per cent (subject to a maximum of 50 per cent), the bond will lock in this gain. So if the market were to rise by 35 per cent and then fall back, the investor would have secured a 30 per cent gain. The price for this further guarantee, however, is that only 92 per cent of the investment is increased in line with the index. Save &amp; Prosper has calculated that over the most recent five calendar year periods, the bond would have beaten a building society higher rate account. For example, over the five years to January 1 1992, Save &amp; Prosper's bond (with the bonus) would have turned Pounds 5,000 into Pounds 7,425; the building society would have grown the same sum into Pounds 7,285. Although the difference is pretty marginal, Save &amp; Prosper points out that the five year period includes the Crash and that interest rates were much higher than they are likely to be over the next five years. So what are the snags? For a start, you must hold your investment for five years. If you want to withdraw your money early, the guarantee will not apply. Your return will depend on the level of the market, minus an unspecified administrative charge which Save &amp; Prosper will apply. The second snag concerns higher rate taxpayers. Unlike some other guaranteed products, returns on the bond are free of basic rate. But higher rate payers will face a charge on their gains equivalent to the difference between basic and top rate tax (currently 15 per cent). If they had invested in a unit or investment trust, gains would be subject to capital gains tax. Few people make enough gains to cross the Pounds 5,800 CGT threshold. The third snag is that the bond pays no income. Not only that, but the investor does not benefit from the dividend yield on shares, currently 4.7 per cent. That can make quite a difference over five years. An indexed fund, such as Gartmore's All-Share Tracker, aims to match the index and pay an income on top. Logic would suggest, therefore, that if you expect the market to rise over the next five years, a tracker fund will give a better return (especially for higher rate payers) than the Save &amp; Prosper fund. And if you do not expect the market to rise over five years, do not invest in an equity-based product - go for gilts or national savings. But logic is rarely the guiding principle in finance. Save &amp; Prosper's research suggests that people would like to invest in equities, but are turned off by the fear of capital loss. A product such as the guaranteed bond helps overcome this psychological barrier, and could be a key marketing tool for the financial services industry.</p>

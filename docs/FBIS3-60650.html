			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>   [Excerpts] There are at least two reasons to link the  discovery of lethal waste delivered from Germany to neighboring  Albania with the war and other events in the Balkans. First,  involved are materials whose degree of poisonousness--that is,  toxicity--in larger concentrations are by no means lower than  some well-known chemical weapons. The second reason is  strategic and long-term interests that the developed Europe and  United States want to realize in these regions.    Without denying the long-accepted general definition of war  as the continuation of politics with different means, one should  still recall the fact that there are means, the use of which is  not permitted in war or peace. Involved are, among others,  chemical-biological combat means that, due to their known and  potential effects, represent a great danger for modern  civilization. [passage omitted]    Chemical weapons have been used in local wars. They are even  used today in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, where, in their  attacks on Serbian positions, Izetbegovic's mujahedins are  reportedly using ammunition charged with poisons, most probably  produced in one of the existing factories of chemical products,  pesticides, or detergents.    Of course, it is difficult to predict the extent of an  ecological catastrophe in the event that cisterns with chloride  explode or if chemical plants in Tuzla or factories of mines and  explosives in Vitez and Gorazde are deliberately destroyed.    Therefore, we cannot be calm over the recent discovery of a  large quantity of lethal chemicals in the neighboring Albania.  There are ever louder rumors that something similar may have  been delivered to some western regions of the former Yugoslav  federation in exchange for diplomatic and military aid in the  forced secession from the mother country. All this directs one  to the justified suspicion that Germany and other developed  countries are not instigating the present reorganization of the  Balkans from the well-known geostrategic reasons alone but are  rather ensuring room for dumping chemical and radioactive waste  as far as possible from their own threshold and under someone  else's carpet.</p>

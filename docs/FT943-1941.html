			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / UK export boost cuts trade deficit with non-EU states British exports to countries outside the European Union rose to record levels last month, with manufacturers reaping the benefits of strong growth in the US and Far Eastern economies. The firm export growth, coupled with falling levels of imports, helped to reduce the UK trade deficit with non-EU countries to its lowest level for more than six years. Exports to non-EU countries, which represent almost half of all British trade, were a seasonally adjusted Pounds 5.47bn last month, up from Pounds 5.41bn in July, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. Imports from these countries were Pounds 5.72bn, down from last month's level of Pounds 5.8bn, but roughly in line with the levels seen during most of this year. The resulting deficit of Pounds 0.26bn was considerably better than the City had expected, and the government welcomed the data as further evidence that the UK recovery was becoming less driven by consumer demand and more by exports and investment. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'These figures are excellent news. The deficit has been halved over the last year.' The most striking part of the data, economists said, was that the recovery did not appear to be bringing in large quantities of imports to meet the recent growth in UK industrial and consumer demand. Although some economists said this might suggest a slowdown in levels of consumer demand, others argued that it might indicate that UK companies were finally responding to the effect of the 1992 sterling devaluation by starting to substitute domestic products for imports. Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation, said: 'At first sight these figures do suggest that there is some import substitution . . . in the home markets.' The growth in exports covered most industrial categories. Although strong oil exports boosted the overall trade balance, manufacturing also performed well, with exports of manufacturing components 9 per cent higher in the three months to August than the previous three months. Exports of processed chemicals and metals showed particularly strong growth. Electronic and engineering goods also did well. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, welcomed the figures as evidence that 'British exporters are succeeding overseas'. However, City economists pointed out that Germany and other European countries were also seeing strong export growth. Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, the Japanese securities house, said: 'It is difficult to say whether the UK is increasing market share or whether it is just that the world economy is booming - but I suspect it is more that world demand is strong.'

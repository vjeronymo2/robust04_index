			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: China urged to develop funds China was urged yesterday to speed the development of mutual funds with foreign involvement to stabilise its fledgling stock markets, which have been subject to wild fluctuations in the past year. Mr Robin Fox, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson, told an investment seminar in Beijing organised by the China-Britain Trade Group that one way to bolster China's markets was to 'promote properly authorised savings vehicles'. Adding to the volatility of China's equities markets has been the fact that inexperienced individuals seeking short-term speculative gains make up the bulk of investors. China announced recently that it was considering allowing foreign securities houses to form joint ventures with Chinese institutions to invest in the A-share market, presently closed to foreigners. Mr Fox said there was a wealth of experience available among foreign securities companies in joint venture arrangements with local firms. Kleinwort Benson, for example, was engaged in such ventures in India, Korea, Taiwan and Japan. 'The foreign joint-venture partner would be more able to overcome conflicts of interest as well as resisting local pressure to invest in particular industries or companies,' Mr Fox said. 'The main investment goal of the funds I am recommending would be to invest in quoted Chinese companies to help in the development of domestic stock markets, but I would expect them also to participate in the bond market, possibly by investing a stated percentage of each fund in government bonds.' Mr Fox said merchant banks and foreign securities companies were also well placed to assist China in its present phase of rapid economic development requiring large amounts of capital, especially for infrastructure projects. British investment banks were 'ideal partners' for projects which required creative approaches in evaluating the financial viability of a project, and seeking ways in which risk could be minimised. There was also a substantial exercise, Mr Fox said, in looking at alternative sources of equity and debt finance, negotiating the construction and other contracts to maximise the risk taken on by the contractors, and also maximise the project finance that does not appear as a direct liability of the promoters of the projects. Other speakers included Lord Alexander, chairman of the National Westminster Bank, who urged his Chinese audience to take advantage of the 'skill base' offered by London's commercial banking system. These skills, he said, include assistance in the development of the Chinese securities industry, corporate finance, direct investment channels and fundraising for privately financed infrastructure projects, such as power stations and toll roads.</p>

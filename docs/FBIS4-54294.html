			<p>CSO     [Text] With a high yen taking root such that in a little  while it soon will fall below $1 to 100 yen, listed firms in  Kansai are making an overseas shift in production and overseas  procurement of parts and materials full-scale. Their aim is to  bolster earnings taking advantage of areas nearby in the Asian  economic bloc that are developing. It seems that such moves are  inviting a deindustrialization of the Kansai economy where there  are many subcontractor firms and accelerating a change of the  industrial structure.    "It seems that quality is not a problem." Director  Tsunemichi  Imanishi of Hamada Printing Machinery heaved a sigh of relief  while inspecting Chinese castings for a rotary press which  arrived at their Ueno plant (Mie Prefecture). Because of the  sales slump in printing machinery, the March 1994 quarter became  the second consecutive quarter with an ordinary deficit, and  they were driven to solicit voluntary retirement. Therefore,  they have decided to reduce by 30 percent variable expenses  (expenses that increase or decrease along with sales) centering  on raw material expenses.    In the case of this company, the percentage for castings in  raw material expenses is high, accounting for 8 percent of  variable expenses. It has taken exactly one year to begin  importing from China since establishing their plan in the spring  of 1993 when a high yen was rapidly advancing. It took time to  develop suppliers and realization was greatly delayed, but  "costs have been reduced 20 percent over domestic procurement"  (Imanishi).    Domestic sales of sheet printers increased during the time  of  the high yen situation in 1985, and they covered the blow from  the high yen. This time, however, domestic demand has cooled,  and the price of printing machines has dropped 40 percent from  the peak. They will not catch up by previous rationalization  methods. In the future, they plan to procure parts other than  castings from Europe, etc.    Daikin Industries plans to boost the overseas procurement  ratio in raw materials expenses which account for half of the  sales cost from the current 5 percent to a goal of 10 percent in  one to two years and additionally, to 20 percent in the future.  Domestic sales of air conditioners have fallen, and the March  1994 quarter turned to a ordinary deficit for the first time in  17 years. "If we do not undertake countermeasures for the high  yen which has become rather entrenched, we cannot expect an  improvement in earnings" (Shiro Tsukasa, manager, General Air  Conditioner Purchasing Department).    They already established a project team specializing in  overseas procurement in 1985, and are importing copper tubing  and aluminum sheets, etc., from Europe. In the future, they will  make procurement parts those with a higher degree of processing.  Beginning in May, they are scheduled to switch to procurement  from Indonesia for some of the fan motors, which are the heart  of room air conditioners. They foresee "at least a 20-percent  decrease in costs."    Matsushita Electric Works will more than double overseas  procurement from the previous quarter in the November 1994  quarter to 60 billion yen. The overseas procurement ratio for  raw materials and products accounts for 13 percent of the  purchase amount, and has been upped about 7 points. There is a  policy to increase the import of highly processed products such  as wood panels for system kitchens, and they say that "a cost  reduction of about 12 billion yen can be expected." The ordinary  profit for this quarter has increased 16 percent from the  previous quarter and is estimated to be 41 billion yen.    Director Shigetaka Ito emphasizes that "it is inevitably a  period when you divide what is necessary to make domestically  and what should be made abroad." In the future, they will make  increases centering on the lighting and building products and  materials divisions which are behind in undertaking overseas  procurement among the eight divisions, and plan to increase the  ratio occupied in the purchase amount to 25 percent in 2001.    Up until now, the Japanese manufacturing industry has been  supported by domestic subcontractor firms that handle with great  care the standards and specifications of the orderer. However,  "decreases in costs will not proceed if we adhere to the  previous method of doing things" (Tsukasa). It is necessary to  turn to concepts such as overseas procurement of parts that are  low in cost even if somewhat off-standard, and to compensate by  changes in assembly methods.    The move to overseas procurement is not just for raw  materials and parts, but is spreading to highly processed  products including finished goods. The deindustrialization of  industry is gradually proceeding along with this. The officer of  one machinery manufacturer discloses, "We want to proceed with  overseas procurement, but have not embarked upon it out of  consideration for the situation of those we do business with at  home."    The percentage of medium to small businesses in Kansai is  close to seven points higher than the national average at 59.1  percent (Ministry of International Trade and Industry  investigation, 1991) based on volume of manufacturing industry  shipments, and the effect is great insofar as it is "a  subcontractor-concentrated area." The structural high yen is  changing radically the creation of things by firms who have been  supported by subcontractor manufacturers. Director Yoshimitsu  Arakawa of the Daiwa Bank Research Institute says, "If we look  back 10 years from now, we will probably think that this high  yen was the demarcation point for a change in the economic  structure" (Atsushi Tamura, Securities Department).</p>

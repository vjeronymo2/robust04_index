An attempt is made to establish the possibility of  leptospirae identification and differentiation in a DNA-DNA  hybridization reaction. To this end, reference leptospirae  strains of 23 serological groups and commercial leptospirae  strains used for making animal leptospirosis vaccines were  examined. The conclusion is drawn that the use of DNA-DNA  hybridization may substantially expand the leptospirae  identification and differentiation test system, shorten the  study duration, and increase the number of animals examined. The  findings show that the use of molecular DNA cloning makes it  possible to obtain a genus-specific DNA probe, the pLp 41, which  is a fragment of the L. interrogans DNA of the pomoma  serotype. The DNA probe thus engineered fuses with DNA specimens  of many pathogenic leptospirae serotypes but does not fuse with  any of the known saprophytic leptospira strains, thus making it  possible to discriminate between pathogenic and saprophytic  leptospirae. No DNA specimen hybridization signals from Y.  pseudotuberculosis and other cells were recording for  bacteria with the pLp 41 DNA probe, attesting to its high  specificity.

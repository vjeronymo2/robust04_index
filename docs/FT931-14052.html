			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Discoveries triple Ecuadorean reserves FOLLOWING several oil discoveries in Ecuador's Amazon region, and new studies by the French Petroleum Institute, the country's proven reserves have almost tripled from 1.46bn barrels to 4.3bn. At the present rate of production the country's reserves will last well into the next century. The most recent discovery was in the Tiputini field in the easternmost region of Ecuador. The exploratory well Pishtingo 1 alone indicated about 237m barrels, almost equal to the estimated reserves for the Tiputini and nearby Tanacocha field together. Mr Ricardo Estrada, the executive director of Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, said it was now obvious that 'the prospects of further incrementing the petroleum reserves of the country are excellent'. In order to tap other potential reserves in the area, Petroecuador will hold another round of bidding for exploration in the near future. Before exploiting the new reserves, five more exploratory wells are planned for the area. Furthermore, 190 km of road and 300 km of pipeline need to be constructed north-west to Lago Agrio, from where the trans-Ecudadorian pipeline will transport the oil across the Andes to the Pacific ports. Petroecuador calculates that the project requires an investment of USDollars 280m over six years. The field's production time is estimated 'DISTEyears, with a maximum daily output of 45,000 barrels a day. In order to transport the heavy crude from Tiputini, it needs to be mixed with a lighter crude from the Panacocha field. Until a more efficient and economic form of transport is available Petroecuador is expected to push the development of the field while the lighter crude is still available to mix with its oil.</p>

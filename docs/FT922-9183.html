			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television Which of our current drama series does it seem likely broadcasters will want to repeat in the year 2024? The question is prompted by today's repeat of The Twilight Zone, a series of splendid fantasy and science fiction stories which began transmission in the US in 1959. Today's episode, 'The Chaser', was first broadcast in today's form in May 1960, though it was previously performed live in 'The Billy Rose Television Theatre' in 1951. Roger is madly in love with Leila, but she scarcely notices he exists. So he buys a love potion which is only too astonishingly effective. This is not one of the best episodes, but the whole series stands up remarkably well. Unhappily Channel 4 will not be screening it until 1.35 in the morning; a job for the VCR perhaps. Earlier the same channel begins a new quiz which sounds as though it might make up for the loss of 'My Music': The Music Game (8.30). Tony Slattery is in the chair but the panel does not look as though it was chosen solely for musical expertise. Happily the best impressionist of his generation makes a welcome return to BBC2 in a new series: Rory Bremner (9.00).</p>

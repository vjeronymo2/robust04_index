			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281) and </F> XINHUA reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Council's  Information Office gave a media briefing in Beijing today,  during which Jin Xin, director general of the State  Administration of Taxation, briefed Chinese and foreign  reporters about China's tax reform and fielded related questions.    According to the director general, on 1 January this year a  major structural reform became effective in China's industrial  and commercial taxes; and a new system was implemented for the  main tax categories, including value-added tax, consumption tax,  business tax, enterprise income tax, individual income tax,  resource tax, and land value-added tax. Judging from the  progress in implementing the new system over the past 10 or more  days, the transition from the old to the new taxation system has  been rather smooth.    Jin Xin particularly discussed tax reform issues concerning  enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises. He  said: The implementation of the new taxation system will not  change the provisions on tax incentives in the income tax law  for foreign-invested and foreign enterprises which went into  effect on 1 July 1991. Changes for foreign-invested and foreign  enterprises involve mainly tax categories such as the nationally  unified value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax which  are to be levied on foreign-invested enterprises and foreign  enterprises effective 1 January 1994 in accordance with a  decision adopted by the fifth meeting of the Eighth National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee.    Jin Xin pointed out: The levying of the nationally unified  value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax on  enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises is  to satisfy the requirements of establishing and developing a  socialist market economy and to equalize the tax burden; it has  also been the request of the majority of foreign-invested  enterprises and foreign enterprises. To keep foreign tax policy  successive and stable, the tax reform has followed an important  policy principle of not increasing the tax burden on enterprises  with foreign investment. This is to say that the redesigning of  tax rates will neither increase nor decrease the aggregate tax  burden. In this way, the state can be guaranteed of no decrease  in its financial revenue, and enterprises, of no additional tax  burden as a result of reform.    Jin Xin said: Due to changes in the structure of the  taxation system and in the chain of tax payers, increased or  decreased tax burdens on products and enterprises will be  unavoidable. As far as this is concerned, the state will adopt  necessary policy measures to ensure the smooth transition from  the old to the new tax system. He added: In line with the  regulations adopted by the NPC Standing Committee, enterprises  with foreign investment licensed before 31 December 1993 will be  refunded any tax burden increase resulting from the introduction  of the value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax as  approved by the tax authorities. This will be limited within  the time period of the approved contract of operation, with a  maximum period of five years. Any foreign-invested enterprises  approved after 1 January 1994 will be subject to the new tax  system.</p>

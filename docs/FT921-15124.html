			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 650,000 rights at Manx Petroleum Manx Petroleum, the oil exploration company whose shares are traded on the over the counter market, is raising a maximum Pounds 650,000 net via a 1-for-1 rights issue at 55p per share. Of the 1.34m shares to be issued, 981,124 - about 75 per cent - have already been committed. At the same time Manx announced that its board and that of Celtic Basin Oil Exploration had agreed terms for a merger. Manx already owns 40 per cent of CBOE and the balance is to be bought for shares. Manx is also to reorganise its capital structure by sub-dividing its existing ordinary shares of Pounds 1 into one ordinary of 5p and one non-voting deferred of 95p. Then, subject to the confirmation of the Court, the latter will be cancelled.</p>

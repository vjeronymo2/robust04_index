			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Inflation dashes Brazilian hopes Inflation in Brazil's new currency-in-waiting accelerated sharply in April in a blow to government hopes of containing price rises. Monthly inflation in the URV accounting unit increased nearly a percentage point to 2.62 per cent in April from 1.77 per cent in March, according to Fipe, one of the country's main research institutes. The URV, or unit of real value, was introduced in March as the first step towards the creation of a new currency, the real, which the government expects to launch in July. Government economists said prices remained volatile, and sharp swings are expected until the new currency is fully in place. They claimed some prices were falling in URV terms, but indicators had not yet registered it. Inflation is continuing to soar in underlying cruzeiro prices. Fipe said yesterday April cruzeiro inflation rose to 46.22 per cent from 41.94 per cent in March. If this rate of increase continues, Brazil will soon pass through the technical measure of hyperinflation, 50 per cent a month.</p>

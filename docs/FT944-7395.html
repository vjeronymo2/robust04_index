			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds lower Hard-hit chemicals group Courtaulds fell 15 to 425p as several analysts felt the hoped-for turnaround had yet to arrive. Rising raw material costs ensured that interim profits were down to Pounds 81m from Pounds 96m previously. UBS maintained its bearish view and bottom of the range full-year forecast of Pounds 150m, while Kleinwort Benson reduced its estimate by Pounds 10m to Pounds 155m, arguing that it was too soon to be an aggressive buyer. More enthusiasm emanated from Hoare Govett, which responded to news that Courtaulds is to raise its own prices from January and invest Pounds 90m in a plant for Tencel, the company's new fibre. Mr Martin Evans of Hoare confirmed his top of the range estimate of Pounds 170m, saying: 'The bull points far outweigh the well worn negative issues.' British Aerospace moved ahead against the market, although there was some confusion caused by the adjustment for the group's two-part rights issue. The shares closed at 434p, with the group collecting Pounds 178m for the first tier of its planned rights issue and thus - as the market saw things - ensuring that BAe can press ahead with rationalisation of its turbo-prop business. The second part of the cash call hinges on the group winning its Pounds 560m bid battle with GEC for submarine maker VSEL. GEC dipped 6 to 275p. Telecom shares were active, with BT, the most heavily traded Footsie stock, turning over 14m shares and proving the star performer in the traded options market. The stock ended 10 lower at 369p. Cable and Wireless, also a heavily traded stock option, shed 15 to 370p in 7m turnover in spite of a buy recommendation for its HK Telecom subsidiary from Salomon Brothers. Vodafone retreated 8 1/2 to 195 1/2 p as the market took stock of the bad debt charges in Tuesday's results statement. Having slipped to within a half-penny of its 182p flotation price, TeleWest Communications ended all-square at 185 1/2 p, with the shares again heavily traded between London and New York. Investors said yes to TSB following encouraging reports on mortgage lending margins from rival Abbey National on Tuesday. The shares stood out in the Footsie with a rise of a half-penny to 219 1/2 p. High street bank Lloyds, which will also be a leading player assuming that the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society deal goes through, eased 3 to 573p. Abbey National slipped 9 to 403p, with Credit Lyonnais Laing a keen seller. Paper group Bowater was one of the leading casualties in the market as it transpired that the company's meeting with its broker was less positive than previously thought. The shares fell 23 to 447p. News that BTR's chief operating officer was stepping down (although staying on the board) helped to depress sentiment at the diversified industrial group. Mr Bob Faircloth is effectively number two to chief executive Mr Alan Jackson. The shares retreated 12 to 284p in 12m turnover. Harrisons &amp; Crosfield dropped 8 per cent on a gloomy statement about disposal losses, the stock weakening 13 to 149p in very heavy trading volume for H&amp;C of 12m shares. Engineering shares with a heavy bias towards the US economy came in for stern treatment, notably Siebe, which tumbled 16 to 554p, and TI Group, down 8 at 364p. Both companies get more than 40 per cent of turnover from North America. Food retailer Argyll Group was one of a handful of stocks that bucked the poor market trend. The shares moved up 2 to 267p on an unconfirmed report that BZW had advised investors to switch into the stock and out of J. Sainsbury. Others simply attributed the rise to catching up after a period of underperformance, ahead of next week's figures. Sainsbury shares relinquished 5 at 406p. Reports of a sell note on WH Smith left the shares 8 cheaper at 462p, although Panmure Gordon was said to have advised investors to buy the stock on weakness. Shares in Granada Group resisted the market slide to close unchanged at 516p after the group reported better than anticipated figures. Full-year profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 265m and the dividend was increased by 14 per cent. One analyst said: 'The profits are of course wonderful but the cash generation policy is particularly impressive.' Many brokers upgraded profit expectations. Other statistics, Page 45</p>

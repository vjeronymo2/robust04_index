			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RSVP / ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Lauding the Johnsons: Performing arts supporters Roger and Janice Johnson were  honored by the Volunteer Center of Orange County last week when they received  its coveted Giving is Living Award.  </P> <P> Hundreds of guests squeezed into the Hyatt Regency Irvine to honor the couple.  </P> <P> Roger Johnson is on the Orange County Performing Arts Center's board of  directors. His wife is chairwoman of the Guilds of the Performing Arts Center.  </P> <P> Developer Kathryn Thompson, attending with husband Gus Owen, presented the  award to the couple whose names have become synonymous with the local  performing arts scene.  </P> <P> Janice Johnson thanked the crowd for their gift of friendship. "Many of the  people in this room have done as much, perhaps even more," she said. "Most of  the friendships I have were made doing volunteer work. Those people are as much  a part of my life as volunteering is."  </P> <P> Roger Johnson told guests that the arts were headed for challenging times. He  said he hoped people would continue to give. When giving is difficult, "that's  when it's needed most."  </P> <P> On the scene: Center chairman William Lyon with his wife, Willa Dean; Janice's  mother, Barbara Rowlands; her brother, Rick Rowlands; and the Johnsons'  children -- Mary Cantor with her husband, Michael, and Eric Johnson with his  wife, Gloria.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Banja Luka, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The army of the  Bosnian Serb republic on Monday repulsed a strong combined  Moslem attack on Brcko in the north of the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb army sources said  in a statement.    More than 100 artillery shells were fired on Bosnian Serb  positions in the area.    The Serb side repulsed a Moslem infantry attack, in which it  suffered no casualties, and the Moslems then continued to open  artillery and machine-gun fire on Serb positions, the statement  said.    The attack proves correct the increasingly frequent reports  about concentration of Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces towards  Serb positions in the valley of the river Sava, where they are  planning to cut the only land corridor between the Serb Krajina  regions in the west and the federal republic of Yugoslavia in  the east.</p>

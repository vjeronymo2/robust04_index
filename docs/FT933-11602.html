			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Eurotunnel deal Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel shot forward after stating that it had reached agreement on the completion of the work on the tunnel with TransManche Link (TML), the construction consortium on the project. The stock finished 27 ahead at 434p after strong business of 1m shares, with the stock also heavily traded in Paris. However, dealers had to wait until after the market close to hear further details about the agreement and the outlook for the company. Several stocks benefited from the positive news at Eurotunnel. These included BICC, one of the UK members of the TML consortium and a weak feature in recent sessions. The shares rallied 18 to 416p. News that the Taiwan government had formally approved Taiwan Aerospace's regional jets joint venture with British Aerospace boosted trading in the UK group. The shares advanced 13 to 422p, with volume reaching 3.3m. Analysts in London expect that the private sector in Taiwan will soon provide the rest of the necessary funding for the project. Conglomerate Williams Holdings, 4 firmer at 319p, was said to have been boosted by a recommendation from Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Among motor issues, a 'buy' recommendation from Panmure Gordon helped T. Cowie appreciate 6 1/2 to 243 1/2 p, ahead of next week's interim figures. Also recommended was Lex Service, 6 higher at 396p. Traders expect both companies to benefit from next month's UK new car registrations. The prospect of good August car sales saw Avon Rubber move ahead 11 to 505p. Shell Transport strengthened 7 1/2 to 627 1/2 p, with Kleinwort Benson reported to have urged investors to buy the stock. British Petroleum added 5 at 300p after encouraging news from its BP Exploration subsidiary about drilling in the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset. BZW moved Kingfisher from a 'buy' to a 'hold', believing the shares to be overvalued after their recent good run. The stock clung to an early gain and closed 4 ahead at 609p. Good two-way business in Sears left the stock 2 firmer at 98p after 11m shares traded. There were downgrades and rumours of more to follow in Guinness following the profits warning on Monday from LVMH. The French group, which has a 24.6 per cent cross-shareholding in Guinness, said it expected first-half profits to fall because of poor champagne sales. Kleinwort Benson chopped Pounds 27m from its current year forecast to Pounds 947m, but Guinness gained a penny at 445p. The recent bid speculation in transport container group Tiphook all but faded. The shares were left trailing the market with a retreat of 12 to 235p on substantial profit-taking. British Airways was another casualty of profit-taking following its recent run, relinquishing 2 to 327p. Improved full year figures at Stagecoach Holdings pushed the shares up 4 to 140p. Evidence of movement in the direct property market is feeding through to positive sentiment in the property sector, according to one industry specialist. Already a firm sector, it is enjoying further boosts. British Land rose 6 to 345p, Hammerson 'A' 5 to 330p and MEPC 9 to 469p. US interest was reported in General Accident, which put on 12 at 648p. Among banks, Lloyds Bank continued to be a strong feature ahead of interim figures expected on Friday. Shares in the bank climbed 15 to 582p, extending the determined recovery in the stock seen since the start of the week. Shares in Reuters, the international news and information group, had a volatile ride as the company published its interim figures. They traded strongly ahead of the announcement, which showed an improvement of 14.5 per cent in profits to Pounds 214.7m, in line with market expectations. However, an unexciting accompanying statement saw the earlier gain surrendered before confidence was restored in the last hour of trading following an upbeat meeting with analysts. The stock was finally 4 ahead at 1444p after good business of 1.7m shares.</p>

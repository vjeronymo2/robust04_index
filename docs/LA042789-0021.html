			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFI/L.A. FEST ENDS TONIGHT  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of the final screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'South'  </P> <P> Argentina/France, 1988, 117 minutes  </P> <P> 6:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  Fernando E. Solanas' great tango-tinged lament for all that was lost during  the time of Argentina's military dictatorship. This dreamy, heart-breaking and  witty film flows easily between past and present, the living and the dead, as  Solanas, returning home himself after a long exile, follows the life of a newly  released political prisoner (Miguel Angel Sola) and his friends. A superb  companion film to "Tango: The Exile of Gardel" from the maker of the landmark  "Hour of the Furnaces." RECOMMENDED KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Time running out for country's brokers - Japanese securities houses and companies turn in fresh batch of poor results / Cost-cutting needs to go deeper FOR the past year, Yamatane Securities has squabbled with Sakura Bank over a restructuring that would wrest control from the broker's traditional family managers. It was appropriate that on the day the broker reported a Y10.4bn (Dollars 93.69m) pre-tax loss, 15 of its executives announced their resignation. The Yamatane case, and a batch of generally bad results yesterday from other medium-sized brokers, suggests there is a limit to how much longer these companies will be allowed to go on reporting losses by their supporting financial institutions, be they larger brokers or banks. Although these brokers have already trimmed staff, reduced office space, and delayed spending on new computer systems, the size of the pre-tax losses suggests the cuts will have to be much deeper. The cause of the problems at the mid-sized brokers, and of the pain at the Big Four - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, and Yamaichi - is the rapid expansion of the domestic operations during the late 1980s, followed by a collapse of prices, turnover and new listings in the three years after the market peak of December 1989. Most of the brokers are confident the Nikkei index, which hit 14,309.41 in August, down from 38,915.87 in late 1989, has recovered enough to keep it in the 20,000 range this year. That expectation has prompted all of the 14 largest brokers to forecast profits, including an ambitious Y60bn at Daiwa, which reported a Y7.3bn loss for the year ended in March. The larger brokers point out that they don't have the bad-loan exposure of banks, although some houses do have a hidden exposure through the lending of their so-called non-bank financial company affiliates. However, Nomura and the other leading brokers do have the advantage of a broader range of revenue sources than the smaller brokers, which are reliant on commissions for as much as 90 per cent of their income. The most notable second-tier exception is Kokusai Securities, which has close links to Nomura, and last year reported Y13.2bn profit on its bond dealings, though it still had a pre-tax loss of Y17.4bn. Nomura's own bond trading volume rose 5 per cent, and profits on bond dealings rose 36 per cent to Y30.5bn, while a rush of straight issues late last year and early this year led to a 48 per cent increase in the amount of bonds underwritten and distributed. 'Thanks to the cuts in the official discount rate and the appreciation of the yen, bond prices rose and transaction volume increased, reversing the downward trend of the previous four years,' Nomura said. The surge in stock prices also meant the leading brokers reported lower valuation losses on their securities holdings than foreseen when the market was languishing. Nomura's loss was Y12.1bn, Daiwa's Y12.7bn, and Nikko's Y10.9bn. Yamaichi, which has now reported two successive years of huge losses, saw a 27 per cent fall in commission income. It did make a profit of Y12.3bn on its securities dealings, against an embarrassing loss of Y32.1bn in the previous year, although dealings on stocks showed a Y1.9bn loss. While Yamaichi may be the most vulnerable of the Big Four houses, there are far deeper concerns about the health of medium-sized brokers, which are struggling to keep market share and are yet to see a return of the individual investors, on whom they rely heavily for earnings. Ms Alicia Ogawa, of Salomon Brothers, said the smaller brokers' profits were 'more highly-geared to a recovery in volume on the exchange than the Big Four', but that their share of that turnover was 'tenuous'. The continuing flow of red ink at brokers such as Kankaku Securities (a pre-tax loss of Y51bn), and Wako Securities (a loss of Y22.5bn), raises the question of whether their backing banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Industrial Bank of Japan respectively, will move to strengthen their control. Only two of the 10 second-tier brokers, Tokyo Securities and Kokusai, announced dividends for the year, and all 10 houses reported sharply lower commissions and financial revenue, affected by the lowering of interest rates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RESULTS OF BIG FOUR SECURITIES FIRMS (Ym)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                         Year to      Year to                                     Mar 31 1993  Mar 31 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nomura Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Commissions                           195,835      249,023   Financial revenue                      88,957      135,897   Profit on securities dealings          29,320       14,366   Pre-tax profit                          2,376       44,101   Net profit                              3,353       31,592  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daiwa Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Commissions                           143,958      180,801   Financial revenue                      66,696      128,730   Profit on securities dealings          36,461       11,616   Pre-tax profit                         -7,266        9,309   Net profit                             -8,821      -43,514  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nikko Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Commissions                           137,309      173,107   Financial revenue                      58,494      101,606   Profit on securities dealings          34,921       13,205   Pre-tax profit                          2,532        3,142   Net profit                             -6,476      -25,865  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yamaichi Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Commissions                           126,270      172,366   Financial revenue                      50,116       91,118   Profit on securities dealings          12,340      -32,100   Pre-tax profit                        -37,360      -36,514   Net Profit                            -44,692      -53,236  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

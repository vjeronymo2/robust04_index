			<p>BFN     [Text] The export industries, which are directly affected  by the appreciation of the yen and depreciation of the dollar,  are greatly alarmed by the recent rapid rise in the yen exchange  rate. They claim that, "This is a serious situation that may  offset all our strenuous efforts at restructuring," (according  to Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel  Federation).    Yen appreciation is not only seen to affect business  performance. "We are just beginning to see partial signs of  recovery in the Japanese economy as a whole, and in automobile  sales. We have also hoped that the substantial income tax cut  would really bring about economic recovery. This will seriously  impair the signs of recovery," (according to Tatsuro Toyoda,  chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association).  Many business leaders are seriously concerned about the effects  on the economic climate and domestic consumption.    According to estimates by Yamauchi Securities' Economic  Research Institute on the adverse effects of yen appreciation,  if the yen- dollar exchange rate goes down by one yen per dollar  for a year, this will cut total profits of the 11 automakers by  30 billion yen, profits of the five computer companies by 16  billion yen, and those of the five home appliances makers by 11  billion yen.    All Japanese companies claim that "the only way out is to  cut  costs by importing manufactured goods, engaging in overseas  production and expanding overseas procurement," (according to  Hideo Hirotsu, vice president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries).  While they seem ready to take further measures to deal with yen  appreciation, most of these businesses have already been  grappling with this problem. They grumble that "this is beyond  our self-help efforts," (according to Reiichi Yumikura, chairman  of the Japan Chemical Fibers Association).    Furthermore, many point to the vicious circle of further  measures to deal with yen appreciation harming the economic  conditions and business profitability in turn. Some assert  that, "If this situation continues, it will accelerate the  hollowing-out process in the manufacturing industries,"  (according to Hajime Murata, chairman of the Japan Petrochemical  Industry Association). Others maintain that, "The prices of  internationally competitive products will have to be raised, and  as a result, this will further delay the recovery of business  profitability," (according to Yoshihiko Wakumoto, managing  director of Toshiba Corporation).    For the above reasons, the business sector is asking the  monetary authorities to "work for the stability of the exchange  rates through the cooperation of the advanced nations"  (Takeshiro Miyashita, chairman of the Japan Paper Association)  in order to stop the further appreciation of the yen and  depreciation of the dollar. It also wants the government to  take additional economic stimulation measures, and implement  steps to correct the trade imbalance as soon as possible.  Toyoda says, "We want definite measures to vigorously expand  domestic demand, such as continuing the income tax cut and  additional investment in social infrastructure."</p>

For  the first time in a long while the general public will finally  get the chance to find out whether the new Russia has a new  policy in the Near East, and if so what it is.    However, on the subject of the public, there was no  intention  of actually informing it: The visit was planned as secret. A  Foreign Ministry staffer literally flew into a rage when he  learned that information about it had nevertheless been leaked  to news agencies. Sanctions followed immediately -- press  representatives were deprived of the chance to accompany the  minister.    All the signs of preparations for a major step in the Near  East sphere have been visible of late: To begin with, First  Deputy Minister Igor Ivanov visited Tunisia and Israel, and then  Viktor Posuvalyuk, leader of the Near East and North Africa  Department, held talks with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis itself. In  Moscow Ivanov unveiled a plan for staging a new international  forum for settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, intended to  develop the principles agreed at the Madrid Conference in 1991.    This idea was greeted without particular enthusiasm by  Washington and Tel Aviv. Among other things, the Israelis are  noticeably concerned about the clear linkage between the upsurge  in diplomatic activity on the part of Moscow and the tragedy in  Hebron, which prompted increased sympathies for the  Palestinians. Yitzhaq Rabin's government fears that, while  promising to bring 'Arafat back to the negotiating table, Russia  will try to win certain concessions for the PLO, striving to win  back the authority in the Arab East which was lost in the years  of rapprochement with the West.    There is no doubt that Andrey Kozyrev will get a warm  reception in Tunis, site of PLO headquarters: The Palestinians  are still nurturing illusions, hoping for a resurrection of  Russia's regional role as a counterbalance to American  influence. By contrast, the discussion in Tel Aviv promises to  be difficult -- the degree of distrust in Israel toward Moscow,  for decades the main sponsor of Arab dictators, is very great.  Given all this, it is hard to imagine that Kozyrev's mission  can culminate in any significant results.</p>

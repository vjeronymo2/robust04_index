			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The Singapore  Government and Singapore companies are optimistic about the  economic outlook for China, and are "deeply impressed" by  China's achievements, Ker Sin Tze, minister of state for  information and the arts, said here today.    The Singapore Government and Singapore companies are also  "confident that China's policies of modernisation and growth are  irreversible," Ker, who is also the minister of state for  education, said at the official launch of the manpower training  programme for Shandong personnel.    Noting that the economic relations between China and  Singapore have progressed steadily, Ker revealed that Singapore  companies have invested nearly one billion U.S. dollars in  China, cumulatively.    In 1993, bilateral trade expanded by 25 percent to reach a  record of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars, he said, adding that in the  first two months of this year, trade between the two countries  had already exceeded 625 million U.S. dollars, or 30 percent  more than the same period of 1993.    He also said that the cooperation between Singapore and  China's Shandong Province created ample opportunities for trade  and investments, not only for the two countries, but also for  bringing in third countries like Germany into partnership to  develop the potential of Shandong Province.    The German state of Bavaria has signed a letter of intent  with Singapore and Shandong Province to explore possibilities  for greater tripartite economic cooperation.    In regard to the manpower training programme for Shandong  personnel, the minister said," It is an important component of  Singapore's economic ties with Shandong," since Singapore is  ready to share its know-how in economic management, urban  planning and public administration with China.    "Singapore's experience may be relevant to China at its  present stage of modernisation, if it is adapted to fit China's  conditions and needs," he said.</p>

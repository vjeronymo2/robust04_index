			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (8): Beyond cramming - The rise of tutorial colleges as alternatives to school In the exam, will we need to draw the curves with a ruler? That question, asked in an economics session at Davies's College near Russell Square in London, suggests that tutorial college students are more exam-orientated than most. The tutor, incidentally, said that it would be a little excessive. Tutorial colleges are odd institutions, but have built up a reliable market in the past few years. Typically based in large Georgian houses in central London, or in regional academic centres such as Oxford, Cambridge or Exeter, colleges charge high fees in return for working students hard in a relaxed environment. They do not fit standard A-level performance tables, despite their concentration on exams  - for example many students are making their second or third attempts, and may be taking only one subject  - and so have not been included in the FT-1,000. However, they do provide a distinct option for two separate markets. The first is as an alternative to school for sixth-formers reacting against school discipline. Most of them offer two-year courses, with extras to improve students' chances of reaching higher education. These may include tuition in information technology, and general studies  - although not usually the wealth of activities provided in a school. This is most attractive to students who have lost patience with boarding schools or who are faring badly at day schools. The second is for people whose A-level grades were too low the first time. Many are would-be medics who must achieve A and B grades. Others are simply aiming for grades to secure them a university place. Discipline is relaxed, but only because tutors know they can rely on parental support. At Mander Portman Woodward, in Cromwell Road, west London  - the biggest UK tutorial college  - a secretary knocks on the door of each class 10 minutes after it begins and if anyone is absent their parents are telephoned immediately. This gives tutors the confidence that their students are working, so they can use teaching methods which could seem progressive in another context. There are no restrictions on uniform  - lurid hairstyles which would not be tolerated at traditional public schools are allowed without a murmur  - and students are allowed to smoke during breaks. According to Fiona Dowding, co-principal of MPW, this gives students less to rebel against. Teaching usually involves the students and the tutor sitting around a table. Class sizes are small  - MPW limits them to seven, and Davies's to eight  - so tuition sessions are swift and intense, with students usually on first name terms with their tutors. More traditionally, there are weekly tests, and personal tutors provide advice on how pupils should plan their study. Is this 'cramming'? Dowding accepts the word to describe re-take classes. 'That's plainly what we're offering,' she says. But she denies another claim, that tutorial colleges are anti-intellectual. Even in a re-take class for history, students are bombarded with topics and asked their relevance to set questions. While it is directly linked to the exam, it is intellectually taxing, and requires genuine understanding of the subject, Dowding says. Most colleges have also diversified from re-take 'cramming'. Two-year courses are just as intense, with students plied with questions, but they are far less rigorously focused on the exam. Fees are roughly equivalent to those of boarding schools. At MPW, for example, a student taking three A-levels over two years would pay Pounds 2,887 per term  - equivalent to Pounds 17,322 for the full two-year course. This is an expensive alternative to two years in sixth form at an independent day school. Winter retakes are charged by the subject  - the exam in January will cost Pounds 1,685. For November, fees are slightly less at Pounds 1,106 per term. At Davies's, retakes cost Pounds 1,500 per subject. Choosing a tutorial college is a difficult process which often starts with recommendations from secondary school teachers. Many colleges are members of the Conference for Independent Further Education (Cife), and results are independently audited by Gabbitas Educational Consultants. These are provided in terms of grade improvement  - most colleges aim to add at least two grades to each A-level taken  - and in overall 'raw' figures. Both are sources of information for people considering a tutorial college. Gabbitas suggests a series of steps to consider. Parents should check which examination boards colleges use, as only three boards offer exams in the winter, and not in all subjects. Prospectuses also require scrutiny, as fees are not always directly comparable. Parents should also beware of pirates. Colleges with fewer than five students under the age of 16 do not need to be registered by the Department for Education. It is therefore advisable to ask if they are accredited either by Cife, or the British Accreditation Council  - if they are not, ask why.

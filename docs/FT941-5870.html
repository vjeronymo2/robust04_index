			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Ro-ro unit at Humber port to be enlarged Associated British Ports, Britain's largest ports operator, has signed a long-term agreement with DFDS Group to extend facilities for roll-on roll-off ferries at Immingham, Humberside. ABP will spend about Pounds 13m to replace the single berth used by DFDS for its service to Cuxhaven, Germany, with a new ro-ro terminal with up to four berths. The work, which is due to be completed by April 1995, will involve the excavation of 20,000 sq m at the south-west arm of the port and an increase in the terminal from 11 to 35 acres. DFDS is to concentrate its Humber links with Sweden, Denmark and Germany at the Immingham terminal early in 1995. Its Netherlands service may follow later.</p>

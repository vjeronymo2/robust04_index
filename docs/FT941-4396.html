			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Savings to be made on electricity bills An energy-saving box of electronics, that could cut electricity bills for large companies by up to 20 per cent, has been developed by London-based engineering company SML. For manufacturing companies the biggest problem is the high levels of inductive currents needed by motors and heaters. The PFC system works by converting part of this need into a demand for the less popular resistive current, which is present in the power networks, and so reduces overall demand.

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Mood darkens in Gaza's camps: Disappointed Palestinians vent their fury as peace accord deadline passes It should have been a day of celebration marking the beginning of the end of 27 years of Israeli occupation of the crowded, impoverished Gaza Strip. But instead, after Israel failed to meet yesterday's deadline under the peace accord to start withdrawing its troops, crowds of Palestinian youths vented their frustration in traditional fashion: lobbing stones and insults at heavily armed Israeli troops stationed behind barbed wire fences. In the sprawling rubbish-strewn Jabalya refugee camp, the birthplace of the Palestinian uprising, youths in sandals and black and white headscarves ran to the fences of Israel's military camp and sent burning tyres into the compound. When soldiers in helmets and bullet-proof jackets moved towards the stone-throwers and shot plastic bullets the youths clapped and whistled. 'I am not afraid to die,' said 17-year old Ahmed al-Hinawi, one of the youths taunting the soldiers and holding a large rock in his hand. 'Death is in God's will and if I die I will be a martyr.' Two blocks away residents gathered to mourn the death of a Palestinian who killed himself while training with a machine gun. Outside the concrete breeze-block home pictures of Mr George Habash, leader of a Palestinian faction opposed to the peace process, were festooned from the roof top. Yesterday was business as usual in the strip although Colonel Shuki Shichrur, deputy military commander, said the army had issued orders to the soldiers to 'be sensitive' and prevent incidents or accidents. By the end of the day three Palestinians had been killed and several wounded in separate incidents across Gaza. One was shot dead as he tried to drive a stolen ambulance booby-trapped with explosives into an army jeep. 'You can see how desperate people are,' said Mr Mansour al-Shawa, the mayor-designate of Gaza City. 'The mood is filthy. People are really upset and disappointed that the Israelis won't even stick to an agreement which gives us virtually nothing.' Mr al-Shawa said opposition to the peace process was mounting day by day. 'We thought we were on the way to regaining some of our dignity and alleviating the pressures, misery and poverty, but now people feel cheated. Many more people now are opposed to the peace. They say they prefer to live under occupation than give up all their rights.' The mood in Gaza was repeated across the occupied West Bank yesterday. In Jericho, the designated capital of future Palestinian self-government, Palestinians shut their businesses to protest against the delay in Israeli military withdrawal. In Nablus soldiers also clashed with Palestinian militants. Palestinians and Israelis have warned that extremism is bound to grow as uncertainty sets in about the future of the peace process. For the Islamic fundamentalists and the PLO factions which oppose the peace accord, the delay in implementation of troop withdrawal provided a rallying call to disaffected Palestinians. 'You see. We can never have peace with Israelis,' said Mr Hisham al-Akra, a 21-year-old student who lives with 13 other family members in a four-roomed shack in Jabalya camp. Like many in Jabalya Mr al-Akra is a refugee who yearns after his ancestral land now in Israel and who has little hope of returning home under the peace accord. 'Even if the troops leave Gaza we will continue attacking them and Yassir Arafat cannot stop that. We don't want this peace. We want to wait and continue the struggle until we are stronger to win all our rights to our land and the right of the refugees to return. 'The Israelis will never give anything. They show this every day. We will have to fight them until we kill them all or send them back to the countries they came from.' The message is one many Palestinians find distasteful. But every day of delay threatens to strengthen the hands of extremists to the long-term detriment of a peaceful transition.</p>

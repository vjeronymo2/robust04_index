			<p>BFN     [Text] President Askar Akayev believes that in the past two  years firm foundations for developing friendly relations between  Kyrgyzstan and India have been built. He said so in Bishkek on  Monday [6 June], accepting credentials from India's Ambassador  to Bishkek, Ramswaruh Mukherjee.    Akayev said he hopes that the visit to Bishkek by India's  Foreign Minister, Salman Khurshid, will help to resolve many  problems connected with bilateral agreements.    It will be a three-day visit. On Tuesday, the head of the  Indian diplomatic service will join a session of the bilateral  commission on economic cooperation. On Wednesday, he will  confer with President Akayev and other Kyrgyz leaders. On  Thursday, Salman Hurshid is expected to give a news conference.  Friday morning he will leave for Dushanbe.</p>

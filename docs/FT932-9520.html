			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Dull performance in UK behind 15% decline at Body Shop ANNUAL PRE-TAX profits from Body Shop International, the natural toiletries and cosmetics group, fell 15 per cent from Pounds 25.2m to Pounds 21.5m in the year to end-February. The decline matched forecasts, however, and the shares rose 6 1/2 p to 204 1/2 p. Despite the reduction in earnings per share from 8.8p to 7.4p, the recommended final dividend is increased from 0.92p to a recommended 1.02p, to give a total of 1.7p, up 6.25 per cent after an unchanged interim. Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman, said the rise reflected underlying confidence and showed the board's 'view of the business on more than just a one year basis'. The profit fall was attributed to lower like-for-like sales in the UK, down 6 per cent for the year after a 3 per cent fall in the first half; the Pounds 1.3m cost of moving the US headquarters, and the increase in overheads from the move to a new UK head office, production and warehouse site. Mr Roddick said a 'major operational reorganisation' would 'have a crucial effect on our future strategy'. Group turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 168.3m. However, including franchisees' retail sales, turnover was up 18 per cent to Pounds 363m. The group opened 173 shops, taking the total to 900, of which 233 (210) are in the UK. It plans another 150 in the current year, with only a few in the UK. UK operating profits fell from 16.5m to Pounds 11.2m. A new head of the UK retail business has been appointed, and more aggressive advertising is planned. In the US, profits rose from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.1m, despite the Pounds 1.3m relocation cost. Retail sales were up 53 per cent, 3 per cent in comparable stores. Mr Roddick said that Chicago and Los Angeles, cities which had each had two stores and two new ones opened, had seen sales in the older stores fall 15 to 20 per cent. But he said each city would eventually support far more shops, and this was a short term effect. Profits from elsewhere in the world rose from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 11m. Like-for-like sales growth was 6 per cent. Mr Roddick said gearing had fallen from 43 per cent to 35 per cent, as debt reduced to Pounds 28.5m at the year end. Working capital had been cut. A Dollars 45m (Pounds 29.2m) 7 year loan note had been privately placed in the US allowing the overdraft to be repaid. Capital expenditure of Pounds 20m last year would fall to Pounds 12m in the current year, he said. Spending will be on new information systems, the cosmetics manufacturing side, and in the US.

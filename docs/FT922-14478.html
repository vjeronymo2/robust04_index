			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / US Money And Credit: Hopes of instant recovery quashed MS NANCY KIMELMAN, the chief economist of the technical data division of Thomson Financial Services in Boston, offered a perspicacious comment about prospects for the US economy last Friday that should be plastered across the walls of America's myopic Treasury bond traders. 'We Americans,' said Ms Kimelman, 'are an antsy bunch. We want to be first in line; we want service immediately; we want our food pre-cooked. We also want our recessions over quickly and our recoveries to be as instant as oatmeal. Well, instant oatmeal tastes like mush] A period of stability is healthy. It's positive for the long run and healthy for the economy.' Ms Kimelman's message is much in line with the private remarks of top US bankers. Few of America's business elite expect a rapid economic recovery; most are looking for growth of only 1 to 2 per cent in the next few months and nearly all say they expect the recovery to be gradual. This commonsense perspective remains at odds with the behaviour of both the bond and equity markets. The stockmarket rallied excessively and anticipated a jet-propelled recovery in January. The bond market's behaviour in recent weeks has been erratic and inconsistent. Last week's swings and roundabouts, ending in a rally based on poor employment data, was typical of this trading pattern. Early in the week a 0.8 per cent rise in the government's index of leading economic indicators failed to move the money men because it was in line with expectations. On Wednesday traders at first took fright and sold Treasury bonds when the March index from the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) rose to 54.1 per cent from 52.4 per cent in February. But within hours the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was marked  3/4 point higher after commentators pronounced the NAPM report to be not as encouraging as it seemed, especially in the sub-index category of employment, which fell in March. On Friday, the market rallied  1/2 a point following the release of March unemployment numbers showing a meagre gain of 19,000 salaried jobs and a continued 7.3 per cent national average unemployment rate. Most economists had been expecting the non-farm employment level to have increased by 25,000 to 50,000 in March, but when the figures were released on Friday they failed to meet even these modest market expectations. Bond traders glanced at the jobs data and factored into the equation last Thursday's Federal Reserve Board numbers showing a significant contraction in key monetary aggregates in the week ended March 23. They also noted the Fed's last Open Market Committee (FOMC) in February had voted to favour a bias toward easing interest rates if necessary, and they guessed the FOMC did the same at another meeting last week. A new trend was born, with the market prepared for more inconclusive macro-economic data in April and once again hoping for an easing in rates - which is the exact opposite of its view of a fortnight ago. Ms Maria Ramirez, a close bond-watcher, summed up the situation this way: 'What a difference a few statistics make] Only two weeks ago a focal point of discussion in the market was when the Fed would tighten (rates). Now, perceptions have swung 180 degrees in the other direction to forecasts for the Fed to ease.' The benchmark 30-year bond was up  25/32 on the week, to yield 7.87 per cent last Friday at a price of 101 7/16 . This compared with a yield of 7.94 per cent a week before. At the shorter end of the market, investors flirted with two-year notes, marking them  3/4 point higher on Friday to yield 5.35 per cent at a price of 100 3/4 . The market views the short end of the market as especially cheap, which is producing a steeper yield curve as short-term interest rates fall farther than the long end. The spread between two-year and 30-year paper is about 250 basis points, reflecting the conviction that the economic recovery is weak enough and money supply growth slow enough for the Fed to consider easing rather than tightening monetary policy. This, at least, was the market mentality late last week. The trend is unlikely to change in the near future, but that by no means implies bond traders are prepared to take a broader view of the world.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                      US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                               Last   1 week   4 wks 12-month 12-month                              Friday    ago     ago    High     Low Fed Funds (weekly average)    3.75    3.50    3.50   11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills    4.04    4.09    4.12    8.29     3.76 Six-month Treasury bills      4.16    4.27    4.27    7.70     3.89 Three-month prime CDs         4.22    4.30    4.32    7.17     4.01 30-day Commercial Paper       4.15    4.25    4.27    7.12     3.90 90-day Commercial Paper       4.17    4.25    4.30    7.02     3.92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Last    Change              1 week     4 wk.

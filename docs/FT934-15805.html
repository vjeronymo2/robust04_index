			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: HK property developer rises 43% SUN HUNG KAI Properties, Hong Kong's largest property development company, yesterday announced a 43 per cent rise in net profit to HKDollars 6.69bn (USDollars 866m) for the year to June 1993, up from HKDollars 4.68bn in 1992. Profits were slightly above analysts' expectations, and were posted on turnover of HKDollars 13.5bn, up from HKDollars 10.7bn in 1992. Second-half earnings were boosted by the sale of the Kodak House building. The outlook for earnings remains positive, despite recent moves by a number of banks to curb property speculation through restrictive lending practices. The majority of developments scheduled for completion in 1994 have already been pre-sold and during the year the group acquired 18 more sites, with a gross floor area of 6.3m sq ft. Mr Walter Kwok, Sun Hung Kai's chairman, said: 'Persistent high inflation, real increases in household income and low interest rates have made property prices still acceptable to Hong Kong people. The fundamental factors supporting the property market remain favourable.' The directors recommended a final dividend of 95 cents a share, representing a full-year payout of HKDollars 1.40 a share, up from HKDollars 1.14 in 1992.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Leading Article: No revolution for British Rail IN REACHING a verdict on yesterday's white paper on the future of British Rail, it is necessary first to ask what it is trying to achieve. Anyone who had hoped for revolutionary change is likely to be disappointed. But if the goal is a better railway, then it offers - potentially - a step in the right direction. However, without further radical changes in transport policy, the white paper is unlikely to improve rail services greatly - and could even accelerate their decline. By common consensus, there is much that is wrong with BR. A long period of underinvestment in the 1970s and 1980s has left it without the equipment needed to deliver a uniformly attractive and reliable passenger service. The deficiency is especially noticeable on some of the more heavily used commuter services in London and south-east England. The problem is exacerbated by a management culture that has only recently started to grapple with the idea that BR exists for the convenience of its customers rather than its employees. Privatisation could, in theory, put this right - first, by giving the railways access to private capital for investment, and second, by leading to a radical change of culture among managers and staff. But after years of wrestling with different ways of achieving this desirable objective, the government has had to accept that, even taking into account the potential for efficiency gains, there is not enough profit to be had from Britain's railways to attract any buyers. There will be no glitzy sale of BR shares to the general public in this privatisation. Evolutionary approach The government has, instead, opted for an evolutionary approach. For the present, only the freight operations and the stations are to be offered for sale, while the railway tracks will remain under BR's ownership. Private-sector operators will be invited to introduce new services to BR's tracks, but the only significant change to BR's existing passenger services is that the private sector will be invited to bid for franchises to run them. Insofar as this counts as privatisation at all, it is a pretty watered-down version. True, the franchising arrangement offers scope for the private sector to inject that much-sought-after change in management culture, but this is about all. Depressingly, since the tracks and most of the trains will remain in BR's ownership, so will most of the responsibility for railway investment, which means it will be just as tightly constrained by the public sector borrowing requirement as ever. Substantial upgrading In practice, therefore, there is little chance that passengers will see big changes in services in the near future. Franchisees are likely to be interested in running only the few lines that have already benefited from substantial upgrading. Even here, their enthusiasm will be determined by how much money they believe they can make from a franchise, which will hang in turn on how much they have to pay for the use of BR's tracks. It is on this crucial issue of track charges that the success of rail privatisation depends. Railways are in tough competition with other transport modes, particularly roads. If would-be train operators find that railway track costs are disproportionately high, compared with the cost of using the roads, they are unlikely to see any potential for acceptable returns; and privatisation, with all its potential benefits, will fail. Indeed, there is a danger that BR will be left with the rail network and the least profitable services, while the cream is skimmed by the private sector. The Treasury would be even less willing or able to find the greater amounts then needed to finance the necessary modernisation. Nevertheless, by separating the track infrastructure from the trains, yesterday's white paper at least creates an opportunity to encourage a socially desirable transfer of traffic from road to rail, by levelling out the relative costs of access to the two. Since the government is unlikely to increase subsidies to the railways to reduce track costs, charges should be raised for road users to reflect the social costs of additional traffic, by means of a combination of higher fuel taxes and tolls on motorways. If the government fails to increase costs to road users, the rail revolution will not happen.</p>

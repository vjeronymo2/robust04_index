			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, "head of the southern </F> delegation to Cairo talks and member of the Yemeni Presidential  Council," conducted in Cairo by Sumayyah Ahmad -- date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ahmad] Now that Lakhdar  Brahimi has concluded his tour, which aimed at resolving the  Yemeni crisis, do you expect any new Security Council  resolutions? Are you moving in this direction?    [Muhammad] We feel that Sanaa has wasted the time of the UN  envoy and made Lakhdar Brahimi believe that it will accept a  cease-fire and respond to his efforts. The UN envoy, who became  certain that Sanaa continuously lies, will submit his report to  the UN secretary general. We are waiting for the Security  Council to take deterrent measures against those refusing to  implement its resolutions. We are not only exerting efforts  with our brothers in the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula, but  also with all Arab brothers and countries in the world to make  them recognize the old situation and the old entity. The  four-year old unity failed to merge it [with northern Yemen].  All merging efforts have failed. This requires new  acknowledgement of the existing situation -- North and South.    [Ahmad] There were Egyptian-Emirian and Saudi initiatives to  contain the Yemeni crisis from the beginning. What is your  assessment of these initiatives and of the statement issued by  the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] regarding the crisis?    [Muhammad] We welcomed all these mediations before and  during  the war and interacted with them out of our desire to save Yemen  from the military option. However, Sanaa did not respond to  these Egyptian and Gulf initiatives and efforts and refused to  deal with them. Therefore, we expect our Arab brothers to  support the victim of injustice. God willing, we will see this  coming. Regarding the GCC statement, the brothers tried their  best to stick to reason and dialogue. Sanaa, however, ignored  all this.    We, on our part, ask the brothers in the Gulf states, and in  the Arab states in general, to recognize us expeditiously  regardless of the military situation, because we are the owners  of rights and cause. We have a right to make our own decisions  and refuse to see tanks, a tribal chieftain, or al-Zindani  [member of the Yemeni Presidential Council] deciding our fate.    [Ahmad] Has the military situation, which is almost settled  in favor of the North, affected Arab and international  recognition of Yemen?    [Muhammad] Undoubtedly, this is true. Even if we move to  Socotra Island we will never give up. We will continue  resistance regardless of the military situation in any  governorate. The situation on the ground is not very bad.  Sanaa's attempts to end the war in three days failed and the  war has been going for more than six weeks. We will continue  resistance and make others admit the realities on the ground.    [Ahmad] How do you view the American stand, and the western  stand in general, vis-a-vis the crisis?    [Muhammad] The U.S. stand is in harmony with its steps.  Certainly, the coming days will reveal the exemplary end of this  role, because we are certain that the Americans, Europeans, and  the Arab brothers cannot allow a small Saddam to appear south of  the Arabian Peninsula.    [Ahmad] What is your assessment of the Egyptian stand  vis-a-vis the Yemeni crisis?    [Muhammad] Egypt is concerned about the situation in Yemen  on  the historical, geographical, political, security, and military  levels. Therefore, it must have a role in the crisis. I  believe there is an Egyptian role, but it takes into  consideration certain internal and external factors. Egypt is  dealing with the situation in a mature and wise way. However,  we feel that the situation in Yemen is serious, and I do not  believe that Egypt will accept a fundamentalist government in  Yemen or want to see Bab el Mandeb and the Red Sea under the  control of two fundamentalist states (Yemen and Sudan). I  believe Egypt is aware of this. Hence, we depend on the  Egyptian role and warn of the dangers of what is taking place in  Yemen. This is despite the fact that we are victims of studying  the situation thoroughly.</p>

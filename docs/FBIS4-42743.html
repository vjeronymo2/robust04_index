			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bolkestein Sees Kok as Purple </F> Coalition Leader"]    [Text] VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]  leader Bolkestein feels that PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok  should be prime minister in a "purple" coalition government  [comprising the VVD, the PvdA, and the D66 [Democrats 66]. Kok  himself and D66 leader Van Mierlo did not wish to make any  comment on the matter this morning [6 June].    Before the coalition negotiations between the PvdA, the VVD,  and the D66 could go further in the First Chamber this morning,  Bolkestein said: "I think that the present coalition, if it at  least works, will govern during the next four years under the  leadership of Mr. Kok. That seems rather obvious."    Bolkestein was reacting to the outcome of a survey carried  out last weekend by the firm Infomart ISM at the request of the  television program "Focal Point" news show which showed that 53  percent of VVD voters would have no problem with a PvdA prime  minister. In addition, 80 percent of the VVD voters support a  coalition with the PvdA and the D66. Bolkestein concluded this  morning by saying that this means that he can go ahead with the  negotiations on a coalition with the PvdA and the D66.    During a VVD congress last week, the party leader was  already  receiving the support of the VVD party officials. Bolkestein  said: "So I can go ahead, on the condition of course that the  right policy comes out of this. In any case, I do not notice  any reluctance among my supporters or my party with regard to  the negotiations currently under way."    It is expected that some links will be forged this week on  the social, economic, and financial fronts. If that is indeed  the case, then it will not be long until we have a definitive  coalition agreement. There should be no talk of ideological  differences in any of the points currently being negotiated.    The survey among VVD supporters also shows which points in  the VVD platform must, according to the VVD voters, remain in  the policy of a "purple" government. Combating crime was named  by 85 percent as being essential, while 80 percent of the VVD  voters felt that asylum policy was essential. Of the surveyed,  48 percent felt that budget cuts of 9 billion guilders were  essential and 40 percent felt that a "minimal" social security  system was needed.    Otherwise, 21 percent of the surveyed VVD supporters said  that they supported a PvdA prime minister. Of the opponents, 39  percent would prefer Bolkestein, 21 percent Van Mierlo, and 14  percent would like Wiegel back.    H. Vonhoff, the Groningen police chief and prominent VVD  supporter, expressed his surprise yesterday in the same  broadcast of "Focal Point" news show about the popularity of a  "purple" coalition among the VVD voters. He felt that the  chances were good that a "purple" coalition would be set up.  "If there is a time when such a coalition could exist, then the  chances for it over the past 25 years have not been great."  According to Vonhoff, the choice of a PvdA prime minister is a  sign of "political realism" among VVD supporters. "There is a  great deal of confidence in Bolkestein; I am convinced of that.  However, nobody is committed to the impossible, and VVD  supporters understand that quite well." He feels it is  understandable that the VVD supporters want to retain a number  of essential points. "If you win such a stunning victory on the  back of such a clear platform, then naturally you must not  distance yourself from these points."</p>

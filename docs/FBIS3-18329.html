			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Six More Italians in European </F> Parliament"]    [Text] Rome, 1 Mar (ANSA) -- The number of Italian  representatives in the European Parliament has been upped from  81 to 87 deputies thanks to an Italian law decree, which also  ushered in changes in election rules.    The law decree, which was approved by the cabinet February  21  but was only just published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE, called for  six additional Italian members in the Strasbourg Assembly in  line with a decision taken by the European Council on February  1, 1993.    The decree also ruled that political groups already present  in the Italian Parliament and in the Strasbourg Assembly must  collect signatures for the presentation of candidates in the  European Parliamentary elections scheduled for June.    Previously, groups already present in parliament were  exempted from having to gather signatures. Now, whoever wants  to be a candidate in all five of the Italian constituencies set  up for the European Parliamentary elections must collect between  150,000 and 175,000 signatures. Furthermore, in each of these  mega-constituencies, candidates must have at least between  30,000 and 35,000 signatures. Slates will not be accepted in  certain regions if the signatures gathered do not add up to at  least one-tenth of the total of signatures collected in a  particular constituency.    There are also changes affecting non-Italian community  citizens resident in Italy. They can now be included in Italian  voter lists and cast their ballots for Italian candidates and  slates in their place of residence. The only formality required  is that they file a request to do so with their local mayor up  to 90 days prior to elections.    The same option is open to Italians residing in another  European Community country, in line with EU directives.  However, those Italians who do no want to vote for foreign  parties, can cast their ballots in special polling stations that  will be set up in Italian consulate offices, cultural  institutes, schools, and the like. Even Italians who are not  resident abroad, but who find themselves temporarily in another  EU nation for work or study purposes, can vote in these  specially set-up polling stations.    The decree also allows the presentation in Italy of  candidates from other European Union countries -- as long as the  EU citizen has not lost the right to run in elections in his  native country.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / British supercomputer sale to US laboratory sparks row A TOP California weapons laboratory has sparked controversy in the US by deciding to purchase a supercomputer from the American subsidiary of Meiko Scientific, a little-known British-owned company. The US Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, in Berkeley, near San Francisco, has agreed to buy a Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.5m) supercomputer from Meiko, choosing the British-owned company's product over those of several US competitors. Supercomputers are used widely in weapons research, geological exploration and meteorology. Meiko is believed to be the only non US-owned company to sell a supercomputer to a US government laboratory for 30 years. The decision comes only two weeks after President Bill Clinton unveiled a technology policy which includes plans to boost the competitiveness of US companies by encouraging greater collaboration between industry and the national laboratories. Meiko, founded in 1985 by six computer engineers from Inmos, the innovative UK state-backed silicon chip manufacturer, has sales of about Dollars 20m a year. US supercomputer manufacturers have regarded Japanese companies as their chief competitors, and the Meiko deal has shocked industry executives who are likely to protest against the sale. US companies dominate the European supercomputer market, but the sale may raise concerns about supercomputer export controls. While the US and Japan have agreed to limit sales of supercomputers to foreign governments because the computers can be used in the development of nuclear weapons, Europe has not so far agreed to such limits. Already, Meiko's export record has been brought into question, especially a sale to Israel in 1991 which would have been forbidden to US companies. 'These are American tax dollars that shouldn't be spent in lowering our national security by pumping up a company that has a bad export record,' Mr Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, and an authority on nuclear proliferation, is quoted as saying in the New York Times. Mr David Alden, president of Meiko Scientific, denied his company has a 'bad export record'. Intel-Microsoft venture, Page 15 Politics in microchip age, Page 30</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Equity futures and options trading ACTIVITY IN the derivatives markets was said by dealers to have been the quietest for many months, with many trading houses running on half their normal staffing levels after the long August bank holiday weekend, writes Steve Thompson. The Footsie future opened at 2,311 but saw no business at that level and soon moved up to touch 2,316 before sliding back to the day's low point of 2,293 just after lunch. It rallied to end the session at 2,303. Turnover in the future was a miserable 5,429 lots. In the traded options market, total volume reached 15,060 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option attracted 6,424 deals, with one leading agency broker said to have sold 500 September 2,300 puts. One of the independent traders crossed 1,750 June 2,500 calls. James Capel was said to have carried out two exceptionally large trades in British Aerospace options just before the close of trading, with the majority of the business in the November 200 puts and 220 calls. The final turnover in Aerospace options came to 2,465 contracts, making it the most heavily traded stock option. GEC was featured by a seller of 900 November 240 contracts at 210p.</p>

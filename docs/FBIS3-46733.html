Metropolitan Police Department officials said  they have already launched an investigation into the case, in  which a large number of such passes are believed to have been  copied and put to use.    The passes for exemption from highway tolls have been issued  by the Japanese Government for the past 30 years under an  agreement with U.S. military authorities in Japan. Users of the  passes simply write down their vehicle number when passing  through toll booths and the agency later reimburses highway  administrative bodies.    The amount expended by the agency for that purpose amounts  to  some 600 million yen a year.    According to U.S. military officials, over 900 copied passes  have been found at toll booths throughout Japan.</p>

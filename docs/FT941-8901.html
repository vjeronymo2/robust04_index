			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Greece cuts Macedonia trade link in dispute over name and flag Greece said yesterday it was suspending diplomatic ties with Macedonia and would no longer permit the former Yugoslav republic to import fuel and other goods through the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, made the announcement live on television before the start of a cabinet meeting, adding that 'Greece is forced to make its position clear with specific actions'. The move came in response to domestic criticism of the Socialist government for failing to wring concessions out of Macedonia in the dispute over its name and use of an ancient Greek symbol, the Vergina star, on its flag. Yesterday European Commission officials in Brussels were holding intensive talks in an attempt to find a way of defusing the crisis. Greece currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union and its action is likely to embarrass EU partners. The Greek government was put out when the US followed EU member states in granting official recognition to Macedonia last week. The decision to deny Macedonian companies access to Thessaloniki could have a serious impact on the Macedonian economy, already hit by UN sanctions on neighbouring Serbia. Mr Papandreou is under attack from his party's radical wing for not opposing more strongly Nato's air strike ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. Mr Carolos Papoulias, foreign minister, visited Belgrade this week to reassure President Slobodan Milosevic that Greece would not weaken its relationship with Serbia. In the Macedonian capital of Skopje, the Macedonian foreign ministry said it had been informed that the Greek consulate was being closed and staff withdrawn. Mr Papandreou spoke of a decision to 'suspend the activities of its consulate in Skopje', leaving the exact status of relations uncertain. In order to answer Greek claims that Macedonia's name implies a territorial claim on the Greek province of the same name, Mr Kiro Gligorov, the Macedonian president, has offered to sign an agreement guaranteeing the border.</p>

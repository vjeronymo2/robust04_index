			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT ON TARGET  </P> <P> This response I felt was necessary on Warren Harwood's letter (Aug. 5),  commenting on "A Maturing L.A. Grows Out and In." It is pleasing to see that  there some politicians with integrity still left in our political spectrum.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, we in Los Angeles have none.  </P> <P> Harwood's answers to the quotes by our former head of the Los Angeles Planning  Commission were right on target. I would say that his sentiments would reflect  the feelings of most of us who live in suburban areas today.  </P> <P> The regrettable situation in Los Angeles is that we do not have a City Council  member who isn't directly or indirectly beholding to the purveyors of  overdevelopment. If such persons exist, let them stand up and be heard.  </P> <P> ROBERT GILBERT  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

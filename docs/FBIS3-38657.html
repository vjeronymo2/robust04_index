The main topic of  the meeting is the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Speaking  before leaving, Papoulias said he hoped that calm views prevail  during the meeting and stressed that Greece will seek a peaceful  stance on the issue and oppose military intervention. [passage  omitted]    Miltiadhis Evert, New Democracy and official opposition  leader, expressed opposition to a possible air raid. Evert left  this morning for a five-day tour of European countries. He said  air strikes will not solve the problem because they will be  followed by ground attacks, which would be insane.</p>

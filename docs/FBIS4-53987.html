			<p>BFN     [Text] Penang, May 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Asia Pacific  region will be able to prosper by putting aside differences  which obstruct progress and bringing together commonalities  which enhance harmony, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah  Badawi said. If Malaysia, with its plural society, could  succeed in forging [word indistinct] situations among its  people, there was hope that the Asia Pacific region, with its  diverse states and communities, would also be able to succeed,  he added.    Countries in the Asia Pacific region should never allow  Western nations to use the issue of human rights, democracy and  economic development as a cudgel to ensure conformity with the  new world order in the Western image, he said when opening a  conference here Sunday.    The five-day conference on Conflict Resolution in the Asian  Pacific region: Culture, Problem-Solving and Peacemaking,  organised by the Malaysian Science University, is being attended  by about 120 scholars, policy-makers and practitioners from 278  countries in the Asia Pacific region.    It is time that countries in the Asia Pacific region let no  one doubt that our future would be shaped by us and not others,  as sovereign nations, we must construct our own agenda for our  future and not allow it to be dictated by others, Abdullah said.    The Asia Pacific region was in a comfortable position to  pursue its own strategic goals that would neatly fit its  distinctive cultures, histories, circumstances and national  requirements, he said.    In this context, he added, the least Asian countries were  [word indistinct] positioned to work out and solve their  problems relating to nuclear proliferation.    As an example, he said North and South Korea, together with  China and Japan, could negotiate [words indistinct] in efforts  to resolve the current issue between North and South Korea.    Abdullah said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) member countries were already on their way towards  framing their own security agenda under the ASEAN Regional Forum  (ARF).    ASEAN could set not only the manner but also the pace with  which it would deal with peacemaking mechanisms and the  avoidance of conflict situations by relying on its own  experience and cultural tradition.    The first ARF meeting in (?Bangkok) in July would test its  relevance and usefulness, he said. He also hoped for greater  openness and readiness by the West to understand and appreciate  Eastern perspectives as the East had done on many international  issues.    Differences between Western and Eastern perspectives are in  fact reconciliable for as long as their ultimate objective  remains one of mutual respect and justice. Where there is  neither respect nor justice, there could be no peace and  violence would ensue, he said.</p>

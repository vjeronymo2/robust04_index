			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANTS' EVICTION MAY BE POSTPONED  </P> <P> The future seemed gloomy for hundreds of migrant laborers when a fire raged  through their encampment in San Diego's Rancho Penasquitos area in November.  </P> <P> Besides destroying dozens of squatter dwellings, the blaze drew considerable  attention to what is perhaps the county's largest concentration of migrant  laborers. That notoriety, prompting city pressure for a cleanup, seemed a  presage to eviction of the workers, who live illegally on private property.  </P> <P> Now, however, San Diego city officials say all sides are moving toward an  interim solution that would allow migrants to remain on the land for the  immediate future -- if basic health and safety standards are maintained. City  authorities, the landowner and migrant advocates have discussed the camp's  status in recent weeks.  </P> <P> "I think we've got to recognize that kicking people out and just having them  move into another area is not the solution," said Jack McGrory, assistant San  Diego city manager.  </P> <P> If evicted from the encampment, residents say they would relocate in another  canyon, playing out a scenario that has occurred numerous times in northern San  Diego County, where migrant camps have proliferated and a number have been  razed. At the bustling Rancho Penasquitos camp, rebuilding and a massive  cleanup continue. Residents are planning a ceremony to rename the area El  Fenix, or the Phoenix, after the mythical bird that rose from ashes.  </P> <P> "I hope this is the beginning of a lot of good things for the people living  there," said Gina Velazquez, a longtime volunteer with the fieldworker outreach  program of nearby Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church, which has provided  considerable assistance to camp residents.  </P> <P> City officials say they are working to ensure that health and safety standards  are in force on the sprawling grounds, which actually include several camps  spread over several dozen acres of rolling brush. Among other things, the city  is requiring a steady supply of drinking water, portable toilets and a trash  storage and removal system. Another requirement is that campfires be at least  15 feet from dwellings.  </P> <P> "We're talking about some minimal standards," said Michael Kemp, city deputy  director of housing inspection.  </P> <P> How the improvements will be implemented and financed remains uncertain,  although camp residents have cleaned up the site considerably and indicated a  willingness to do more. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church representatives have also  pledged assistance, as has the Rev. Rafael Martinez, who heads the  Encinitas-based North County Chaplaincy, a migrant advocacy group.  </P> <P> Both city authorities and the landowners' representative now say that eviction  of the migrants is unlikely in the near future. "I'm just going to let things  lie and be quiet for a while," said Robert Scarcia, a Carlsbad resident who,  along with his brother and brother-in-law, owns a 78-acre parcel that  encompasses most of the encampment. However, they acknowledged that any  agreement will be temporary. And workers will remain in substandard housing  amid the suburban prosperity of North County.  </P> <P> The ultimate solution -- legal, permanent housing -- remains elusive,  especially because little government money is available to build such  structures. Area employers have expressed little interest in providing housing  for their work force of migrants, who typically earn minimum wage.  </P> <P> "Obviously, there's a socioeconomic problem that has contributed to this  situation, and I don't expect that it's going to go away that quickly," said  McGrory, the assistant city manager.  </P> <P> In North County, thousands of homeless immigrant laborers live without shelter  in canyons and river bottoms. The workers, mostly Mexican men, are unable to  afford area housing. The Rancho Penasquitos encampment, in McGonigle Canyon,  just off Black Mountain Road, is one of the area's most expansive, if not its  largest, such encampment. During peak seasons, as many as 500 people live  there; most leave each morning in search of day labor, returning after work.  </P> <P> While Scarcia, the landowner, indicated that migrants would likely remain on  his property until the end of the year, he made it clear that the residents  would eventually have to leave. He has posted "No Trespassing" signs. He also  said that he would decline to sign any formal accord committing him to a lease  or any agreement making him liable for mishaps or accidents on the property.  </P> <P> "I'll cooperate with the city and the people as much as I can," said Scarcia,  who city officials and even some migrant advocates have described as reasonable  and patient. "We're all human beings. But I don't want to be taken advantage  of."  </P></p>

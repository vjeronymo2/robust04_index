			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Motor credit sales improve SUPPORT for cautious optimism in the motor trade came yesterday in statistics released by HPI, the vehicle credit information agency. Third-quarter sales of new and used vehicles bought on credit showed a recovery from steep drops in the first half of this year and the final quarter of 1991. That comes in the wake of an 8.1 per cent rise last month in total new car sales. 'It appears that interest rate cuts and low prices - particularly in the used-car market - are helping finance sales on the way to recovery,' said Dr Brian Bailey, HPI's chairman. Third-quarter sales of new cars on credit were down 1.1 per cent year-on-year ard with a fall of 12.7 per cent in the second quarter.</p>

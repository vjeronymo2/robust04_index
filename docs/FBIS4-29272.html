			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Min-pae: "Why Does the Democratic Liberal </F> Party Call For Reconsideration of the Denuclearization  Declaration on the Korean Peninsula?"]    [Text] In a statement released during a meeting of its  lawmakers and district chapter chairmen on 15 June, the  Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] demanded that "the government  reconsider the denuclearization declaration on the Korean  peninsula." This attracts the people's attention.    The DLP, as a ruling party, has called upon the government  to  reconsider the denuclearization declaration on the Korean  peninsula "only if it is not observed." It is very significant,  because the DLP, of the same family of the government, has urged  it to reconsider the declaration and to independently formulate  steps to deal with it.    This is not the first time the DLP has made such remarks.  Figures -- who believed that to play the game with Kim Il-song,  an atmosphere for negotiations will never be created if North  Korea is not cornered -- have demanded that the North-South  denuclearization declaration be reconsidered. During a  parliamentary inquiry in the meeting of National Assembly  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Yi Se-ki, chairman of the  party Policy Committee, and lawmakers Hwang Myong-su and Pak  Chong-su have also called for its reconsideration. Many  lawmakers seem to have the same feeling as the above-mentioned  lawmakers.    The reconsideration of the denuclearization declaration  means  the revision of "the denuclearization declaration on the Korean  peninsula" agreed upon by the North and South during talks in  Panmunjom on 31 December 1991. We have observed this agreement,  while North Korea has ignored it by maintaining a radiochemical  laboratory in Yongbyon and extracting plutonium from there. They  ask: How can South Korea abide by it under these circumstances?  North Korea consistently moves forward with its nuclear  development program, while the denuclearization declaration on  the Korean peninsula has only fettered our nuclear sovereignty  [haekchugwon]. They said, therefore, that its reconsideration is  indispensable.    The government's official position regarding this is that  "the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula must  be maintained." During a parliamentary inquiry last year,  Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung hinted at the  possibility of its reconsideration. He was criticized by people  after he made such remarks and, thereby, retracted them. If the  government officially decides on its position regarding the need  for its reconsideration, it will face difficulties in urging  North Korea to abandon its nuclear development program, as well  as to accept nuclear inspections. Also, big problems can be  created in relations with the United States, which has pursued  the denuclearization declaration on the Korean peninsula.    Then, why does the DLP call for it? The figures who have  called for its reconsideration said: "This is because we can  effectively use the card, the reconsideration of the  denuclearization declaration, to exert more pressure against  North Korea in dealing with Kim Il-song." In other words, this  is another card to induce North Korea to the negotiations table.    Along with this, the DLP demand includes a message to the  United States.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: TAP may cut workforce by 12% TAP-Air Portugal, the state-owned airline, could reduce its workforce by 12 per cent by the end of 1993 to cut heavy financial losses, company officials said yesterday. The officials said 1,500 of TAP's 10,500 workers were expected to leave as a result of voluntary redundancy schemes, early retirement and the cancellation of fixed-term contracts. They stressed there would be no forced dismissals. TAP, which has not been profitable since 1973, earlier forecast 1992 would be a break-even year. But officials now admit losses will soar above Es8bn (Dollars 56.4m) compared with a loss of Es2.1bn in 1992. Officials said the higher than expected losses were caused by currency factors which had affected all sources of income from ticketing to maintenance and to a fierce price war that had slashed tariffs. TAP's forecast loss is in spite of a 13 per cent increase in traffic and a rise in seat-occupancy rates. As part of its retrenchment plans, TAP did not renew the contracts of 600 temporary staff which expired in October. It will also offer early retirement deals to 835 workers who will reach the age of 55 before the end of this year. The government is preparing to privatise 49 per cent of TAP's capital in the second half of next year. Iberia, Spain's national carrier, has said it is a leading contender to purchase a large stake in TAP.</p>

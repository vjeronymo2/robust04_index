			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Paris resists timetable on liberalisation: Row over air routes The French government yesterday confirmed that it would open Orly airport to UK airlines flying from London from June 13, but said it would resist the timetable demanded by the European Commission for the liberalisation of some domestic routes. Mr Bernard Bosson, transport minister said that Orly airport, in southern Paris, would be opened to British carriers with a limit of four daily return flights per airline. From the summer of 1995, the routes will be limited to aircraft with more than 200 seats during the morning and evening peak travel periods. However, it was necessary to implement competition on a gradual basis, he said. France would appeal to the European court of Justice concerning an order by the European Commission to open the Orly-Toulouse and Orly Marseille routes by the end of the autumn. Britain welcomed the opening of Orly airport to London flights, but expressed concerns about the limits placed on the frequency of services. British Airways, which must share its allocation of four daily flights with TAT European Airlines, its French affiliate, said it would challenge the restrictions. Yesterday's announcement follows a compromise agreement between France and Britain which was reached two weeks ago and which averted a damaging showdown between British airlines and the French government. Mr Bosson said that the opening of the London-Orly route was in line with French policy and would allow cheaper air travel. The French government also stressed that French carriers must receive improved access to London's Heathrow airport as part of the compromise agreement with the British government. Air Liberte, a small French airline, however, said that the problem of access to Heathrow had not been resolved.</p>

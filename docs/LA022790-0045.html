			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CANTWELL STUDENTS ACT TO KEEP RELIGIOUS  ORDER  </P> <P> The student body of Cantwell High School in Montebello walked out of class  Monday to protest a decision by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to drop the  contract of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, a religious order that has  run the boys' school since it opened 43 years ago.  </P> <P> About 230 students left their classes and held a two-hour rally in the  gymnasium. They asked that Archbishop Roger Mahony visit the school to witness  the quality of education they receive from the Christian Brothers. Mahony  announced last week that the Christian Brothers' contract would not be renewed  and that, beginning in September, 1991, Jesuits would staff the school.  </P></p>

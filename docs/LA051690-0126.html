			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> MINIMAL RISK SEEN IN REBUILDING PIER  </P> <P> In demolishing the city pier, workers will chop hundreds of wooden planks  coated with a hazardous substance, which could minimally contaminate the  surrounding surf, according to an environmental impact report.  </P> <P> The study concludes that the threat of creosote pollution is slight, but that  it is one of several "unavoidable environmental risks" when the pier  reconstruction project begins Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Although most of the 76-year-old pier is constructed of concrete, the platform  underside and some support braces are made of wood saturated with creosote, a  black, tarlike goop once commonly used to protect telephone poles and railroad  tracks from weather.  </P> <P> As the planks are dismantled and cut, the sawdust could sully the waters below  with the hazardous, petroleum-based material, city engineer Bob Eichblatt said  Tuesday. To minimize the dust, the wood will be wetted and cut "as little as  possible," and workers who may be exposed to creosote will wear rubber gloves  and masks, the report said. The removed planks and soiled gloves will be  disposed into Bee Canyon Sanitary Landfill, a hazardous waste dump.  </P> <P> Eichblatt said that because the wooden planks are so old, the contamination  risk is minimal.  </P> <P> "There would be more of a danger, I would think, if we were dealing with  (planks) freshly covered with creosote," he said.  </P> <P> The remains of the pier's concrete, meanwhile, may be added to an artificial  reef about three miles off Bolsa Chica State Beach. City officials are studying  that proposal, which would create a haven for fish while diverting tons of  concrete from landfills. JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Komarov: "Poisonous Canned Stewed Meat"] </F>   [Text] Irkutsk residents have received two big presents:  the No. 8 trolley bus route, which links the Yubileynyy  microrayon with the city's center, has been started up, and a  family polyclinic in the Universitetskiy microrayon has opened.  These pieces of news are good. But there is also news to prick  up one's ears.    The food products certification department of the Eastern  Siberia Center of Metrology and Standardization has warned  Irkutsk residents that it is dangerous to drink Chinese vodka  with hieroglyphics on a white and red label (it contains 30  times the maximum norms of fusel oils, 10 times the maximum  norms of aldehydes, and 37 times the maximum norms of ethers),  to eat canned stewed beef from Mongolia (which is spiced with  toxic chemicals), to use tomato paste produced by the  Soyuzvneshkooptorg, or to treat oneself to Rakovaya Sheyka  Chinese candies. It is not yet know whether everyone has  followed this advice.</p>

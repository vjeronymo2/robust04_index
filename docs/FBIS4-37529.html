			<p>BFN     [Text] On the telephone to MBC today, the Sudanese Ummah  Party, through former Interior Minister Mubarak Fadil al-Mahdi,  denied the Sudanese government's accusations that al-Sadiq  al-Mahdi, leader of the party and former prime minister, was  involved in a conspiracy against President 'Umar Hasan  al-Bashir. The Sudanese authorities arrested al-Mahdi and two  of his aides on suspicion that they and foreign intelligence  agencies planned to overthrow the government.    [Begin Fadil recording] We believe the arrests were made  because the regime is besieged politically, economically, and  diplomatically. As the regime approaches the celebration of  five years in office in 10 days, it feels the earth being shaken  beneath it. It therefore decided to launch this attack on the  opposition leadership and on the biggest political bloc in a  futile attempt to obstruct the movement for change in Sudan.  The accusations and their scenario were prepared in a naive  way. Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi will emerge innocent, and we consider  this to be a malicious political and security act. This is a  political battle that we will wage against the regime until the  end. [end recording]</p>

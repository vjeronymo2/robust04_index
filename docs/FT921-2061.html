			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Greens announce radical tax plan THE GREEN party yesterday announced its radical alternative to the three main parties in an attempt to reverse its declining fortunes. It proposes a significant shift away from taxes on income to 'green' taxes aimed at cutting the amount of non-renewable energy and raw materials consumed in the economy. As part of its commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions by between 60 per cent and 80 per cent by early next century, the party wants a significant move away from the use of private cars towards public transport and bicycles. The manifesto, printed on recycled paper in two sections, was presented in the cramped offices of the London Ecological Centre by the party's new shared leadership: chairwoman Ms Sara Parkin and 'joint speakers' Ms Jean Lambert and Mr Richard Lawson, both of whom are standing for parliament. 'We know that the Greens in power can make a difference,' Ms Parkin said. 'Unlike the other political parties, this manifesto faces up to the real issues.' Mr Lawson, a GP who is fighting Weston-super-Mare, said: 'The brains of the country's political economists are malfunctioning to such an extent that they are destroying our renewable resources.' The party has just Pounds 75,000 - and no contributions so far from any company - to spend on its national campaign. But Ms Parkin was in a upbeat mood, claiming the Greens were the 'fastest-growing movement the world has ever seen'. The party will field 250 candidates, many in constituencies where there are controversial environmental issues. Green speakers yesterday rejected the suggestion by what it termed the 'grey' parties that they should urge their supporters to vote tactically rather than 'waste' votes. Ms Lambert said: 'We shall tell our supporters to vote Green.' On taxation, the party plans 'green' taxes on carbon fuel and all packaging materials, increased petrol and diesel duties and a zero value-added-tax rating for goods and services that promote sustainable development and a luxury rating on those that do the reverse.  -------------------------------- Green Party 1987  -------------------------------- Votes                 89,793 % of total votes         0.3 Seats                      0 Candidates for 1992      250  --------------------------------</p>

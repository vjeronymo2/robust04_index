			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TRANSSEXUAL CAN'T MARRY, COURT RULES  </P> <P> A transsexual actress who once appeared as a James Bond playmate has no legal  right to marry a man because she was born a boy, a European court ruled today,  upholding British law.  </P> <P> The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, said Caroline  Cossey's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had not been  breached when Britain refused to alter her birth certificate.  </P> <P> The model and actress, whose stage name is Tula, said she was "bitterly  disappointed" by the court's decision and declined further comment.  </P> <P> Cossey, 35, who appeared in "For Your Eyes Only,' had claimed her human rights  were infringed because she is not allowed under British law to change the sex  on her birth certificate. As a result, she cannot legally marry a man in  Britain.  </P> <P> Cossey, born Barry, had a sex-change operation 15 years ago.  </P></p>

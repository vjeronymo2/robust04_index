			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle chief executive leaves after 11 months MR STEPHEN Brown yesterday left Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group where he was chief executive. Mr Brown joined the company only in April 1991 as group managing director. He became chief executive in April last year, when Mr Neil Shaw split the roles of chairman and chief executive. Tate also announced other board changes. The shares fell 3p to 434p. Analysts said Mr Brown's sudden departure was embarrassing for Tate and for Mr Shaw and raised questions about management succession at Tate. Mr Brown's original appointment had suggested Tate could not find a successor to Mr Shaw internally. Mr 'Red' Wilson, who had run the group's North American businesses and had been seen as a possible successor, left in 1989, although he remains a non-executive director. Mr Shaw said yesterday that he planned to stay for at least two years and there would by then be 'a lot of candidates' to succeed him. Mr Brown, who had a three-year rolling contract on a basic salary of around Pounds 300,000, is expected to receive compensation of around Pounds 900,000. He will also have to move out of his Kensington home, which is 70 per cent-owned by Tate and 30 per cent by himself, or exercise an option to buy Tate's share. The house was bought for Pounds 900,000 last June. Mr Shaw said there had been differences over management style and Mr Brown 'didn't fit in'. There had been 'no big scene' but both sides agreed that it 'wasn't working'. He said there was a difference between an agricultural company such as Tate and a manufacturing group such as Alcan, the aluminium company, where Mr Brown worked before. He admitted that this had not been foreseen when Mr Brown was appointed two years ago. One analyst said Mr Brown 'never managed to impose himself'. Others suggested that Mr Shaw had continued to dominate decisions. However, insiders said that Mr Shaw had stepped back from day-to-day management, taken on a number of outside interests and had 'played fair'. They admitted there could have been some difference of perception between Mr Shaw and Mr Brown over the role of a chief executive. Lex, Page 18; Picture, Page 20</p>

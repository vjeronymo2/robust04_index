			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Ken and Eddie bewilder the markets: Investors are questioning the rate cut Markets do not like surprises. Tuesday's  1/4 percentage-point cut in UK base rates was decidedly unexpected and the foreign exchange markets have reacted badly. Sterling fell 2 1/2 pfennigs and one cent yesterday, closing in London at DM2.5708 and Dollars 1.4605 respectively. On a trade-weighted basis, the Bank of England's sterling index dropped from 81.5 to 80.8. The pound is now four pfennigs lower than its level before the announcement of the cut. More important than the size of the fall, however, is that sentiment towards the pound seems to have changed distinctly for the worse. The mood among international investors, particularly those in the US is said to have turned against the UK following the rate cut, with heavy selling of both gilts and the pound. The markets are unconvinced by the explanations for the cuts presented by the Treasury and the Bank of England. Although the latter's quarterly inflation report contained positive news, its conclusion was that the risks of a rise in underlying inflation were greater than those of a fall. 'If you read the inflation report, there is no justification for rates to come down,' says Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International (Europe). 'The target measure of inflation is forecast to be rising at 3 per cent two years out, in the upper half of the target range and the report says the risks are on the upside.' The size of the cut, says Mr Shepperd, is seen as 'something of a compromise' between the government and the Bank of England. As Mr Robin Aspinall of Panmure Gordon puts it, the perception is that 'Ken (Clarke) wanted  1/2 point and Eddie (George) wanted none'. Given the perceived lack of economic justification for the cut, the market has been tempted to look for a political explanation. The size and timing of the rate cut was decided last week. However, foreign exchange markets are highly cynical and some traders have undoubtedly linked the timing of the cut, albeit erroneously, to the government's political difficulties, in particular the recent death of Tory MP Stephen Milligan. Mr Tony Norfield, UK Treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, commented: 'The authorities have made a very big hash. The politics have conspired to turn the balance of market sentiment in the other direction. The surprise factor has rebounded on them. Market sentiment about their own credibility has been very much damaged.' Some fall in sterling after the announcement of the cut was probably inevitable, especially as the change came so soon after the Federal Reserve's decision to increase US interest rates by  1/4 of a point. What matters now is the extent, and the duration, of the pound's decline. Although the government does not have an exchange rate target, the value of the pound is one of the inflationary indicators monitored by the Treasury and the Bank of England. The authorities can take comfort from the fact that sterling's weakness is only retracing the ground it has recently gained. Against the D-Mark, the pound is still well above the DM2.32 it traded at a year ago and the DM2.43 it touched as recently as October. In trade-weighted terms, the Bank of England index also remains well above the 76.0 level of 12 months ago. A weaker pound brings some benefits, of course, most notably to the competitiveness of UK exporters. Indeed some see a weaker pound as the main motive for the rate cut, given that the small size of the change means it will not be passed on by building societies in the form of lower mortgage rates. Industry could certainly live with a substantially lower pound. 'On a trade-weighted basis, sterling still remains above the level recorded in the first half of November. For many companies, this is still close to the top end of the range at which they are competitive in main overseas markets,' said Mr Sudhir Junankar, associate director for economic analysis at the Confederation of British Industry. Analysts note that the outlook for sterling is much better against the D-Mark than the dollar. Figures released on Monday showing German unemployment still rising underline the economy's weakness. Economists predict that German interest rates probably still have 100 basis points to fall. Increasingly the interest rate differential should favour sterling. Against the dollar, however, there is talk of sterling falling as low as Dollars 1.35-Dollars 1.40. Mr Mark Austin, treasury strategist at Midland Global Markets, said the fact that sterling had not bounced back much, despite its large fall, suggested there was unlikely to be much recovery for the currency in the short term. The government will be unhappy if this particular cut has placed its anti-inflationary credibility in question, partly as that would limit its subsequent room for manoeuvre. The fall of sterling itself is unlikely to be a serious concern to the government, at least this far. It may even be welcome. A sustained slide in sterling would be another matter, but it is much too early to conclude that anything like that is in prospect.</p>

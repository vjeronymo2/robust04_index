			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Management: Mercedes sees the writing on the wall HOW ARE the mighty fallen. And how tough a task they face in clambering up again. They must accomplish not just a sharp shift in competitive strategy, but also - far more daunting - a complete revolution in their internal culture and organisation. If they had taken firm action in response to the clear warning signals of a decade ago, their task would have been immeasurably easier. Hard on the heels of the latest ravages at IBM, Mercedes-Benz last week emerged with its famous star firmly in the mire. Thanks to the recent but entirely predictable appearance of much cheaper high-quality Japanese products at the luxury end of the car market, its overpriced, overweight models are piling up unsold on both sides of the Atlantic. Rubbing salt into the wound, its great German rival, BMW, is faring far less badly. In most respects, including its leadership, Mercedes's troubles are several steps short of IBM's. But in some ways it faces a tougher challenge. Everyone at IBM is affected by the threat to its existence, whether they are from design, engineering, marketing or finance. But the Mercedes problem is rooted in the overwhelming dominance of one discipline, engineering. So its cultural revolution will need to be bloodier. Mercedes is also less advanced than IBM in confronting a core problem: the time it takes to bring new products to market. Whereas IBM has done much in the past decade to compress its development cycle through 'simultaneous engineering' and other processes, Mercedes has started only recently. Japanese car-makers have been able to develop a car, and then its successor, in the time Mercedes has taken to launch just one model. If the company had not been so arrogant, it would have realised the need for change almost 10 years ago. It has always focused, with time-consuming thoroughness and care, on belt-and-braces engineering: producing cars that were tank-like in their solidity, outlasted almost every other make, and cost the earth. This was fine so long as such quality-based 'differentiation' could only be bought at high cost. But, as they have done so often, the Japanese changed the rules of the game. They made what academics call 'differentiation at low cost' an entirely feasible strategy. This reached its clearest fulfilment in 1989 when Toyota and Nissan made their first direct challenge to the Mercedes stable with the launch of Lexus and Infiniti. The failure of Mercedes to anticipate this threat was entirely its own fault. Moreover, if it had been less inward-looking, it would have noticed in 1984 the first evidence of the radical compression of product development cycles which has since swept through its industry. Moving swiftly from the bottom to the middle of the volume car business, the Japanese shrank the 'time-to-market' for a 'compact' (family-sized) car by the late 1980s to three-and-a-half years, compared with the European and US average of five. Yet only in the wake of the influential late-1980s study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology of Japanese 'lean manufacturing' did Mercedes realise it had to rethink its whole approach. It conceded this in public only last week, when its in-coming chief executive, Helmut Werner, implied that its cars were over-engineered and too expensive. To remedy this, he said the company was taking the radical step - for it - of moving to a product-development process based on 'target costing'. This is a variant of a notorious but powerful Japanese approach which used to be known as 'market share pricing'. Instead of working on an ultra-generous cost-plus basis, Mercedes will now derive its target product costs, right down to each part, from competitive market prices. The reaction of one experienced international consultant to this news was to emit a deep belly laugh, followed by the expostulation 'about time]'. Though a highly refined technique of 'target costing' has emerged only since the late 1980s, the principle underlying it - like the term itself - has been applied for more than two decades in most consumer product industries. That includes Ford and other western carmakers. A key design goal for one of the new Japanese luxury models was 'make a 7-Series BMW for a 5-Series price'. Recent advances under the broad banner of target costing include the use of sensitive techniques such as 'co-variant analysis' to determine the sort of value which customers will place on individual features, or clusters of them. The methodology has also been adapted to include a company's suppliers. Chrysler has used it recently to particular effect. For Mercedes to adopt such an approach represents an even greater challenge than meets the eye. This is because of a phenomenon which Kevin Jones, a partner at Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, the management consultancy, calls 'the rational overhead': that most of the time taken to develop a product is spent not on actual development work, but trying to convince everyone involved that each decision is correct. For Mercedes, one of the key challenges of target costing will be how to introduce such a detailed technique without - in instinctively rigorous fashion - increasing the complexity and time of its development cycle still further. The only way to cope with this, Jones advises, will be to limit the number of variables that it scrutinises on each new model. For a Germanic company which will want constantly to challenge the details and cost of every part, that is an almost unthinkable revolution. But, like the other challenges which Mercedes is confronting, it is a matter of do or die.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: WHAT'S IN STARS FOR MEDIA STARS? TRY A WILD GUESS;  </P> <P> MEDIA  </P> <P> Former Channel 39 sports guy Al Janis asked what may have been the unwisest  question of 1988. Frustrated with all the changes at the station, Janis went to  his boss and demanded to know whether he was going to be kept around after the  transition period.  </P> <P> "Well, Al, now that you mention it . . . " was the reply, and Al went back to  clean out his desk.  </P> <P> The moral: Don't ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer.  </P> <P> This is a strong argument for ignoring the urge to speculate about the year  ahead. Perhaps we're better off taking the experiential approach, blissfully  letting events sweep over us.  </P> <P> But that would be no fun. As a great philosopher once said, speculation is the  spice of life (or something like that).  </P> <P> Certainly it is fair to speculate that KFMB-TV (Channel 8) viewers will be  seeing more of anchorwoman Andrea Naversen in the next year. She has that  professional, easy-to-look-at, Ice Queen-look, popularized locally by Bree  Walker. The Ice Queen-look is apparently "in," so there is no doubt Naversen  will be working her way up the Channel 8 ladder of success, especially since  current No. 1 anchor Allison Ross' relationship with the station is rumored to  resemble that of the Bundy family on "Married . . . With Children."  </P> <P> Over at Channel 39, viewers certainly will be seeing a lot more of former  newspaperman Bill Ritter, who is becoming the station's designated hitter, the  epitome of Channel 39's attempt to build a hard-news image. Now that Ritter has  mastered the intricacies of television news -- his hair and makeup look great  -- he is on the Channel 39 fast track.  </P> <P> Also watch for more of Dave Bender at Channel 39. Bender reeks of perkiness. He  is perky enough to be a poster child for a campaign to ban caffeine. Bender's  perky weather reports and perky puff features are already starting to get more  play, especially since semi-perky weatherman Brian Hackney recently said a  short goodby.  </P> <P> And speaking of people born to smile 'til it hurts, 1989 will be a big year for  Bill Griffith and the folks at Channel 10's "InSide San Diego." When Channel 10  started the show, station officials said they were going to give it at least a  year to build an audience. The year is up in June, and, following standard  television operating practice, Channel 10 probably will either can the  chat-fest, fire the hosts or make it a semi-permanent part of the station's  schedule.  </P> <P> The year ahead also will be crucial to Larry Himmel, who probably will get a  chance to take his new Channel 39 show weekly, and for XTRA-AM (690), which is  trying to establish its news-talk format amid a general "who cares" sentiment  among radio listeners.  </P> <P> Also in the "who cares" department, KSWV-FM (102.9) will continue its attempt  to convince people that modern elevator music is "The Wave" of the future.  After an initial ratings flourish, listeners throughout the country have been  opting to pass on "The Wave." The hiring of disc jockey Art Good, local radio's  answer to Sleep-eze, is unlikely to revive the local version.  </P> <P> Of course, all this is simply speculation, similar to these predictions for the  New Year:  </P> <P> * Channel 8 weatherman Larry Mendte will be asked to host "The Gong Show," but  he'll turn it down to take a job in the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> * Channel 10 will rename its 5 p.m. broadcast "ZooNews," and reporter Margaret  Radford will win an Emmy for a poignant and moving feature entitled "Your  Friend the Giraffe."  </P> <P> * Frustrated by lack of interest in his new television show, former mayor Roger  Hedgecock will form a traveling nude mud-wrestling troupe, featuring himself as  the ringmaster.  </P> <P> * Channel 10's Kimberly Hunt, impressed with the hair dye-jobs of fellow  broadcasters Jerry G. Bishop and Mitch Duncan -- and tired of being called a  blonde bimbo by local radio personalities -- will decide to dye her hair  purple. She also will legally change her name to "Babycakes."  </P> <P> * Channel 39 sports guy Bobby Estill will quit to become the new sports  columnist for GQ magazine. He'll be fired when he refuses to wear socks.  </P> <P> Remember, you heard it here first.  </P> <P> Friday was the last day of local radio traffic reports from the Automobile Club  of Southern California, the second traffic report service to fold since the  national Metro Traffic service moved into San Diego a few months ago. "The  service was no longer unique, so we decided to place the resources elsewhere,"  Auto Club assistant district director Bill Schurmer said. Metro will pick up  several of the Auto Club's contracts, but local traffic reporter Jon Hoffman  has landed the gig with KKLQ-FM (Q106) and KNSD-TV (Channel 39). . . . KSDO-AM  (1130) afternoon talk-show host Stacy Taylor has been one of Kimberly Hunt's  main tormentors. Friday afternoon, Hunt will be a guest on his show. Meanwhile,  Michael Tuck will be a guest on Gloria Penner's KPBS-TV (Channel 15) talk show,  6:30 p.m., Sunday. It will mark the start of Penner's fifth year. . . .  </P> <P> It must be nice to be editor of your own paper. Not only did the Tribune do a  massive puff piece on editor Neil Morgan a couple of weeks ago, but last week  Morgan managed to get a Page 1 photo credit for a photo of his own mountain  cabin. And, in Friday's column, he sneaked in a plug for his wife's cover story  in the January issue of Travel &amp; Leisure.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The issuing of certificates, which are very closely  linked to the customs union between the Czech and Slovak  Republics, has political aspects, too, although the economic  aspects prevail.    This is what Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said in  connection with the problem surrounding certificates required  for foodstuffs imported from the Czech Republic into Slovakia.  At the same time, he said that what is important is that the  two sides have a political interest in preserving mutual  cooperation and mutual links at least at the present level. He  did not rule out the possibility, however, that the current  cooperation in this form could cease to be convenient for either  side.</p>

Electoral  material was destroyed or stolen at 60 tables. Electoral  organization officials were able to overcome most of these  problems throughout the day.    [General Octavio Vargas, police director] The outcome is  very  satisfactory. There were a few incidents, such as in the  Departments of Sucre, Arauca, and Santander, but the public  force took care of them. [end recording]</p>

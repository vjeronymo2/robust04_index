			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL LOOK IN BUSINESS PROGRAM  </P> <P> The city's civic, business and education leaders have started a program  designed to make Irvine a greater force in international business and help  local entrepreneurs tap overseas markets.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take the brightest porch light on the block to see that this  community is developing an international character," Mayor Larry Agran said  after a Wednesday conference at the city's civic center.  </P> <P> Agran said one-fourth of the industrial development in Irvine has been sold to  foreign nationals. He added that a recent survey showed that between 500 and  600 businesses in the community have international ties or are interested in  establishing such connections.  </P> <P> Yogi Sharma, a yoga master and adviser to the mayor on international affairs,  said he has already received inquiries from India about investment in Irvine.  </P> <P> "More than half the people here are doing business with other countries," he  said of the others attending the conference. "We should do something about it  to help our local businesses."  </P> <P> City leaders claim that Irvine is different from other communities interested  in investment abroad. Since Irvine has no aging industrial or urban base that  needs to be redeveloped, the city can focus on economic expansion and  diversification.  </P> <P> "The bottom line, real simply, is that international business is here to stay,"  said Larry Larsen, the city's officer for international affairs. "If Irvine is  interested in having a growing economic environment, we ought to focus more  attention on helping businesses position themselves in the global marketplace."  </P> <P> Under a plan developed by the city and King International Group, a consultant,  the city would have a full-time coordinator of international affairs and a  consortium would be established to contribute to the community's international  economic development efforts.  </P> <P> The program would be paid for by the businesses involved and should ultimately  cost the public nothing, Agran said.  </P> <P> The plan is set to come before the Irvine City Council in six to eight weeks.  "In creating this kind of specific consortium with a clear mission, the  opportunities are limitless," Agran said. DANICA KIRKA  </P></p>

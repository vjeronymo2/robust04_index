			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dakar, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Leaders from 14 African  nations resumed talks here Tuesday afternoon on the issue of the  value of the CFA franc, in the wake of an indication by  authoritative sources that they had agreed in principle on a  devaluation.    The participants took a lunch break on Tuesday, but then  reconvened at 1500 GMT in a closed-door session -- which was not  attended by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Michel Roussin, French  cooperation minister. The two men had met separately Tuesday  morning with the African leaders.    The authoritative sources had reported that the  participating  countries had agreed in principle late Monday to a devaluation  of their common currency, the CFA franc, but had reached no  formal accord. They said the participants had endorsed the idea  of a 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc, a largely West  African currency pegged to the French franc.    Authoritative sources said later that the continuation of  the  Dakar summit meeting was to be explained by the difficulty of  reaching agreement between the participating countries and aid  donors on measures that should accompany a devaluation.    They said that a uniform rate of devaluation would be  adopted  for the 14 countries in the Franc Zone, on the order of 50  percent, but the funds for providing compensation would be  shared out depending on each country's specific needs. The  total amount might be on the order of two billion dollars, one  Western source said in Dakar.    In another development, French businessman Pierre Castel,  chairman of Castel Freres, which supplies most of  French-speaking Africa with beer, protested strongly against a  possible CFA franc devaluation -- which he said would have  "dramatic" consequences both for Africa and for his group.    He said "A 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc would  force us to hike the price of our beer by around 40 percent.  And if African salaries don't go up, we will lose half of our  sales, and have to make layoffs".</p>

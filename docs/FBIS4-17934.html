			<p>BFN     [Text] The issue of the possibility for the Latvian and  Russian presidents to meet will, to a great extent, be decided  at the meeting of experts of the Latvian-Russian interstate  talks in Jurmala, Aivars Vovers, the deputy head of the Latvian  delegation, told reporters today during the talks between the  experts. Vovers explained that during the experts' talks the  main attention was paid to an additional protocol to the  agreement on the discharged Russian military personnel  initialled on 15 March, the draft of which Latvia submitted on  Tuesday [26 April].    The draft protocol provides for the possibility of  repatriation of the discharged Russian military personnel who  wish to return to Russia, as well as setting up a repatriation  fund. The Russian experts have agreed to the idea of such a  fund. However, the standpoints of the two sides are  controversial on many points of the additional protocol, Vovers  said.    The Russian side has submitted a list of approximately 150  military who were discharged by 28 January 1992 but have not  carried out all the corresponding formalities until now as a  supplement to the above-mentioned agreement.    According to the initialled agreement, in the event of  signing the list [as heard] these people will have the right to  remain in Latvia, Vovers explained. He added that to tackle  repatriation problems the Latvian side would need the list of  all the discharged Russian military living in Latvia.    Sergey Zotov, the head of the Russian delegation, who today  discussed these problems with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs, for his part expressed the view that the talks were  very difficult because the Latvian side shows excessive  stubbornness and does not wish to unilaterally give in on  several issues.</p>

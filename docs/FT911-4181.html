			<p>910420 FT  20 APR 91 / Books: Crime A LITTLE Gentle Sleuthing by Betty Rowlands (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 11.95. 269 pages) is a first novel by a clearly gifted and knowledgeable writer. The book is not without its flaws - a few too many red herrings - but it is never less than engaging and readable. Familiar situation: city woman, on her own takes a country cottage to lead a new and quiet life. Well, you can imagine how quiet that life proves to be. The rural sitting is generously and effectively described, and there is a good assortment of minor characters. Make a note of the name: Betty Rowlands.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / International Company News: Japanese steelmakers cut capital spending Two of Japan's leading steel companies announced large cuts in capital spending for the current fiscal year. Nippon Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, said it would cut capital spending by 24 per cent to Y130bn (Dollars 1.26bn) because of a lack of large investment projects. The level of capital spending targeted by Nippon Steel is the lowest since the company suffered weak demand amid a sharp fall in economic activity in the late 1980s due to the yen's sharp rise against the dollar. The reduction is part of a restructuring plan at Nippon Steel, which aims to restrict its capital spending to Y340bn over the next three years. As a result, capital spending in fiscal 1995 and 1996 is expected to be even lower than this year's. Kobe Steel also announced plans to reduce capital spending by 42 per cent this year to Y60bn from a previous Y103bn. 'As most of (the planned) large scale investments for reorganising the production systems to increase competitiveness have been completed, capital expenditure is being controlled to reduce fixed costs,' Kobe said. Both Nippon Steel and Kobe Steel are expected to have incurred losses in the year to March 1994, and Kobe Steel is passing its dividend.</p>

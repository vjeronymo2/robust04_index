			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APARTHEID MAY DIE A PEACEFUL DEATH;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: A COMMITMENT TO DIALOGUE, HOWEVER FRAGILE AND UNCERTAIN, SEEMS TO  BE EMERGING. WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO NOURISH AND ENCOURAGE IT.  </P> <P> Although overshadowed by events in Eastern Europe, the political climate in  South Africa, too, is undergoing significant change. South Africans, black and  white, are shaking off old assumptions and rigidities and contemplating fresh  approaches to differences that seemed irreconcilable even a year ago. The  evolving process is still fragile and uncertain, but there is new hope on all  sides that it may yet prove possible to reach agreement on a peaceful  transition to a non-racial, democratic society in South Africa.  </P> <P> Last summer's meeting between then-President Pieter W. Botha and Nelson  Mandela, imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, was a signal of  the South African government's recognition that the country's future cannot be  settled unless there is dialogue with credible opposition leaders. Internal and  external pressures, among which sanctions are only one element, have helped  persuade South African leaders that the well-being of the white minority cannot  be sustained without a negotiated political settlement that results in  political equality for all South Africans.  </P> <P> Claiming a mandate for change after last fall's elections, President Frederik  W. de Klerk has taken a number of encouraging steps to get this process under  way. He has permitted peaceful anti-apartheid demonstrations and rallies, freed  leading political prisoners, announced plans to discard the Separate Amenities  Act, scaled down the state security apparatus and met with credible black  leaders, including Mandela. It is premature to predict whether these steps will  lead to a continuing dialogue, but they constitute tangible evidence that  things are changing, and they offer reason for hope.  </P> <P> The United States has long regarded dialogue among all South Africans as the  most important first step in the process of change. Moves that would further  enhance prospects for dialogue include: an end to violence on all sides; the  release of all political prisoners, including Mandela; the lifting of the state  of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity and freedom of  association for the black opposition, and the unbanning of all political  organizations, including the African National Congress.  </P> <P> U.S. policy toward South Africa is guided by five basic principles:  </P> <P>  -- Unequivocal opposition to apartheid;  </P> <P>  -- Commitment to building a post-apartheid democratic South Africa through  assistance to black South Africans;  </P> <P>  -- Active U.S. diplomacy to resolve conflicts and support economic development  throughout southern Africa;  </P> <P>  -- Cooperation with our allies and other concerned nations in a multilateral  approach to South Africa;  </P> <P>  -- Maintenance of a bipartisan consensus with Congress on our general approach  to the region.  </P> <P> For its part, the anti-apartheid movement must look beyond the rhetoric of the  past to find creative ways of responding to the unexpected opportunities that  may now be arising. Anti-apartheid activists should work to achieve consensus  among diverse and often hostile opposition elements, and to formulate  constructive principles for the negotiating process that may be emerging. There  are signs that such an effort, with the support of the international community,  is already beginning.  </P> <P> The ANC has indicated that it is taking the possibility of dialogue seriously.  Its expressed preference for the path of negotiated and peaceful settlement was  endorsed in 1989 by the Organization of African Unity. The consensus  declaration adopted at the conclusion of the United Nations special session on  apartheid Dec. 14 not only urged the people of South Africa to join together to  negotiate an end to apartheid; it also postulated fundamental principles that  could constitute the basis for an internationally acceptable solution in South  Africa.  </P> <P> Clearly, a non-racial, democratic South Africa is not yet at hand. While their  overall numbers have diminished, political detainees, including Nelson Mandela,  are still in custody, the state of emergency remains in effect and  black-on-black violence has not abated. But there is a growing sense that the  majority of South Africans of all races may be ready to seize this opportunity  to break out of the isolation imposed by apartheid and rejoin the international  community of free nations.  </P> <P> The United States stands ready, through contact with all parties, to do  everything possible to promote this process. And we hope that negotiations and  peaceful change, as called for in the recent U.N. declaration, will become the  norm for the international community's approach to South Africa.  </P></p>

These articles as well as the  fifth anniversary of the vessel's loss which was observed  attracted attention not just among the public but even in the  departments whose sluggishness has almost caused the process of  immobilizing the ship to break down.    The main administration of the RF Ministry for  Emergency Situations (MinChS), which was responsible for  organizing the expedition to the site of the "Komsomolets's"  loss, hastily began to put together cadres. The first 300  million rubles [R], perhaps not a large amount but even so  perfectly real money, was allocated in early April to prepare  the expedition.    But it is still too early to put the story of the  "Komsomolets" to rest.  <H5>  A Problem Which Does Not Exist? </H5>   In early April 1994, a number of mass information media all  at once, each claiming to have been the first to receive the  exclusive information, at first alluding to "a responsible  employee of one of the ministries who asked to remain anonymous"  and then directly indicating official sources in the MinChS,  circulated a report entitled "Expert Analysis of the Condition  and Prediction of Long-term Radioecological Consequences of the  Accident and Location of the Atomic Submarine `Komsomolets' on  the Bottom of the Norwegian Sea." This document, which was part  of the material of the 33rd volume of the archives of the former  Committee for Conducting Special Underwater Tasks (KOPRON), was  presented as a secret one, and thus had been inaccessible to  journalists and the public. In addition to the technical data on  the "Komsomolets's" condition, it cited the calculations of a  number of experts regarding the probable development of a  radioecological situation near the sunken vessel. In their  calculations, the authors came to the conclusion that even if  the plutonium from the warheads of the torpedoes was washed out,  no more than 30-400 square kilometers of the bottom would be  contaminated and the radiation doses on the distant borders  would be "very negligible." On that basis the conclusion was  drawn that given "the absence of economic damages from the  atomic submarine's being there in its sunken state for a long  time," there was no need to "conduct expensive work to seal off  the reactor bay and the torpedo tubes." And so the developers of  the document proposed abandoning any work on the "Komsomolets"  at all, limiting it to nothing but radioecological monitoring at  the site where the vessel had sunk to "lessen the  social-psychological and political tension surrounding this  problem."    The report which made its way from the depths of the MinChS  to the press served as a basis for the publication of almost  sensational materials on the day of the fifth anniversary of the  loss of the "Komsomolets." According to them, the vessel which  sank in the Norwegian Sea does not pose any realistic danger and  the threats related to it are strongly exaggerated. But the fuss  raised by the mass information media concerning the vessel  forced the MinChS to declassify the report, it became clear. At  the same time, it was alleged that there was no problem of the  "Komsomolets" as such and there was no reason to upset the  population about it.  <H5>  The `Secret' of Volume 33 </H5>   The truth that the most plausible lie is a half truth is as  old as the world but no less true because of that. A half truth  can be created by putting forward certain facts and hiding  others. It is precisely this device which the authors of the  premeditated information leak used by releasing the "secret"  document to the press. But the facts cited in it are only a part  of the truth. The other, which was concealed from journalists  but is undoubtedly familiar to the MinChS leadership, is that  practically right after its appearance in 1993, the report with  such a favorable prognosis was sent for an expert study at the  All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental  Physics (VNIIEF). Its results dispelled the unfounded optimism.  In verifying the methodology of the calculations, it turned out  that the authors began from false premises by significantly  exaggerating the speed at which the plutonium would dissolve and  separate out in sea water. The underwater currents which  increase the contamination spot to 100-1,000 kilometers and a  whole number of other factors were not taken into account. In a  review signed by S. Voronin, the chief designer of VNIIEF, Yu.  Trutnev, the first deputy scientific manager, and other  specialists of the institute, the calculations cited were  declared wrong and inadequately substantiated, while the  conclusions on the need to abandon work to prevent radionuclides  from getting into the surrounding sea were found to be  "premature." The need to immobilize the vessel's nuclear  ammunition as quickly as possible was confirmed once again. The  document subjected to an expert study was sent to the archives,  while KOPRON, which still existed at that time, began to make  preparations for an expedition to immobilize the corroding  warheads of the nuclear torpedoes in the summer of 1994.    But the rejected finding did not lie in the archives for  long. In January 1994, KOPRON was disbanded and its functions  transferred to MinChS, which was created then and for a long  time forgot about the "Komsomolets's" existence. But after the  articles published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, the MinChS was  immediately required to justify its inaction which put the  expedition to the Norwegian Sea on the verge of failure and the  long-ago report issued to journalists as the "secret of Volume  33" was brought to light. For greater persuasiveness, its  materials were accompanied with the classifications DSP [For  Official Use] and "Top Secret" [as published]. The logic of the  authors of the artificial information leak was simple: Since  there was no unanimous opinion regarding the degree of danger  related to the "Komsomolets" even among experts, it was hardly  worthwhile to hold the MinChS leadership responsible for  stopping work in this direction.  <H5>  The Specialists' Unanimity </H5>   In fact there is no disagreement among serious scientists  and  specialists regarding further actions with the "Komsomolets,"  and there never has been. All of them, and the KOPRON materials  have as many documents which confirm this as you might want,  favor immobilizing the vessel's destroyed nuclear ammunition as  quickly as possible. Here are the opinions of certain highly  respected experts.    Academician N. Laverov, vice president of the Russian  Academy of Sciences: "After reviewing the materials  presented for the expert study on the issues of eliminating the  consequences of the accident on the `Komsomolets'  nuclear-powered vessel, the Russian Academy of Sciences deems it  necessary... in 1994 to work to seal off torpedo tubes Nos 5 and  6, which contain nuclear ammunition."    Yu. Vishnevskiy, chairman of Gosatomnadzor Rossii  [Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation  Security]: "We consider it necessary to develop technology  and carry out the operations work to seal off the nuclear  ammunition in order to prevent the plutonium compounds from  spreading into the environment."    S. Grigorov, chief of the RF Ministry of Defense  Administration of Ecology and Special Safety Equipment: "In  order to eliminate the radiation leak of plutonium from the two  destroyed nuclear warheads... we consider it necessary... to  seal off their internal spaces and the nuclear-powered vessel's  forward end as a whole."    V. Konovalov, the RF first deputy minister of atomic energy,  F. Gromov, the commander in chief of the Navy, and A. Pogodin,  the RF first deputy minister of protection of the environment  and natural resources, gave similar conclusions. It is worth  mentioning here that the specialists' assessments cited were  delivered in September-October 1993, even before a new form of  existence of plutonium in the form of suspended particles,  macrosols, was found in the water samples taken at the site of  the accident, and they made the radiation situation near the  vessel even more menacing.    All these expert opinions were placed in the last, newest  volumes of KOPRON archives, which total 82 volumes. In  accordance with the edict of the president of Russia on  declassifying ecological information, the documentation kept in  it was never closed and, at least before being handed over to  the MinChS, remained accessible not only to specialists but to  interested journalists as well. Of the thousand documents  contained in the archives, only a few bore the classification  "For Official Use," which, considering the former top secret  treatment of the "Komsomolets," was perfectly explicable. So one  must certainly not speak of the "secrets" of Volume No 33 and  other volumes of the KOPRON archives. Incidentally, the MinChS  leadership might not have even known that, and it was for that  reason that they began to leak information which was not in  keeping with reality, holding back the findings which refuted  their conclusions.  <H5>  A Latent Danger </H5>   Another myth created to justify the uselessness of rendering  the "Komsomolets" harmless was the allegation that its nuclear  filling was too small to do any substantial harm to the  environment. To support this, statistics which say that as a  result of testing Soviet nuclear weapons alone, 54,000 curie of  strontium-90 and cesium-137 fell into the waters of the Barents  Sea, while radioactive waste whose total radioactivity exceeds  the "Komsomolets's" "baggage" by a factor of 10 has been sunk in  the seas and oceans.    The inaccuracy of such comparisons is that they are talking  of altogether different elements. Cesium and strontium, which  are formed as a result of nuclear explosions and the operation  of atomic reactors, are classified as so-called short-lived  elements. Their half-life does not exceed a few years and in  dispersing into the atmosphere over enormous expanses of ocean  or slowly seeping out from rusting tanks, they are incapable of  resulting in any marked increase in the radiation background.  The plutonium contained in the nuclear ammunition of the  "Komsomolets" is something else. Its half-life is 24,000 years.  Besides, plutonium is classified as an extremely toxic  substance, 10,000 times more toxic than arsenic. So getting into  sea water, it represents an enormous danger. Even if the  "Komsomolets's" filling is compared with the discharges  resulting from nuclear weapons experiments, according to expert  calculations only 100 curie of plutonium ended up in the Barents  Sea during the entire time the experiments were conducted on  Novaya Zemlya. But the vessel's torpedoes contain 4 times as  much--430 curie. A blowout of them during a short time in one  place can lead to truly catastrophic consequences.    But the danger related to plutonium by no means stops there.  As everyone knows, this element does not have beta and gamma ray  activity. And it takes several months to identify its inherent  alpha ray activity using existing instruments. This means that  it will be impossible to efficiently monitor the level of  radioactive contamination of the Norwegian Sea and the fish  swimming in it. A device which could do this, unlike any other  in the world, is just now being developed by the specialists of  Arzamas-16. By order, incidentally, of KOPRON itself.  <H5>  How Much Does a Disaster Cost? </H5>   How much can the radiation disaster, if it does in fact  occur, cost Russia and the entire world? NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  [NG] has already written about how the region of the  "Komsomolets's" loss is one of the most biologically productive  in the Norwegian Sea. The vessel lies at a depth of 1,700  meters, which is exactly where plankton winter and then with  their seasonal migration rise to the surface and serve as food  for fish. Moreover, the hydrochlorides and hydroxides of  plutonium, combining with the products of the corrosion of other  metals, form macrosols which can be carried to fishing industry  regions by strong vertical and horizontal currents. All these  facts were confirmed in the report of the Polar Scientific  Research Institute of the Ocean Fish Industry and Oceanography  imeni Knipovich and are well known to ichthyologists. In October  1993, V. Korelskiy, the chairman of the RF Committee on the  Fishing Industry, gave his finding on the amount of probable  damage: "The `Komsomolets' nuclear-powered vessel [NPV] which  sank is a potential source of long-term radioactive  contamination of the northern seas, which naturally may involve  Russia's losing its traditional fishing industry. It is  difficult to assess the negative consequences of the disaster  for the fishing industry economy, although preliminary estimates  of the possible damage during the five-year period totaled an  astronomical sum--more than R3.5 trillion in 1993 prices." Any  commentary here is hardly necessary.    Incidentally, Russia will bear losses not only from the  reduction in its extraction of fish. The Norwegian Sea is  traditionally a zone of Norway's ecological interests, and if  just one cod netted has traces of isotopes of plutonium of  manmade origin, an international scandal will erupt. The scale  of it will exceed many times over the complications which arose  after Russia dumped just 0.38 curie of liquid radioactive waste  in the Sea of Japan. The fishing companies of the United States,  Japan, and France, for whom this will be a fine opportunity to  supplant the competitive Norwegian firms in the fish market,  will not let the passions die. A Norway which has lost its  market will have nothing left to do but demand that the annual  losses in the hundreds of millions of dollars be reimbursed by  Russia. And the Russian government, according to international  sea law, will have to pay them.  <H5>  Not Raise, but Immobilize </H5>   A radiation disaster in the Norwegian Sea can be averted  only  one way, by sealing off the nuclear torpedoes in the forward end  of the NPV. The option of raising the vessel was rejected by  specialists back in 1991. There were many reasons for this, the  main one being that the vessel's hull is virtually destroyed. In  addition, because of the fact that the speed of corrosion of the  steel near the titanium hull of the "Komsomolets" is 10 times  more than usual, the bolts which reinforce the lid of the atomic  reactor are most likely already ruined, and it is lying  virtually free on the base. If the vessel were tilted even  slightly, and if it were raised that is almost inevitable, the  reactor's lid would slip off and spill its radioactive filling  into the water. But even if the vessel could be raised  absolutely vertically, the result would be the same. Because of  the differential in pressure inside and outside the reactor and  the gas residue in the high pressure system, when raised its  contents would in fact gush as if pumped into the sea.    In 1993 KOPRON specialists developed a plan for immobilizing  the vessel by which all the openings in its forward end would be  closed off. It was planned to insert a special chitosan-based  sorbing compound in the interwall space, and a special batch of  it was manufactured by the Committee's order. On 4 January 1994,  the plan was handed over for an ecological expert study, and six  days later, in connection with the creation of the MinChS, the  Committee was disbanded and all the work to make preparations  for the expedition to the Norwegian Sea stopped. The departure  of the research ship "Akademik Keldysh" to sea with "Mir" deep  water equipment on board was open to question for the reasons  which NG has already written about. And, as the story concerning  the information "leak" which threw the Russian and international  community into confusion showed, the MinChS leadership  responsible for rendering the "Komsomolets" harmless was more  concerned with hiding its own inaction, lack of professionalism,  and negligence than with preventing the coming disaster.    Meanwhile, the expedition can be conducted this summer only  by starting preparations for it in the coming days. Urgent  measures are needed. A specially authorized organ consisting of  truly competent specialists, most importantly ones with an  interest in solving the problem, could carry those measures out.  I. Spasskiy, the general designer of the Rubin Central Design  Bureau, T. Borisov, the former chief of KOPRON, Yu. Kormilitsyn,  the chief designer of the "Komsomolets," and a whole number of  prominent experts have expressed their agreement to work on  immobilizing the vessel without pay.  <H5>  KOPRON or the MinChS? </H5>   The story of the "Komsomolets" has another side as well. In  early 1994, when KOPRON was disbanded and its tasks charged to  the Ministry for Emergency Situations which was being created,  almost all the submariners and designers of seagoing equipment  lodged protests against this reorganization. And the point is  not even that, as for example O. Ilyin, who supervised both  these structures in the government apparat, warned, such a  reorganization would almost certainly result in delay and  breakdown of the work on the "Komsomolets." KOPRON, which in  nine months of its work managed to conduct a unique study of the  "Komsomolets" and recruited 42 domestic enterprises, most of  which were part of the military-industrial complex which is  undergoing conversion, to cooperate had every chance of becoming  the world leader in the area of deepwater work. There is a very  great need for such work on the international market, and the  operation to immobilize the "Komsomolets" automatically creates  unprecedented publicity for the organization that does it and  ensures orders for many years into the future. It is precisely  for that reason that a consortium of Dutch firms is so eager now  to receive the contract to immobilize the vessel with the aid of  the international fund in memory of the "Komsomolets." And the  disbanding of KOPRON buried the hopes of many Russian defense  workers to use it to resolve the problem of their conversion.  This measure proved to be doubly wrong for the additional reason  that sooner or later Russia will all the same have to create  such an organ. A considerable number of dangerous objects have  been sunk near its shores, including 8 atomic reactors, almost  24,000 tanks of radioactive waste, and hundreds of thousands of  containers with toxic substances and chemical weapons. They all  have to at least be monitored if not raised. These are perhaps  not immediate tasks, but all the same they are tasks for the  future. But now it is important to conduct the operation to  immobilize the "Komsomolets" as quickly as possible. The vessel  lying in the depths of the Norwegian Sea represents a real  danger, not one devised by panicky specialists and journalists  after a sensational story. Russia has little time left to  eliminate this danger.</p>

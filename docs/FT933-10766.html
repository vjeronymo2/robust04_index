			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: 3M up slightly at Dollars 331m 3M, the US manufacturer of adhesives, magnetic tapes and other industrial and consumer products, turned in second-quarter net income of Dollars 331m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, writes Karen Zagor. A year earlier, it earned Dollars 317m, or Dollars 1.45. Sales were essentially flat at Dollars 3.54bn, up from Dollars 3.52bn. Mr L. D. DeSimone, chairman, said the company expected higher earnings for the year as a whole, in spite of a difficult economic environment and unfavourable currency translations. Like many other companies, 3M is finding Europe a particularly challenging market. For the first half, net income was Dollars 661m, or Dollars 3.02, on sales of Dollars 7.06bn, against earnings of Dollars 623m, or Dollars 2.83, on sales of Dollars 6.96bn. In the 1992 period, 3M took charges of 2 cents a share for accounting changes.</p>

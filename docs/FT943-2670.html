			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: Mexico's version of Hallowe'en - Bernard Simon joins a colourful and intense celebration of death in the south-western state of Oaxaca It is 2am, and Atzompa cemetery is coming to life. A brass band has struck up just inside the arched entrance. Family groups, their faces illuminated by hundreds of candles, are crouched around the graves, arranging the marigolds, loaves of bread, skull-shaped sweets and ornaments which festoon each mound of earth. More families, laden with decorations, are streaming in along a dusty, moonlit path from the nearby village. The night of October 31 marks the official start of the Dias de los Muertos (Days of the Dead) festival, when Mexicans celebrate death in a fusion - and profusion - of Christian rites and pre-Columbian traditions. The festival, which reaches its climax on November 2, All Souls' Day, is observed in many parts of Mexico. But it is at its most colourful and intense in villages like Atzompa, in the south-western state of Oaxaca, where the pre-Columbian Zapotec culture flourishes. There is nothing morbid or macabre about the Days of the Dead, but Mexico's version of Hallowe'en has more serious overtones than North American trick-or-treating. It is a serene, even a joyous, occasion when the living are reunited with the spirits of their dead relatives, while contemplating the transience of their own existence. No effort is spared to welcome the returning spirits. Senor Velasquez, affable proprietor of the charming Las Golondrinas (The Swallows) Hotel in Oaxaca city, sets aside an entire room for the elaborate altar which is the centrepiece of every family's celebration. The Oaxaca municipal authorities sponsor a competition for the best altar. Las Golondrinas has yet to win, but the certificates hanging in the guest lounge attest to its efforts. The celebration is not confined to homes and cemeteries. Oaxaca's street markets are stocked with altar and grave decorations in the days leading up to the Dias de los Muertos. Most conspicuous are the round loaves of slightly sweet bread, known as pan de los muertos. The loaves come in many sizes, but each one is decorated with an angel face or skull painted on a small flour-paste decal. Activities around the tree-lined main square include a fireworks display, live music and parades. Unfortunately, a North American twist has started to creep in. Urchins shouting 'Hallowe'en, Hallowe'en' try to prise a few pesos from patrons at the outdoor cafes lining the square. Our excursion to the cemeteries started just before 11pm on October 31. It was a chilly night, but Alberto, our guide, had brought along a few bottles of mezcal - fire-water made from cactus juice. We were also each given a taper candle, decorated with strips of coloured foil. Atzompa was our first stop, but the work of decorating graves had barely begun at 11.30. We resolved to return later. Things were busier at two cemeteries in Xoxocotlan, another barrio on the outskirts of Oaxaca. A vendor of 'hot dogs exquisitos' was doing a brisk business at the entrance to one. At the other, some youngsters, presumably bored with decorating graves, had gathered around a ghetto-blaster. Activity was both quieter and more intense around the graves. Women did most of the work. At one grave, coloured sand had been arranged to form an elaborate, life-sized white skeleton adorned with an over-sized green and yellow head-dress, also fashioned from sand. Dozens of votive candles circled the family's work of art. The head of the grave was a mass of brilliant red gladioli, mixed with orange marigolds. Most families stay up all night. They need to complete their grave and altar decorations by 4am when, according to Zapotec legend, the spirits of dead children return to earth. The spirits depart again for the netherworld about four hours later, when the tiny candles which commemorate them are snuffed out. The adult spirits supposedly arrive during the afternoon of November 1, when the coloured strips on the candles are replaced with black ones, and depart early on the morning of All Souls' Day. But we returned to our hotel in Oaxaca even before the younger spirits had made an appearance. Our minds and bodies had succumbed to the mezcal. Oaxaca is 400km, or a 50-minute flight, south of Mexico City. There is also a luxury bus service, which takes about eight hours. The most comfortable hotel in Oaxaca is the stone-walled Stouffer Presidente, converted in the 1970s from the 16th century convent of Santa Catalina. More moderately-priced hotels include Las Golondrinas, which has 18 rooms facing lushly-planted courtyards; and the Hotel Trebol, which is close to the square and the Benito Juarez market. Other attractions around Oaxaca include the ruins of the ancient Zapotec mountain-top capital of Monte Alban; the Mixtec and Zapotec settlement at Mitla; the weavers' village of Teotitlan del Valle; and teeming markets selling everything from green-glazed pottery to fried grasshoppers.</p>

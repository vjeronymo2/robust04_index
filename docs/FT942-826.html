			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Kravchuk faces run-off poll against Kuchma Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister, will face each other in a run-off election scheduled for July 10 to select the country's next leader, officials said yesterday. Preliminary returns from across Ukraine suggest that the two men are clearly ahead of the five other presidential candidates, but neither obtained the outright majority required for victory in the first round. Sunday's vote underscored deepening regional divisions. Mr Kuchma, who was a director of the former Soviet Union's largest missile factory and who promised to bring law and order to Ukraine, improve links with Russia and boost economic performance, won a landslide in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine and the separatist Crimean peninsula, taking up to 80 per cent of the vote. Mr Kravchuk, who sought to position himself as the only candidate able to preserve stability and national unity, won more than 90 per cent of the vote in the less populist, but fiercely nationalist, west of the country. Results are more sparse from the Ukrainian heartland, but the Interfax news agency reported that, in Kiev, 42 per cent of the vote went to Mr Kravchuk and only 19 per cent to Mr Kuchma. In contrast with neighbouring Belarus, where an outsider won a plurality of the votes in the first round of presidential elections last week, the five other candidates were far behind the two leaders. Mr Oleksandr Moroz, the hard-line socialist who leads the dominant bloc in parliament, was placed a poor third. While Mr Kravchuk and Mr Kuchma will return to the campaign trail to continue the fight over the two main issues in Ukraine - national sovereignty and the economy - important changes are expected in the government. In a move criticised by Mr Kuchma, the president and parliament approved a new prime minister, Mr Vitali Masol, before the election. Mr Masol, like Mr Kravchuk, was a Communist party functionary and was expected to continue the Ukrainian government's lacklustre economic performance. But some western diplomats and Ukrainian cabinet ministers now say that Mr Masol has undergone a conversion to the market and is following the path of Russia's unlikely reformist, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin. Mr Roman Shpek, Ukraine's reformist minister for the economy, said the prime minister had asked him to stay on. Senior Ukrainian officials predict that when Mr Masol asks parliament to approve a new cabinet later this week, other reformists will be appointed and opponents of change will be sacked. In what some observers view as an 11th-hour effort to burnish Mr Kravchuk's economic track record, Ukrainian officials say that the government will ask parliament this week to approve a number of progressive laws, including price liberalisation and the abolition of the country's fixed exchange rate system.</p>

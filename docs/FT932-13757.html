			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Housing grant cut may be reviewed THE GOVERNMENT is prepared to reconsider its plan to cut grants to housing associations to build or buy homes for rent, Sir George Young, housing minister, indicated yesterday. The plan, announced in the chancellor's Autumn Statement, would have cut the grant from an average last year of 72 per cent of the cost of new housing to 60 per cent next year and 55 per cent in 1995. The balance is raised on the capital markets. Questioned by the cross-party Commons environment committee, Sir George said reducing the grant to 55 per cent by 1995 was a 'target', not a 'commitment', and would be reconsidered if the cuts looked likely to force up rents unduly or to make it harder for associations to attract the private finance they need. Some financial institutions had warned that associations would find it difficult to borrow 45 per cent of the cost against the security of a tenanted home. The extra interest charges would have pushed up rents by 70 per cent according to a study by stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The National Federation of Housing Associations said these rises would have left up to 85 per cent of tenants dependent on housing benefit. Sir George said he was prepared to see some rise in rents, especially if the economic recovery raised incomes. The increasing proportion of tenants on housing benefit indicated that the housing budget was better targeted on those most in need. However, no decision had yet been made on the level of housing association grant for the next two years. Sir George said he would make a judgment later in the summer about the grant rate for next year after consulting financial institutions about their readiness to fund associations at given rates. Sir George also said that there were no plans to change the legislation on government grants to enable them to be paid to private property developers. The minister said he had an open mind on the desirability of such a change and would welcome views from MPs. However, he would want to be satisfied on questions such as the accountability of developers for public money and the level of rents.</p>

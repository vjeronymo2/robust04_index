			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Bank chairman 'acted honestly' A fake burglary and other mysterious events surrounded the end of Wallace Smith Trust Company, the collapsed London merchant bank, raising a 'finger of suspicion' that it had been targeted by a thief or fraudster, counsel for the bank's chairman told the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr William Clegg QC, said that could be why a Pounds 100m hole was found in the bank's finances after it folded in 1991. He said that Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the bank's founder, had not known about it. Mr Clegg said Mr Smith, who denies two charges of obtaining money by deception, three of the theft of certificates of deposit, two of false accounting and one charge of fraudulent trading with intent to defraud creditors, had never acted dishonestly. The trial continues today.</p>

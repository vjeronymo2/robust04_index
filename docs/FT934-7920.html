			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Emperor's MP wants to keep multi-seat system unchanged MR KAORU YOSANO, a member of parliament for the Liberal Democratic party, was an unhappy man yesterday . Mr Yosano, 55, represents the central Tokyo district which includes parliament and the emperor's palace. He is one of the mainstream of LDP politicians who will today vote against the government's plans for political reform. Mr Yosano, winner of six elections and former vice-minister of the ministry of international trade and industry, argues that the proposed shift from multi-seat constituencies to single seats will worsen, rather than lessen, the corruption which has discredited the political system. 'It's just going to accelerate hidden competition. Small boroughs are all very well when each party has different policies. But the policies of the LDP age have been carried over exactly by the the new government, so people will find it very hard to differentiate between parties,' he says. This will intensify what he euphemistically calls 'service competition'. Instead, he would prefer the present multi-seat constituency system to remain intact. Reform should, for the moment, be limited to a bill to curb corruption, he believes. 'After all, it took Britain 400 years to bring about political reform.' The outlook for the opposition LDP is bleak, Mr Yosano admits. 'At least half the party membership feels as I do, but we are being carried away by the wave of the age ..It is too late to argue, so we will not argue any more,' he says gloomily. He knows the LDP will be outvoted in the lower house and fears it will lose 'almost all' its urban seats in the election to be held next year, if the coalition manages to field single candidates under the new system. Holders of large constituencies such as his own, which has more than 500,000 inhabitants, will find it particularly hard to raise enough campaign cash to fight an election, under tough new curbs on political funding. 'Money will be very difficult to obtain from companies. So we will have to rely more on personal donations, which will be difficult in the current atmosphere in Japanese society,' he says, referring to the outrage aroused by years of political corruption. The average candidate needs Y30m (Pounds 188,600) to run a 14-day election campaign, and far more to finance the months of preparation required, he estimates. However, Mr Yosano is unwilling to put a figure on his own election expenses. 'Do you want me to confess?' he laughs. Mr Yosano plans, at least for the time being, to stay loyal to the party and to his LDP faction, led by Mr Michio Watanabe, the veteran former foreign minister who opposes reform. But in the longer term, he admits he might have to rethink his loyalties. 'If there is a big earthquake, I have to escape one way or the other,' he says.</p>

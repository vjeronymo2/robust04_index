			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> UNDEFEATED AGOURA GIRLS ON BRINK OF 3-A SOCCER TITLE  </P> <P> Dave Godwin must be wondering what is in store for him as his Agoura High  girls' soccer team prepares to play Anaheim Canyon for the Southern Section 3-A  Division championship this afternoon at 2 at Gahr High in Cerritos.  </P> <P> Godwin, the Agoura coach, last month announced his resignation effective at the  end of the season. Under Godwin, Agoura has won the past two 2-A titles.  </P> <P> This season, having been elevated to the 3-A level, the No. 1-seeded Chargers  are 25-0. A victory today would bring Godwin's five-year record to 102-7-9 and  undoubtedly warrant cause for celebration. And that has become cause for  concern.  </P> <P> "Last year I got hit in the face with a cream pie," Godwin said. "It was a  perfect shot. I don't know what's going to happen should we be fortunate enough  to win."  </P> <P> The Chargers certainly are good enough to win. Agoura has won 40 consecutive  matches and has outscored the opposition this season, 170-6, establishing a  Southern Section single-season record for goals. Junior Heidi Walters has  scored a team-high 29 goals and senior Julie Tingle is the Southern Section  career assist leader with 103.  </P> <P> Sixth-seeded Canyon (18-1-4), however, is not likely to be intimidated. The  Comanches, the Century League champions, have recorded playoff wins over  third-seeded Moreno Valley (1-0) and second-seeded Mater Dei (4-1).  </P> <P> "Everyone I talk to says Agoura is awesome," Coach John Williams said. "But  we're used to being the underdogs."  </P> <P> Senior striker Christa Ramirez leads Canyon with 22 goals. Senior goalkeeper  Keri Erkenbrack has yielded only two goals in the past 12 matches.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the City Section girls' soccer season will conclude today at  Birmingham High with an all-Valley final when Chatsworth meets Grant at noon.  </P> <P> Chatsworth breezed to the Northwest Conference championship and is unbeaten --  with one tie -- in 16 matches. Grant finished second to Chatsworth in the  conference and is 12-2-3.  </P></p>

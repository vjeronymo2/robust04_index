			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taiwan has expelled four refugees from the People's  Republic of China to Sweden. All four are reported to have  taken part in the democracy movement and are expected at Arlanda  [airport] this evening. The reason why Taiwan is expelling the  four Chinese is that one or more of them are reported to have  relatives in Sweden. In the past, refugees from the People's  Republic have been allowed to stay in Taiwan, but as the  relations between the two countries have improved, interest in  the refugees has lessened in Taiwan.</p>

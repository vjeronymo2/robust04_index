			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Govett shareholders requisition EGM SHAREHOLDERS in Govett Atlantic Investment Trust have requisitioned an Extraordinary General Meeting and called on the managers to present plans to enable shareholders to realise their holdings at net asset value. ST Partners, a vehicle for American investor Mr Andrew Shechtel, and Buchanan Partners, a London-based investment group, which each hold about 5 per cent of the equity capital, have requisitioned the meeting. Investors holding a further 14.5 per cent of the equity have agreed to support the motion which calls for the directors to produce 'proposals for unitisation or other methods of substantially narrowing the discount'. In January, Govett Atlantic said it was giving consideration to a scheme of capital reconstruction designed to achieve this purpose.</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Aga on course for higher profit AGA, the Swedish industrial gas group, said it was on course to achieve higher profits in 1993 as income after financial items rose by 4 per cent to SKr766m (Dollars 95m) in the first half. The figures continued the group's steady performance in the face of difficult market conditions, but showed it was unable to reap the full benefits of strong growth in sales and operating income because of high interest costs. Sales for the period were 32 per cent higher at SKr7.54bn. The company said this was due to the depreciation of the Swedish krona and acquisitions. Operating income was up 25 per cent at SKr792m. However, the costs of financing the purchase of CEGF, the French cold storage company, and the greater expense of servicing foreign loans with a weaker krona, meant net financial costs were SKr158m higher than in the same 1992 period. The group's performance would have been static but for the fact that its share of income from the power company Gullspangs Kraft rose by SKr28m. Aga said it was satisfied with the performance of its core gas operations, considering the weak economic climate in most of its key markets. Exchange rate factors lifted gas sales by 24 per cent to SKr5.45bn and operating income by 14 per cent to SKr697m. The cold storage and food processing business, Frigoscandia, saw sales rise 58 per cent to SKr2.09bn, mainly due to acquisitions. Operating income soared to SKr95m from SKr22m. Aga is sticking to an earlier forecast that full-year profits will exceed last year's SKr1.48bn. Mr Marcus Storch, the company's chief executive, said: 'The recession is expected to continue throughout the year, although some recovery is anticipated in the UK and the Nordic countries. Growth in the US is low and the economic climate in Latin America is mixed.'</p>

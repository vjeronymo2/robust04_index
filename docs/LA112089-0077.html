			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN EXPO COMING INTO ITS OWN IN L.A.;  </P> <P> TRADE: LAUNCHED IN LATE 1980, THE EVENT HAS ATTRACTED EVER-WIDENING INTEREST IN  JAPANESE CULTURE AND PRODUCTS. AND FOUNDER NAGAO MASUDA, WHO MADE IT A SUCCESS,  IS EXPANDING HIS SMALL EMPIRE BY PRODUCING OTHER PROMOTIONAL SHOWS.  </P> <P> When Nagao Masuda sought support for a Japanese trade and cultural exhibit in  Los Angeles in 1980, officials of the Japan External Trade Organization tried  to talk him out of the idea for fear that the event would exacerbate the  already chilly trade relations between the United States and Japan.  </P> <P> But Masuda, a Japanese banker's son and one-time TV cameraman who has a  reputation as a creative promoter, pursued his project with stunning results.  Launched just after the September, 1980, airing of the NBC-TV mini-series  "Shogun" fueled wider interest in Japanese culture, Japan Expo became a huge  event that drew Japanese TV coverage as well as appearances from dignitaries  such as Mayor Tom Bradley. During its Nov. 24-26 run this year at the downtown  Los Angeles Convention Center, the exhibit of Japanese consumer goods, food and  artists is expected to draw about 90,000 visitors, employ 55 people and gross  about $500,000.  </P> <P> "I guess I was lucky to think of the idea," said Masuda, 47, who in true  promoter's spirit, recalled that he donned a Samurai warrior's suit of armor to  greet visitors at the first expo in 1980. "It was a big hit. I was in the right  place at the right time."  </P> <P> As interest in Japan has grown in the wake of the country's increased economic  clout, many have tried to capitalize on Americans' curiosity about the nation  as well as cater to the cultural needs of the growing Japanese-American  community in the United States.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. festivals centering on Japan have become popular. In September,  for example, Beverly Hills paid tribute to Japan in connection with the city's  75th anniversary.  </P> <P> But Masuda, who emigrated to the United States from Japan 18 years ago, has  become something of a Los Angeles institution in trying to bridge the cultural  gap between the two countries. And although his maverick style bucks Japanese  business tradition and draws criticism from some colleagues who call him  boastful, Masuda has found a lucrative niche promoting his homeland to tens of  thousands of Southern Californians.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem of the Japanese is that they are so misunderstood," said  Holmes Stoner, head of the Los Angeles firm Artesa Inc., which specializes in  advertising to Latinos and Asian-Americans. "Nagao has become a conduit for  greater understanding. He tries to join Japan to the U.S. in so many ways. . .  . Japan needs more like him."  </P> <P> Yet Masuda's business ethics appear unseemly to one acquaintance, who used the  Japanese term applied to the nightclub or entertainment world -- mizu shobai,  or literally "water trade," to describe the promoter.  </P> <P> "I think Mr. Masuda is very creative," said the associate, who declined to be  identified. "But he exaggerates a lot of things."  </P> <P> Water does seem to leak from some of Masuda's claims.  </P> <P> Japan Expo promotional literature boasts that the event has drawn as many as  93,000 people. But many observers put the total much lower. Convention  spokeswoman Kris Morita, who predicts that Japan Expo could draw about 90,000  people this year because organizers are using two exhibition halls for the  first time, estimated that attendance since the mid-1980s -- although growing  -- has not topped 75,000 for all three days.  </P> <P> Masuda also tells media outlets that Japan Expo is "produced by" the Japan  America Friendship Foundation Inc. The foundation, also housed in Masuda's  Gardena offices, describes itself in brochures as a "nonprofit cultural and  educational organization." As a result, Masuda often secures lower,  non-commercial ad rates and other financial breaks to promote Japan Expo, a  colleague said. However, Masuda -- who is chairman of both Japan Expo and the  nonprofit foundation -- said in an interview that the Japan Expo event is a  profit-seeking venture.  </P> <P> When asked about the discrepancies, Masuda would say only, "We don't really  care about the money. . . . We just want to bring Japanese culture to the  American people."  </P> <P> Billed as a "trade and cultural exhibition," Japan Expo resembles a car show,  consumer electronics exhibit, food fair and arts festival -- all rolled into  one.  </P> <P> The expo -- which lost money during its first four years -- is now bigger than  any other ethnic festival held at the convention center, including past events  pegged to the Soviet Union, Mexico and China, said convention spokeswoman  Morita. Although Japan Expo draws about half as many people as the center's  largest annual event -- the auto show -- it has "good strong promotion and  marketing," said Morita.  </P> <P> For U.S. companies, Japan Expo offers a chance to introduce their products and  services to the Japanese-American community. At past shows, for instance,  American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has offered event-goers three minutes of  free long-distance calls to Japan from its booth at the convention center.  </P> <P> By contrast, many Japanese companies use the event to conduct market research.  Most of the leading Japanese auto makers, including Nissan and Honda, will have  new and prototype cars on hand. Consumer electronics firms, such as JVC, will  display their latest wares, and an assortment of Japanese food companies and  local restaurants will serve their latest creations.  </P> <P> Amid the commerce, there are a host of cultural exhibitions highlighting  traditional Japanese arts, ranging from doll makers to wood block printers. All  told, about 60 different artists will fly in from Japan, Masuda says.  </P> <P> In a letter reprinted in promotional material sent to Japanese companies this  year, Mayor Bradley wrote of the event organizers: "I fully support your  wholehearted efforts in bringing such a beautiful and colorful Japanese  culture, entertainment and enterprises to the people of the U.S.A. This is  truly a wonderful way to promote friendship."  </P> <P> About 300 firms are expected to pay $1,000 or more to rent booths at the event.  A 148-page exhibition guide, which last year featured 43 advertisers in a  112-page issue, will generate $1,500 for each full-page black-and-white ad and  $2,400 for each full-page color advertisement sold this year.  </P> <P> Japan Expo officials estimate that the event will gross $750,000, although  observers close to the company put the figure nearer to $500,000. Masuda won't  say how profitable Japan Expo is. But the event earns enough to keep a  five-member Japan Expo staff working year-round crisscrossing the Pacific -- as  well as enough to enable Masuda to buy a house in Torrance and drive a  Mercedes-Benz.  </P> <P> Masuda -- who has turned over the daily management of Japan Expo to his brother  Norio Masuda, 45 -- has parlayed the success of Japan Expo into a mushrooming  number of other promotional enterprises operated out of his Gardena offices.  </P> <P> The ventures include a real estate development firm and at least four other  exhibitions modeled after Japan Expo. Among them: the Asian Expo, the Japan  Regional Food Products Fair as well as the World Gem &amp; Jewelry Show held in  Japan and an upcoming USA Expo to be held in Japan.  </P> <P> With all the activity, some wonder if Masuda is not spreading himself too thin.  And a critic who once helped Masuda stage Japan Expo complained that Masuda's  business style is "sloppy."  </P> <P> The critic, who did not want to be identified, added: "People from Japan expect  a more sophisticated show." But they forgive Masuda and Japan Expo keeps  growing, the critic said, because "Mr. Masuda is a likable person with a very  charming personality."  </P> <P> Sporting near-shoulder length hair, designer jewelry and silk suits, Masuda's  style is more akin to a Hollywood mogul than a Japanese-American businessman.  </P> <P> "He doesn't look like the son of a banker, does he?" joked John K. Marumoto,  vice president of Japan Expo, when Masuda recently greeted a visitor in his  office. Masuda doesn't act the role of conservative businessman either.  </P> <P> Masuda is one of the few local Japanese-American entrepreneurs who does not  belong to the establishment Japanese Business Assn. of Los Angeles. And the  association's director, Takashi Kawahito, is not expansive on the subject of  Masuda. He declined to discuss the promoter or Japan Expo. Instead, he cited  other Japanese cultural events in Los Angeles that, he said, "are popular,  too."  </P> <P> But endorsements of Japan Expo come in from as far away as the desk of former  Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and that of California Gov. George  Deukmejian, who last year extended written best wishes to event organizers.  Likewise, Masuda's list of Japanese business associates is so extensive that  his long-distance telephone bills often run dozens of pages.  </P> <P> "Mr. Masuda is quite a successful businessman," said the promoter's old boss,  Nobu Katagiri, who worked with Masuda at a Japanese TV station. "He left (TV)  and established his own independent publishing company and then started Japan  Expo. It was a very good idea," said Katagiri, who is now vice president of  Asahi Homecast Co. of San Gabriel, which produces Japanese-language television  programming for Channel 18.  </P> <P> Even the Japan External Trade Organization, which once spurned Masuda, has  changed its tune. As a Japanese government-supported agency it cannot  financially back Japan Expo. Nevertheless, JETRO has offered behind-the-scenes  support, according to Ted Hayashi, JETRO's director.  </P> <P> "It's become quite a big event for the Japanese community," Hayashi said of  Japan Expo. "A lot of Japanese manufacturers and local (Japanese) governments  participate. But this fair is for the public. It brings cultural things like  traditional Japanese arts" to a wider American audience.  </P></p>

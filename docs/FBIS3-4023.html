The latest statistics show that the newly-added investment  has totaled 370 million U.S. dollars. Some 10 foreign-funded  ventures have each poured more than 10 million U.S. dollars into  their operations.    Experts pointed out that high economic returns on  investments  and bright investment prospects are the key factors in  furthering the attraction of overseas investment.    The Tianjin economic and technological development zone has  attracted the largest number of foreign investors in the city.  So far, some 2,000 foreign-funded enterprises have been  established in the zone and nearly half of them have started  operating.    Figures show that 85 percent of the operational enterprises  are showing profits and one-third of them have already recouped  their investment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz has stressed that the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat  Church was committed after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to  divert international attention away from the massacre.    In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM published today,  the Lebanese foreign minister said that a number of people have  been arrested for the church bombing. These people revealed  that they has connections to Israeli officers and had obtained  instructions, funds, and equipment that enabled them to assemble  the explosive device, Buwayz added.    Buwayz maintained that it is not possible to terminate the  resistance before obtaining assurances that south Lebanon will  return to Lebanon because the resistance is not the reason for  the Israeli occupation but a result of it.    Responding to a question on the Middle East market, the  Lebanese foreign minister said: Any concept of future regional  relations must be based on the dimensions of peace.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Management: Leaders in the vision league After a decade of global restructuring and heavy investment in 'lean manufacturing' and 'time compression' to speed product development, where are the world's most responsive manufacturing businesses? The answer, according to an exhaustive global survey* launched this month by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International, the international accountants and consultants, is still Japan - but only just. Overall, the Japanese come closest to having achieved the vision for the 'agile manufacturing enterprise' of the 21st century, says the survey of 1,300 leading manufacturing companies in 11 industrialised nations. It is probably the most ambitious global exercise in benchmarking manufacturing. Japanese leadership in this area is important because, as the survey puts it, 'global competitive battles will be won and lost on an organisation's ability to tap interface capabilities, particularly in manufacturing, design and marketing'. The findings suggest that the Japanese have greater abilities for rapidly introducing new products and increasing production volumes, because of their superior co-ordination across functions. However, US and Canadian executives perceive themselves as only slightly behind the Japanese in terms of agility, though the Europeans and Latin Americans admit to wider gaps. 'There is little doubt that, in the future, organisations making the greatest competitive strides will be those that can best integrate inter-firm and intra-firm activities and can shorten their new product development times,' says the survey. Spanning traditional functional boundaries requires radical departures from current operations, it adds. *Vision in Manufacturing: Planning for the Future. Pounds 75.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller briefed political party  leaders on the economic stability package.    Ciller, True Path Party leader and prime minister, is  continuing to seek a consensus in connection with the economic  stability package. She first visited Motherland Party [ANAP]  leader Mesut Yilmaz at his office in parliament.    In a statement before the meeting, Ciller said that the main  aim of her visit was to seek a consensus in connection with the  economic measures. She said she would explain her views and  listen to the views of the opposition leader. She said:    [Begin Ciller recording] We are starting an important  struggle. We want a consensus from every sector of the society.  We will listen to the views of the opposition leader.  Naturally, different views might be expressed. However, I  consider this a national problem, therefore I think it is  appropriate for me to set off with this approach. I will also  have the opportunity to ask him for his opinion on other issues.  [end recording]    In a statement after the meeting, ANAP leader Yilmaz said  that Ciller briefed him on the economic measures she will  disclose tomorrow. He said that Ciller asked that this  information not be divulged until she announces the measures  tomorrow. Yilmaz said that he will express his views on the  economic measures after the prime minister announces them.    Asked if the prime minister asked for his support for the  economic measures, Yilmaz replied:    [Begin Yilmaz recording] She did not ask for our direct  support. However, she stressed that these measures are  inevitable given the current state of the economy, that they  are, in fact, late in coming. She said that she expects us to  approach the issue with this understanding. [end recording]    Yilmaz pointed out that at the end of their meeting, the  prime minister asked him his opinion about a unification of the  right. Yilmaz said that he reiterated his earlier remarks on the  issue.    [Begin Yilmaz recording] I pointed out that there is a  coalition government at the moment. I said that we do not  consider it right, in principle, to discuss the issue as long as  this coalition is in power. I said, however, that if this issue  becomes actual in the future for whatever reason, if Turkey is  faced with such a necessity, we will approach this issue  constructively. [end recording]    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller met with Prosperity Party  leader Necmettin Erbakan. Before the meeting, the prime  minister said that she would brief Erbakan on the economic  package and listen to his views. She stressed that a first step  will be taken tomorrow in implementing a series of important  economic measures. Within this framework, she said, I will  visit all the party leaders, adding: This is such a struggle  but it can succeed if all the sectors in the country are united  in supporting it as much as possible.    In a statement after the meeting, Erbakan said that the  package is nothing but new price hikes, taxes, and the closing  of factories. He maintained that this will crush the people and  said that he warned the prime minister that there will be social  explosions in the end. He alleged that the economic package  will further exacerbate the rate of inflation and unemployment.    Asked if the prime minister asked for his party's support,  Erbakan replied:    [Begin Erbakan recording] We listened to the outline the  prime minister gave us. It became clear once again that what  they call a package involves nothing but price hikes, the  closing down of numerous institutions, and new taxes --  everything to be carried out in periods of three months. We  warned her about what these measures might lead to. [end  recording]    Prime Minister Ciller then briefed the True Path Party  Assembly group on the economic measures. It was a closed  session.</p>

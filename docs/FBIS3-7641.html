			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 29 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  indirectly proposed that it will allow International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) checks of seven nuclear facilities only  after a third round of high-level talks with the United States.    One senior official at the North Korean Mission to the  United  Nations in New York said Tuesday that the original agreements  reached between North Korea and the United States and North  Korea and the IAEA called for a comprehensive IAEA inspection of  only five of the seven sites.    As for the other two facilities -- a 5-megawatt reactor and  a  radiochemical laboratory -- North Korea had agreed to accept  IAEA inspections that are necessary only to maintain continuity  in nuclear safeguards, the official claimed.    The question of permitting comprehensive IAEA inspections of  all seven facilities in North Korea, a member of the nuclear  non- proliferation treaty (NPT), must be resolved at the third  round of high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington, he  said.    The official, who declined to be identified by name, said  the  United States is reportedly planning to raise the question of  special checks of the two facilities at the talks.    The U.S. position mirrors that of a hostile country  demanding  that the other side publicly disclose its military technology,  the official said. He thus ruled out the possibility that the  IAEA may conduct special inspections.    The official also demanded that the United States not attach  any preconditions to further dialogue.    "The United States has to give up the idea that U.S.-North  Korean talks are some kind of present (to Pyongyang)," he said.  "In fact, we do not feel an urgent need for dialogue with the  United States."    The official's comments confirm widely held suspicions that  much time and effort are needed to resolve the issue since South  Korea, the United States and their allies are demanding that  North Korea permit IAEA inspections immediately while Pyongyang  is seeking further talks with Washington first.</p>

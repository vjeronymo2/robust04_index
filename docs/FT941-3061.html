			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US calls for proof that its stockpile sales are disrupting the world bauxite market The US government will limit sales of refractory grade bauxite (aluminium ore) sold from its strategic stockpile in the 1994 fiscal year to Chinese material, but has asked for evidence from a major producer to substantiate claims that the sales are depressing prices paid to producers. The US embassy in Guyana says the limit is in response to concerns expressed by the Guyanese government over the sale of 48,000 tonnes of refractory grade bauxite between October 1992 and September 1993. Guyana and China dominate the world market for refractory grade bauxite. The government of the English-speaking republic in north-east South America says the sale is depressing the world market price of the bauxite and threatening efforts to rehabilitate the local bauxite industry. 'In response to Guyanese government concerns about the impact of stockpile refractory bauxite sales on the Guyanese market. . . the stockpile has taken affirmative action to limit refractory bauxite offerings in fiscal year 1994 primarily to Chinese material,' an embassy statement says. It adds, however, that the US interagency committee, which monitors the impact of stockpile sales, has asked the Guyana government to provide additional information to support its contention that the US sales have caused undue disruption in the market. 'This committee did not believe that the bauxite sales in fiscal year 1993 would cause an undue disruption of the world market for refractory bauxite, which amounts to over 1m tons annually,' it says. Guyanese officials had claimed that the sale from the US strategic stockpile had driven world prices for refractory grade bauxite from Dollars 150 a tonne to under Dollars 100. The US Congress has directed the Defence Stockpile Centre to sell its surplus stock of refractory bauxite by September 1997 because stockpiling requirements have changed because of a lessening in potential threats to US national security. The decision to reduce the strategic bauxite stockpile has been a cause of concern among producers. Mr Nenad Altman, secretary general of the International Bauxite Association, the producers' group, said recently that despite the sale of relatively small amounts, producers were being affected by the price of the US material.</p>

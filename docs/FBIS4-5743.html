			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Quang Thong: "Opening the Door for National </F> Development and Protection]    [Text] Our country has entered a period of door-opening.  Advantages have never been so good as they are today. This is a  result of our dynamic economy, stable politics, and correct  diplomatic policy. A person or a family with few friends and  lots of enemies would have many worries and incalculable  misfortune. A country, if faced with the same situation, would  be much worse. Therefore, door-opening is a great success  arising from our party's renovative thinking.    Our party's great thinking is to build a  dynamically-developed society along the socialist path with a  prosperous population, strong nation, and an equitable and  civilized society. But that path is being targeted for sabotage  by hostile forces. We must realize clearly the motto of being  open-minded toward everybody and honest with friends, and never  belittling the political wisdom and shrewdness of a nation and  its people. That is a lesson for everybody in the current trend  of integration and development and is needed for the world to  coexist peacefully amid never-ending conflict.    We do not exaggerate the dangers while great opportunities  have arisen. Our people, with their incomparable and sincere  desire for peace, are easily moved by the offer of any  cooperative hands. They gratefully view this as an act of  sharing our suffering. As our people are grateful, they will  never forget the kindness given to them by the peoples of  friendly countries during their fight against the French and the  United States. Despite countless difficulties, these friendly  peoples encouraged, supported, and assisted us. That sincere act  came from the depth of their hearts. It will not be our fault  should history ever leave any unsavory mark on anybody.    "Why should we be vigilant? If I come to you with  suspicions, can I cooperate with you enthusiastically?" The  answer is: "We do not suspect anybody when we think of  cooperation for mutual benefit. We open our door widely to  welcome anyone, irrespective of political affiliation, who  arrives to cooperate with the Vietnamese people for economic  development and cultural exchange. But we will not allow anyone  to interfere in our internal affairs to divert us from the Uncle  Ho-directed path already chosen by our party and people."    We cherish peace. We absolutely do not want war, including  the bloody anti-aggression war and the silent war against the  peaceful evolution strategy. As Trotsky put it: "You may not  be concerned about strategies, but strategies do concern you."    Real information and activities, most of them clandestine  and  illegal, show that the "peaceful evolution" strategy is a prop  for the enemy's riotous and subversive activities and is being  undertaken to a great extent. External reactionary forces  working hand in glove with internal reactionary and dissident  elements have publicly declared their intention to eliminate our  socialist regime. Door-opening, which is considered by us as one  of the advantages of the new situation, is also a dream for  those hostile forces which are conspiring to eliminate our  regime.    The enemy has drawn on their successful lessons of  experience, obtained from East Europe and the Soviet Union in  using their "peaceful evolution" strategy with its sweet and  gentle tricks, to attack Vietnam. Being a well-experienced  party, "it" [the enemy] will not directly attack our strategic  command. The enemy will take advantage of our shortcomings and  negligence. They will find a way into our intermediate-level  management echelons and into every nook and cranny of villages  and hamlets. They will seek to buy support, sow division among  the people, and incite bad elements to oppose us as the  opportunities arise before they start riotous and subversive  activities.    [Text] We are vigilant, but not childish to the point of  seeing everyone as our enemy, gradually closing our door, or  being panic-stricken. We are alert and confident. We are  vigilant to protect the survival of our regime and especially  our pattern of defense and development as a nation.    Remaining vigilant is the consciousness of the entire  people.  But great responsibility rests with the Armed Forces. Even in  some countries where no gunfire has been heard for hundreds of  years, priority efforts continue to strengthen their defense  forces and their armies. Their soldiers are sweating and even  bleeding in their combat drills. The history of our country is  one stained with the blood of aggressors. We can still recall  the story of Ms. Vo Thi Thang who, after walking out free from  the Con Dao prison with her "victorious smile," went to Cuba for  a visit where an elderly lady struggled with the crowd to reach  her. Embracing her, she said to her in tears: "How beautiful  and gentle you are. Vietnam is so loyal and appreciative. Why  is it that the enemy continues to target your country for their  invasion, killing, and sabotaging?"    The Armed Forces must first be strengthened in line with our  national strategy. We do not like to see a country with very  poor revenue bearing a very high defense budget. But in order  to have a peaceful country for construction, a strong people's  Army is of paramount importance. Safeguarding independence and  sovereignty and achieving socio-political stability are  important conditions for economic development and national  construction.    The incident in East Europe and the Soviet Union woke up all  revolutionary nations over the social class nature of the Armed  Forces. At present, to heighten a sense of vigilance for the  Army, we must first of all train it to become politically stable  and absolutely loyal to the socialist regime, the party, and the  people. In an attempt to overthrow our regime, the enemy is  eager to see nothing other than a Vietnamese Army having vague  political knowledge, waning willpower and determination, and a  falling organizational structure. Therefore, in heightening a  sense of vigilance, not only will the Army have to equip itself  with high combat skills so it can be ready to smash all external  acts of aggression but it will also have to serve as solid prop  to maintain internal political stability. Hostile forces are  trying by all means to exploit our negligence, weaknesses, and  internal difficulties to create troubles here and there. We  should maintain a high sense of vigilance to prevent bad  phenomena from occurring. As they are undergoing their  combat-readiness training, Army units must contribute their  utmost effort to make the public thoroughly aware of the party's  revolutionary lines and the enemy's sabotage schemes. The units  must try to build a strong political structure from among the  people.    In their new strategy, hostile forces are "paying particular  attention to us." Their attacking weapons are not guns and  ammunition, but rather sweet words to the ears and freshly  fragrant handkerchiefs. They want us to stray off our course,  eliminate the party, depoliticize the Army, negate all our  socialist achievements, and eventually, direct their artillery  attack at our history and smear our banner which has been  reddened with the blood of our predecessors.    At the recent All-Army National Congress, delegates  discussed  and fully understood the meaning of a party Central Committee  resolution on achievements scored, and on new opportunities and  challenges. This is vivid evidence that the Army has upheld the  lesson of remaining vigilant to stabilize politics, develop the  nation, and protect the regime and the fatherland.</p>

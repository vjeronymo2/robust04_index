			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME USES JUSTIFY HEAVY GOVERNMENT BORROWING  </P> <P> Some comments on James Flanigan's "Watch Out for Deflation, Not Inflation"  column (Aug. 12):  </P> <P> * The high unemployment began in 1975 and, through 1987, constituted the  third-worst record in a century -- exceeded only by the great slumps of the  1890s and 1920s. There may be a question one day as to whether oil was the  cause, or overcapacity on a worldwide basis.  </P> <P> * I remain surprised that people talk of the deficit as being historically high  -- not as a fraction of GNP, and the same holds true for government debt as a  fraction of total debt. If the thinking that holds today had been used for  policy in the 1940s, we could not have financed World War II. Why, then, is  increased government spending so horrifying?  </P> <P> * Unemployment today is worse than indicated because of the addition of the  military to the employed work force in recent years, and the vast increase in  part-time workers.  </P> <P> I wonder why nobody has pointed to one of the most fundamental causes of the  size of the S&amp;L bailout. Since the deregulation of interest rates paid to  depositors a decade or so ago, the interest rates paid depositors have  constantly remained well above the inflation rate. Because interest rate  payoffs are also part of the insurance up to the $100,000 limit, lots of  depositors are making big profits on no-risk deposits -- including drug dealers  lured in by high rates. Paying off depositors at a "ceiling" of interest rates  indexed to inflation would be reasonable, equitable and cost much less.  </P> <P> Look at it this way -- if we stumble into war in the Middle East, nobody will  worry about government borrowing -- why would it be so awful to spend on  education, infrastructure, etc.  </P> <P> FREDERICK C. THAYER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Professor Emeritus  </P> <P> University of Pittsburgh's School  </P> <P> of Public and International Affairs  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Poland faces shift to left Poland's coalition government, led by Ms Hanna Suchocka, faces a reshuffle and possible shift to the left, following the resignation of Mr Gabriel Janowski, agriculture minister, Christopher Bobinski reports from Warsaw. Mr Janowski quit after the government brushed aside his ministry's recommendations on minimum grain prices. He attacked cabinet colleagues for failing to support his efforts to develop agriculture. About 40 per cent of Poles live or work in the countryside and the rural vote is important. Leaders of Mr Janowski's party will meet next week to decide whether to withdraw from the coalition. If they pull out, Ms Suchocka may turn to the left-leaning PSL farmers' party. Reuter adds: Poland's secret service have foiled a plot to kill President Lech Walesa, a spokeswoman for the service said yesterday.</p>

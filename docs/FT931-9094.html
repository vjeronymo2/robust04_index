			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Scapa pays Pounds 11m for German group SCAPA GROUP, the Blackburn-based company which supplies industrial textiles and services to the paper industry, has paid Pounds 11m cash for the Oberdorfer Group, a German maker of forming fabrics. Oberdorfer, which was in receivership, has manufacturing plants at Heidenhem in Germany, Frankenmarkt in Austria and Idaho in the US. The loss-making Idaho plant will be closed, with the loss of about 30 jobs, and production will be transferred to Scapa's existing forming fabric plant in Shreveport, Louisiana. The number of jobs at Heidenhem has already been cut from 190 to 120 and in Austria from 80 to 58. Oberdorfer's annual turnover is Pounds 16m and Scapa said it was confident that the group's continuing operations would be profitable. Mr Harry Tuley, Scapa's chief executive, said: 'This acquisition fits our strategy of building market share in our core business areas. Oberdorfer will considerably strengthen Scapa's position in the supply of specialist forming fabrics, used in the manufacture of paper, especially in the important west European markets.' Oberdorfer will be integrated into Scapa's engineering fabrics division, which has manufacturing plants in 11 countries around the world.</p>

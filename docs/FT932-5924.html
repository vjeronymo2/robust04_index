			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets Bundesbank caution BUNDESBANK council mem-bers have been hawkish in recent days about the prospect for more German interest rate cuts, and that theme is likely to continue this week, writes James Blitz. There are now few expectations of the Bundesbank easing official rates at its council meeting on Thursday. Given the recent jump in M3 money supply growth, stubborn cost-of-living inflation and the deterioration in public sector finances, the Bundesbank is likely to be very cautious about its rate-cutting policy over the next few weeks. The release of indicators of west Germany's real economy in the next few days should show signs of weakness in both industrial output and manufacturing new orders - and this is likely to raise new questions about how long the Bundesbank can keep monetary policy as tight as it currently is. However, Ms Ruth Lea of Mitsubishi Bank in London believes it is possible that the rate of decline is now slowing down as Germany's export industries are helped by growth in the US and by signs of green shoots in the UK. Sterling weakened sharply in the wake of the cabinet reshuffle in the UK last week, and dealers will be watching for any continuation of this trend. Although the pound's weakness was mainly due to flows into the D-Mark, a dealer said 'the rudderless feel' in UK economic policy meant that sterling was being tossed around amid the turbulence in European currencies. As ever, the non-farm payroll report in the US, due out on Friday, will be a key indicator of the direction of the US economy and the dollar. James Capel, based in London, is expecting a net rise of 115,000 in May's headline figure.</p>

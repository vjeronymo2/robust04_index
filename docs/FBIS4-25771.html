			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China's President Jiang Zemin has stressed that  patriotism is essential for maintaining stability in Hong Kong  in the transitional period and has warned that confrontation  could cost the territory its future. Mr Jiang met a 20-strong  delegation of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) in  the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday. He told the  local unionists that it was now very important for Hong Kong  people to unite closely to cope with transitional matters. Mr  Jiang stressed that Hong Kong people should love China and avoid  confrontational action.    FTU chairman Cheng Yiutong said the president urged the  unionists to do more work in Hong Kong in uniting those who were  willing to be loyal to China.    Mr Jiang was quoted as saying that achieving stability in  transition was a big issue. He offered a formula for the  British colony with its history of more than a hundred years  rule--that it should uphold patriotism toward its original  motherland. To love China and Hong Kong were key matters. And  it was especially important to love China to affect a smooth  transition, he was quoted as saying. It would not be a problem  for Hong Kong people to love the territory, Mr Jiang said. But  loving China was quite a different matter for many Hong Kong  people, for the historical reason that Hong Kong had been  separated from China for about 150 years.    The Chinese leader called for an improved understanding of  China by Hong Kong people. He said this was a good way to  strengthen the ideology of patriotism in the territory. He said  more communication between China and Hong Kong would be  necessary for this. Uniting Hong Kong people under a banner of  patriotism could guarantee stability and a smooth transition, Mr  Jiang said.    He told the unionists that the Chinese position on Hong Kong  was that the key to the territory's prosperity lay on the  mainland. Hong Kong had to co-operate with China, and good  coordination between the two systems was vital. He stressed  that Hong Kong must not take a confrontational attitude to China  or reject China. He told the local delegation that Hong Kong  would come to an end without any future if it took the latter  attitude. Mr Jiang said the policy of "one country, two  systems" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong after it  reverted to Chinese control in 1997 should not be doubted. This  was the central government's fixed policy on the territory, he  said.</p>

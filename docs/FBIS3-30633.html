			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague Feb 4 (CTK) -- The signing of a closing  declaration of the Central European Free Trade Agreement  (CEFTA), which stipulates the efforts and convictions of the  participants to ensure liberalisation of trade within five  years, marked the end of a joint session of delegations from  four Central European countries in Prague today.    The economics ministers of the CEFTA countries, Bela Kadar  of  Hungary, Leslaw Podkanski of Poland, Jan Ducky of Slovakia and  the Czech Republic's Vladimir Dlouhy told journalists they  attached great significance to the agreement.    They stressed especially the fact that the changeover to  liberalising Central European trade was occurring at a time when  important trade agreements worldwide were being concluded,  examples including the North American Free Trade Agreement and  the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Liberalisation will not apply to certain problem groups,  particularly agriculture, they said. It will also proceed more  slowly with a number of "sensitive goods," such as automobiles,  textile and metals.</p>

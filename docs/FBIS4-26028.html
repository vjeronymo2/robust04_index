			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, June 17 (XINHUA) -- The Australian Trade  Commission (Austrade), the government trade arms, has appointed  Martin Walsh senior trade commissioner to Shanghai, China's  largest industrial and financial center.    Walsh said today that as Shanghai is increasingly taking on  the role of China's financial and industrial hub, "Austrade is  now expanding its services in Shanghai."    This is in line with the government initiative to help  Australian business get better access to the tremendous  development now going on in the east China region, he said in a  statement.    Walsh, who will take up his position on July 15, has been  manager of Austrade's east Asia regional support office in  Sydney since 1993.    Speaking fluent mandarin Chinese and with an extensive  background in Chinese business culture, Walsh was posted as  Austrade trade commissioner in south China from 1985 to 1988 and  as trade development director at the Australian Commerce and  Industry Office in Taipei from 1989 to 1992.    He said that "Shanghai itself is growing rapidly" and he  would focus on its Pudong Economic Development Zone.    "We are focusing strongly on the new Pudong finance and  industrial development area on the opposite bank of the Huangpu  River to the Bund," he added.    He said that "this will be a massive commercial center."    Australia has shifted its trade focus to Asia in recent  years  in a hope of taking advantage of booming economies in the Asian  region to give an impetus to the country's economy.    Trade and economic ties between China and Australia have  increased in the past years as the thriving economic growth in  China, especially in east China, has lured more Australian  business.    Australia's investment in China has reached to 1.25 billion  U.S. dollars in terms of contracted value by the end of last  year, making it the 9th largest foreign investor in China.</p>

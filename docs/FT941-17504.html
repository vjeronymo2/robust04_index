			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Some dreams come true - International opera The international musical year makes its most dynamic start on the other side of the Atlantic, with three world premieres over the next six weeks. America's most experienced opera composer, Dominick Argento, evokes the spirit of the legendary 1920s Hollywood actor Rudolph Valentino in his new opera The Dream of Valentino, which will be unveiled by the Washington Opera (Jan 15). The other two premieres are orchestral: Kurt Masur conducts the New York Philharmonic in Schnittke's Eighth Symphony (Feb 10), and Daniel Barenboim conducts a new Elliott Carter work in Chicago (Feb 17). In Europe, the spotlight falls initially on the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, where Peter Jonas has launched a British invasion in his first season as intendant. Tom Cairns designs and directs Un ballo in maschera with a cast including Dennis O'Neill and Julia Varady (Jan 31), while Richard Jones and Charles Mackerras tackle Giulio Cesare, with Ann Murray in the title role (March 21). Zurich also makes a rare foray into Handel with Alcina (Feb 5), one of two new productions conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt - the other being a very Viennese-looking La Belle Helene (May 28). The highlight of the Geneva season promises to be Francesca Zambello's new staging of Billy Budd, with a cast headed by Robert Tear, Rodney Gilfry and Samuel Ramey (March 15). Claudio Abbado's Faust series with the Berlin Philharmonic reaches its climax with Mahler's Eighth Symphony (Feb 12/13), but the event likely to generate most excitement in Berlin is saved for the end of the season - when Carlos Kleiber emerges from seclusion to conduct the federal president's charity concert (June 28). Nothing in the Milan programme arouses undue interest - except perhaps Riccardo Muti's Rigoletto (May 14). French tenor star-in-waiting Roberto Alagna sings the Duke, before moving to Paris to join Nuccia Focile in Romeo et Juliette at the Opera-Comique (June 24). Apart from a showing of Harry Kupfer's 1987 Stuttgart production of Die Soldaten at the Bastille (Jan 22), the only big-scale opera project in Paris is a new Ring at the Chatelet, conducted by Jeffrey Tate and staged by Pierre Strosser (June-Nov). That may be overshadowed by the new Ring at Bayreuth - a curious marriage of arch-radical producer, Alfred Kirchner, and arch-conservative conductor, James Levine. But Bayreuth faces strong competition from this summer's Salzburg programme, which promises to be Gerard Mortier's strongest yet: a Barenboim-Chereau Don Giovanni, two cycles of Beethoven symphonies conducted by Harnoncourt, a Stravinsky series featuring a Nagano-Sellars Oedipus Rex, and plenty of Stockhausen and Boulez. Lovers of operatic rarities will seek out Lalo's Le Roi d'Ys at Marseille (March 16) and Reyer's Sigurd at Montpellier (May 6). But the most intriguing of all is the revival of Hans Krasa's Dostoyevsky opera Uncle's Dream at the Prague State Opera - formerly Prague's German theatre, where it was premiered by George Szell in 1933. Krasa was gassed at Auschwitz, and the opera has not been heard since - unlike his children's opera Brundibar, which was performed last year at London's South Bank. When a young Israeli conductor, Israel Yinon, recently asked Universal Edition for the score, he was told it had been lost. He persisted, and eventually found Krasa's manuscript, complete with Szell's pencil markings, in the basement of the publisher's Vienna premises. Yinon conducts Uncle's Dream in Prague on March 27. (The production transfers to Mannheim in June.)</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "pra": "Machine Pushing German Interests </F> Through?"]    [Text] Something appalling has happened in the European  election campaign: The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  has turned into the Christian Social Union [CSU]. The SPD has  conducted the election campaign that one could have actually  expected of the CSU after Bavarian Minister President Edmund  Stoiber's attacks on Europe. No other party, except for the  Republikaner, talked so much of "German interests" as the Social  Democrats. In their election campaign, they turned Europe into  a machine pushing German interests through.    Who remembers the election campaign that the SPD conducted  five years ago? At that time, it tried to arouse enthusiasm for  Europe. In 1994 it tried to warm itself at the national fire.  The SPD is to blame for the strengthening of German national  trends. It wanted to occupy the topics of the political  opponents; it has thoroughly failed. In the polls its strange  election slogans are related to the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/CSU or the Republikaner -- a just punishment. The SPD  motto "security instead of fear" currently sounds like the  invocation of social democratic views. The Greens (that is, the  party that brought a charge against Maastricht in Karlsruhe)  showed the SPD what a pro-European election campaign can look  like in these days.    Chancellor Kohl's election campaign concept has worked: He  was able to reprimand the CDU for going too far and he prevented  the CDU/CSU from tearing itself to pieces in the controversy  over Maastricht. Kohl succeeded in pushing the planned European  currency, which violently moved the nation one year ago, into  the background -- he anticipated the Bundestag election  campaign. Therefore, gamblers like Manfred Brunner were not able  to play the part for which they had hoped.</p>

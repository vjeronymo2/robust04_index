			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Spanish tenor Jose Carreras was greeted by cheers and applause on his return to  London's Royal Opera House on Tuesday after a three-year absence caused by his  fight against leukemia. Carreras, 42, won at least 10 standing ovations -- the  first before he even began his two-hour recital -- as a packed house clapped,  cheered, stamped and showered the stage with flowers. Carreras was diagnosed in  1987 as suffering from leukemia. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

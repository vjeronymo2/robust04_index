			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Eurotunnel is warned of customer crisis of confidence Eurotunnel risks a crisis of confidence among customers if it has further problems with its freight shuttle service through the Channel tunnel, the Road Haulage Association warned yesterday. Mr Sydney Balgarnie, the association's spokesman, said: 'If they haven't got this problem cracked soon, there is going to be trouble. People do not want to get stranded in the tunnel. People want reliability, and if they don't get it they will use the ferries instead.' His comments came after yesterday's incident involving the temporary suspension of a train service because of technical problems - the second such incident in 11 days. Eurotunnel said the two incidents were unrelated though both involved warning lights that signalled non-existent faults. In one instance the warning indicated that the ramps used by trucks driving on to the shuttles were extended, while in the second a light warned that a train's anti-skid mechanism was not working. In the second incident, drivers of lorries travelling on the shuttles were evacuated from the tunnel. Mr John Noulton, Eurotunnel's public affairs director, said: 'These were irritations. It is what you would expect at this stage of introducing a new railway. The trains could have continued normally, but at this stage of the system our procedures are very strict and we followed them to the letter.' Eurotunnel has been operating for just over two weeks and has run about 200 trains through the tunnel. Mr John Chapman, Eurotunnel freight sales manager, said the incidents 'had no safety implications at all'. No drivers were in danger. Mr Balgarnie said that any breakdown in the tunnel had a psychological effect which would intensify once a full service was running. Last month Eurotunnel launched a highly-discounted promotion service for selected transport companies with the aim of attracting hauliers who normally use ferry services.</p>

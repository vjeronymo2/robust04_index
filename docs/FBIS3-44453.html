The  comments came after the government issued a directive asking  them to turn down invitations from the Preliminary Working  Committee (PWC) for the Special Administrative Region [SAR]  Preparatory Committee to discuss transitional matters.    The chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants'  Association, Peter Wong Hyo, said it was imperative for them to  discuss transitional matters with PWC members, particularly for  the civil service. "I think the government should not be too  sensitive on this. It is absurd that we should seek approval  from our supervisors before meeting the PWC members," he said.    Despite his strong advocation of having contacts with the  PWC, Mr Wong said the unfriendly political climate made it  difficult for them to sit on the panel, as suggested by a PWC  member Vincent Lo Hong-sui. "I think it is embarrassing for us  to sit on the panel. But we hope the PWC members will take our  opinions into consideration," Mr Wong said.    The chairman of the Local Inspectors' Association Robert  Chau  Chuen-kung, said he did not see any problems with them having  contact with the PWC. "I personally find nothing wrong for us  to be consulted by the PWC, as long as we act according to the  Official Secrets Act," he said. "But since the Government has  issued the directive, we must abide by it or risk our job  prospects."    Although Mr Chau said civil servants could refrain from  sitting on the PWC, which was a consultative body, he called on  the government to let them join the SAR Preparatory Committee to  be set up in 1996 to finalise details of the post-1997  government. "We are talking about convergence, which is very  important to Hong Kong and cannot be done within a matter of 24  hours. We need to prepare for it" he said.    His concern was shared by the chairman of the 15,000-strong  Government Employees' Association Cheng Chung-wai, who feared  that civil servants would be discriminated against by the  Government if they established close links with the PWC. "The  participation of civil servants will be of great help to the  PWC's work and, in turn, will benefit the smooth transition of  Hong Kong," he said. Mr Cheng said about 90 percent of civil  servants would stay in Hong Kong after 1997 and there was an  urgent need to get their views and concerns through to the  Beijing Government.    The deputy chairman of the Association for Expatriate Civil  Servants (AECS) Barry Brown, said the group would work according  to the decision of the senior Civil Service Council. It might  not be appropriate for civil servants to become members of the  PWC, but they should give their opinions on the transition to  their members. Mr Brown said the AECS was particularly concerned  about the definition of locals and whether they would be allowed  to serve Hong Kong after 1997.    Article 99 of the Basic Law stipulates that public servants  be permanent residents of Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Cooper Clarke improves COOPER CLARKE Group, the builders' merchant, yesterday reported some improvement in interim pre-tax profits but warned that recovery in the construction sector was likely to be some time away. Mr Peter Clarke, chairman, said that while turnover had increased, there had been continued pressure on margins and as a result profitability continued to suffer. In the first half of 1993, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 125,000 to Pounds 204,000, on turnover of Pounds 15m (Pounds 11.3m). Earnings per share came to 3.6p (2.2p). Mr Clarke said that at present there was no likelihood of any improvement in the construction sector and a number of the company's customers faced the prospect of falling order books. 'There is little doubt that while 1993 may see some improvement in the UK economy, any follow on to the construction sector is likely to be some time off.'</p>

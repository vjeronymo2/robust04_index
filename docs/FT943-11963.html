			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (6): No room for religious parties - President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali provides answers on the key issues facing the country in an interview with Roger Matthews On the threat posed to Tunisia if Islamic fundamentalists come to power in Algeria. Of course, it could pose some difficulties for us. But it would not be a real threat. In some ways, it is like a sickness. If you are healthy and strong, then you will not be infected. We have a healthy body, so we have no reason to fear anything. On the causes of fundamentalism. First, it is important to make clear that to some extent fundamentalism was of our own making, and was at one time encouraged in order to combat the threat of communism. Such groups were fostered in the universities and elsewhere at that time in order to offset the communists and to strike a balance. This is not really going back to the roots of the issue, but is one aspect of it. This phenomenon has also spread in some regions, not primarily because of religious reasons, but because of social and economic causes, especially where there have been pockets of poverty. Basically it is a socio-economic problem. How Tunisia has approached the problem. Our approach has been multi-dimensional and we have avoided making only a security response, although of course we have applied the law. We have adopted policies which tackle the economic and social problems, by taking care of the poorer regions and helping the poorest section of society. We have tried to go to the roots of the problem. My background in the military and security has provided me with a rich experience in understanding the problem. For example, when in the past there were demonstrations on the streets it was noticeable that the protesters attacked the outward symbols of wealth. They threw stones at Mercedes limousines and at luxury villas and houses. They showed their resentment at the rich. This was evidence that the real origin of the protests was social. It would take hours to explain the full reasons for the phenomenon. I have been aware of it since the 1970s and I was the first to write a paper on the subject of fundamentalists and the danger they posed to the government here. The role of democracy In Algeria, the government sought to introduce a ready-made model of democracy. But what is really important is what the people understand by democracy. For example, in November 1987, two days after I had become president, the minister of the interior told me that people who said they were homeless had tried to invade some newly-constructed buildings. They said that they had the right to invade them because under a democracy everyone had a right to a house. That was their understanding of democracy. It shows that the development of democracy is very much a matter of education and of progressing step by step. This approach does not mean there is no freedom or justice. Doing it by stages means first introducing it at the level of the schools and to avoid making wrong steps. In this we are being successful. Democracy is a matter of mentality and a way of life. People have to be taught. Democracy is an overall concept. It is not just politics but also health care, housing and the right to a job. There cannot be democracy without development, and there cannot be development without democracy. But freedom of expression alone does not necessarily bring jobs and drinking water for the people. If people are not mentally prepared for democracy it could be a catastrophe. The examples elsewhere in the world are obvious. The fundamentalists are basically the enemies of democracy. They struggle to take people back to the Middle Ages and the days of the Islamic caliphate. Where is the democracy in that? According to the laws and constitution of Tunisia, there is no room for religious parties. They will never happen here. We shall never embark on this course. It would be a catastrophe for this country and its people if we were ever to give permission for the formation of a religious party. As long as I am here, as president or not, I will continue to combat the creation of a religious party. That is my conviction. Tunisia's links with Europe, the Arab world and north Africa Tunisia's natural environment is constituted first by the Maghreb, then by the Arab world. To deny this would be to deny our very identity. But it is also true that Tunisia has always been linked economically with Europe, which is our major supplier of equipment and technology and our favoured partner in the commercial domain. What is more, Tunisia is one of the favourite destinations of European tourists. But these days there is also less room for co-operation among single countries alone. Instead they are very much coming to be seen as part of larger groupings. So we are trying to co-operate with the Maghreb Union, which adds extra weight to our co-operation with the EU. On establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel Tunisia has unfailingly provided our Palestinian brothers and sisters with active support for the re-establishment of their legitimate national rights. Our relief and optimism at the signing of agreements between the PLO and Israel were felt all the more strongly because of the considerable contribution we made. It appears that the Palestinian problem is on the path to a lasting political solution. But we cannot say the problem has been truly solved until the Palestinians have recovered all their legitimate rights. We will avoid making any hasty decisions that might compromise their interests, and at the same time we will continue to provide our full support for the peace process. On the future of Tunisia Previously an underdeveloped country, we have been successful in getting to the intermediate stage and it is my ambition that we should be a member of the family of democratic nations. That is a political decision. I have been urging Tunisians to work harder. Now I am urging them to work better in order to catch up with the developed countries, to be competitive with them, especially in the event of there being a free trade zone with the European Union. We have to enhance the quality of our goods. Whoever consumes what he does not produce is not truly independent.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied Partnership suspended SHARES OF Allied Partnership Group, the environmental contractor and forklift truck distributor, were suspended at 9 3/4 p yesterday pending clarification of its financial state. The suspension comes less than four months after Mr Martyn Rose, chairman and chief executive, said in releasing details of interim losses, that the balance sheet had been strengthened by the Pounds 7.44m raised in a share placing and offer. The 3-for-5 offer, announced last June, was priced at 17p. It raised net assets to over Pounds 30m and cut debt to about Pounds 22m. In December 1990, gearing had reached 125 per cent and a banking agreement had been breached. The placing document said the breaches had been waived and the facility reconfirmed until December this year.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Management: Academe plc - John Authers on a new trend in university appointments Executives from the world of commerce might have a place at university high tables. Today's appointment of Elizabeth Esteve-Coll, director of the Victoria and Albert museum, as the next vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia is only the latest of several moves by universities to recruit entrepreneurial talent from outside academe. The trend is most accentuated in the 'new' universities which converted from polytechnics in 1992, but older institutions are also spreading their net wider. For example, University College London now has Derek Roberts, a former research director for GEC, the electronics company, as its provost. Under his direction the college has amassed government research ratings bettered only by Oxford and Cambridge, and also built a much envied enterprise scheme to provide services for businesses. It is prospering in the competition for both public- and private-sector funds. This competition, intensifying as universities proliferate and funds become scarcer, has spurred academic selection committees to look for people with experience of industrial management, and also with presentational skills. According to Raymond Frostick, who chaired East Anglia's selection committee for the appointment, the assessors were looking for unorthodox qualities in an academic: 'The ability to promote and market the university to the outside world is extremely important, while at the same time having a clear conception as to what happens when managing a complex organisation.' Half of East Anglia's final shortlist of eight for the post held jobs outside the university environment, and the university even employed head-hunters Saxton Bampfylde for the first time. The company had already found vice-chancellors for four other universities - Leeds, South Bank, Southampton and York. Stephen Bampfylde, director, says: 'The real process skill we look for is that of managing knowledge-based professionals.' This threw the field open to managers of large accountancy firms or book publishers, for example. He defines what he was looking for as a management style which involves 'the ability to articulate a vision and then a gentle ability to herd people along with a hand rather than a heavy boot.' It was also important to find someone who could command the intellectual respect of the academic staff, even if it was no longer necessary to recruit a renowned scholar. This approach involves a sharp change in standard management styles for higher education. According to Ted Nield of the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals, which represents all UK universities: 'Traditionally, being a vice-chancellor is a bit like being a sheepdog. You have to get everyone moving in the same direction but you do it by chivvying from behind, as opposed to holding a banner at the front.' Now, rather than the stately and collegial process of persuading colleagues to agree on a course of action, vice-chancellors are taking on the role of American college presidents, and acting as figureheads. At De Montfort University, a fast-growing former polytechnic in Leicester, of which Esteve-Coll is a governor, different departments have transparent budgets and work to targets in a stark, but so far successful, move away from the traditional collegial style. Academic sensitivities remain too strong for this to be taken too far, however. According to Frostick: 'I certainly think we have found a flag-waver. But there is a university community, and the job is still not like being a managing director of a commercial organisation. There is still a lot of persuasion involved.' See Arts page</p>

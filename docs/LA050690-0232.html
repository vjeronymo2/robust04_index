			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A;  </P> <P> ARCHIE MAKES A MOVIE FOR NBC  </P> <P> "Archie: To Riverdale and Back Again," the first live-action movie based on the  characters from the popular Archie comic books, airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on NBC.  Michael Silberkleit, the publisher and chairman of Archie Comic Publications  Inc., talked about Archie and his colorful history with Susan King.  </P> <P>  Why has it taken so long for Archie to become a live-action film?  </P> <P> We started on TV in 1969 with the animated show and were on for seven years,  and have tried over the years to get people interested in doing a live Archie  show. Unfortunately, there were other properties that were hotter. There was  more interest in adventure characters. But it's our turn. There's a movement  back to nostalgia and away from violence.  </P> <P> Were you reluctant to have Archie and the gang depicted as adults in their 30s?  </P> <P> It would be silly for me to say that I wasn't. To me and to my partner (Richard  Goldwater) and my son and people who work for us, Archie is a real live human  being. He really exists. But people do grow up. Obviously, he's not going to  take drugs, get drunk, break the law or molest children. It's still true to the  Riverdale motif. It's still the same old Archie. We are not going to do  anything to screw up the character.  </P> <P> Why has Archie maintained its popularity over 49 years?  </P> <P> Archie is everyman to everybody. He lives in middle America. Archie is who you  wish you were but aren't.  </P> <P> Have you kept Archie contemporary?  </P> <P> By all means. Our writers are instructed to constantly read the latest  magazines. Whatever is going on in the world will find itself into a story in  some degree. Magazines carry public service messages on "Say No to Drugs." The  Archie "Say No to Drugs" message is on over a billion-and-a-half milk cartons.  We have addressed the AIDS situation and missing children in public service  announcements.  </P> <P> How many copies of Archie comics are sold yearly?  </P> <P> We sell about 15 million a year. Some come out monthly and some come out every  other month. We have about 40-50 different titles. We are constantly expanding  our line.  </P> <P> Kids really believe Archie lives because they call here and ask to speak to  Archie. Sometimes I am Archie, and sometimes Richard is Archie, but we talk to  them. We have an answering machine on the weekends, and then you can see how  many kids call from all over -- I'm talking from South Africa, New Zealand and  Japan.  </P> <P> Are there any other Archie projects in the offing?  </P> <P> I am working on an Archie fast-food restaurant. I want it to be healthy, low  cholesterol, low-fat food. We have signed a licensing deal for a line of  clothing for adults, and we signed an agreement with Warner Bros. to do a live  feature like "Batman," but without the violence.  </P></p>

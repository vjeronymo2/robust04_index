			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / TGWU chief attacks 'intimidating' faction Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU, Britain's largest industrial union, has warned his union officers that the organisation faces serious internal conflict from a group of members who he alleges are resorting to intimidation in trying to achieve their ends with the threat of occupying union property. In a circular sent this month to all TGWU branch secretaries, officers and staff, Mr Morris says the union is involved in a 'struggle for democracy and decency'. His unprecedented outburst follows the occupation of the union's national computer centre in Newcastle on July 6 by Mr John Farrell, a former TGWU trade group secretary on Merseyside, and at least 30 of his supporters. The group was protesting over the dismissal in June of Mr Farrell on various conduct-related grounds, which the TGWU said included abuse of dispute benefit payments. Mr Farrell took court action, which ultimately failed, to prevent his dismissal - but he plans to appeal against his dismissal at the union's biennial conference in June next year. Last night Mr Farrell denied the charges of intimidation in the occupation of the computer centre. 'If he (Mr Morris) believes this, why has he not called in the police?' asked Mr Farrell. In his circular Mr Morris says: 'A member of the union's staff was subjected to intimidation in the course of an action which had the effect of halting the provision of services to the union's membership. The attack disrupted the administration of the union, resulting in delay to union benefits being paid and payments to TGWU pensioners.' Mr Farrell said last night that the official concerned, who had held the key to the office, had not reported the matter to the police. The TGWU leader has told the union's officers that the assault on the union was 'every bit as serious as any external challenge which we have faced over the past 15 years'. The union's finance and general purposes committee has condemned Mr Farrell's temporary seizure of the building. Mr Morris has told officials that when Mr Farrell and his supporters left the computer centre they were reported to have 'threatened that more so-called direct occupations would follow'. Their occupation followed a number of internal union disciplinary hearings over Mr Farrell's case that started in February and ended on June 17 when the union's general executive council decided to dismiss him. In the early stages of the affair Mr Farrell sought a High Court injunction against the TGWU, claiming the procedures for the disciplinary hearing against him were unfair and against natural justice. The judge dismissed Mr Farrell's case after four days. The union is now seeking to reclaim substantial legal costs from him over the court proceedings. Mr Morris says in his letter to TGWU officials: 'I know you will share my determination that we cannot allow intimidation to deter us from following our democratic rules and procedures which have served the union well for seventy-two years.'</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Moi's new cabinet fails to inspire foreign confidence KENYAN president Daniel arap Moi yesterday announced a new cabinet which is unlikely to inspire domestic or foreign confidence in his adminstration. Initial reactions were negative from western donors, who were hoping for positive signals on economic reforms and clean government before resuming about Dollars 400m (Pounds 261m) of suspended aid. The president, who has struggled to put together a competent cabinet since his narrow victory in marred multi-party elections last month, has formed a government which rewarded the tribes and personalities which supported him at the polls. Kenya's two most dominant tribes, the Luo and the Kikuyu, have been largely excluded after voting against Mr Moi and the ruling Kanu party. Mr Moi has retained some of the 15 defeated ministers by using his power to nominate 12 members of parliament. Western donors expressed disappointment. 'It's a hard-line Kanu government without any sign of being able to build consensus,' said one senior western economist. 'We can't expect better economic policy from this bunch. Moi's wasted a golden opportunity.' Professor George Saitoti remains vice president but Mr Moi removed him from the finance post replacing it with planning and national development. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, a 32-year-old politician from western Kenya, becomes the finance minister. 'This means Moi and Saitoti unfortunately keep control of economic policy,' said the economist. In the new trimmed cabinet of 25 nine former ministers have been reappointed. Two of them, trounced in the elections, retained cabinet posts after Mr Moi nominated them to parliament. They are Mr Joseph Kamotho, education minister, and the only Kikuyu in the cabinet, and Mr Dalmas Otieno, transport minister, the only Luo. The cabinet shows a continuation of Mr Moi's policy of ethnic balancing but it has a heavy bias towards his Rift Valley province, home to his Kalenjin tribe and other minority pastoral tribes such as the Masai. Also rewarded strongly are the Kamba tribe from eastern province, the Luhya from western province, and the Kisii from Nyanza province.</p>

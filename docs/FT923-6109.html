			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Import rise doubles UK motor industry deficit THE UK motor industry's trade deficit more than doubled in the first half of this year to Pounds 1.37bn from Pounds 617m in the same period of 1991. The first-half figure was greater than the Pounds 1bn deficit for the whole of 1991. The deficit in the second quarter more than trebled, from Pounds 276m to Pounds 834m, as a surge in car imports was accompanied by a fall in car exports, sharply reversing the earlier positive trend. The motor industry is becoming concerned that new car stocks in the UK have reached excessive levels. The surge in car imports in the second quarter was fuelled by carmakers' expectations of a significant rise in new car demand in August, traditionally the most important month for sales because of the new prefix on car registrations. But the recovery has failed to materialise. Figures released yesterday show that new car registrations of 290,550 in the first 20 days of August were only 0.9 per cent higher than the depressed level in the same period a year ago. Sales have failed to rally in spite of big spending on marketing by carmakers, including widespread dealer discounting, manufacturer cash rebates and offers such as free insurance, free road fund licence and low-cost finance. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders warned yesterday that the scale of the increase in imports coupled with the poor state of domestic demand 'must increase the risk of stock problems in the months to come'. Ford and Rover are two companies which have already been forced to impose short-time working on several of their UK vehicle assembly lines in order to cut production and reduce bloated stock levels. The rebound in imports of automotive products is evident in all sectors of the industry. The value of imports of parts and accessories in the first six months of this year jumped by 11 per cent to Pounds 2.9bn, while the value of car imports increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.4bn. The value of commercial vehicle imports rose by 30.7 per cent to Pounds 396m. Car imports surge breaks trend, Page 6 Ford plant to build engines for Jaguar, Page 6</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAST BREAK;  </P> <P> VANS UNMATCHED IN QUICKLY FILLING ORDERS FOR CUSTOM SHOES  </P> <P> When it comes to colors, few shoemakers can rival Vans. The company's canvas  sneakers are sold in more than 30 different shades and prints, from red  checkerboard to little green fish swimming through a sea of black-and-white  swirls.  </P> <P> But when a retailer recently placed a large order for sneakers in bright  purple, green and orange, Vans didn't have them. But the shoe manufacturer  promised that it could make them -- fast.  </P> <P> And therein lies the Vans secret.  </P> <P> "There's no shoe company that can respond as quickly," boasted company  President Richard Leeuwenburg, sinking back onto a couch while pointing the  waffle soles of his light-colored Vans sneakers at a visitor.  </P> <P> As it turned out, the retailer had uncovered a fashion trend that had eluded  the rest of the shoe industry. The purple, green and orange shoes are expected  to be so popular with the back-to-school crowd that Vans is featuring them in  its billboard ads.  </P> <P> Vans, founded in 1966 as the Van Doren Rubber Co., rose to dizzying success in  the wake of the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." Actor Sean Penn wore  a pair of checkerboard Vans in the film, sparking a wave of teen-age copycats  who snatched up every pair they could find.  </P> <P> Hoping to cash in on its hit product, Van Doren Rubber expanded quickly by  building new stores -- too quickly, as it turned out. When the fad died out,  sales plummeted and the company suddenly was stuck with the big debt incurred  during its expansion. By 1984, the company had filed for protection from  creditors in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. But it didn't stay there  long.  </P> <P> The company emerged a year later and was sold to a Menlo Park venture capital  firm, McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co. Leeuwenburg (the similarity between his name  and the venture capital firm's is only coincidental) took over the company and  has embarked on a strategy of expansion beyond Southern California. The  48-year-old executive said the East Coast and foreign markets are ripe for  expansion.  </P> <P> He said the shoes are especially popular in Mexico and Europe. Sales in Mexico  would have been even better, Leeuwenburg said, except for a counterfeit ring  that flooded the Mexican market with cheaply made knockoffs of Vans shoes. The  counterfeit ring was broken up by Mexican authorities, but not before the  company lost an estimated $4 million in profits in 1989.  </P> <P> Hoping that the counterfeiting problem is behind it, Leeuwenburg predicts a  strong year for the shoemaker. At least one industry observer agrees.  </P> <P> "That whole fashion-active look . . . is one of the biggest-growing  categories," said Dick Silverman, editor of the 30,000-circulation Footwear  News, a New York-based trade publication. "That market overall is in good  shape."  </P> <P> The key to the company's success, Leeuwenburg said, is the ability of the  1,500-employee manufacturing plant to handle special orders as well as the  company's stock. The flexibility also allows the company to quickly adopt new  fabrics or colors into its lines so that it can stay on the cutting edge of  fashion.  </P> <P> A quarter of the 75,000 pairs of shoes that the company manufactures this year  will be custom-ordered. Customers can select shoes in different colors and  shades from the company's catalogue, and retailers can place special orders for  large volumes. Custom shoes cost $2 to $5 more than the usual $30 price tag.  </P> <P> The company's most popular model, a lace-up sneaker, has not changed in design  since its introduction in 1966. But by constantly adding new colors of canvas  or stripes, the look can be simply updated, he said.  </P> <P> Leeuwenburg acknowledges that Vans is a bit player in an industry dominated by  the likes of Nike and Reebok. The company holds less than 10% of the sport shoe  market and has its highest profile in Southern California, where it has 59  company-owned retail stores. Its shoes are also sold by some large retail  chains such as the Foot Locker.  </P> <P> Vans had sales of about $70 million for its fiscal year ended in May. The  privately held company does not disclose its profits.  </P> <P> The company focuses its marketing efforts on its core customer group: males  ages 9 to 19. It markets its shoes as a unique alternative to regular sport  shoes.  </P> <P> "The product itself is fun," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Company News: First-half turnround at Austria's Girocredit GIROCREDIT, Austria's third-largest bank, reported a 68 per cent rise in bank operating income to Sch895m (Dollars 75m) for the first half of 1993, marking a turnround from the sharp profit decline of 1992. Mr Hans Haumer, chairman, said he expected the bank to achieve operating earnings of about Sch1.7bn for the full year, up 30 per cent. He said the improvement was due to a larger interest margin following the decline in European interest rates and strong gains in fee and trading income. After heavy losses on foreign lending in the previous years, the bank has boosted domestic loan activities while reducing its international exposure, Mr Haumer said. Balance sheet assets climbed a moderate 2 per cent to Sch329bn in the first half and are expected to increase by 3 to 4 per cent for the full year.</p>

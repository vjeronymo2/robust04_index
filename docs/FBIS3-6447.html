			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Keiko Ito: "Totally </F> Bogged Down MITI"]    [Text] According to statements by some section heads in  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], a  special meeting of senior officers was held at the ministry on  the afternoon of 8 February. Those attending were the  administrative vice minister, director of the minister's  secretariat, directors general of each bureau, heads of  divisions in the secretariat, and so on, all members of regular  ministerial discussions.    At this meeting, an A4-size paper entitled "Proposed  Comments  on Economic Stimulus Measures" was reportedly distributed to all  members. The word processor had produced such entries as:  "Point 1. Welcome and highly evaluate the decision on the  largest-ever economic stimulus measures which will exceed Y  [Yen] 15 trillion (...omitted). 2. Support the government's  idea to attempt to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio."  "Model 1. Highly evaluate the government's decision for  putting forward the largest-ever Y15 trillion economic stimulus  measures, which include Y6 trillion in income tax/residence tax  reductions (...omitted)...."    One section head explained to Administrative Vice Minister  Hideaki Kumano that they were planning to send this document to  economic organizations.    On 8 February the government decided upon and announced  comprehensive economic measures. This paper was the "example"  which they wanted leaders of economic organizations to use when  making comments to the media. It told them to evaluate the  government stimulus measures along these lines.    Vice Minister Kumano was said to have made the point: "Isn't  it rather inappropriate to use a `model'?"    But by then, this paper had already been faxed to four  business organizations.    It was faxed twice to the Federation of Economic  Organizations [Keidanren].    The first fax was received by the Finance Division at around  11 in the morning. It was addressed to Management Director  Keijiro Koyama. But this paper was entitled "Proposed Comments  on the Tax Reduction Issue." The content of this paper was  almost identical as the "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus  Measures," but numbers such as "Y6 trillion in income tax  reductions" and "Y15 trillion in economic stimulus measures"  were not included. It was around noon that day when the  coalition government, which had been discussing economic  stimulus measures, agreed on "proceeding with a Y6 trillion tax  reduction." The concrete economic measures were announced that  evening. Adjustment seems to have also been made in the MITI  example, reflecting this decision.  <H5>  "Not A High-Level Composition" </H5>   The "Proposed Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," which  included the contents as announced, was sent to the four  organizations between three and four in the afternoon.    It must have been compiled in a great hurry: there were  typographical errors such as "to secure the source of revenue  for the tax reduction" and irregular indentations.    People who were involved say: "There were some passages in  which I could not tell what the subject of the sentence was. We  thought it was a badly written, hard to read document."    The other three organizations received only the "Proposed  Comments on Economic Stimulus Measures," but by the time the fax  arrived, all these organizations had already made their leaders'  comments public. The result was that the "unheard of" guidance  by fax only made the businessmen laugh.    "It was insulting," according to Managing Director Masaji  Shinagawa of the Japanese Association of Corporate Executives.    "It did not affect us," said Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa of  Keidanren.    One staff member of a business organization angrily said:  "We are not kids. We can make our own judgments. The  government does not have to instruct us."  <H5>  Industrial Policy Bureau Director-General Position Was Vacant </H5>   On 14 February, when the proposed comments became known in  the newspapers, at his regular news conference Vice Minister  Kumano answered: "I did not know anything (about sending out  the proposed comments)." He then explained that the paper was a  memorandum prepared by a staff member of the Industrial Policy  Bureau staff for internal use only to clarify matters in his own  mind. It was not intended to force others to accept this  thinking.    "There were some inappropriate expressions which we regret."    However, he said "it is not clear" who prepared and faxed  it.    According to Hiroshi Yokokawa, head of the General  Coordination Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau, on 8  February the Industrial Policy Bureau resembled combat on a  battlefield.    The government's plan for a tax increase and a tax reduction  had changed twice and three times respectively since the 3  February early morning commotion over a national welfare tax.  Everyday the government parties negotiated within the  coalition. At midday on 8 February, the outline was finally  decided upon. The Industrial Policy Bureau was extremely busy  working in preparation for the evening news conference. It is  said that in these chaotically busy conditions, some junior  staff member might have produced the "proposed comments" and  faxed them.    "When policies are announced, we often receive questions  from the business sector as to what the significance is. That  document was a point paper that staff members had for dealing  with such questions. However, it was a mistake to have faxed  it."    There has been no director general for the Industrial Policy  Bureau since 24 December of last year. The director general  until then was Masahisa Naito. He submitted his resignation  when he was told to do so on the grounds he had given  preferential personnel treatment to the eldest son of the former  administrative vice minister.    As of 15 February, Director General Tomio Tsutsumi assumed  the position in the Industrial Policy Bureau, which is the most  senior position among the directors general in MITI. But at the  time of the faxing incident, Administrative Vice Minister Kumano  was holding it as an additional position.  <H5>  Anxious Because Imperfections Have Became Noticeable </H5>   MITI admits that "guidance" by fax is unheard of. But it is  also a fact that, before announcing major policies, phone calls  from MITI are always made to economic organizations soliciting  them to "please offer a favorable comment."    Naito, who was popular among people in the business sector  because "he was not like a petty official and had a broader  personality," had been performing this function of making phone  calls from the time he became director of the Secretariat.    According to a person involved in the economic  organizations:  "Until now they have been working things out in advance  [nemawashi], relying on intuitive good timing. But this time,  because they have no director general, they messed things up."    The tax reduction is limited to one year. There is no  prospect for a source of revenue. The comprehensive economic  stimulus measures of the coalition government reflected the  internal situation of the coalition government, which consisted  of a "pickup team." Imperfections were noticeable in the  content of the measures. Some economists say: "Weren't they  too impatient because they thought they could not get the  economic sector to provide a strong evaluation of such  countercyclical measures?"    But MITI's apprehension turned out to be groundless, and  comments by leaders of the business sector all welcomed the  stimulus measures.    Chairman Ken Moroi of Chichibu Cement Co. Ltd., who is also  vice chairman of Keidanren, these days often senses a "tragic"  feeling coming from MITI.    There is a great recession, historically unprecedented.  There is the somewhat unclear meaning of the U.S.-Japan  alliance relationship in the post-Cold War era. He sees this as  a time when we cannot use the old manuals for domestic politics  and foreign policy.    "When there was a clear goal to strive for economic growth  and to catch up with the developed countries, it was an era when  the bureaucrats could be most active. Because there is no need  to create anything new, they only have to think up ways to  proceed most efficiently toward the goal. But today Japan has  to create the goals itself. This cannot be done by bureaucrats."    To create new goals is essentially a task for politics. But  he says that, under the continuously chaotic coalition  government, the Japanese bureaucrats are driven by a sense of  duty to the effect that "we must do the job."    At the end of last year also, Chairman Moroi was astonished  when MITI Administrative Vice Minister Kumano called on him,  together with Ministry of Finance Administrative Vice Minister  Jiro Saito.    "It must have been the first time in history that two vice  ministers from the greatest ministries come together to ask for  a favor."    After greetings by Vice Minister Saito, Vice Minister Kumano  made an appeal for an understanding on the argument for  consolidating the tax increase and tax reduction. The two vice  ministers were said to have desperately tried to persuade him  that the next 15 months would be the period which would  determine the destiny of the Japanese economy. They said that  during this period, the government would mobilize every possible  policy measure to achieve the recovery of good economic  conditions, and for that purpose the sources of revenue would be  used up. Therefore the consumption tax must be raised to 7  percent in the future....    Some in the economic sector also point out that "it just  happened to show up symbolically in MITI that the bureaucrats  are running about in confusion as things change."  <H5>  Reform Movement Within the Junior Ranks </H5>   In this style of MITI, there is also movement for reform.  Two or three years ago, when the recession had become serious,  a "junior officers study group" emerged in MITI. Originally  this was a study group initiated by 25 people who had entered  the ministry in 1980. They held discussions in the evening,  mainly over dinner.    Topics included the structural recession, the reduced  population of people of a productive age, aging, women's  advancement in society, and the collapse of the seniority system.    "The old bureaucratic office system has become fatigued. We  wanted to think how MITI should respond to this time of  transition," says Hisato Nagao, deputy head of the General  Coordination Division in the minister's Secretariat and the  person who called for the study group.    Centering on the officers in charge of laws and ordinances  in each division, it has expanded the circle to younger people.  Current participating members number around 400 who entered the  ministry between 1980 to 1989. To collect concrete policy  proposals from this younger generation, they have been meeting  several times each month, in groups based on the same entry  year, since last October.    Ironically, it was in the midst of such activity that the  issue involving Director General Naito and the fax incident  occurred.    According to one of the initiators of the study group, Seiji  Hagiwara, deputy division head in the General Coordination  Division of the Industrial Policy Bureau: "It is a fact that  the study group has become a platform for considering the issue  of how to deal with the changing environment. Everyone thought  MITI's role was being questioned by society, and we had to brace  ourselves. But all we can do is to reply by putting forward  solid policies as bureaucrats."    [Following is the content of the faxed paper]  <H3>  Proposed Comments on the Economic Stimulus Measures </H3> Point 1. Welcome and highly evaluate the decision on the  largest-ever economic stimulus measures which will exceed Y15  trillion. (...omitted) 2. Support the government's idea to  attempt to correct the direct and indirect tax ratio. 3. Come  to a rapid conclusion on a national consensus for tax reform  discussion, including tax revenue sources. 4. Achieve rapid  implementation through rapid formation of budget and tax  legislation.  Model 1. Highly evaluate the government's decision for putting  forward the largest-ever Y15 trillion economic stimulus  measures, which include Y6 trillion in income tax/residence tax  reductions, corporation special taxes, automobile consumption  taxes, and so on. (mention appropriate contents) 2. Support  the government's idea to correct the direct and indirect tax  ratio from the standpoint of to secure the source for lost tax  revenues such as income taxes, and attempts to review what the  people's burden should be in relation to the increased expense  of an aged society. 3. As for the revenue source issue, it has  been decided that the discussion is to continue. But  considering it will be the people themselves who pay the debts  in the end, we want you to make a responsible judgment quickly.  As the time of a full-scale aged society is approaching, we  also want you to settle on a discussion to achieve tax system  reform with a national consensus, and to make efforts to pass  the legislation within the year. 4. Expect the government to  attempt to quickly pass the third supplemental budget, the  original 1994 budget, and budget legislation-related bills--such  as tax system related legislation--at an early date, and that  the stimulation measures will be quickly implemented.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 21 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH  has said that the downing of two U.S. helicopters by U.S.  aircraft over northern Iraq has revealed the broad rejection of  the U.S. policies of hegemony, violence, and aggression.    In an article today entitled "The Downing of the U.S.  Helicopters Is First Drops of Rain," the paper adds: Numerous  facts will certainly be revealed about similar U.S. crimes which  used to be kept secret or forgotten, now that, after the downing  of the two U.S. helicopters, the White House can no longer  conceal these cheap and lowly adventures after they have been  exposed to the whole world.    AL-QADISIYAH adds: Such mistakes will continue to be made  without any justification apart from the U.S. grudge against  peoples and the desire to control and dominate them. No wonder,  therefore, that this topic has drawn the attention of the world  media. The paper continues: Everyone is aware of the tragedies  of wars and military interventions led by the United States in  the world. Everyone recalls, in particular, the U.S. crimes in  Vietnam, Panama, Nicaragua, Korea, and Iraq as well as the  distress caused to both the American people and the world as a  result of the reckless U.S. policy.    The paper wonders how the American people feel regarding the  many U.S. soldiers who died in the U.S. wars, and who are left  with only memories. The paper concludes that history will  uncover the folded pages even if they are concealed by the dust  of years or the smoke of intelligence services and those  revolving in their orbit.</p>

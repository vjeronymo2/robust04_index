			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elena Polidori report: "Race for Succession Under Way"] </F>   [Excerpt] Rome -- Lamberto Dini will be the new budget  minister, so as of now the race to succeed him as director  general of the Bank of Italy is officially under way.    There are two scenarios that are most likely. The first is a  freeze on the post and a transfer of the functions to one of the  deputy directors, the "old boy" Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, or the  new arrival, Vincenzo Desario. This would involve asking the  Bank's high council, the body that decides in such matters, for  a sort of leave. This already happened once in 1919 with  Bonaldo Stringher, who was appointed to the Treasury Ministry.  Nevertheless, there are those at the Bank who point to the  anomaly of this kind of choice, because the governor, holding a  dialogue with Minister Dini, would have to make do with one of  his subordinates, even if he is "in the freezer."    The second scenario, which is considered more likely, has it  that the appointment of the new director general will come from  outside, as, in fact, happened with Dini himself, who was called  to Rome by the International Monetary Fund, where he served as  director for Italy. Thus, by analogy, there are those who feel  that Massimo Russo, the IMF official for Europe, will be put  forward as a candidate. However, the name of Rainer Masera, the  director general of IMI [Italian Institute for Financing  Personal and Real Property], is also making the rounds, while  two possible candidates -- Cesare Geronzi, director general of  the Bank of Rome, and Mario Draghi, director general of the  Treasury -- have let it be known that there is no question of  them being involved.    Lastly, it is felt that an internal succession is highly  unlikely, as this would mean advancing careers within the  directorate by inserting a new functionary. Or, Padoa Schioppa  could be promoted and some 10 new general officials would make  their way into the control room.    Officially, the choice is up to the high council, which has  to be convened by the governor. However, the budget minister  has a certain amount of influence in the complex appointment  procedure. To put it technically: There are 13 members on the  council plus the governor. The deliberations begin with the  favorable vote of two-thirds of those present, provided that  two-thirds of the members are present. A date for the  convocation has not yet been set, but there is no doubt that the  councillors will be in Rome on 31 May for the Bank's meeting.  [passage omitted]</p>

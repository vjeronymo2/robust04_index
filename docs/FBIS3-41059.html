It is based  on foreign media content and behavior and is issued without  coordination with other U.S. Government components.]    [Analysis Note] In anticipation of a showdown with  the Ukrainian parliament following the recent signing of the  trilateral U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons,  Ukrainian government officials have mounted a campaign to win  parliament's acquiescence in the agreement, arguing that  Ukraine's refusal to bend under Russian and world pressure has  led to an agreement that meets the conditions laid down in the  parliament's 18 November 1993 resolution on the START-I Treaty.  In contrast, Russian officials--in a strategy Ukrainian  opponents of the deal are likely to use against it--have  suggested just the reverse, portraying the agreement as a  vindication of their own strategy of marshaling international  pressure on Ukraine to relinquish the nuclear arsenal deployed  on its territory. Meanwhile, in a development likely to further  diminish chances that the current Ukrainian parliament will go  along with the deal, Russian and Ukrainian officials have  expressed differing interpretations of a key provision of the  accord on relief of Ukraine's energy debt to Russia.    The Ukrainian government has begun an uncharacteristically  agressive battle with opponents in the Rada to win the  parliament's acquiescence in the trilateral agreement signed by  Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on 14 January. Since  returning to Kiev following the signing ceremony in Moscow,  Kravchuk and other key Ukrainian government and military  officials have mounted an offensive stressing that the agreement  will provide security and economic benefits to Ukraine and  enhance the country's international stature as well.  <H5>  Kravchuk on the Offensive </H5>   Both Kravchuk and the cabinet appear to be committed to  defending the agreement. Kravchuk, en route to Moscow on 13  January, suggested willingness to risk his political career by  signing the accord, saying the "career of a politician cannot  compare with the global problem we are solving" (Interfax, 13  January). At a press conference held on his return to Kiev,  Kravchuk lambasted domestic critics of the agreement who, he  said, had accused the government of buckling under pressure from  Russia and the United States and bringing Ukraine "to its  knees." Calling such statements "absurd," Kravchuk claimed that  the critics are "a minority" and "demonstrate their total  ignorance." He took pains to dispel any impression that Ukraine  had yielded to Russian or U.S. pressure, asserting that the  agreement resulted from an understanding by Russia and the  United States of Kiev's problems rather than "pressure or arm  twisting" (Interfax, 14 January). Ukraine's negotiators,  Kravchuk said, had remained steadfast in promoting the country's  interests, thereby raising Ukraine's political prestige and  image as a nation whose "policies are predictable" (Kiev radio,  14 January). Kravchuk and other officials used the same  argument in winning the endorsement of the Ukrainian Cabinet of  Ministers on the eve of the signing, suggesting that the  government will maintain a united front on the issue. According  to Kiev radio (13 January), the government leaders praised "the  active stand of Ukraine's representatives" in the trilateral  negotiations in December and January, saying it produced "the  essential progress" toward the agreement which would "guarantee  our state's security and promise it considerable economic  benefits."  <H5>  Economic Benefits </H5>   In an apparent effort to gain maximum leverage from the  economic benefits of the agreement, Ukrainian officials have  played up not only the benefits specified in the agreement, such  as fuel rods for Ukrainian power reactors, but others they argue  will accrue from improved relations with the United States,  Russia, and the West resulting from the agreement:    -- Kravchuk, in his 14 January press conference in Kiev,  said  the agreement opens the way for expanded economic assistance  from the United States, "international financial organizations,  and Russia" (Kiev radio, 14 January).    -- In a roundtable discussion broadcast on Kiev radio (15  January), Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko cited the U.S.  commitment to establish a foundation for small businesses, a  $155 million allocation to Ukraine by the United States for  "economic reform," and "a whole series of specific projects and  programs"--including, according to Defense Minister Vitaliy  Radetskyy, U.S. assistance in providing housing for  servicemen--expected to result from the pending visit to the  United States of a Ukrainian economic delegation. Zlenko also  hinted that the United States would increase the $175 million in  dismantlement assistance it has promised Ukraine. "We know what  other reserves they are talking about and, of course, we will be  able to get access to those reserves so as to increase this  sum," Zlenko said without elaboration.    -- In a similar vein, Deputy Prime Minister Deputy Shmarov,  in remarks paraphrased by Kiev radio on 17 January, said  Ukraine's denuclearization "will enable Ukraine to receive  international financial aid, including much needed investment to  help resolve defense conversion issues, overcome the economic  crisis, and provide for the social protection of our people"  (Kiev radio, 17 January).  <H5>  Security Guarantees </H5>   Government officials evidently feel that the issue of  security guarantees presents the greatest challenge in their  efforts to sell the agreement at home. They indirectly  acknowledged that Ukraine had failed in its effort to obtain  legally binding security guarantees from the United States and  Russia, and highlighted instead the multilateral security  guarantees accruing to nonnuclear parties to the  Nonproliferation Treaty and emphasized Russia's pledge not to  use economic pressure against Ukraine:    -- Clearly uncomfortable when asked repeatedly about  security  guarantees for Ukraine, Kravchuk, in his 14 January press  conference, responded vaguely, at one point suggesting that  security guarantees are not very meaningful. "Security does not  mean signed documents," Kravchuk said, stressing instead that  the road to security begins with "civilized" policies. When  pressed further, Kravchuk cited the tripartite agreement's  pledge to "respect the territorial integrity, inviolability of  borders, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine." Kravchuk  added that by joining the NPT, "those security guarantees will  acquire a more specific, precise nature." And he noted that  Russia had pledged not to use "economic pressure" against  Ukraine.    -- Zlenko, in contrast, was more self-assured on the issue  of  security guarantees in the 15 January roundtable discussion on  Kiev radio, asserting that Ukraine had successfully won  "multilateral" assurances of security through the NPT process  rather than mere "bilateral" assurances and adding that France  had also offered security guarantees. Underscoring his point,  Zlenko asked, "Do you understand what we are talking about?  What does it mean for our state, which is still unsteady on its  feet of independence, to receive political guarantees from  leading nuclear states? It is a guarantee protecting Ukraine's  political sovereignty."  <H5>  Military Endorsements </H5>   Ukrainian military officials also gave their stamp of  approval to the agreement affirming that the agreement  adequately protects Ukraine's security, and pointing out that  since Kiev does not control the nuclear weapons on its soil,  they afford Ukraine no real security:    -- In an 18 January press conference, Radetskyy said he  "fully supports" the agreement, adding, according to paraphrased  remarks, that Ukraine "is incapable of maintaining its own  nuclear weapons at the moment and would have to get rid of them  sooner or later" (Kiev UNIAN, 18 January). Earlier, Radetskyy  said "high-precision" conventional weapons are more valuable for  Ukraine's security and that he plans to report "in the near  future" to the defense Council on plans to "compensate for the  withdrawal of the nuclear weapons" (Kiev radio, 15 January).    -- In a similar vein, Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan  Oliynik said the nuclear arms in Ukraine had no bearing "on the  issues of our security. We do not control these weapons, we  cannot maintain them.... and we cannot but implement the  decision taken by our state to become non-nuclear in the  future." He also said Ukraine would "have to rely on our own  forces [and] create nonnuclear forces that can enable us to  ensure the protection of our state" (Kiev radio, 18 January).  <H5>  Safety Issue Played Up </H5>   In an unusual twist to support their efforts to sell the  agreement, Ukrainian officials have also adopted a Russian  argument, which until recently they had heatedly rebutted, that  the current physical condition of nuclear warheads in Ukraine is  deteriorating dangerously. In his 14 January news conference,  Kravchuk himself raised the prospect--often used by Russian  military officials--of a nuclear nightmare on Ukrainian soil,  saying Ukraine is "obliged to remove [the weapons] because they  are more dreadful than all the Chernobyl-type accidents taken  together," adding, "we cannot maintain them with due  responsibility for our future" (Kiev radio, 14 January). At an  18 January press conference, Kostyantyn Hryhschenko, chief of  disarmament for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reportedly said  warheads stored in Ukraine are increasingly unstable and pose a  serious environmental threat to Ukraine (UNIAR, Kiev radio, 18  January).  <H5>  Party and Legislative Reaction </H5>   Although some Ukrainian opposition leaders condemned the  agreement even before it had been signed and released, a number  of key legislators adopted a wait-and-see attitude while others  expressed support. Meanwhile, at a parliamentary meeting on 20  January, several relevant committees (foreign affairs, defense  and security, and legislation and legality) were instructed to  prepare by 25 January a "resolution" on the "compatibility" of  the trilateral agreement with the parliament's 18 November  resolution (UNIAN, 20 January).    Legislative Opponents. Some leaders of the main  opposition party People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh)  vituperatively opposed the agreement, although some other  leading members took a more moderate stand. Rukh Chairman  Vyacheslav Chornovil called the agreement "a national betrayal,"  and Les Tanyuk, a Rukh leader and member of the parliament's  presidium, asserted Ukraine had been brought "to its knees"  (UNIAN, AFP, 14 January; Interfax, 18 January). However,  another Rukh leader, Volodymyr Chernyak, was less harsh,  praising the agreement for opening possibilities for economic  cooperation and compensation, but faulting it for being short on  security guarantees (UNIAN, 13 January). Similarly, a statement  issued by the Conservative Republican Party, headed by the  well-known radical nationalist Stepan Khmara, reportedly claimed  that Kravchuk had "acted contrary to Ukraine's national  interests" in signing the agreement (Krasnaya Zvezda, 19  January). Mykhaylo Horyn, leader of the Ukrainian Republican  Party, keyed on Ukraine's national security interests, asserting  in an interview published on 12 January that Ukraine should  retain indefinitely the 46 SS-24 ICBMs deployed on Ukrainian  soil. Horyn urged Kravchuk not to sign the agreement, saying it  would be an "irreparable blunder" (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu).    Undecided Legislators. A number of key  legislators said that they needed to study the document before  taking a stand and claimed that if the accord did not meet the  conditions set out in parliament's 18 November resolution on  START-I they would oppose it. According to the Ukrainian news  agency UNIAR, parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch was "refraining  from comment" until the "relevant documents are studied" (15  January). Yuriy Kostenko, Minister of Environmental Protection  and head of the parliamentary commission on ratification of  START-I, was similarly cited by Russian media as saying that he  would "like to read the text" of the agreement before drawing  any "conclusions" about whether it conforms to the parliament's  conditions (ITAR-TASS, Moscow radio, 16 January). In April  1993, Kostenko was widely reported to have claimed that the  nuclear weapons on its territory made Ukraine a "nuclear state"  (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27 April 1993; Kiev radio, 28 April 1993).  According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Yevgeniy  Marmazov, deputy head of the parliament's foreign affairs  commission, told an interviewer that the legislature would "not  ratify the deal unless the conditions it had set" were met, but  he apparently did not draw any preliminary conclusion as to  whether the agreement met this test (14 January).    Supportive Legislators. Some legislative leaders  have reacted positively to the agreement, some citing the  participation of the United States in the accord and some the  economic benefits to Ukraine. Mykola Shulha, chairman of the  parliamentary committee for issues of state sovereignty and  inter-republic and inter-ethnic relations, told a Ukrainian  interviewer that he would "endeavor to convince" parliament to  support the agreement, arguing that Russian adherence to the  terms of the agreement was guaranteed by the "global authority  of such an influential state as America" (UNIAN, 14 January).  Vladimir Grinyev, former deputy head of parliament and leader  of the New Ukraine Movement, reportedly said that he is  "supportive" of the agreement and that Ukraine will "reap  economic dividends" from it (Interfax, 18 January).  <H5>  Russian Reaction </H5>   While Ukrainian officials have stressed the benefits of the  agreement to Ukraine, Russian officials have let it be known  that they view the agreement as the fruit of their and U.S.  efforts to pressure Ukraine to relinquish the nuclear arsenal on  its territory:    -- During in a joint press conference with President Clinton  on 14 January, Yeltsin did not demur when an ITAR-TASS  correspondent spoke of Russian efforts during Yeltsin's recent  visit to Brussels to get the United States and NATO "to exert  more influence" on Ukraine. Asked if his "hopes" on this score  had been justified, Yeltsin replied, "I think our hopes have  been justified extremely quickly" (Russian TV, 14 January).    -- An unnamed "senior official" of the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs reportedly told Interfax that the "extremely negative  reaction" by the world community--above all Russia and the  United States--to Kiev's earlier hesitant stand on the nuclear  question "was understood by Leonid Kravchuk" (1O January).    -- In a 12 January article in the government newspaper  Rossiyskaya Gazeta, commentator Vladimir Kuznechevskiy wrote  that Kravchuk was "unable to withstand the combined pressure of  the U.S. and Russian presidents" and had therefore "agreed" to  sign the document giving up nuclear weapons.    Russian officials may also view the trilateral signing as  evidence of tacit U.S. acknowledgment of the primacy of Russia's  role among states of the former Soviet Union. Member of the  Presidential Council Andranik Migranyan, in 17 January remarks  disseminated by ITAR-TASS, said that with the trilateral  agreement the United States had confirmed "Russia's special role  in maintaining stability on the territory of the post-Soviet  space." The same sentiment was expressed in a Nezavisimaya  Gazeta commentary on the trilateral talks (13 January), which  asserted that Yeltsin "managed to demonstrate the role his  country is playing in the former Soviet Union: Leonid Kravchuk  and Bill Clinton will negotiate on his territory and he himself  will be involved in the talks."  <H5>  Disagreement Over Compensation </H5>   A controversy over the possibility of debt relief for  Ukraine  as part of the trilateral agreement demonstrates a serious  divergence in the two sides' interpretation of the agreement.  Although it has been widely reported that Russia agreed in the  tripartite talks to write off all or part of Ukraine's energy  debt as compensation for tactical nuclear weapons removed from  Ukraine in 1992, (Interfax, 12 January; Moscow radio, 14  January), some Russian officials have denied such a possibility,  thereby angering Ukrainian officials who are trying to sell the  agreement on its economic merits. Kozyrev, in remarks on 14  January, said that "any write-off of the Ukrainian debt is out  of the question" (Interfax, 14 January). In addition, a senior  official of Gosprom, a leading Russian gas producer, said the  Russian government would "never" agree to compensate Ukraine for  denuclearization by writing off its energy debt (Interfax, 12  January). Zlenko reportedly reacted with "surprise and  disagreement" to Kozyrev's statement, saying, in remarks  paraphrased 14 January by Interfax, that a Ukrainian debt relief  "formula" was "laid down in the agreement." In a 14 January  press conference at the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, Kravchuk  said the "amount and form" of compensation for tactical nuclear  weapons removed from Ukraine in 1992 was yet to be determined,  but that "one option" was debt relief for Ukrainian energy  imports.  <H5>  Outlook </H5>   The number of Ukrainian legislators reserving judgement on  the agreement offers some hope that Kravchuk may be able to sway  the parliament's final reaction to the agreement, and Kravchuk  and the Ukrainian Government appear to be forcefully pushing the  agreement now. But in the past, Kravchuk has backed away from  controversial decisions, such as the signing of the Massandra  agreement with Russia, when the political heat rose. Moscow's  view of the trilateral agreement, which surely will not go  unnoticed in Ukraine, may raise the heat for Kravchuk by  undermining his strongest selling points: enhanced  international prestige and economic benefits. Kravchuk's  domestic opponents will likely use the Russians' statements that  the agreement was the product of pressure on Ukraine against  him, particularly as the campaign for Ukraine's 27 March  legislative election gets into full swing. The apparent  disagreement over debt relief to Ukraine is also likely to  complicate Kravchuk's effort to sell the agreement on its  economic merits and may raise additional difficulties when the  parties attempt to resolve outstanding issues of implementation.</p>

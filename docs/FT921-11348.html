			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Disarmament service offered THREE leading US armaments contractors, seeing a profits opportunity in the ending of the Cold War, have formed a new company with the grandiose title of International Disarmament Corporation to specialise in the dismantling of former Soviet nuclear weapons systems. The three are Lockheed, Olin and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, a unit of the energy services company McDermott International. Each will have a 33 per cent interest in IDC. The US defence industry as a whole faces a severe contraction over the next decade as the ending of the Cold War has produced a sharp drop in defence spending by the Pentagon. Companies have been pursuing a wide variety of different strategies to find new business, but this is thought to be the first company offering a disarmament service of this kind. IDC plans to offer its services to the four Commonwealth Independent States which hold weapons that previously made up the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Mr Troy Wade, president of IDC, said yesterday that the former Soviet Union was clearly capable of dismantling nuclear weapons, but it was unlikely that all of the four successor states had this expertise. The company does not see significant commercial opportunities in the US, where the government already has a well-organised weapons destruction industry, although it could bid for some of this work in future. Mr Wade said that while the scope for Soviet work was extremely uncertain, the kind of disarmament discussions taking place between President George Bush and Russian leader Mr Boris Yeltsin could lead to the destruction of 'thousands of warheads and a business worth billions of dollars over many years'. One of the spurs to the company's formation was a bill passed by the US Congress last year authorising the US to spend up to Dollars 400m to help Russia'a disarmament efforts. Lockheed, one of the largest defence contractors in the US, has great experience in the systems integration and the management of high technology programmes, including the US navy fleet's ballistic missile programme. Olin Ordnance specialises in high explosives and ammunition production and destruction, while Babcock has expertise in the manufacture and assembly of nuclear components, and nuclear materials processing. Mr Wade was formerly the senior career civil servant at the Department of Energy in Washington dealing with defence systems, and has experience of international weapons treaty verification.</p>

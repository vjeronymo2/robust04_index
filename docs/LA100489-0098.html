			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BLACKOUT AFFECTS ABOUT 1,500 IN IRVINE  </P> <P> About 1,500 customers in Irvine were without electricity for an hour or more  Tuesday night, authorities said.  </P> <P> Linda Gilleland, a spokeswoman for Southern California Edison, confirmed that  the outage occurred around 7:30 p.m. in the Northwood area of Irvine, south of  Walnut Avenue between Culver Drive and Yale Avenue.  </P> <P> Two Edison crews restored power to about 1,100 customers within an hour, and  were working to restore service to the rest late Tuesday night, Gilleland said.  The cause was attributed to the failure of an underground cable.  </P> <P> "The entire neighborhood was in darkness. We couldn't tell what was going on,"  said James Sibaila, a Northwood resident.  </P></p>

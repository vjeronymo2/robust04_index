Shapiro of Philadelphia, who was scheduled to hear arguments in the leagues'  request for an injunction forcing the umpires to work.  </P> <P> Instead, the sides met for several hours, then emerged, saying that retired  Common Pleas Judge Stanley Greenburg would decide the issues, starting with a  hearing today.  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Competing telephones It is fitting that the tribulations of Mercury, main competitor for British Telecommunications, should have surfaced in the week that Oftel, the telecoms watchdog, set out its views on the future regulation of the UK's telecoms industry. It would be wrong, however, to attribute Mercury's plight to regulatory failings, and still more mistaken for overseas observers to believe it reveals the limits to effective telecoms competition. On the contrary, Mercury's difficulties reflect the flourishing state of competition in UK telecoms. Mercury's success in the late 1980s spurred BT into making the impressive efficiency gains which are haunting its rival in the mid-1990s. Since the abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, 57 new licences have been granted, many of them to operators targeting the corporate market with lower prices than Mercury's. The government's policy of opening the market to all qualified comers has yielded benefits to companies and consumers. And Oftel's tough price cap on BT has produced large tariff cuts, even for those who have not benefited directly from new competition. Over-detailed However, three issues require attention if the second decade of competition in UK telecoms is to be as successful as the first. First, the over-detailed regulation of retail prices and of inter-connection terms for operators needing to use BT's national network. Second, the role of Oftel in policing a tough pro-competition regime. Third, the shape of pan-EU regulation as telecoms liberalisation advances on the mainland. To reduce the need for intrusive regulation, BT's prices need to be brought more closely into line with its costs, and its accounts ought to be fully transparent to prevent undue cross-subsidy. Oftel has made strides on both fronts, but more needs to be done. It is essential that Oftel withdraws from the dubious process of charging BT's competitors 'access deficit contributions' to cover the supposed loss BT incurs in maintaining line connections. With competition in local telephony well established, Oftel should give BT freedom to set line rentals, provided BT was required to maintain a uniform national charge and to protect low users. ADCs could then be abolished. Effective sanctions Oftel is careful in its paper to talk in terms of options, but its thrust is away from prescriptive rules and towards effective sanctions to deal with abuse of dominant position. This is to be welcomed, although fairly exacting price controls on BT must continue for as long as it remains dominant. However, if this approach is to bear fruit, competitors must have confidence in the ability of the regulator to police abuse. They have little reason for such confidence at present. Regulatory authorities in the UK have no power to offer relief through injunction; nor are the UK's courts and competition agencies well equipped to offer swift and effective remedies. Changes in the law may be necessary to strengthen the regulators. Without such changes, aggrieved competitors may look to Brussels for redress. There are those who would in any case welcome a single EU telecoms regulator as liberalisation advances across the EU. Yet it is hard to square the idea of a single EU regulator with the principle of subsidiarity, given Oftel's proven capacity to police the emerging UK market over the last decade. Far better to agree principles for application in each country - one of which must be the conferring on regulators of sufficient powers to enforce fair competition swiftly.</p>

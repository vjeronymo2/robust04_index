			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MICHIGAN;  </P> <P> UNION OKS STRIKE AT DETROIT NEWSPAPERS  </P> <P> Newspaper union members voted to authorize a strike against the Detroit News  and Detroit Free Press on the eve of the newspapers' scheduled merger of  non-editorial operations. Teamsters officials said the strike was set for  Thursday to give the employees time to get established under the new  operations, set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. today under a joint operating  agreement. Talks between the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will run the  papers' combined operations, and the Newspaper Unity Coalition, representing  the six largest News and Free Press locals, have broken off. The two sides were  far apart on union wage demands.  </P></p>

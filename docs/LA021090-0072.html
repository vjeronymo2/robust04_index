			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARNATION PULLS AD ACCOUNT FROM OGILVY  </P> <P> Carnation, one of the West Coast's largest packaged-goods companies, has  decided to repackage its advertising.  </P> <P> The company said Friday that it will consolidate much of its advertising with  several advertising agencies owned by the giant New York holding company,  Interpublic Group. In Los Angeles, an account valued at $12 million to $15  million will go from Ogilvy &amp; Mather to McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Dailey &amp; Associates, the Los Angeles agency that also creates ads for  several Carnation products, will not be affected by the changes -- at least for  the time being. But advertising executives speculated Friday that this may be  just the beginning to a major overhaul of Carnation's advertising nationwide.  </P> <P> "We want to realign our advertising strategy to focus on fewer agencies," said  Richard Curd, a Carnation spokesman. The company is following the lead of  Nestle, which owns Carnation Co. "This in no way reflects dissatisfaction with  Ogilvy's past performance," Curd said.  </P> <P> Carnation is one of the few major packaged-goods companies headquartered on the  West Cost. Because packaged-goods makers are often such large and visible  advertisers, their accounts are coveted.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most familiar ads that Ogilvy has created for Carnation are for its  Contadina Fresh Pasta and Fresh Sauces. Those commercials, which show the  pasta's expiration date stamped on the package, say: Our days are numbered, but  we wouldn't have it any other way.  </P> <P> "It's darned unfortunate to do a great job for a client and then have the  larger corporate goals of the client get in the way," said Gerald McGee,  general manager of Ogilvy's Los Angeles office, regarding the loss of the  account it handled for about three years. "They want to consolidate, and we got  stung by it."  </P> <P> McGee, whose office recently won the coveted Paramount Pictures advertising  business, said there will not be any layoffs resulting from the loss of the  Carnation business.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the big winner is McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles, which will not only  create ads for the pasta lines, but also for Grand Gourmet dog food, and for  two lines of Carnation infant formula, Good Start and Good Nature.  </P> <P> "We're absolutely thrilled," said Jim Surmanek, senior vice president at  McCann. He said the agency will hire more staff once the extent of the new  business is clearer.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Childcare pays off for the parent: Sony is starting to reap the benefits of its Hollywood investments This summer it will be difficult to escape the media blitz for Columbia Pictures' Last Action Hero, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. With production costs of Dollars 55m and another Dollars 20m budgeted for marketing, it is one of Hollywood's most expensive movies. At first glance, the figures seem extravagant for Sony of Japan, which has been criticised for lavish spending since 1989 when it bought Columbia and TriStar Pictures and formed Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) as a new combined Hollywood studio. But the amount seems less outlandish given the extent to which SPE's operating profit will this year help to offset declining profits from Sony's core consumer electronics business, which has been severely affected by the global recession. In the quarter to December 31, the Sony group reported a 62 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, to Dollars 405m. Wall Street's judgment on Sony's Hollywood acquisition has revolved around three issues - the financial logic of the deal, the degree to which much-vaunted synergies, or interdependence, could be achieved between the hardware (consumer electronics) and software (film) sides of the group, and the ability of Sony to rebuild the Columbia and TriStar studios, which were battered three years ago by low morale, weak management and a lack of box-office hits. After the takeover, industry critics added up Sony's costs in buying CBS Records in 1988, its Hollywood acquisition and subsequent studio investments, and concluded that once debt-servicing expenses were deducted the return on investment would be low. They suggested that it would be at least five years before Sony would reap benefits from its Hollywood adventure. The group's Dollars 7.9bn of entertainment investments included: Dollars 2bn on buying CBS Records, and Dollars 3.4bn on the Hollywood studios, which came with Dollars 1.5bn of debt. Sony then injected a further Dollars 1bn of capital to rebuild the studios and to acquire the film production company owned by Mr Peter Guber, who became chairman of SPE. These days the Tokyo-based owners of SPE may be forgiven for smiling at some of the Wall Street sceptics. In the financial year that will end next Wednesday the entertainment side of Sony (films, television, music and electronic publishing) is likely to provide nearly Dollars 900m of operating profits before depreciation and debt servicing, or about 45 per cent of the group's worldwide total. The figures indicate that Sony's entertainment operations appear to be bailing out its core consumer electronics business. What is more, the non-electronics side is producing an annual return on investment of about 11 per cent at the operating level, compared with 6 per cent at the end of Sony's first year in Hollywood. Mr David Londoner, an entertainment analyst at Wertheim Schroder, the New York investment bank, says Wall Street's first impression of Sony's Hollywood acquisition 'was that they overpaid for a company that was limping along'. The new perception, he adds, 'is that they have gone a long way toward making a respectable return on investment'. When it comes to synergy, Mr Guber says: 'What we are really talking about is a mutuality of interests in products and marketing between the entertainment and the electronics businesses'. No one in Tokyo, he explains, 'is telling us to synergise'. Instead the aim is to seek ways of marrying the technology resources on the electronics side of Sony with the entertainment side in Hollywood, he says. The Schwarzenegger film is merely the most graphic example of how the two sides of Sony could work together. The film, released by Columbia Pictures, will be accompanied by a soundtrack manufactured by Sony Music. Cinemas showing the film will use the Sony-made digital sound systems that claim to represent a technology advance beyond Dolby sound systems. Sony will also sell electronic video games based on the film that will work on Sony products. Some cinemas will also introduce 'virtual reality' games made by Sony and based on the movie. Finally, there are plans for the joint marketing of Sony television sets and VCRs and the film, with electronic shops across the country showing extracts from the film on Sony products. The degree to which hardware-software links can produce significant revenues still remains to be proved, but a senior Sony executive in the US admits that in profit terms 'over the past year the software has been carrying the hardware'. The man most responsible for the turnround is Mr Guber. He presides over two studios, Dollars 3bn of annual revenues, 20 per cent of total US box-office market share and a budget of about Dollars 600m for more than 20 movies a year. In the financial year now ending, SPE is estimated to have made an operating profit of more than Dollars 300m from its film and television productions and cinema chain subsidiaries. That is 22 per cent better than the previous year and double the profit level of 1989-90, when Sony first bought into Hollywood. However, despite the improvement, the return on Sony's total investment of Dollars 4.4bn is just 7 per cent and still short of the return made on the much cheaper music business. At Wertheim Schroder, Mr Londoner stresses that SPE still has more work to do to reach the operating profit levels of studios like Warner and Disney, both of which earn more than Dollars 400m a year. In New York, Mr Guber's boss, Mr Mickey Schulhof, the vice-chairman of Sony USA, the US subsidiary which controls SPE, agrees that Warner and Disney earn more, but stresses that with a 20 per cent market share, SPE is now among the top three Hollywood studios. He adds that it is not unreasonable to expect the entertainment side to achieve a 15 per cent return on investment within the next couple of years. Mr Guber used much of the estimated Dollars 1bn of fresh capital over the past three years to rebuild the two studios, taking on staff and forging deals with directors and producers. That has meant producing flagship films, such as last year's Hook, based on the Peter Pan fairytale, which have not reaped critical praise but which have been box-office hits and helped to renew confidence in the studios among cinema chains and distributors. Another top priority was the studio's television division, which last year generated operating profits of Dollars 175m (see chart), equal to the film side. The business was restructured, and while its profits will dip next year because of a cyclical reduction in its earnings from programme syndication, it is now being expanded internationally. Mr Mel Harris, the new head of the TV division, is exploring co-production deals with RTL in Germany and the Berlusconi group in Italy. Globalisation is as much a buzzword at SPE as it is elsewhere in corporate America, and Mr Guber says he is increasingly sensitive to non-US markets, which provide about half of all box-office proceeds. 'We feel the impact here when England is not doing well and Germany is slipping into recession.' Mr Guber's senior aides, and especially Mr Jonathan Dolgen, president of the motion picture division, say they are working hard to trim costs where possible. 'The cost side has to be managed, but in a way that is not intrusive into the creative side. No one is going to cut production or marketing costs in half, but we can make and market some pictures for 5 per cent less,' Mr Dolgen explains. Cost-cutting is evident on a visit to the back lots and executive suites of Sony Pictures. Shooting schedules have been tightened, and editing and marketing costs have been trimmed. Morale is higher than it was a year ago, the result of the rebuilding programme, tighter management and box-office success. It also reflects the growing awareness that Hollywood is bolstering its Sony parent company back in Tokyo for the first time since the Japanese entered the business. As one studio executive put it: 'It's nice to feel that we're needed.'  ------------------------------------------------------------- Sony Pictures Entertainment: a sharp picture  ------------------------------------------------------------- Operating profit        1989-90  1990-91  1991-92  1992-93 (Dollars million)  ------------------------------------------------------------- Motion pictures               0       25      100      175 Television                  200      175      200      175 Cinema chain                 25       25       25       35 Sub total                   225      225      325      385 Corporate overheads         -75     -100      -75      -75 Operating profit            150      125      250      310  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Statement by Russian Federation Metallurgy Committee </F> Chairman Serafim Afonin: "We Are Not Taking a Kopeck from the  Budget"]    [Text] At the end of January the Russian government  basically approved the draft Federal Program for Technical  Retooling and Development of Russia's Metallurgy up to the Year  2000. The ink on the document was barely dry, as they say, when  one of the newspapers already called the program inflationary.  However, I am sure that the journalist did not even take the  trouble to glance at it.    How can the program be called inflationary when we are not  taking a kopeck from the state budget for its realization? Out  of the general sum of 40.810 billion rubles [R] needed for  retooling the sector the enterprises' own funds comprise R28.168  billion, or 69 percent, and other funds that have been attracted  comprise R8.526 billion (20.9 percent). Only R4.116 billion,  hardly more than 10 percent, is from state investment credits.  Credit, I emphasize, which needs to be returned and not grants  or subsidies.    Of course we will need state support in order to fulfill the  program. It is necessary to review duty rates for stimulating  the export of metallurgical products with a high technical  preparedness and restraining analagous imports. Certain other  tariff and tax relief is required, let's say for importing  equipment which is not produced in Russia, and for a number of  other instances. But this is normal state protectionism which is  practiced everywhere for supporting basic sectors of a country's  economy. And metallurgy, along with the fuel and energy  complex, determines the viabiliy of Russia's economic organism  as a whole.    Fulfilling the complete volume of work for technical  retooling of metallurgy goes beyond this century. However, the  realization of basic measures intended before the year 2000 will  allow significant improvement in the structure of metallurgical  production. Introducing progressive technology will decrease  the expenditure of steel for rolled metal, of coke, energy  resources and pig iron for steel smelting. This will also  significantly improve the ecological situation in the  metallurgical regions.</p>

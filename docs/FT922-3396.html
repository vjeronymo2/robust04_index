			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Review of 'cosy' travel facility SOME MPs are not taking kindly to the prospect of having their travel arrangements made by a German-owned tour operator. It emerged yesterday that the all-party Commons administration committee is likely to review 'as an early priority' an arrangement whereby the Palace of Westminster's transport office has been operated exclusively since 1985 by Thomas Cook. The travel company was bought from Midland Bank last week for Pounds 200m by LTU, Germany's third-biggest package tour operator. Mr Brian Wilson, Labour MP for Cunninghame North, whose written question led to the statement that a review was on the cards, said the takeover had prompted the timing of his question. 'It does seem a cosy arrangement,' he said. According to Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP who answered on behalf of the House of Commons Commission in charge of administration, the original four-year agreement with Thomas Cook had been extended indefinitely, with the recommendation that the arrangement be 'fully reviewed' within 12 months of the start of the present parliament. It was expected that the administration committee would be 'invited to initiate that review as an early priority'. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East and a prominent Euro-sceptic, said it was vital that the contract should be placed immediately for public tender. 'There is always the possibility that a British-owned firm might be successful,' he said.</p>

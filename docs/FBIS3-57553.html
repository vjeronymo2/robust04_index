He was welcomed at  Pulkovo airport by city Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak, head of the  Leningrad regional administration Aleksandr Belyakov and other  officials.    St. Petersburg, called Leningrad at that time, was  completely  surrounded by German troops on September 8, 1941. It then had a  population of 2,544,000, but only 800,000 people survived to see  the holiday salute marking the city's liberation on Thursday  January 27, 1944.    About one million people, mostly women and children, were  evacuated from the city in the period from January to November  1942 through the only lifeline over Lake Ladoga, 642,000 died  from hunger, and about 20,000 were killed during air raids and  shellings.    The German Air Force and artillery demolished more than  3,000  buildings and damaged more than 7,000. The population of the  city voluntarily worked Sundays, a total of 50 million working  hours, to restore Leningrad. Its pre-war townscape was  practically restored by 1947.    From the airport President Yeltsin went to the  Piskaryovskoye  memorial cemetery to pay homage to hundreds of thousands of  Leningraders buried there. Then he will visit the Marino  settlement in Kirov district of Leningrad region, where he will  be shown the "Lifting of the Leningrad Blockade" Diorama Museum.  In the afternoon the president will attend the opening of the  all-Russia "salute the victory" folk art festival at the  "Oktyabrsky" grand concert hall.    President Yeltsin will return to Moscow in the evening of  the  same day.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- The next Prague Council is  to have 55 members, a council meeting agreed today.    The local election law says that towns with over 150,000  people shall have between 35 and 55 council members but when  towns fail to state the exact number of counselors for the next  term 85 days before the elections they are only allowed 35  counselors.    The present council, which has 76 members, is yet to  announce  the number of districts for the local elections and how many  counselors will be elected in each district.</p>

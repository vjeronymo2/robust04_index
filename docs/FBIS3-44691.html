			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev said today that his country wishes to  develop a partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization (NATO) on the basis of extensive political contacts  and policy and action coordination.    Meeting with two visiting U.S. senators, Grachev said that  in  its security concept of partnership for peace, NATO should take  into account the interests of all countries instead of its  member states only, the INTERFAX News Agency reported.    Russia, which used to lead the Warsaw Pact nations against  NATO during the Cold War, has become deeply concerned over the  attempts of some of its former partners to join NATO. Russia  insisted that NATO should first weaken its role as a  political-military bloc.    To ease Russia's anxiety, the United States has said that it  opposes NATO's immediate acceptance of any East European nation.    In his meeting with the U.S. senators, Grachev also said  Russia has given up its former promise of not using nuclear  weapons first because other nuclear powers have not done so.</p>

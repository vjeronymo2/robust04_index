			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) What is the best method for getting appropriate design principles incorporated into Federal agency design specifications and guidance, etc? In particular, how can we get landscape designs integrated with the natural habitat, incorporating native plants, xeriscaping principles and water efficient irrigation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) How can we ensure that the principles and practices identified in the Executive Memorandum are implemented by Federal agencies? Should this be the responsibility of each Agency's Environmental Executive (designated under Executive Order 12873)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Seek to Prevent Pollution By, Among Other Things, Reducing Fertilizer and Pesticide Use, Using Integrated Pest Management Techniques, Recycling Green Waste, and Minimizing Runoff. Landscaping Practices that Reduce the Use of Toxic Chemicals Provide One Approach for Agencies to Reach Reduction Goals Established in Executive Order No. 12856, ``Federal Compliance with Right-To-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements;''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Landscaping practices which do not require, or require only limited, application of fertilizer and/or pesticides may result in significant prevention of pollution in several ways. First, and most conspicuous, any decreased need for application decreases the likelihood that adverse environmental impacts associated with runoff of these chemicals will occur. In addition, reduced need for chemical substances will decrease the amount of energy expended to produce these chemicals. One practice, the use of integrated pest management, not only serves to reduce or eliminate the need for pesticide application and thus prevent pollution, it generally results in significant reductions in unintended impacts to non-target species, resulting in an secondary environmental benefit beyond pollution prevention. Additionally, recycling of ``green waste'' results in a range of environmental benefits linked to pollution prevention. The collection, composting and ultimate reuse of green wastes not only reduces the amount of materials placed in landfills, it decreases and can eliminate the need for man-made fertilizers and thus reaps the same benefits as other such landscaping practices. Finally, landscaping practices may serve a vital role in pollution prevention through the use of plants as barriers to pollution and to absorb natural or man made pollutants which may otherwise enter natural systems such as waterbodies. For example, buffer plantings along waterways act to absorb excess nutrients and chemical pollutants which might otherwise enter waterways.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concerns:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) How can the Federal community best accomplish this task? Non-traditional landscaping practices such as integrated pest management not only require training to be effective, they require acceptance on the part of facility managers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> (d) Implement Water-Efficient Practices, Such As the Use of Mulches, Efficient Irrigation Systems, Audits to Determine Exact Landscaping Water-Use Needs, and Recycled or Reclaimed Water and the Selecting and Siting of Plants in A Manner that Conserves Water and Controls Soil Erosion. Landscaping practices, Such As Planting Regionally Native Shade Trees Around Buildings to Reduce Air Conditioning Demands, Can Also Provide Innovative Measures to Meet the Energy Consumption Reduction Goal Established in Executive Order No. 12902, ``Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation at Federal Facilities;''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Certain landscaping practices by design result in elimination or reduction of supplementary water needed to sustain landscaped areas and prevent or reduce soil erosion. Practices such as the use of mulches which reduce evaporation from landscaped areas and effective siting of landscape plantings can decrease the need for supplemental water and prevent physical erosion of the soil. Other practices, such as efficient irrigation systems and water audits, ensure that supplemental water is used most effectively and only when necessary. Additionally, the use of recycled or reclaimed water offers an alternative to the use of potable water which both satisfies landscaping water needs and conserves energy by decreasing the need for treated water. Finally, consideration of the natural shading effect associated with landscape plantings can serve to reduce heat loadings on buildings and result in energy conservation. These landscaping practices can conserve valuable water resources and energy and provide significant environmental benefits to affected Federal property managers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concerns:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Since the use of non-traditional landscaping practices will require training to ensure success, how can the Federal government ensure that facility managers are aware of, and accept, non-traditional water-efficient landscaping practices?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Are there potential problems with the use of recycled or reclaimed water?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Likewise, are there potential problems with the use of recycled materials, i.e. newspaper and sludge?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Create Outdoor Demonstrations Incorporating Native Plants, As Well As Pollution Prevention and Water Conservation Techniques, to Promote Awareness of the Environmental An Economic Benefits of Implementing This Directive. Agencies are Encouraged to Develop Other Methods for Sharing Information on Landscaping Advances With Interested Nonfederal Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many Federal facilities have a significant acreage of open land which remains unused for facility buildings and infrastructure. In many instances, the public is actively invited to use these lands for passive recreational purposes such as bird watching, picnicking, or hiking. These areas, therefore present a significant opportunity to showcase the aesthetic and economic effectiveness of environmentally beneficial landscaping. Demonstration projects allow both public and private interests to experience the benefits of landscaping practices and apply those practices to their own landscaping activities. Other technology and information transfer methods such as workshops and brochures can also provide this benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concerns:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) In this era of restricted resources, will the public understand the use of public funds for landscaping demonstration projects?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the Presidential Memorandum follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum on Environmentally Beneficial Landscaping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> April 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Subject: Environmentally and Economically Beneficial Practices on Federal Landscaped Grounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Report of the National Performance Review contains recommendations for a series of environmental actions, including one to increase environmentally and economically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial landscaping practices at Federal facilities and federally funded projects. Environmentally beneficial landscaping entails utilizing techniques that complement and enhance the local environment and seek to minimize the adverse effects that the landscaping will have on it. In particular, this means using regionally native plants and employing landscaping practices and technologies that conserve water and prevent pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These landscaping practices should benefit the environment, as well as generate long-term costs savings for the Federal Government. For example, the use of native plants not only protects our natural heritage and provides wildlife habitat, but also can reduce fertilizer, pesticide,and irrigation demands and their associated costs because native plants are suited to the local environment and climate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PAPANDREOU TALK WITH COMMUNISTS FAILS TO BREAK NINE-DAY DEADLOCK  </P> <P> Ailing Premier Andreas Papandreou today failed to gain Communist support in  forming a coalition government that would lead Greece out of a nine-day  political deadlock.  </P> <P> Negotiations between the premier's Panhellenic Socialist Movement and the  Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress ended at noon without an  agreement.  </P> <P> Papandreou, who met with the Communists for an hour, was forced to appoint a  representative to negotiate on his behalf. The 70-year-old premier was admitted  to General State Hospital on Thursday with pneumonia he contracted eight months  after undergoing heart surgery.  </P> <P> Papandreou is heading a caretaker government because no party received a  majority in elections on June 18 to the 300-seat Parliament.  </P> <P> After the meeting today, Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said that the  Socialist proposals "were equally interesting" as those made to him last week  by the conservatives, who finished first in the elections but failed to build a  coalition. Florakis did not disclose the proposals. The conservative New  Democracy Party had proposed a government in which the leftists would control  the justice and interior ministries.  </P> <P> If the three major parties cannot form a coalition government, new elections  will be called.  </P></p>

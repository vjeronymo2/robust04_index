			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Nabisco modifies share scheme RJR Nabisco, the large food and cigarettes manufacturer, said yesterday that it would go ahead with its 'targeted stock' scheme - which would create two classes of shares, one pegged to the fortunes of its tobacco division and one to the performance of its food operations - in spite of the cigarette price war begun by Philip Morris, a rival manufacturer, earlier this month. RJR Nabisco's scheme would be modified in two important respects. First, the group would simply proceed with the sale of 93m RN-Nabisco shares to new investors. These shares would be pegged to the food operations' performance and represented a 25 per cent interest in the food group's equity. RJR Nabisco would not issue RN-Nabisco shares to existing investors in the company at this stage. Instead, the existing RJR Nabisco shares would be renamed as RN-Reynolds shares once the RN-Nabisco flotation had gone ahead, and Reynolds group would retain the remaining 75 per cent interest in the food group's equity. This contrasts with the original targeted stock scheme, which envisaged that another 142m RN-Nabisco shares would be issued to existing RJR Nabisco shareholders about six months after the flotation of RN-Nabisco shares. Secondly, the company would delay declaring any dividends on the renamed RN-Reynolds shares until 'there is a clear assessment of the domestic tobacco operating environment and the company can initiate a dividend policy that is consistent with its capital structure and credit rating targets'. This group of shares will carry a 'pass-through' dividend of about three cents a share from the third quarter of 1993 onwards, reflecting this stock's retained interest in the dividend-paying food interests.</p>

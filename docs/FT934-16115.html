			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Sihanouk press ban prompts fears on rights: Reporting restrictions in Cambodia IN THE first sign of possible restrictions on constitutional rights in post-election Cambodia, the new government has warned journalists working in the country that they should refrain from criticising the newly enthroned King Norodom Sihanouk. At a press conference Mr Ek Sereywath, the deputy information minister, pointed out that foreign journalists have often written critical comments about Prince Sihanouk (as he was until two weeks ago) and said it would be 'against our custom to criticise' the king. The country's new constitution, which was promulgated by King Sihanouk two weeks ago, enshrines freedom of the press, together with freedom of expression and freedom of association. However, diplomats and other foreign residents say they are concerned that the bar on criticism of the king could lead to other restrictions on these constitutional rights. King Sihanouk's past record of close involvement in Cambodian politics suggests that any full account of political developments in the country would have to reflect his role. Under the new constitution, the king 'reigns but does not govern'. However, the early signs are that the king is likely to play a much more active part in day-to-day questions than that implies. King Sihanouk has had a testy relationship with the media since the first time he ruled Cambodia as king during the 1950s. Then, and later when he abdicated to become the civilian head of state, he kept a black list of journalists who were banned from the country and refused to give interviews to any but his favourites. In recent years, as head of a resistance coalition and then as head of state under the United Nations mandate in Cambodia, he has often responded in detail to what he perceived to be negative reports about him in the local and foreign press. He now says he has put those days behind him, though. In interviews last weekend, he repeatedly told visitors that Cambodia would have an absolutely free press with no restrictions and no censorship. Mr Ek Sereywath insists the idea of restricting criticism of the king was his own initiative, but it seems likely that the idea had at least the tacit support of the king, whose actions have often belied his public statements. During the 18 months that the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) was in the country, the local media flourished and became much more outspoken. With the backing of the UN's own radio station, Radio Untac, Cambodian reporters began to expose corruption and to criticise the main political players, including King Sihanouk. Now that Untac's mandate has come to an end and most UN personnel have left the country, the local media are again exposed to a possible renewal of the bullying and threats of the past. Until the Untac-sponsored election in May, Cambodia was a one-party state and there was no real independence in the media. The one outspoken editor was thrown into jail and his newspaper closed. One optimistic note in the new environment is that Mr Khieu Kanharith, the editor who was jailed for his independent views, is now the minister for information. Many fear, however, that he may be replaced by a tougher political rival. The government says it is committed to openness and a free press but when the constitution was being drafted, there was no public consultation and no dialogue between the members of the drafting committee and the public. Special interest groups and a coalition of Cambodian non-government organisations protested strongly but their views were still not heard by the committee. Now, they point out that the government's commitment to dialogue carries limited weight given the way in which the constitution was written and the unwillingness of members of parliament to listen to the views of the people who elected them. The government insists it does not intend to widen the ban on criticism of the king to cover ministers or other members of the administration. However, there is already concern that there could be a return to the official and unofficial censorship of the past.</p>

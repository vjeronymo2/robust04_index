			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MORE THAN MUSCLE?  </P> <P> While Stallone attempts to branch out, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting ready  to go back into action in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," expected to begin  rolling in early October in and around L.A.  </P> <P> James Cameron -- who made his directorial debut with the original "Terminator"  (1984) -- produces, directs and co-writes with William Wisher. (A longtime  friend and former college roommate of Cameron's, Wisher worked as a consultant  on the original "Terminator" -- and wrote the film's novelization.)  </P> <P> This time out, the story involves John Connor, the young and troubled son (he's  already got a police record) of "Terminator's" tough heroine, Sarah Connor,  again played by Linda Hamilton. Michael Biehn -- the futuristic soldier of "I"  -- will also be back.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger's in the midst of starring in the action-comedy  "Kindergarten Cop," which reunites him with "Twins" director Ivan Reitman.

'The changes proposed will fundamentally undermine police morale, will substantially cut the living standards of serving officers, will weaken the ability of officers to be fairly represented and will significantly reduce the attractiveness of a career in the police service for able young Scots men and women.' Scottish Police Federation 'The report is dangerous. It seeks to bring to the management and remuneration of the police concepts familiar in the commercial world but wholly unsuited to the police service.' Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman 'Most police officers will recognise that the service has always carried dead wood and that there was no way of getting rid of them.' Brian Hilliard, editor of Police Review and a former Metropolitan Police inspector</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> MAYOR'S FIELD OF DREAMS FOR CITY SLOW TO BLOOM  </P> <P> Calling Los Angeles "America's most fertile field of dreams," Mayor Tom Bradley  launched his unprecedented fifth term in June, 1989, by pledging an ambitious  series of housing, transportation and environmental programs.  </P> <P> One year later, most of the mayor's reforms have yet to blossom.  </P> <P> For example, Bradley's proposal to cut rush-hour truck traffic on city streets  by 70% won initial City Council approval last November, but now is stalled.  Mayoral staffers are trying to work out unresolved questions, such as ways to  enforce the proposed truck ban.  </P> <P> Bradley's initiative to target more than $100-million a year in downtown  redevelopment funds for affordable housing and after-school education is at an  impasse. No visible progress has been made in what the mayor hailed as "the  largest municipal housing and homeless plan in American history," and thousands  of homeless people continue to sleep in cardboard "condos" and rescue missions  within blocks of City Hall.  </P> <P> Other sweeping proposals -- such as turning the Los Angeles River into a  verdant recreation area or maximizing city airport revenues by possible sale or  long-term lease of Los Angeles International Airport to a private utility --  also have not moved beyond the talking stage.  </P> <P> In a series of interviews in late June, Bradley and his top aides contended  that substantial progress has been made during the last year on many of the  more complicated and innovative proposals.  </P> <P> But when the city's unwieldy bureaucracy and budgetary constraints are factored  into the equation, they said, significant changes will take additional time and  patience.  </P> <P> "It doesn't discourage me or deter me just because a program may take many  months longer than someone perceives that it should take," said Bradley, who  has three more years to make good on his 1989 campaign promises. "I had an  excellent year."  </P> <P> Bradley and his staffers cited several significant accomplishments in the last  year:  </P> <P> * A five-year moratorium on the demolition of single-room occupancy hotels on  Skid Row.  </P> <P> * Creation of a division of storm drains to help protect Santa Monica Bay from  pollution.  </P> <P> * Establishment of a public hot line for information on buses, vans and rider  sharing to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution.  </P> <P> In addition, Administration officials said that the mayor took a leadership  role in getting the city to ban the sale of ammunition for one week before New  Year's Eve and Independence Day. Bradley also proposed mandatory 10% cuts in  water usage to ease the city's water shortage.  </P> <P> Council members generally agree that Bradley, in seeking to move beyond the  scandals that plagued his Administration for more than a year, has raised his  visibility on major issues.  </P> <P> "One year he ran for reelection and bragged about the fact that he did things  quietly," said council President John Ferraro. "Now he's talking about  everything that's coming down the pike."  </P> <P> But Ferraro and several council members say it remains unclear whether the  72-year-old mayor has the ability and inclination to accomplish his goals.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said he is encouraged that Bradley has hired several  energetic aides, such as Chief of Staff Mark Fabiani and housing coordinator  Michael Bodaken. However, he added, "It's too early to know how much of (the  Bradley agenda) is going to come to fruition. I hope the staff that he has  brought aboard is a precursor to things that will happen rather than . . . to  create the appearance of change."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Independent Council  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said the mayor has a more difficult time getting  his proposals through the council. "I don't think it's as easy as it has been  in past years for the mayor to make eight phone calls and get eight aye votes  because I think we're looking at the issues on an individual basis," she said.  </P> <P> Council supporters of Bradley counter that slow progress is the nature of big  government and that rosy predictions are sometimes necessary to achieve  long-term reforms.  </P> <P> A case in point, said Councilman Marvin Braude, is the truck reduction  proposal, which Bradley aides had predicted would be in place last fall. The  measure aims to bar 70% of large trucks from city streets during rush hour.  </P> <P> "That means regulating the whole of Southern California's trucking industry,"  Braude said. "It's a major step and to expect that can happen in six months is  unrealistic.  </P> <P> "If you want to do something new," the councilman added, "you can't admit that  it's going to take a long time when you start. Otherwise, you're giving up  before you begin."  </P> <P> City traffic planners are conducting a noise study to assess the impact of  late-night truck deliveries. The city also has asked the South Coast Air  Quality Management District to assist in setting up enforcement procedures and  fee structures for the ban, which the Bradley Administration believes should be  used as a model for the entire Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reforms 'Dormant'  </P> <P> "It would have been easy to throw something in place that wasn't well thought  out and that didn't have the cooperation of key sectors of the Southern  California economy," said Fabiani, who was promoted from the mayor's legal  adviser to chief of staff last November. "The mayor chose to go around, meet  with every affected party, try to bring them into the process. If that means a  few extra months, in the end it is really going to be worth it."  </P> <P> Fabiani said the mayor's 1988 proposal for massive affordable housing  construction is equally complicated, since the funding scheme relies on county  and school district approval to raise a court-imposed ceiling on Community  Redevelopment Agency spending from $750 million to $5 billion.  </P> <P> Critics have termed Bradley's initiative, which he unveiled in January, 1988, a  thinly veiled attempt to free enormous sums of money for further redevelopment.  They note that there is little incentive for schools and the county to  surrender property tax revenues to the city.  </P> <P> County budget officer Jerry Roos said last week that "progress has been slow,"  but that the county is open to further negotiations with the city.  </P> <P> Bradley refused to discuss specifics of the impasse, saying only that "we  haven't given up, we're going to go at it again."  </P> <P> The mayor and his aides cite other progress on the affordable housing front in  addition to the downtown demolition moratorium. In late June, the mayor  established a new Affordable Housing Commission and a Housing Preservation and  Production Department.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the city's housing crunch continues, according to city housing  coordinator Bodaken, a former Legal Aid Foundation attorney who was appointed  six months ago.  </P> <P> Bodaken said that the city had all but ignored the housing issue until a 1988  city committee called for the annual production of 10,000 new housing units.  </P> <P> And most reforms proposed by the committee "lay dormant" last year due to a  nine-month vacancy in the housing coordinator's post, he said.  </P> <P> Now, Bodaken said, a top priority of the mayor's office is establishment of a  fee system under which commercial developers would be required to pay  per-square-foot assessments for construction of affordable housing. The council  recently approved an ordinance placing developers on notice that the fee is  being formulated. An extensive study is under way to help determine the fee  levels.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recycling Scaled Down  </P> <P> In keeping with a campaign promise, Bradley signed a law last January that  eventually will require all households to recycle garbage.  </P> <P> But the program has fallen behind schedule because of delays in the purchase of  garbage trucks and in locating purchasers for the recycled plastics, glass and  paper.  </P> <P> Recycling was to begin in September in 150,000 households from Koreatown to  Eagle Rock, but now is scheduled to start this fall in 24,000 homes in those  areas. In other parts of the city, the starting date will be delayed until  1992.  </P> <P> Bradley wanted to establish an air quality management office staffed by four  employees. But the City Council last year created a much larger Department of  Environmental Affairs over the objection of the mayor. Since then, the mayor  appointed a general manager, Lillian Kawasaki, to head the environmental  affairs department, and 11 of the 20 authorized staff members have been hired.  Kawasaki said her staff has begun coordinating the city's air pollution  reduction efforts and is preparing a plan for dealing with coastline oil  spills.  </P> <P> Bradley has hired a city AIDS coordinator and a director to oversee efforts to  expand the use of reclaimed water in public parks.  </P> <P> The mayor, who had promised to expand the police force, won council approval  for 500 new police officers last year. But his plan to hire another 400 police  this year was rejected by the council on the recommendation of Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates, who said that he would rather spend limited resources on more  pressing needs.  </P> <P> Bradley's proposal to "green" the Los Angeles River has stirred words and  action far beyond the river's banks. In Washington, a House committee has  recommended a $700,000 study and in Sacramento, legislation is pending on an  alternate plan to turn the concrete flood-control channel back into a natural  waterway.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most controversy has been whipped up by another proposal. Later  this summer, a $100,000 county transportation commission study is due on  Assemblyman Richard Katz's (D-Sylmar) plan to turn the riverbed into an  expressway.  </P></p>

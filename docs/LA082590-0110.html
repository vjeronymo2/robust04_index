			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORST FIRES IN DECADES BURN FRENCH FORESTS  </P> <P> Mediterranean winds Friday fanned the flames of France's worst forest fires in  26 years, killing one person and threatening several towns.  </P> <P> Flames up to 65 feet high have roared out of control, burning more than 32,000  acres of southern France since Tuesday. A lack of rain and high winds have  hampered the effort to control the flames.  </P> <P> A long, dry spell and the steep mountain slopes also have made controlling the  fires difficult for the 2,000 firefighters and the pilots dropping thousands of  gallons of water on the blazes.  </P></p>

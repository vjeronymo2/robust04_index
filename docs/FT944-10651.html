			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (13): Energy wealth wasted - YPFB petroleum company It is not only the local coca growers that have put the sub-tropical Chapare region near Cochabamba under threat. Oil and gas fields discovered in 1993 and developed by the still state-owned petroleum company YPFB are turning the Chapare into an ecological danger zone. Campo Carrasco, 300km west of Santa Cruz along the coca trail, is typical. On one side of the road, a seedy night club advertisement offers engineers, coca-growers and drug dealers 'pleasant company'. Opposite, a 7km side-road comes to a less pleasant end - a gigantic gas torch protruding from the lush vegetation throws out scorching flame, testimony to decades of mismanagement by historically corruption-riddled YPFB. Day and night, and not just in the Chapare, gas from YPFB wells is burned off. As much as 20 per cent of Bolivia's non-renewable hydrocarbons wealth, instead of being reinjected or transported to final consumers, goes straight into the atmosphere. 'It's bad planning by previous administrations,' says Mr Mauricio Gonzalez, YPFB's Oxford-educated president, appointed when the new government took office in August 1993. He is charged with capitalising Bolivia's most important state-owned company. 'Capitalisation is a highly expeditious and cost-efficient way of financing the Dollars 1bn minimum YPFB needs over five years for upstream development,' says Mr Gonzalez, who prefers to describe the state's quasi-monopoly as a 'dominant position in the local market'. Bolivia's only hydrocarbons export is natural gas to Argentina worth Dollars 120m a year. National production shortages meant oil-and-gas-rich Bolivia was obliged to start importing diesel fuel in 1993. YPFB is far and away the country's largest company. Its 14,900-strong workforce produces some 400 cu ft of natural gas and 27,000 barrels of oil a day. Revenue from YPFB is central government's single most important source of income; militant YPFB unions its biggest headache. Mr Gonzalez says YPFB's new partner will inherit the job of restructuring the workforce: so far it has been reduced by just 800. The YPFB capitalisation timetable - and its eventual price tag - will be dependent on negotiations over new gas markets in Brazil and Chile, on a new hydrocarbons law and on passage of deregulatory and environmental norms. 'These are exciting times - we're moving ahead terribly fast on all fronts,' says Mr Gonzalez, who aims to have the capitalisation process completed by mid-1995. Industry reaction is mixed. 'The government is taking the right steps,' said a foreign oil executive based in Santa Cruz. 'But no-one knows how they intend to get investors on the boat.' Special concern exists about environmental liabilities such as unplugged holes and claims for past damages. Whether to offer YPFB as a whole or as a series of packages - as the World Bank is urging - is still being studied, according to Mr Alfonso Revollo, capitalisation minister. If the government decides to keep YPFB as a single entity, it must then decide whether to allow one trade buyer to buy up half the company. Some government advisers think this would risk submerging Bolivia's biggest company into a foreign oil giant. So they are proposing a sale of a 20 per cent stake to an investor that would manage the company, and the sale of 30 per cent to institutional investors in international financial markets. This would maximise the long-term value of the 50 per cent of the company being distributed to Bolivians, they say. Leading international companies such as Exxon, Occidental Petroleum, Amoco and Shell have shown keen interest in partnering YPFB, says Mr Revollo. Newly-privatised Argentine oil company YPF is also likely to be interested. 'By smashing the anachronistic YPFB monopoly and introducing an attractive fiscal regime for upstream activities, the 1990 hydrocarbons law set the stage for aggressive oil and gas exploration by private companies both foreign and national,' says Mr Herbert Muller, the former energy minister. Now, on the way to capitalisation, the hydrocarbons law is again under revision - in late October a twelfth draft sought still more 'agile mechanisms that will stimulate investment', according to Mr Gonzalez. The new law will require private companies and YPFB to sign hydrocarbons contracts directly with the government. Latest World Bank projections envisage a 12.5 per cent royalty for the producer regions, a 19 per cent tax on production for existing contract-holders, a 25 per cent corporate income tax and a 50 per cent royalty on output from YPFB-operated fields. Industry, meanwhile, is pressing hard to be able to write off exploration costs during the first year of production. Oil companies - mainly foreign - have to date signed a total of 16 exploration-operation contracts or embarked on joint ventures with YPFB. The state company estimates its operations presently cover only 15 per cent of Bolivia's oil and gas-bearing territory; joint operating contracts account for another 22 per cent and 12 per cent is in the final negotiation stage. 'The rest is up for grabs,' says Mr Gonzalez.</p>

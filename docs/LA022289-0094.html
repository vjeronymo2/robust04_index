			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERNARDI WANTS CITY VOTE ON USE OF $4.25 BILLION  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi wants to hear from the voters on  how Los Angeles should spend $4.25 billion in projected downtown property tax  revenues -- money that Mayor Tom Bradley wants to spend, in part, on coping  with the problems of housing shortages and gangs.  </P> <P> Bernardi, long a critic of the mayor's and the Community Redevelopment Agency's  hold over millions in redevelopment funds, moved Tuesday to put the  $4.25-billion question on the city ballot.  </P> <P> Bernardi said he would seek cooperation with the mayor's office in preparing  the advisory measure, which requires council approval and probably would not be  ready until the June, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Running Dispute  </P> <P> The effort is aimed at resolving a long-running dispute over who should control  future tax-increment revenues generated by downtown redevelopment. Under a 1977  court settlement, a ceiling of $750 million was placed on CRA spending -- a  figure that is expected to be reached by 1997 or before. The mayor and the CRA  are trying to persuade a judge to raise the limit to $5 billion. That money  would be collected and spent over a 20-year period.  </P> <P> The citywide vote being pushed by Bernardi would be a non-binding referendum on  whether the limit should be lifted or left as is, in which case future revenues  would come under the control of the City Council.  </P> <P> Bradley is pushing an agenda that, with the ceiling raised, calls for the CRA  to spend half the money on continuing downtown redevelopment -- including  additions to downtown's skyline, a gentrified residential area and restored  historic areas. The other half would be used to build affordable housing and to  finance an after-school program that Bradley touts as the key to keeping youths  out of gangs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Cannot Agree'  </P> <P> "I don't question Mayor Bradley's concern for the city's housing crisis,"  Bernardi said. "But I cannot agree that we should give the CRA $2.2 billion in  property taxes over the next 20 years to build more high-rise buildings  downtown."  </P> <P> If the ceiling remains in place, Bernardi said, the city and county can still  use tax money to pay for housing and anti-gang programs, and will also have  more money to hire police officers and keep trauma care facilities open.  </P></p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nicaragua hindered by stabilisation programme Sir, Edward Orlebar's article, 'Nicaragua limps back to life' (November 1), is mistaken in saying there has been no economic growth in Nicaragua since the 1970s. In fact, following the Sandinista revolution in 1979, the country's gross domestic product expanded at an average rate of 4.8 per cent a year from 1980 to 1983. One important reason for the decline from 1984 onwards was the lack of access to foreign finance, mainly due to the economic boycott of Nicaragua instituted by the US government. Since the UNO government took office in 1990, though, the country has received exceptionally large amounts of foreign finance, with loans and donations amounting to almost 40 per cent of GDP a year. However, much of this finance was conditional on the government implementing one of the most hard-hitting stabilisation and structural adjustment programmes in Latin America. This has led to a situation where, according to government figures, 55 per cent of the population is now without a proper job, and poverty has increased strikingly, especially in rural areas. Mr Orlebar gives the impression that little has yet changed in the public sector, but this is not true. Government consumption has been cut by a third, employment has been reduced by 20 per cent, and nearly all the country's 350 nationalised companies have been privatised. The key problem in Nicaragua is that, despite all the foreign finance, after three years of structural adjustment policies, the economy has still not demonstrated any significant growth. Imports of expensive consumer goods have flourished, to the benefit of a small minority, but the balance of payments has deteriorated and private investment is now even lower than it was in 1990.

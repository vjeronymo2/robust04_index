			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Midway to Buy Some Eastern Gates: Strikebound Eastern Airlines has agreed to  sell its eight Philadelphia airport gates and other assets to Chicago-based  Midway Airlines instead of selling the gate spaces to Washington-based USAir.  Eastern announced the move in a federal bankruptcy court hearing called to  discuss an earlier proposed $85-million agreement under which it would have  sold the Philadelphia gate spaces and two U.S.-Canadian routes to USAir Group  Inc. That agreement had come under fire from government regulators.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Central Executive Bureau of the PDSR  [Social Democracy Party of Romania] held a meeting yesterday,  which was attended by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, other  ministers, and PDSR members. [passage omitted]    At the end of the meeting, PDSR President Adrian Nastase  made  a brief statement to the press. He mentioned that discussions  regarding the negotiations with the parties that form the  majority in parliament were very heated. After four hours, the  Central Executive Bureau unanimously approved the formula of a  coalition government open to all parties that belong to the  current parliamentary majority. Adrian Nastase said that this  act should be preceded by the preparation of a draft political  pact open to all parties, as well as a political understanding  between all five parties -- namely the PDSR, PUNR [Romanian  National Unity Party], the PRM [Greater Romania Party], the PSM  [Socialist Party of Labor], and the PDAR [Romanian Democratic  Agrarian Party].    Likewise, Adrian Nastase mentioned that it is necessary to  achieve a consensus on an anticrisis and anti-inflation program.  After its drafting, consultations will continue with a view to  setting up a parliamentary coalition government by 1 March.    Mr. Adrian Nastase also expressed his surprise that these  elements discussed with the aforementioned parties on 21 January  in the evening were not taken into consideration at the meeting  of the PUNR National Council. Mr. Adrian Nastase also stressed  that the Central Executive Bureau wants to reaffirm the  willingness of the PDSR for a political dialogue with the  parliamentary parties in the opposition, noting that this  dialogue might take place at the end of the next week.    Referring to the memorandum convened between the Romanian  Government and the IMF, Mr. Nastase informed the correspondents  present that the participants in the meeting of the Central  Executive Bureau agreed unanimously that it is necessary for the  parliament to adopt a declaration in which it expresses support  for this memorandum as soon as possible.</p>

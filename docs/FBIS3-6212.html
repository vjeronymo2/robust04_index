Computerization is considered a must to accommodate the  amount of information acquired by overseas missions and quickly  meet demands as documents are now managed separately by bureau,  office and division, the officials said.    The ministry plans to start building up a data base on  diplomatic information this year.    It will begin with information on people, protocols,  economic  and trade statistics, National Assembly interpellation  summaries, diplomatic schedules, dates of global events and  international organizations this month.    Work on the data base will continue to include diplomatic  policies, materials, books and personnel.    Comprehensive and efficient management of diplomatic  information is neccessary to respond quickly and aggressively to  changes in the world, an official said.    In the long run, the ministry will adopt a multi-data system  that handles letters, images and sounds at the same time and  introduce an optical file system to produce colorful image data.</p>

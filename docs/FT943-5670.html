			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Williams shares aided by upbeat statement Williams Holdings' shares yesterday recovered from their recent weakness and jumped 3 per cent to 364p as the fire protection, security and building products group offered the market an upbeat assessment on trading. Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said Europe was showing better-than-expected growth, while 'economic indicators for the second half in the UK and North America continue to be favourable'. However, he warned that the pace and duration of any economic recovery remained uncertain. The market welcomed Mr Rudd's statements as encouraging, but still more cautious than those being made by other industrial conglomerates. 'They are at pains to make sure people do not get carried away,' said one analyst. Mr Rudd's comments came as the group announced a 13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 86.2m for the six months to June 30. The outcome, after reorganisation costs of Pounds 4m, were largely in line with expectations. Sales were 10 per cent ahead to Pounds 648.7m. Mr Rudd emphasised the group's organic growth, progress on margins, and improving cashflow. Profits from continuing businesses rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 98.7m, on sales 13 per cent ahead to Pounds 639m. Cashflow - for which Williams has often been criticised - was held at similar levels to last year, before dividends, disposals and acquisitions. Given the 40 per cent increase in capital expenditure and higher tax, the underlying cashflow position was better, Mr Rudd said, and was expected to improve further in the second half. Williams has bought three businesses since the year-end for Pounds 110m. Provisions for restructuring the largest acquisition, Solvay, would come to just over Pounds 5m, leaving Williams with total charges this year estimated at more than Pounds 9m. Mr Rudd said the group hoped to use the proceeds of the Pounds 267m rights issue in May to complete further purchases - particularly in fire protection and building products - before the end of the year. Profits at the security division advanced 31 per cent to Pounds 16.5m, thanks to the Corbin Russwin acquisition. Fire protection increased profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 25.7m. North American building products returned a 17 per cent profits advance to Pounds 19.6m, while the European business increased profits by 10 per cent to Pounds 34.9m. The interim dividend is increased to 5.25p (5p), payable from basic earnings per share up 8 per cent to 9p. Excluding exceptionals, earnings rose by 12 per cent to 9.6p. COMMENT The shares jumped today, less on the back of Mr Rudd's guarded optimism than on the relief that Williams appears to be holding its margins in spite of higher raw material prices. There is also the feeling that Williams may have finally laid to rest cash flow doubts. Forecasts are for Pounds 200m in profits this year, with the shares on a prospective p/e of about 18. Although Williams offers solid long-term potential, the shares appear to be fairly priced right now.</p>

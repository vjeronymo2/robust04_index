			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: TEAM'S BALANCED SCORING GIVES MCCORKLE THE EDGE  </P> <P> As the leading scorer of Capistrano Valley High School's Southern Section 5-A  champion boys' basketball team last year, Scott McCorkle figured to lead the  Cougars again this season.  </P> <P> Opponents braced to stop McCorkle, a 6-foot-5 forward who signed a letter of  intent in November to attend Syracuse in the fall.  </P> <P> "He's had two people running at him in every game we've played," Coach Mark  Thornton said.  </P> <P> Even so, McCorkle, The Times' Athlete of the Week, is averaging 27 points a  game, three points above his regular-season average last year.  </P> <P> He had 25 points and nine rebounds in a 74-52 victory over Dana Hills  Wednesday. And he had 26 points as the Cougars defeated El Toro, 74-51,  Saturday and moved into a tie with Mission Viejo for first place in the South  Coast League.  </P> <P> But Thornton said the key to the Cougars' success is balance. And not just  balance between McCorkle and his neighbor, point guard Chris Kostoff, who had  20 points and nine assists against Dana Hills and 26 points and nine assists  against El Toro.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, after a 64-47 loss to Mater Dei, the top-ranked team in  Orange County, in which McCorkle and Kostoff scored 41 points, Thornton decided  the Cougars were depending too much on the pair. In one practice, Thornton  prohibited McCorkle and Kostoff from shooting, and in games, he told the rest  of the team to take more shots.  </P> <P> "We wanted to try to get some of the other kids involved in the offense and we  have accomplished that," Thornton said.  </P> <P> McCorkle said his teammates' willingness to take more shots gives him and  Kostoff more opportunities.  </P> <P> "It opens up a lot of things for me and Chris because they have to guard the  other guys too now," McCorkle said.  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Kevin Carlson scored 33 points in Katella's 80-71 victory over Cypress Friday.  Carlson also scored 20 in a 70-53 loss to Esperanza Wednesday.  </P> <P> Orange goalkeeper Tres Martin had two shutouts -- his sixth and seventh of the  season -- as the Panthers won two Pacific Coast League soccer matches. Martin  had 12 saves in Orange's 2-0 victory over Laguna Hills Friday.  </P> <P> Savanna wrestler Tony Okada pinned Richard Martinez of Covina to win the  132-pound division in the Five Counties Tournament at Fountain Valley Saturday.  </P> <P> Robbie Shelton of Western had 30 points and 18 rebounds as he led his team to a  67-48 victory over Anaheim Friday. He had 27 points and eight rebounds in  Western's 63-51 loss to Brea-Olinda Wednesday.  </P> <P> Scott McCorkle  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High  </P> <P> * Position: Forward  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 6-5, 215, Senior  </P> <P> * Last Week: McCorkle scored 51 points in two South Coast League victories.  </P> <P> * Season: McCorkle is averaging 27.2 points and 8.1 rebounds.  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Jakarta set to close file on Timor killings The Indonesian military yesterday handed President Suharto the results of its own investigation into the massacre of civilians in the disputed territory of East Timor last year, writes William Keeling in Jakarta. The report is likely to signal the government's determination to close the incident which caused many international donors to express concern. An earlier report organised by the government said about 50 people had been killed in the incident, as against an estimate of up to 180 by independent witnesses. Most international donors, who meet in Paris this week to consider aid to Indonesia for the year ahead, expressed their satisfaction with the first report and are expected to pledge about Dollars 4.8bn to Indonesia, a similar sum to last year. Yesterday's report says that only 18 graves have been discovered. An armed forces spokesman conceded, however, that some of the 66 people still missing are believed dead.</p>

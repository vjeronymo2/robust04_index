			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING WITH A TWIST: JOB TRAINING;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: WATTS-WILLOWBROOK PROJECT SITS NEXT TO COLLEGE, WHERE RESIDENTS  CAN STUDY FOR HEALTH CAREERS.  </P> <P> A festive crowd of 200 community residents and officials on Friday hailed the  opening of 48 townhouses in the Watts-Willowbrook area. Planners say the  project represents a national role model for providing affordable housing and  career opportunities to low-income working parents.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and other dignitaries dedicated the  Willowbrook Green Housing Complex, a 3 1/2-acre project at the corner of 118th  Street and Compton Avenue near Charles Drew University.  </P> <P> "We need thousands of housing projects like this," Hahn said at the  ribbon-cutting ceremony amid dozens of colored balloons. "This is exactly what  America needs to solve its housing crisis."  </P> <P> Willowbrook Green will be ready for occupancy in mid-August, and the developer  by late fall will complete a 5,200-square-foot child-care center accommodating  60 youngsters. In a unique twist, plans are being drawn up by the adjacent Drew  University College of Allied Health to train interested Willowbrook Green  residents for health careers.  </P> <P> The $3.9-million housing complex is a project of the Drew Housing Development  Corp., a nonprofit developer dedicated to rebuilding run-down neighborhoods in  South-Central Los Angeles, company President Brenda Y. Shockley said.  </P> <P> "We feel that this is a unique project because it is one of the first attempts  to integrate child care, housing and employment together in one cohesive  fashion," Shockley said. "This project was designed as a national role model to  provide affordable housing for working parents."  </P> <P> Each townhouse-style unit will feature carpeting, window blinds, washer and  dryer, a stove, refrigerator and central air conditioning, Shockley said. In  addition, every unit faces a landscaped courtyard with a toddler play area.  There is also a community building where special events can be held.  </P> <P> The apartments range in price from $575 for a one-bedroom to $850 for a  three-bedroom unit, Shockley said.  </P> <P> Curious local residents got their first peek inside the apartments Friday  afternoon, and several said they were impressed with the facilities.  </P> <P> "These apartments are fabulous. They are absolutely beautiful," said Lemmarie  McGuire of Watts, who said she would like to live in the complex.  </P> <P> "This is a good project," said Patricia Hardaway, McGuire's neighbor. "It is  putting something back into our community and it will help a lot of working  parents."  </P> <P> Shockley said a management firm is screening potential tenants, who will soon  learn whether they have qualified for a unit.  </P> <P> "This particular development is reflecting the revitalization that is coming to  the Willowbrook area," Shockley said. "It will provide something the community  can be proud of."  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Letter: Regulatory review must not tie independent financial advisers Sir, You are right, in your leading article, to call for the alternatives to the Personal Investment Authority to be spelt out ('City regulation', January 14). The members of the existing self-regulatory organisations (SROs) will decide whether the PIA comes into existence. They need to know the implications of their decisions before they vote and they should be aware of planned changes within which SROs will operate. However, your suggestions that Fimbra, the regulator for financial intermediaries, could be absorbed within a strengthened Lautro, the regulator for unit trust and life companies, and that independent financial advisers would have to become tied agents, except where they could obtain authorisation through professional bodies, is misguided. While examples of poor advice being given have come to light (incidentally, largely from tied agents), these have affected a small minority of the recipients of advice. A far more pernicious consequence of the Financial Services Act has been the contraction in the availability of independent advice. However tough the regulatory environment, 'tied advice' will not be a universally adequate substitute for independent advice. It is, therefore, important that the current review of SROs does not force independent financial advisers into the tied agency sector.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (4) Section 182(b)(1)_15% Progress Plans.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(b)(1) of the CAA required states to submit a revision to the SIP by November 15, 1993, to provide for VOC emission reductions by November 15, 1996, of at least 15% from baseline emissions accounting for any growth in emissions after the date of enactment of the CAA. The Commonwealth failed to submit the required revisions and as a result, on April 1, 1994, EPA issued a finding letter notifying Kentucky of a finding of failure to submit. This finding of failure to submit triggered the: (1) 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a); (2) the Administrator's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m); and (3) the 2-year time clock for promulgation of the FIP 15% regulations for this area as required by section 110(c)(1). However, the letter acknowledges the submittal of this redesignation request to attainment and stated that if the redesignation request to attainment is approved then requirements for a 15% plan SIP will be unnecessary for the Ashland-Huntington area. Therefore, upon approval of this redesignation request, the sanctions clock will stop. As the requirement to submit a 15% plan did not come due until November 15, 1993, the 15% plan requirement is not an applicable requirement for purposes of the evaluation of this redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (5) Section 182(b)(3)_Stage II.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(b)(3) of the CAA required moderate areas to implement Stage II gasoline vapor recovery systems unless and until EPA promulgated onboard vapor recovery (OBVR) regulations. On January 24, 1994, EPA promulgated the OBVR rule, and, as section 202(a)(b) of the CAA provides that once the rule is promulgated, moderate areas are no longer required to implement Stage II. Thus, the Stage II vapor recovery requirement of section 182(b)(3) is no longer an applicable requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (6) Section 182(b)(4)_Motor Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance (I/M).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA required all moderate and above areas to revise the SIP to include provisions necessary to provide for a vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The Commonwealth failed to submit the required revisions and as a result, on April 1, 1994, EPA issued a finding letter notifying Kentucky of a finding of failure to submit. This finding of failure to submit triggered the: (1) 18-month time clock for mandatory application of sanctions under section 179(a); (2) the Administrator's discretionary authority to impose sanctions under section 110(m); and (3) the 2-year time clock for promulgation of the FIP I/M regulations for this area as required by section 110(c)(1). However, the letter acknowledges the submittal of this redesignation request to attainment and stated that if the redesignation request to attainment is approved then requirements for an I/M SIP will be necessary for the Ashland-Huntington area only as a contingency measure. Therefore, when this redesignation request is approved, the sanctions clock will stop and the program will be a contingency measure in the maintenance plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (7) Section 182(b)(5)_New Source Review (NSR).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA required all classified nonattainment areas to meet several requirements regarding NSR, including provisions to ensure that increased emissions of VOCs compounds will not result from any new or major source modifications and a general offset rule. The Cabinet submitted a NSR rule on February 17, 1993, to incorporate VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  permit review requirements for new and modified sources in Kentucky's O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas. The revised permit requirements meet new offset ratios and additional provisions for moderate O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nonattainment areas. This rule was approved by EPA on June 23, 1994 (59 FR 32343). (EPA notes that under the policy announced in the memorandum, ``Part D New Source Review (part D NSR) Requirements for Areas Requesting Redesignation to Attainment'', dated October 14, 1994, from Mary D. Nichols to Air Division Directors I&hyph;X, approval of the NSR submittal is not necessarily required for approval of a redesignation.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (8) Section 182(f)_Oxides of Nitrogen (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 182(f) of the CAA requires states with areas designated nonattainment for O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and classified as moderate and above to impose the same control requirements for major stationary sources of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as apply to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These control requirements, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NSR, were to be submitted to EPA in a SIP revision by November 15, 1992. EPA adopted a policy pursuant to section 110(k)(4) of the CAA to conditionally approve NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT SIPs which committed to provide EPA with specific enforceable measures within one year of the date of approval of the commitment. EPA's committal SIP policy was challenged in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Council v. Browner_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full Opinion, dated May 6, 1994, the Court found that EPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded the EPA's statutory authority, but concluded that ``EPA properly extended'' to November 15, 1993, the deadline for submittal of fully enforceable NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT SIPs. As a result of this court case, the deadline to submit NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT rules was November 15, 1993. Therefore, because that date is after the Commonwealth submitted the redesignation request, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT is not an applicable requirement for this redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

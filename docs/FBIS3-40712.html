This was indicated here by the  Yugoslav Charge d' Affairs, Ms Milena Vlahovic.    Speaking to this correspondent on the eve of the Foreign  Minister's visit (he arrives here on Sunday, Ms Vlahovic said  the purpose was to inform the Indian leadership "about the  situation in the Balkans, propose possible solutions as well as  explore the possibilities of future interaction, including  cultural exchanges."    Itself a victim of ethnic infighting, Yugoslavia is expected  to back India on the Kashmir issue. Ms Vlahovic said Yugoslavia  "completely and unconditionally supports the stand that Kashmir  is an integral part of India."    However, the emphasis on the sanctions issue is indicated in  the Foreign Minister's itinerary. Apart from calling on the  President, the Prime Minister and holding discussions with his  counterpart, the External Affairs Minister, parleys between Mr.  Jovanovic and the Commerce Minister are also slated.    Mr. Jovanovic's visit coincides with the European Foreign  Ministers proposing a wideranging settlement on the Yugoslav  question.    Covering Croatia as well as Bosnia Herzegovina, this plan  urges Serbs to offer land to the Bosnian Muslims more than what  they conceded in the talks which broke down last summer. In  return, an easing of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro is being  promised.    In addition, aiming to provide relief to the affected  population, European negotiators want safe passage for U.N.  relief convoys. Wanting to create another link to central  Bosnia, the Europeans hope to send technicians to reopen the  airport at Tuzla.    Urging the removal of sanctions, the Yugoslav Charge d'  Affaires said their negative impact was felt in the  Balkans. Referring to the geographic centrality of the country,  she said the sanctions had also been detrimental to Greece,  Romania and Hungary.</p>

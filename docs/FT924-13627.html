			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Letter: Short sighted to halve the size of UK coal industry Sir, Whatever the bullying tactics of mineworkers in the past, it can't make sense to more than halve what remains of the industry. In an island as crowded and as short of natural resources as ours, it is perverse to neglect what we have. Political pundits, electricity generators, shirt-sleeved traders and teenage scribblers justify the prospect by telling us what any fool knows, namely that you can buy fuel cheaply from offshore sources at present. I hope that somebody is considering whether this is still likely to be true in one, five and 20 years' time. Closing mines is not an easily reversible process and I hope we know where our energy will come from if South African coal mines fall into chaos or something blows our oil and gas rigs out of the sea. Quite apart from such strategic risks, there is the mundane consideration that further devaluations of the pound can soon change today's bargain into tomorrow's extortionate price. Such weakening of the currency will be accelerated if we damage the balance of payments by importing yet more of our raw materials. It might be wrong to think that the electricity generators have all this at the front of their minds in deciding what amount of coal to buy in the UK and hence what proportion of the mines will be closed. They have more immediate concerns than this and they know that, in the ultimate, no conceivable UK government can allow electricity generators to founder completely. That is why it was a mistake to privatise them. If one of them takes a short cut to a cost saving, the other will have to do likewise. We can all see short cuts but who can save us from short sight?

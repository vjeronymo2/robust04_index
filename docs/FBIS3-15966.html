"As investigation is still under way we refrain from any  comments", the spokesman told TASS on Friday and asked not to  press for detailed information.    "In general I am against such inappropriate persistence of  the press. We are doing everything which is in the interests of  maintaining security of this country. We report about our  successes when this does not impede our work", he said.</p>

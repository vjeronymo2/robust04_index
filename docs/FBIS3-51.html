			<p>SUMMARY                                           On 16 March Russian Television's (RTV) primetime edition of its  Vesti news program launched a scathing attack on media bigwigs,  including Aleksandr Yakovlev, head of both the Federal Service of  Russia for Television and Radio Broadcasting and the Ostankino  Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, and Mikhail  Poltoranin, head of the State Duma Committee for Information  Policy and Communications.  Showing video of the two taking in  the performance of an exotic dancer at a club for media elite,  the program juxtaposed the officials' expensive and decadent  perquisites with state television's acute shortage of operating  funds.                                     END SUMMARY      Newscaster Svetlana Sorokina began the report by highlighting the  continuing financial difficulties Plaguing state television.  She  noted that Anatoliy Nazeykin, chairman of the Central Committee  of the Russian Federation Trade Union of Communications Workers,  had recently warned that communications workers may again go on  strike, as they did in February, if state television companies  continue to fall behind in payments to communications enterprise5  for broadcasting state programming.  The report then noted that  the "media chiefs" had just attended a meeting of the Russian  Union of Journalists where participant5 discussed state  televisions financial crisis, and had stopped off at an  "elitist" and "bourgeoi"  journalists' club on returning from the  meeting.  Accompanying video showed Yakovlev and Poltoranin  conversing at a table and then cut to shots of an "exotic" dancer  performing a strip-tease to Western jazz music.  The reporter  said that the club's patrons, largely bankers and entrepreneurs  selected according to "CPSU principles," came to enjoy "expensive  foreign drinks" and to experience "Western culture," which is  "foreign" to Russians.  He concluded the report by noting that  the proceeds from the club were supposed to support state  television and questioning whether the government would also  help.  Sorokina then closed the broadcast by sardonically  assuring viewers that, "as soon as we learn," Vesti would inform  viewers "whom the government will help and how."     Implications     Coming in the wake of a major media reorganizati0n and statements  by Yeltsin on the need to maintain two state television  companies, this brash attack may indicate that decision-makers at  RTV see Yeltsin himself as their patron and do not fear  antagonizing Yakovlev or media officialdom in general.  It may be  particularly embarrassing for Yakovlev, who himself has recently  expressed his opposition to excessive sex and violence in Western  television programming aired on Russian television.  The attack,  however, plays into the hands of Yeltsin's hardline opponents,  who often decry the alleged influence and decadence of the West.  Finally, by simultaneously titillating viewers with salacious  television footage and embarrassing Yakovlev, head of RTV's main  rival, Ostankino, the report may indicate that competition  between the two major television companie5 for viewers and  advertising rubles is heating up.

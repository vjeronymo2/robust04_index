			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / West honours Berlin troops Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand attend ceremonies in Berlin yesterday to mark the departure of western Allied troops. Mr Kohl said Germany would never forget what its partners did for it during the Soviet blockade of west Berlin in 1948-49. Meanwhile, Mr Mitterrand's press service denied that the French president had cancelled some of his engagements in Berlin because of ill health. He is suffering from cancer. See Page 2</p>

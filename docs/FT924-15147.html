			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: USAir disrupted by ground crew strike THOUSANDS of ground crew workers went on strike yesterday against USAir, the US carrier into which British Airways is seeking to invest Dollars 750m for a large minority stake. The strike action, which stems from USAir's efforts to secure work rule changes and wage concessions in negotiations with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, had an immediate impact on operations. The carrier, which runs about 2,750 jet departures each day, immediately cut jet flight schedules to 60 per cent of the normal level. The damage done to USAir will depend heavily on how long the strike lasts. Yesterday, the airline said that it was in talks with a federal mediator and the IAM, in the hope that matters could be quickly resolved - although USAir claimed to have contingency plans aimed at restoring 100 per cent of flight capacity if the industrial action persists. However, Standard &amp; Poors, the large ratings agency which has USAir debt under review with 'developing' implications, warned: 'The strike by the machinists, while not as damaging as a pilots' strike, could cause serious disruption and losses if it lasts for more than a few days'. Mr Jim Conley of the IAM said there were pickets 'at all locations where USAir flies in the US'. By mid-morning, the USAir flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants, had thrown its support behind the mechanics' strike, and instructed members not to cross picket lines. However, the USAir's pilots union said that it was taking no position on the dispute. It advised members to report for work as scheduled - although not to perform other duties. USAir, meanwhile, said that the strike was not expected to affect its shuttle operation, between New York, Boston and Washington DC, or its USAir Express commuter carriers. It added that international flights were running as normal. A number of other US airlines - including Continental, Northwest, America West and Delta - said that they would generally try to accommodate strike-hit passengers holding USAir tickets, where space permitted. USAir, which has lost about Dollars 760m after tax during the past two years, has been asking all employees to accept wage and work rule concessions in an attempt to prune about Dollars 400m from its annual cost base. USAir reached an agreement with its pilots, earlier this year but negotiations with the mechanics and flight attendants have remained unresolved. USAir shares slumped  3/4 to Dollars 11 1/4 . USAir said yesterday that the period in which British Airways may terminate its investment offer has been extended to November 9 from October 4. British Airways can rescind its offer if it is not satisfied with a due diligence investigation of USAir. In addition, talks between the US and the UK governments about revisions to the bilateral aviation agreement are scheduled to resume this week.</p>

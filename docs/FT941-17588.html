			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Regional divide narrows The recession has narrowed the north-south divide, figures from the Central Statistical Office showed yesterday. Gross domestic product per head in south-east England slipped back while that in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north moved forward. But an east-west divide opened up with East Anglia seeing the biggest rise and north-west England the steepest fall. Regional figures for 1992 showed that while GDP in Greater London was down almost 2 per cent on 1991, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north saw their second successive relative increase. Total GDP in 1992 was Pounds 514bn, up 4 per cent on 1991. More than a third was accounted for by the south-east, with Greater London alone responsible for 14.7 per cent.</p>

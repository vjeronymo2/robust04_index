			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Consumer gloom spreads to businesses claims IoD The 'feel bad' factor among consumers that has been souring the UK economic recovery may now be spreading to the business community. The latest bi-monthly survey by the Institute of Directors, out yesterday, showed that business confidence in the health of Britain's economy has slipped in recent months, even though the City is forecasting steady growth next year. The findings, which come as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, meets Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, for their monthly monetary meeting today, highlight the obstacles the government may face next year in convincing people that a stable recovery is under way. The IoD survey showed business confidence at its lowest for two years. After recent interest rate rises and Budget and political turmoil, the proportion of directors who were optimistic about the economy fell to 38 per cent this month from 43 per cent two months ago. The fall occurred even though the IoD itself predicts steady growth for Britain in 1995. The prediction echoes a recent, separate survey of more than 40 economic forecasters, which also expects healthy, industry-led expansion next year. That survey, which is tracked by the Treasury, showed that most forecasters expect growth of about 3.25 per cent in 1995, consistent with the Treasury's own forecast. The underlying inflation rate is expected to be 2.9 per cent - higher than the Treasury's forecast, but very low compared with the past two decades. The average consensus among the forecasters is that exports will grow by between 6 per cent and 7 per cent next year, while imports will grow by only 5 per cent. The consumer sector, however, is expected to remain relatively weak, underlining the export and industry-driven nature of the recovery. City and independent forecasters expect consumer spending to grow on average by only 2.3 per cent next year. Nevertheless, yesterday's IoD survey suggested that rosy economic forecasts were viewed with caution by many businessmen, not least because of recent splits in the government. Nearly half those directors who were less confident about the economy than six months ago cited political concerns as their key worry, the IoD said. A separate report from the Incomes Data Services highlighted another potential business worry. The survey of wage settlements showed that pay rises have crept up over the past year, with most settlements between October and December worth about 3 per cent. That is low compared with the UK's recent economic experiences, but higher than the rate of inflation. Busy start to sales, Page 6</p>

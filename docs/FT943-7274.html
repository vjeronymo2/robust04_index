			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: NFC loses driver NFC's statement on the resignation of chief executive Mr Peter Sherlock left everything to the imagination. The company provided no explanation at all, not even that traditional fig leaf, 'after a clash of management styles'. To be fair to NFC, Bass was no more illuminating when Mr Sherlock left its employ in October 1992. Whatever the reasons, shareholders of both companies may begrudge paying Mr Sherlock over Pounds 1m in compensation for loss of office in under two years. The bigger worry for NFC shareholders is that there is more to Mr Sherlock's departure than personalities. While his business school jargon may not have been to every investment institution's taste, his arrival was welcomed by those keen to see NFC's inbred culture opened up. They will not be reassured that the board appears to have sided with Mr Robbie Burns, a life-long NFC man who was beaten to the top job by Mr Sherlock and has now withdrawn his own resignation. Although the company stresses that there has been no change in strategic direction, the suspicion remains that Mr Sherlock wanted to pursue it more quickly than Mr Burns. The management question would matter less if Mr Sherlock's bullish comments about trading prospects had proved accurate. Third quarter figures suggest operating profit growth remains very sluggish. NFC may be right to blame both European recession and American overheating for its problems. But the new chief executive will need to do more to convince investors it can capitalise on the undoubted opportunities.</p>

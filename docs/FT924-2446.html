			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Building society's debt rating cut NATIONWIDE became the first building society to have its short-term debt rating lowered when Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, downgraded the rating on Nationwide's commercial paper and certificates of deposit from A1 to A2 yesterday. S&amp;P said the downgrade reflected the 'impact of the continued weakness of the UK housing market on Nationwide's asset quality', adding that the high level of mortgage arrears would require heavy provisioning charges in the current and future financial years. Borrowers normally find that their funding costs rise when the rating on their short-term or long-term debt is lowered. Mr Richard Lassen, treasurer at Nationwide, said the society would 'probably stay away from the commercial paper market for the next few months' to avoid higher costs. 'We can continue funding in the UK, principally by winding down our very high level of liquidity.' Nationwide, the second-largest building society, has a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.28bn) commercial paper programme that has been fully used, and the paper is due to mature over the next few months. It will continue to issue certificates of deposit. Nationwide has total debts of about Pounds 7bn.</p>

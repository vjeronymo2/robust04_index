The petitioner proposes to use only portable fire extinguishers to replace existing requirements where rock dust, water cars, and other water storage are not practical. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. C &amp; C Coal Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;125&hyph;C]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> C &amp; C Coal Company, 100 E.

No. 36&hyph;08341) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to limit the mapping of mines above and below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mine workings to those present within 100 foot of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

No. 36&hyph;08341) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to revise and supplement mine maps on an annual basis instead of the required 6 month interval and to update maps daily by hand notations. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Betty B. Coal Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;127&hyph;C]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Betty B. Coal Company, P.O. Box 1139, Coeburn, Virginia 24230 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1710 (canopies or cabs; electric face equipment) to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Betty B. Mine No. 12 (I.D. No. 44&hyph;06423) located in Wise County, Virginia. The petitioner requests relief from the use of canopies on electric face equipment. The petitioner states that the use of canopies would result in hazardous conditions to the equipment operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5. L. L. &amp; S. Coal Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;128&hyph;C]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> L. L. &amp; S. Coal Company, P.O. Box 148, Hegins, Pennsylvania 17938 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1400 (hoisting equipment; general) to its L. L. &amp; S. Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08166) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Because of steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternate, when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Consolidation Coal Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;129&hyph;C]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241&hyph;1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its Robinson Run No. 95 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01318) located in Harrison County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions from the No. 5 Seal in the Main East set of seals to the point of intersection with Main North of the intake air course, traveling the affected area in its entirety would be unsafe. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation check points; to have a certified person test for methane and the quantity of air at each check point on a weekly basis; to have the certified person initial, date, and record the results in a record book kept on the surface; and to make the record book available for inspection by interested persons. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

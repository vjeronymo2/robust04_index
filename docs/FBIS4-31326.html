			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, June 5 (MTI) -- The 26-strong  parliamentary group of the Independent Smallholders Party [FKgP]  has elected party chairman Jozsef Torgyan faction leader on  Sunday [5 June], the first day of their Budapest statutory  meeting. The FKgP took fourth place -- 6.74 per cent -- among  the six parties that got into Hungary's National Assembly in the  May general elections.    Asked by MTI, Torgyan said he was elected parliamentary  faction leader unanimously. The rules of operation will also  have to be discussed and approved at the meeting, he added.    Commenting on the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] special  Saturday [4 June] congress nominating party chairman Gyula Horn  for premiership, Torgyan said he was not surprised at the  decision as he had always considered Horn the most likely  candidate for the post. Horn's personal contribution to the  MSZP's overwhelming election victory is indisputable, he said.  It would have been total negligence of the voters' will if  somebody else had been nominated for the prime ministerial post,  Torgyan said. For the same reason, the Alliance of Free  Democrats is almost certain to say yes to a coalition, he added.    The FKgP is preparing to provide a forthright opposition to  the next government. "This is the only party that has repeatedly  made it clear-cut from the very beginning: It will not  cooperate with the Socialists in any way," Torgyan said.</p>

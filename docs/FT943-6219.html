			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Bidders queue up on Highway One - Vietnam's road project is near the contract phase For about 75 international construction companies bidding for contracts on Highway One, Vietnam's first large infrastructure project since 1975, the nail-biting will not last much longer. Officials from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) say companies should know by the end of this year whether they have clinched contracts to upgrade the country's main road artery: a pot-holed, 2,300km two-lane road that links Ho Chi Minh City with the capital, Hanoi. Vietnamese transport officials suggest companies from South Korea and the US are front-runners in a line-up including contractors from Malaysia, Japan, India and Yugoslavia. The Chinese are also prominent on the list, reflecting growing interest by Vietnam's giant neighbour in the country's infrastructure projects. The World Bank and ADB are part-financing the project through loans worth a combined Dollars 278.5m. The total project is estimated at Dollars 317m. The World Bank loan agreement has already been signed and ADB officials say the ADB agreement should be signed within the next three weeks. Both banks are inspecting pre-qualification documents and say they will allow approved companies to make their bids later this month. Interest has been keen. Most international companies have seen little incentive in going for privately financed projects due to low traffic volumes, which would limit the returns from tolls. However, with Vietnam's renewed access to funds from multilateral agencies, following the clearing of its IMF arrears, they have swooped in on Highway One. South Korean companies, often regarded as the industry's most keenly priced construction bidders, have submitted the most bids on both projects. Together with the American bidders - which local press reports suggest include big names such as Parsons Brinckerhoff and Brown and Root - they appear to have a slight advantage, having had a hand in building roughly 3,000km of roads in the southern part of the country before 1975. 'I think they know the conditions in Vietnam better than the others because of their experience before,' said Mr Pham Ngoc Thuy, general director of the transport ministry's Project Management Unit 1, whose staff of 40 is overseeing the bids from the Vietnamese side. The criteria used to determine who gets the contracts are 'technical and financial capacity,' says Mr Thuy. The portion of the Highway One upgrading overseen by the World Bank runs from Hanoi to Vinh and is split into two sections, with one contract for each. A third contract is for the section that runs south from the industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City to Can Tho. The ADB is overseeing the stretch from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang, further north. In common with most multilaterally funded projects, price is likely to be the determining factor. 'At the end of the day, the key is price,' said Mr Bradley Babson, Hanoi Resident Representative of the World Bank. 'The whole idea is to award the contract to the lowest technically qualified bid.' Between 40 and 50 per cent of the bidders would get through to the next stage of being invited to submit bids early next month, said Mr Thuy. Work should start by May and was slated for completion in mid-1998, despite the fact that some tax issues still had to be resolved, he said. The government is still debating the tax regime for contractors awarded the projects. They could be liable for import tax, personal income tax and turnover tax, a widely unpopular special levy that applies to many foreign investment projects in Vietnam. 'In the loan agreement with the (World) Bank, the bank has said it will not finance any part of tax and the government must contribute this part, 100 per cent,' said Mr Thuy. 'Whether we apply the tax or not, it's a problem,' he said. However, contractors wishing to hire labour for the project would be able to hire on the open market and there would be no special surcharges for hiring workers, as there are in the oil industry. Construction companies vying for Highway One projects are anxious to have these issues ironed out before work starts, industry officials say. Any cost overruns would be dealt with by holding over non-essential sections of the highway until the next phase of World Bank and ADB-funded Highway One projects. Both banks are conducting preliminary studies of stretches of the road that do not fall within the current loan schemes, notably from Vinh to Nha Trang. Vietnam had not yet started resettling the millions of people affected and was 'still surveying', said Mr Thuy. 'But it must be done before January.' One of the components of the World Bank loan is assistance towards relocation. Highway One is the first of several infrastructure projects planned for the country, whose 10,000km of roads have suffered from war damage and neglect. The World Bank estimates that Vietnam will need Dollars 7bn-Dollars 10bn by the year 2000 for comprehensive repairs to infrastructure and recommends that at least Dollars 2.2bn be allocated to transport.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGHWAY 1: REVITALISING THE MAIN ARTERY  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- World Bank  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total project cost:                        Dollars   176m Total World Bank loan:                     Dollars 158.5m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ADB  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total project cost:                        Dollars   141m Total ADB loan:                            Dollars   120m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Transport Facts  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vietnam has 10,000km of roads, 40% of which are rated 'poor' or 'very poor' 8,280 road bridges, 50% of which are dilapidated 2,600km of railways Seven major seaports Three international &amp; 10 domestic airports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Ministry of Transport, World Bank, ADB, Vietnam Economic Times  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

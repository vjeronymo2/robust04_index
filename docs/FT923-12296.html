			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / German Bonds: Ground trembles beneath the ERM ON the Richter scale of seismic disturbance in the bond markets, the impact of last Thursday's 0.75 percentage point rise in Germany's discount rate took time to register. Other European bond markets even managed a spontaneous half-hearted cheer of a rally in their relief that the ground had not shaken harder. But by the end of Friday, the subterranean after-shocks set off by the Bundesbank's action had given a thorough shake to the foundations of the exchange rate mechanism. The shudders were not only felt in bond markets at the outer margins of the ERM. The yield on 10-year French government bonds jumped from 8.85 per cent to 8.97 per cent, opening up the widest gap between French and German bond yields this year at nearly 90 basis points. French bond prices, of course, reflect the other great fear that stalks the markets: that French voters will say 'non' in September to Maastricht proposals for economic and monetary union, and put a bomb under the seemingly inexorable convergence of bond yields across the EC. With German monetary tightening acting as another turn of the screw on the hard-pressed economies of its neighbours, that no vote may have become a little more likely. The tremor that passed through the markets on Friday was felt equally strongly from southern Europe to Scandinavia. Spanish bond prices, which had nose-dived by Thursday to their lowest for some time, took one look over their shoulder and kept on going. Ten-year bond yields, which had leapt to 11.80 per cent on Thursday, jumped further to 11.93 per cent. Italy's monetary authorities may have earned plaudits in the market for acting decisively to raise the country's discount rate by 0.75 percentage point on Thursday (the second rise in a fortnight) but it did not insulate Italian bonds from the rout. Net yields on 10-year bonds followed those of their Spanish counterparts, moving up from 11.75 per cent to 11.92 per cent. The ripples beyond the immediate confines of the ERM bloc extended to Sweden, where 10-year bond yields ended the week at 10 per cent, around 10 basis points up on the week, although Finland escaped the worst of the slide. A currency swap agreement between Finnish and other European central bankers, designed to underpin the Finnish currency and fortuitously announced on Wednesday, left yields by the end of the week firmer at just under 12 per cent. The sharp drops of Friday took place against a background of thin trading in cash markets, with investors either already on holiday or too nervous to act. Most are only likely to shake off the paralysis when they feel they know the answer to one question: what will the Bundesbank do next? The narrowing of the gap between the discount and Lombard rates to 1 percentage point has been interpreted by some as a sign of pressure for another Lombard rate rise. However, as the graph shows, the gap between the two has been narrower in the past, particularly when the interest rate environment changes quickly. Certainly there were no hints on Friday of further stringency. The gap between three-month and 10-year German interest rates, at 180 basis points, is already as great as at any time recently, but there was no indication of short-term interest rates creeping up, further inverting the yield curve. 'The Bundesbank is relieving tensions in the money markets,' said Mr Klaus Baader, economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, on Friday. 'A Lombard rate rise certainly isn't programmed into the markets yet.' Mr Baader summed up the mood of most investors and analysts: 'German monetary policy is very finely balanced between tightening and easing.' Some clue could come this week, with the latest inflation and money supply data. Market observers are looking for a sharp fall in the headline inflation rate from its 4.3 per cent level, while M3 growth is expected to ease from the 8.7 per cent recorded for May. If the market's expectations are disappointed, fears will intensify that the Lombard rate will be raised later in the summer. And with the French preparing to vote on Maastricht, that really would make the earth beneath the bond markets move.</p>

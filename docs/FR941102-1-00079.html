			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D. Miscellaneous <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The three component prices: butterfat, protein, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other solids, will be expressed on a per pound basis with four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> places to the right of the decimal. Analysis has shown that by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressing these prices to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accuracy of the prices is significantly enhanced over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressing the prices to the nearest cent. Additionally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference between what is paid into the producer settlement fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and what is drawn from the producer settlement fund is much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closer to zero than when prices are rounded to the nearest full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast to other orders that have multiple component  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing provisions, this decision incorporates only one protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price as well as one other nonfat solids price. The pooling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the components to include the Class I skim portion is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporated within the computation of the producer price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential. This feature of the pricing plan allows for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elimination of separate handler and producer protein prices and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate handler and producer other solids prices, and resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion over which price, handler or producer, should be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when. In addition, a handler's per pound price for protein or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other solids is the same whether the handler is buying milk from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers or from other handlers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The producer price differential, which represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional value of Class I and Class II milk in the pool and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> positive or negative effect of Class III&hyph;A, will be determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computing for each handler, and then accumulating for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers, the differential value (from Class III) of the Class I,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class II, and Class III&hyph;A product pounds. The differential value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is adjusted, when appropriate, for shrinkage and overage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory reclassification, receipts of other source milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated as Class I, receipts from unregulated supply plants,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location adjustments, and, in the Chicago Regional order,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation and assembly credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of eliminating differences between handler  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and producer component values, the value of the Class I skim milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the values of the protein and other solids contained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skim milk allocated to Class II and Class III will be added to,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the values of the protein and other solids contained in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer milk subtracted from, the differential pool. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulated total for all handlers is then adjusted by total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer location adjustments and one-half the unobligated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance in the producer settlement fund. The resulting value is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then divided by the total pounds of producer milk in the pool,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and an amount not less than four cents nor more than five cents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is deducted. The result is the producer price differential to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid to producers on a per hundredweight basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is possible for the producer price differential to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative. A negative producer price differential can result for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two reasons. Any of the Class I, II, or III&hyph;A differential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices may be negative and/or the minus adjustments may be large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to offset any positive contribution from the differential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price. A negative producer price differential would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent to a uniform price less than the Class III price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An issue that was not directly addressed in this proceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned testing for protein. The five orders included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing currently base protein testing on the standard Kjeldahl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method, which tests for nitrogen and then converts the nitrogen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result to protein. Since there is a certain amount of free  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrogen in milk this test somewhat overstates the protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content of milk. Recent developments in testing allow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing for true protein which is a more accurate reflection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein content. In no way does this decision mandate a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing procedure. However, when (or if) the industry does move  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to testing for true protein, this decision should not be viewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a hindrance to that conversion. At the time a change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing for true protein may occur, a change in the 1.32 factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

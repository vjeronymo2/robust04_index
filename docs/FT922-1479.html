			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (5): A less costly way to build systems - Downsizing COMPUTER COMPANIES are increasingly replacing centralised mainframe computer systems with open, distributed networks of 'smaller' computers. The main difference between the old mainframe systems and the new distributed systems is the separation of the front-end workstation functions from the back-end 'server' functions - often referred to as a client-server system. The front-end desktop workstations or personal computers replace the so-called 'dumb' terminals which are used to provide access to mainframe-based applications. These are the 'clients' in client/server systems. Workstations are easier to use because they have their own processing power and are equipped with much better presentation features than mainframe terminals. These features - graphical user interfaces - allow users to carry out local computing tasks, such as wordprocessing and spreadsheet processing, in addition to acting as a terminal to a large central server system. The server systems replace the back-end functions - database management, printing, communications and intensive processing. The term 'downsizing' is misleading. The systems used to replace the old mainframes and terminals are only smaller in some respects. They are less expensive, they occupy less physical space and, in theory, they require less specialist attention. But the new systems are not smaller in performance terms and many can now match mainframes in important areas of business data processing such as transaction processing and database management. The term 'rightsizing', which is a becoming popular one, is far more appropriate. Companies said to be downsizing are taking advantage of a shift in the economies of scale in the computer industry. The original large mainframe systems offered economies of scale because they offered the greatest amount of computing power for the price. But in the past decade, the price/performance of industry-standard microprocessors - such as those produced by Intel and Motorola - has grown exponentially. A typical desktop PC in 1992 is more powerful than a typical mainframe was in 1982. The standard PC is far less expensive and costs virtually nothing to run. More important, it can be connected to other computers in a network and share large, expensive resources such as printers and database storage. This has made downsizing appealing and an increasing number of large users are moving applications away from mainframes. Large organisations, such as BP Oil and Mercury, the UK telecommunications company, have begun to re-orient their information technology strategy towards networks of workstations based on the client/server approach. The trend to downsizing has only become practical because of the growth of open systems standards. These standards - now followed by most suppliers - provide a framework with which to connect workstations and server systems so that they may be used for the advanced applications that were once the exclusive preserve of proprietary mainframe systems. The most important mainframe applications have always been performance-sensitive tasks which involve processing transactions such as the large networks of automatic teller machines used by banks and building societies. Until recently, specially-designed proprietary systems, such as IBM's mainframe systems, were the only systems capable of powering large-scale transaction-processing applications. But in the past year, the increased power and improved software offered by server systems has challenged the proprietary mainframe's leading role in transaction processing. The breakthrough has come from companies which have harnessed the power of several small computers in what is termed a parallel-processing architecture. These include systems developed by companies such as Sequent and Pyramid, which use special transaction-processing software from software developers. Oracle and Informix - among those at the forefront of this trend - have produced impressive results for transaction processing which compare with those produced by mainframe computers costing substantially more. There are also moves to include standards for transaction-processing systems within the emerging standards for open systems, based on the Unix operating system. Unix Systems Laboratories (USL), the organisation responsible for the development of Unix, has persuaded a number of leading manufacturers to base their transaction processing systems on a software standard called Tuxedo. If USL is successful in establishing Tuxedo as a standard, it is likely that many transaction-processing applications which use mainframe hardware to support them will switch to open systems. The most important aspect of downsizing, however, is the significant cost reductions in building information systems. Some put the reductions from downsizing as being as high as 75 per cent of the cost of an equivalent mainframe system - although the claim is countered by others who warn of hidden costs such as re-training and systems integration.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Discussing the UN Security Council's deliberations  on the Hebron massacre, AL-BA'TH writes in its "With the Events"  column:    Awaiting a UN Security Council resolution and following  world  demand for an Israeli withdrawal and the implementation of the  Geneva Conventions on the protection of civilians in time of  war, the threats to peace, posed by the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, have not gone away. Nor will the massacre lose its  influence on the credibility of the UN Security Council, which  is still holding consultations as if the massacre were less  significant than Lockerbie or less vicious than the reasons that  prompted UN troops to land in more than one capital of the  post-Cold War world.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Plant closures push Sansui Electric into red SANSUI Electric, the Japanese audio equipment maker acquired by Polly Peck International, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Y9.6bn (Dollars 74m), as the company continued its attempts to restructure manufacturing operations in Asia. Sales totalled Y20.5bn, compared with Y16.3bn for a nine-month period in 1990, when the company's financial year was changed. Sales of audio equipment, which account for about 90 per cent of total sales, were affected by a downturn in the Japanese and international markets. The company reported an after-tax loss of Y73.16bn, which it said arose from costs associated with plant closures. In the previous period, it reported an after-tax profit of Y413m and it is forecasting a profit of Y500m this year. For the current year, the company forecasts sales of Y18bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y3.5bn.</p>

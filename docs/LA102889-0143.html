			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL-EFFECTS MAN R.H. PATTERSON DIES AT 74  </P> <P> Services will be conducted today for veteran movie special-effects man R.H.  (Pat) Patterson, who suffered a massive stroke and died just hours before he  was expected to leave for Las Vegas to begin work on the film "Back to the  Future III."  </P> <P> Patterson died at his Costa Mesa home Tuesday afternoon, his daughter Barbra  Patterson said Friday. He was 74.  </P> <P> Patterson was probably best known for helping to stage the jarring and  memorable final scene in the movie "Bonnie and Clyde," in which the two  characters are killed in a gunfire barrage. He also worked on numerous other  hits, including "The Blues Brothers" and "Escape From New York," his daughter  said.  </P> <P> Other films he worked on include "Oklahoma Crude" and "Carousel," as well as  the television shows "Gunsmoke" and "Death Valley Days." Barbra Patterson said  her father especially enjoyed working on movies starring John Wayne. "They were  very close friends," she said.  </P> <P> Patterson was born in Brazil, Ind., in 1915 and moved to Idaho in 1932, where  he was a disc jockey for a few years before coming to California with his wife.  He began his career in the movie industry as a studio carpenter.  </P> <P> Patterson is survived by his wife, Irene Marie, a son, four daughters, 12  grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.  </P> <P> Services will be held at 2 p.m. today at Pierce Brothers Bell Broadway mortuary  in Costa Mesa.  </P></p>

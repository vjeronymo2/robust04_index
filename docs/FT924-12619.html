			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / International Company News: Publishing division boosts Time Warner results TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday unveiled a solid advance in its third-quarter operating earnings, but incurred a Dollars 152m loss after the payment of dividends on preferred stock. The stock was issued at the time of the 1989 merger of Time and Warner. The company chose to highlight its third-quarter net profit of Dollars 6m, which compares with a Dollars 62m net loss a year ago. But Time Warner's need to continue paying special preferred stock dividends resulted in the ultimate Dollars 152m loss, or 41 cents a share, although this has been reduced from the Dollars 211m loss or 66 cents of a year ago. Operating profits were Dollars 303m, up from Dollars 218m in the same period last year, while total revenues were Dollars 3.2bn, up from Dollars 2.9bn. Mr Gerald Levin, co-chief executive, said despite continued sluggishness in the world economy, Time Warner had posted 'three straight quarters in which all five of our divisions showed increases in their results'. Fourth-quarter results are likely to benefit from a worldwide book, record and video campaign on behalf of the new, sexually explicit products being launched by Madonna, the pop star. The publishing division achieved Dollars 64m of operating income before depreciation and amortisation, compared with only Dollars 1m a year ago. The music division earned Dollars 122m on the same basis, compared with Dollars 116m. Filmed entertainment was almost unchanged at Dollars 121m, against Dollars 120m, while the Home Box Office (HBO) cable programming business earned Dollars 54m, up from Dollars 47m. The cable operating division earned Dollars 250m, against Dollars 221m. Time Warner's operating income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 926m, up from Dollars 752m. Net profits were Dollars 18m, compared with a Dollars 144m loss in the same period last year. The group's loss after paying dividends on preferred stock was Dollars 449m in the first nine months, down from Dollars 585m. On Wall Street, Time Warner's share price closed Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 24. McGraw-Hill, the media and financial services company, lifted third-quarter net earnings by 11 per cent to Dollars 61.1m. Revenues were 8.8 per cent higher at Dollars 532.7m.</p>

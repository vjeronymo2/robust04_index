			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UN struggles to avert Angola nightmare: Michael Holman on the waning prospects for a lasting end to the 16-year conflict IT HAD the makings of a nightmare, the senior UN official said last May when contemplating the biggest obstacle in the path of Angola's transition from 16 years of civil war to multi-party democracy. The demobilisation of the country's rival armies was going badly, he warned; weapons were cached, discipline was poor, and the timetable was slipping. Less than a year later, his grim vision has become reality as Angola slides back into civil war, triggered by Unita leader Jonas Savimbi's rejection of the September election which gave victory to President Eduardo dos Santos and the ruling MPLA. Over 1,500 people are reported to have died in the past two weeks and fighting continued yesterday in and around Huambo, the central highlands city currently held by Unita. Last-ditch efforts to restore peace, in which Ms Margaret Anstee, the UN special representative based in Luanda, will play a key role, may yet bear fruit. Diplomats in the Angolan capital said Mr Venancio de Moura, the country's foreign minister, had on Tuesday at a meeting with Portuguese, Russian and US observers and Ms Anstee, formally proposed talks with Unita. But western diplomats warn that forging a lasting settlement will be a frustrating process, undermined by old enmities, tribal rivalries, Mr Savimbi's overriding ambition, and the temptation of controlling proceeds from the country's 500,000 b/d oil sector. Should peace efforts fail, an early military victory for either side seems unlikely, they say. Instead, there will be what a US diplomat yesterday called 'a process of mutual enfeeblement until both forces go back to the negotiating table'. No one is sure how long that would take. A broad assessment by western analysts puts the MPLA in control of the main towns, while Unita can operate relatively freely in 75 per cent of the countryside. Both sides have lost allies: the 50,000-strong Cuban contingent that fought alongside the MPLA has long since departed. Namibia's independence has deprived Unita of what amounted to a rear base in the formerly South African-controlled territory. Pretoria, which sent troops into Angola in support of Unita, seems unlikely again to come to the help of Mr Savimbi in any substantial way. Zaire remains a valuable Unita ally, but its role as a conduit for US military and other assistance ended with the departure of the Cubans. Meanwhile Washington has increasingly distanced itself from Mr Savimbi, embarrassed by his human rights record, and sceptical of his claims of election rigging. The incoming Democrat administration will take an even tougher stand. Unita has also been weakened by divisions within its ranks, which came to a head last year when senior officials deserted Mr Savimbi following the murder of a former aide. Tensions remain, illustrated earlier this week when Mr Abel Chivukuvuku, Unita's secretary for foreign affairs, and General Peregrino Huambu, its military intelligence chief, called for an immediate end to fighting. Both men were captured in October during fighting in Luanda which saw Unita driven from the capital. But whether speaking under duress or not, their absence from the battlefield must be a blow to Mr Savimbi. Whatever the outcome of mediation efforts, no one doubts that Angola's best chance for peace was squandered last year. Implementation of the peace plan was weak, the timetable proved unrealistic and resources for the exercise were too few. Central to the success of the transition was the requirement that soldiers and guerrillas from rival armies report to 50 assembly points, to be monitored by UN forces, before being demobilised or entering an integrated national army. Both sides were suspected of caching weapons and those that were surrendered were not securely held. As election day approached, only 1,500 soldiers had been sworn in to an integrated national army supposed to number 40,000. Tens of thousands of government and Unita soldiers were still in demobilisation camps, most of them with ready access to weapons. A further 40,000 men of the 150,000-strong combined forces had yet to be demobilised. Western diplomats now acknowledge that they could have acted differently, insisting that elections could not proceed until both sides respected the terms of the peace pact signed in May 1991. 'As I listened to the speeches that evening and watched MPLA and Unita leaders mingling, I knew that we were celebrating the end of an era,' wrote Mr Chester Crocker, predecessor to Mr Cohen, and the the architect of the south-west African settlement. It proved premature. This time round, scepticism, not optimism, is the mood of Angola's would-be peace makers.</p>

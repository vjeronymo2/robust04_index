			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: REEBOK OFFICIAL RESIGNS, UNITS COMBINED  </P> <P> Reebok International Ltd. has combined its domestic and international Reebok  divisions, and the president of the U.S. operation has announced his  resignation.  </P> <P> Frank O'Connell, who was president of the U.S. division the past two years,  said he was departing the athletic-shoe company "with positive feelings."  </P> <P> "It was a situation where I didn't see the opportunity to exercise my  leadership skills," O'Connell, 46, said in a phone interview. "I don't want to  stay unless I could really run it."  </P> <P> Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of Reebok, said in a statement that  John Duerden will be president of the combined, global business.  </P> <P> Duerden, 49, was previously president of the international division.  </P> <P> Combining the two divisions "is the most effective way to maximize the global  opportunities for the Reebok brand," Fireman said, adding that Duerden's  experience will help the company focus on worldwide sales.  </P> <P> Under the new structure, Duerden will report directly to Fireman, as will the  presidents of other company divisions, such as Avia and Rockport shoes and  Boston Whaler boats.  </P></p>

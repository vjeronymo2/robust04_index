			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard beats forecasts with 41% surge Hewlett-Packard, the US computer and electronics group, yesterday reported a continuing strong performance for its first fiscal quarter, with a 41 per cent increase in net earnings and 24 per cent growth in revenue. The results reflect the group's advance in the computer market at the expense of some of its largest competitors, including IBM and Digital Equipment. HP's share price rose sharply on news of the results, which outstripped Wall Street expectations. Its shares closed at Dollars 89 1/8 , up from Tuesday's close of Dollars 85 1/2 . 'The year is off to a good start,' said Mr Lew Platt, chairman, president and chief executive. 'We turned strong revenue growth into better profits, largely due to focused management of operating expenses.' Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 368m, compared with Dollars 261m, while earnings a share rose to Dollars 1.42 on approximately 259m shares of common stock. This compares with Dollars 1.03 a share on about 252m shares in the first quarter of fiscal 1993. The increase in shares outstanding reflects a change in accounting for employee stock options. The change reduced earnings a share by about four cents, the company said. Net revenue for the quarter was Dollars 5.7bn, compared with Dollars 4.6bn in the first quarter of fiscal 1993. US sales were Dollars 2.6bn, an increase of 25 per cent, while revenue from outside the US rose 24 per cent to Dollars 3.1bn. The first quarter was marked by strong demand for HP's computer printers, personal computers, multi-user computers and workstations, the company said. 'Overall, we're very encouraged by the quarter's results,' said Mr Platt. 'This quarter's revenue growth far outpaced the increase in operating expenses.' Operating expenses were 28.4 per cent of revenues, compared with 32.5 per cent in the same period a year ago. 'This is a key goal in our efforts to improve profitability.' Cost of goods sold was 61.1 per cent of net revenue, down slightly from 61.4 per cent in the preceding quarter. Mr Platt said that HP would continue to maintain its emphasis on lean operating-expenses. HP has set ambitious goals to play a central role in emerging markets for 'information superhighways' including interactive television and mobile computing. It aims to blend its traditional expertise in electronic test and measurement equipment with its computer and communications technologies to create a broad range of new products.</p>

"Various official invitations from  the Israeli Government should be reviewed or rejected because  the aim of the visit is just to show good things," Aisyah Aminy,  the House's Foreign Affairs Commission chairperson, said in  response to the massacre of at least 43 Palestinians at a prayer  at Ibrahim ar-Rahman mosque in Al Khalil (Hebron).    After the signing of the Israeli-PLO peace accord in  Washington DC. in September last year, Israel has been active  in launching approaches to a number of states, including  Indonesia, to persuade them to open diplomatic ties with Israel.  The Jewish state has invited certain professional circles  including journalists, to visit Israel. A number of Indonesian  journalists visited Israel recently at the invitation of Israel.  Aminy said that Israeli invitations was an effort to break  isolation of the Jewish state with the rest of the world  communities.    She said that an invitation for journalists by Israel in the  future has to be considered seriously before accepting it. The  legislator said that recent massacre in Al Khalil is a result of  the Israeli action which -- in violation of the United Nations  resolutions 471 and 476 -- bans its citizens overseas to return  to their countries of origin but to the occupied territories.    Baruch Goldstein who did the massacre is a Jewish immigrant  who belongs to an anti-Arab organization. Among Jews resettling  in the Palestinian land are anti-Arab extremists, including  Goldstein who poured bullets on Palestinian at prayers last  Friday.    "Indonesia must condemn the brutal act, and I believe the  incident in the Ibrahim ar-Rahman Mosque will hamper the Middle  East peace process," she said.    The shooting at the mosque was possible due to the fact that  the Israeli Government allows its citizens to possess fire arms  of various calibres. "Israeli civilians must be disarmed to  prevent similar incident," The member of parliament said.</p>

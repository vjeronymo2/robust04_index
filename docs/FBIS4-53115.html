			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The 20 April Jakarta ANGKATAN BERSENJATA  in Indonesian on page 5 reported that the Philippines is  interested in purchasing excess F-5 fighter jets and ships from  South Korea as part of its efforts to modernize its military  equipment, according to Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, the  newly-appointed military chief. South Korea sold 12 patrol  boats the Philippines at a sharply-reduced price last year, and  was considering selling F-5 jets as well. This sale, however,  must be approved by the U.S., since Korea acquired the jets  through the U.S. military assistance program. Enrile pointed  out that the Philippines is relying on only two 1960-vintage F-5  jets to guard its airspace. The problem became very apparent  when U.S. forces withdrew from the country in 1992.</p>

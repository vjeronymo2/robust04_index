			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are reports saying that on 4 March, troops of  communist Vietnam's puppets and the two-headed government  launched a four-pronged attack against the people in the areas  on both side of Route 10 in Battambang Province.    The first prong moved from Kamping Puoy toward Don Peou; the  second prong from Treng toward Veal Thom and Buo Charak hill;  the third prong from Sdau toward Neang Len hill; and the fourth  prong from Snoeng toward Buon Chuo.    The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK] cooperated and smashed and routed this attack on the  evening of the same day. We killed 53 enemy soldiers on the  spot, including a colonel, two majors, and three lieutenants and  wounded a great number of others. We destroyed 35 assorted  weapons and some assorted ammunition and seized 15 AK's, three  B-40's, a 60-mm mortar, and some ammunition.    On 8 March, troops of communist Vietnam's puppets and the  two-headed government launched a two-pronged second attack along  Route 10. The first prong moved from Treng toward Tuol village  on Route 10 and the second from Kamping Puoy and Chrouy Sna  toward Kaoh Chen Don Peou. The people and the NADK cooperated  and completely routed this attack for the second time. We  killed or wounded over 80 enemy soldiers; destroyed 31 assorted  weapons and a quantiy of other war materiel; and seized 49  assorted weapons and some ammunition.    Concerning the above attacks, people clearly know that the  puppets of communist Vietnam and the two-headed government  continuee to fuel the war of the communist Vietnamese  aggressors; they do not want national reconciliation and peace.</p>

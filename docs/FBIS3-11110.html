			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim by </F> Claudia Boragni -- place and date not given]    [Text] In an interview with LA NACION, Brazilian Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim discussed the extent of the Brazilian  proposal for establishing a South American Free Trade Zone  (ALCSA). He explained that this undertaking will "not undermine  the implementation of Mercosur [Co]on Market of the South],"  although he did express his doubts about Mercosur joining NAFTA.    "I envision a favorable disposition on the part of the  Argentine Government," said Amorim. His words were reconfirmed  by Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, who said that  "although it is still premature to issue an opinion in this  regard, Argentina will not have any objections to the Brazilian  proposal because we do not want Mercosur to be a closed bloc."    [Boragni] What is the extent of ALCSA?    [Amorim] The idea is to have a full free trade zone for a  10-year period similar to GATT; that is, an area that will  encompass 80 percent of regional trade and will not be  detrimental to the participation of Mercosur member countries in  other free trade blocs. I am specifically referring to other  regional agreements such as ALADI [Latin American Integration  Association] and the Andean Pact, for example.    [Boragni] What mechanism will be used to implement this  initiative?    [Amorim] This is still being discussed by the four  signatories of the Asuncion Treaty. Brazil does not uphold a  rigid proposal, otherwise we would not have come to Buenos Aires  to discuss it with our partners. We are waiting for a  counterproposal.    [Boragni] What do you think will be the impact on  Argentine-Brazilian trade?    [Amorim] Bilateral trade will not be affected at all. On the  contrary, Brazilian-Argentine trade ties with other South  American countries will increase. What is important here is  that if ALCSA is approved, commercial trade with all countries  will increase.    [Boragni] Has the Argentine economic team been consulted on  the issue?    [Amorim] Yes, and I saw a very favorable disposition. I see  no doubts about the agreement's objective.    [Boragni] Is this Brazilian proposal a no to NAFTA and  Mercosur?    [Amorim] Quite the contrary. Mercosur continues to be our  top priority, including that pertaining to free trade and the  definition of a common customs tariff (AEC).    At any rate I must stress that for Brazil, the Mercosur  proposal cannot be excluded.    [Boragni] What is Brazil's position regarding Mercosur  joining NAFTA?    [Amorim] I believe this is something that does not depend on  us. The United States will surely indicate with whom it wishes  to negotiate. If Brazil is accepted, we will be willing to join  NAFTA. And if Argentina is invited to negotiate, we will have to  see how to make it compatible with our commitments with Mercosur.    I believe it is not technically easy to join NAFTA but it  surely is possible.    [Boragni] Brazil has just launched an economic plan. Does  your government foresee a greater economic recovery?    [Amorim] The big problem affecting the Brazilian economy is  inflation. In spite of it, however, in 1993, Brazil experienced  an economic growth ranging between 5 and 6 percent. The  automobile industry achieved a record production. But the main  objective of Finance Minister Cardoso's economic plan is to  achieve economic growth under stable conditions. I believe that  both the business sector and the people have had a very positive  reaction.</p>

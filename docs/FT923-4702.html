			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / China tells US to reverse sale of fighters to Taiwan CHINA lodged one of the strongest protests heard from Beijing in a long time yesterday in angry response to the decision by President George Bush to permit the sale of US warplanes to Taiwan for the first time in 10 years. China accused Washington of being untrustworthy and of violating the Sino-US joint communique of August 1982, expressing itself 'shocked and outraged'. The protest threatened China's withdrawal from arms control talks between the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council if the decision to supply Taiwan with 150 F-16 fighters was not reversed. Warning of 'a major retrogression' in Sino-US relations, it said this would have a negative impact on bilateral co-operation in the UN and other international organisations. Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, said 'the US government should be held accountable for any serious consequences'. At a press conference in Jakarta, where he is leading a Chinese delegation to the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, he added: 'On the one hand, the US government is arguing for arms control, but on the other hand it is selling such sophisticated fighters.' Mr J. Stapleton Roy, the US ambassador to China, was summoned to the foreign ministry in Beijing to be told by Liu Huaqiu, vice-foreign minister, that the decision was a gross interference in China's internal affairs. The 1982 communique, one of three agreements forming the basis of Sino-US relations, expresses US intent to 'reduce gradually sale of arms to Taiwan, leading over a period of time to a final resolution'. Mr Bush helped negotiate the understand - ing with China a decade ago. Proponents of the F-16 sale argue that the US has the right to provide Taiwan with the arms that it needs for its defence. The sale of US fighter aircraft to Taiwan was blocked during the cold war. Washington needed China's help as a counterweight to the military strength of the old Soviet Union. The role of China in this formerly critical balance has vanished. China has been strengthening its own military capability, buying Russian Su-27 fighters and acquiring the right to manufacture the Russian MiG-15. Taiwan has been unable to upgrade its airforce in the same manner. China's rebuke to the US is likely to add to its unpopularity in Congress where its human rights record is under criticism and its most favoured nation trade status under debate.

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Sport: Seven strokes of a master - Golf IT IS A truism that a golf tournament never begins until the last nine holes on Sunday afternoon, when the nerves begin to jangle and the palms to sweat and the stern but obvious taskmaster called pressure begins to exert its influence. It is even more true at Augusta National golf club, the site of the US Masters, where the difficulties of each hole are magnified by the weight of the history that has taken place there. The tenth at Augusta; was that not where Ben Crenshaw sank a 60ft putt in 1984? And the 11th, 12th and 13th holes; are they known as Amen Corner because they have ended so many contender's chances? Did Ed Sneed not once stand on the 16th tee, his 69th hole, with a three-stroke lead and think to himself: 'it is impossible not to win,' which he then did not. The inward nine holes at Augusta bear names such as Camellia (tenth) White Dogwood (11th), Firethorn (15th). They are anything but serene and pastoral. To play them is an exercise in damage limitation and the man who wins the green jacket tomorrow will have had his nerve examined on every one of the 35 or so strokes it will take him to cover its two miles. Here are seven key shots on these holes that must be mastered before a man can become a Master. The second shot at the par four tenth. At 485 yards it is the longest par four on the course. The hole falls by 100ft from tee to green. The tee shot should bound down the hill and roll to the left from where a mid iron is sufficient. If it does not, then the second shot is played from high on the right side of the fairway from a downhill lie to a green that slopes away. It is far more difficult. Tradition says the second shot must find the green. Nick Faldo missed the green in the play-offs in 1989 and 1990, both times ending in the bunker to the right of the green and still won. The second shot at the 455-yard 11th. Ben Hogan once said: 'any time you see me on this green in two you will know I mishit my second shot.' He felt it was safer to hit to the right of the green, which is protected by water, and then chip and one-putt. Larry Mize would agree. He chipped in from 50 yards in the play-off against Greg Norman in 1987 and became champion. Faldo says the only way is to attack the green. 'You have to forget about the water, trust your swing and hit your shot.' This is what Ray Floyd did not do in 1990 against Faldo. He mishit an eight iron and the ball plunged into the water. Tee shot at the 155-yard 12th. Tom Weiskopf took five attempts to reach the shallow, tilted green and recorded a 13 on the hole Jack Nicklaus calls 'the hardest in championship golf.' On the other hand, Fred Couples had a stroke of luck here last year. His tee shot rolled back down the bank and stopped on a collar of rough 1ft from the water. He got his par and two hours later won his green jacket. Tee shot at the 465-yard 13th. One of the most strategic holes in golf, (and one of the shortest par fives in championship golf) requires a drive to be shaped from right to left to get it around the corner of the doglegged hole. Overdo the shaping and the ball will run into a creek or clatter among trees. Second shot at the same hole. This shot must clear Rae's Creek which crosses the fairway and skirts the right side of the green. Curtis Strange got it spectacularly wrong in 1985. He hit a four wood that landed in Rae's Creek when he was leading by three strokes. Second shot to the 15th (Fire Thorn). Likely to be anything from 175 to 230 yards in length, it must carry a pond. Gene Sarazen hit his second shot in to the hole using a four-wood in 1935. Last year Couples needed only a seven-iron for his second shot in the fourth round. Tee shot to the 170-yard 16th. Almost all over water to a wickedly sloping green. It is essential to hit the putting surface, preferably hit it as close as Nicklaus did in 1986 when he nearly holed in one. In 1989 Ballesteros could have won. His tee shot here flew at the flag but fell 1ft short of the green and rolled back into the water. Succeed with all these strokes and you have a chance of winning the US Masters. But it is not over yet. One crucial stroke remains. The tee shot at the 18th. 'You look down this narrow chute, trees on both sides and not a sound in the air and I can tell you it's a terrifying sight' said Sandy Lyle. You must hit the fairway which runs uphill and curves to the right otherwise there is little chance of reaching the green, even though at just over 400 yards (all uphill) the hole is quite short. Lyle hit his tee shot into the first of two bunkers on the left of the fairway and then played a miraculous seven iron to 10ft past the hole and sank the putt for a birdie to win in 1988. But every one else loses one stroke - at least. Jose Maria Olazabal did so from the Lyle bunker in 1991 and Tom Watson, who had driven in to the trees on the right, lost two. That year Ian Woosnam kept his ball in play from the tee and won the title. Play these strokes successfully and you might win the US Masters. If you fail to do so and you have no chance. You do not have to believe me. Just watch it all unfold on television tomorrow evening.</p>

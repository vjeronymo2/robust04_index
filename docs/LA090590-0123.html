			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN DURSLAG: TEACHING HOW DEALS ARE DONE  </P> <P> Those who administer college football are depressed. They aren't able to  understand the money madness seizing the children who play the game.  </P> <P> With eligibility left, the kids are going over the wall to join the pros. What  has happened to the student-athlete? You ask one:  </P> <P> "Are you interested in engineering?"  </P> <P> "Indeed I am. I am dying to study the power plant of a Ferrari -- my Ferrari."  </P> <P> It is regrettable that undergraduates in football don't have the healthy  outlook of their university elders, who see the game as simple beauty, free  from commercial pressure and general money-grubbing.  </P> <P> For instance, colleges today play no more than 12 games. They are playing bowl  games before the season even starts -- things called the Kickoff Classic and  Disneyland Pigskin Classic.  </P> <P> A college distinguished for its football has set up a private television deal  with NBC. Lesser arrangements by universities result in as many as 11 games  being seen on TV on a single Saturday.  </P> <P> Why can't the players comport themselves like those who run college football,  detached from earthly goods, dedicated to the spirit of friendly rivalry that  sportsmen seek?  </P> <P> New Year's Day, you will see that the number of bowl games on television has  been limited to eight.  </P> <P> "You will note the restraint," university people will tell players thinking of  jumping to the pros. "We easily could play 10 on New Year's, scheduling two  games between midnight and 6 in the morning."  </P> <P> Originally, college football favored us with four bowls on Jan. 1 -- Rose,  Orange, Cotton and Sugar.  </P> <P> It expanded to five with something known as the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl. Then,  presumably on a leveraged buyout, the Florida Citrus Bowl took over the  Tangerine Bowl and soon bumped New Year's Day viewing to six games.  </P> <P> The Hall of Fame Bowl increased it to seven, the figure now escalating to eight  with a switching of dates of the Mazda Gator Bowl.  </P> <P> Eight bowl games battling each other on the same day might appear as overkill,  but what's a little cannibalization among educated people?  </P> <P> Meantime, the Cotton Bowl has come to be called the Mobil Cotton Bowl and the  Sugar Bowl the USF&amp;G Sugar Bowl. The Sun Bowl became the John Hancock Sun  Bowl, until such time as the sponsor decided such billing was a deterrent to  direct communication.  </P> <P> The name was changed to John Hancock Bowl.  </P> <P> And the universities, observing events, go along, because they are not as  commercially oriented as today's players.  </P> <P> Over in Tucson, they got a postseason game certified known as the Copper Bowl.  Linking up with a firm that makes mouth freshener, the game became known as the  Copper BreathLess Bowl, but that would change to Copper Bowl, presented by  BreathLess.  </P> <P> Last heard from, the game was still breathing, but without its mouth-freshening  sponsor.  </P> <P> Mind you, this is watched unblinkingly by the colleges, role models for those  student-athletes who would dump their schools for a lousy $80,000 a year from  the pros.  </P> <P> Since only one bowl game, the Rose, has fixed participants every year, the  others must hoof it, entering into bloodlettings to beat out rivals for the  best teams.  </P> <P> Rules prevent bowls from contacting teams before specified dates, and, of  course, no school would fudge, accepting bids prematurely, because this would  set a bum example for the players.  </P> <P> Watching a school that lacks integrity, a player with eligibility might be  tempted to talk to a pro team in the alley about the draft.  </P> <P> Now, say, you play for Clemson where home sellouts are automatic. Why open with  Miami when you can play Cal State Long Beach?  </P> <P> Same financial result.  </P> <P> So you wipe out Long Beach, 59-0, enhance the winning record and prepare three  weeks down the line to entertain Appalachian State. Picturing George Allen,  Long Beach coach, on the sideline last Saturday, you heard him mumble: "The  future is 20 years ago."  </P> <P> But Clemson establishes standards any admiring kid will want to emulate as he  strolls the boulevard of life.  </P></p>

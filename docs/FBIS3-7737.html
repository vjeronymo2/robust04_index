			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The government aircraft carrying Slovak Prime  Minister Vladimir Meciar and his entourage made two stopovers on  the way back from China so that our leaders could have more  political talks.    During the stopover at the airport in Karachi in southern  Pakistan, Vladimir Meciar was received by a minister authorized  by Prime Minister Bhutto, who was on a foreign trip at the time.  Apart from political and economic issues, they discussed  cooperation in tourism. In this respect, the Pakistani side was  interested in the conditions for foreign capital entry into our  market. A government delegation and a group of businessmen will  come to Slovakia and examine the potential and forms of possible  capital investments in our country.    The government aircraft landed in Ankara after a four-hour  flight from Karachi. Vladimir Meciar met Turkish Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin there. Their conversation, which lasted  approximately 30 minutes, focused, apart from political issues,  on the problems of forming a Slovak-Turkish intergovernmental  commission for economic cooperation. One of the other topics  they discussed was a joint armaments program and the drafting of  a plan on cooperation in the sphere of building oil and gas  pipelines. The two sides also agreed that it was necessary to  prepare a new cultural agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

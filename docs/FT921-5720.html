			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Arts: Today's Television The series-within-a-series, 'J'accuse' in the C4 arts slot Without Walls (9.00) is one of television's most valuable innovations for years. For too long television's arts budgets have concentrated almost exclusively on panegyrics and hagiography. In 'J'accuse' somebody gets the opportunity to challenge the consensus on one of our cultural gods. Today Russell Davies tackles the inflated reputation of Laurence Olivier. In words that bring to mind the famous radio series presented by Edgar Lustgarten, today's incident in ITV's Murder Squad (9.00) is described as 'one of the strangest cases in the history of the Metropolitan Police'. It began with the disappearance of a seven year old boy who should have been collected by his guardian after school in December 1989. Tony Slattery is developing a splendid hate figure in Terence Frisby's superior comedy That's Love: a marriage guidance counsellor who is busy seducing the wife in the couple he is supposed to be counselling (9.30 ITV). 40 Minutes reports on 'knackers' night' in a Tyneside pub when the regulars laugh at the acts put on by the mentally and physically disabled ..who enjoy it (9.50 BBC2).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "Front Against Front"] </F>   [Text] In the fifties, some people in Iraq and other Arab  states held the view that it was better to avoid provoking  imperialism through demonstrations and other acts of protest.  Those who held this view were mainly liberals who advocated  compromise solutions with the ruling regimes which were linked  in one way or another with imperialist forces. The liberals  claimed that the more the people intensified their resistance to  imperialist agents and imperialism itself, the more the agents  and their overlords increased their oppression of the people and  prolonged foreign domination of Iraq and other Arab states.  Despite their call for peaceful action represented by  addressing nicely written petitions to the monarchy on some  public demand and dispatching delegations to key government  officials, or to the British Embassy in Baghdad, for instance,  concerning some issue of public interest, such as calling for an  end to British influence in and domination of Iraq, our liberal  friends were not spared persecution, arrest, imprisonment, and  even exile by those royal governments.    Many of those liberal ideas found their way into political  action of a different kind in Egypt under the late President  Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. Before the June War, the Egyptian  leadership was advised not to provoke the Zionist entity and to  use diplomacy in resolving the Arab-Zionist conflict. Strangely  enough, the Soviet Union itself was one of those who offered  such advice. Following the Arab defeat in that war, many  people, both friends and foes, began saying: We advised  'Abd-al-Nasir, but he did not listen to our advice, hence the  defeat. Actually, 'Abd-al-Nasir listened to Soviet and French  advice. It was the Zionist entity which did not care and was  not ready to hear anything other than the voice of racism,  aggression, occupation, and the overthrow of 'Abd-al-Nasir's  regime.    It is understood that the Soviets also advised Iraq not to  provoke the United States and the West by nationalizing oil.  The nationalization decision which was drafted by struggler  Saddam Husayn was the strongest and most important of all. The  Soviets repeated their stand in the period before and after the  Nazi military aggression on Iraq. This time, however, it was  charged with ill-intention and evil. It came under Gorbachev,  not under Podgorny in 1967 or Brezhnev during the  nationalization days in 1972.    The position taken by the public throughout those years to  this day, especially in Iraq, is to reject the ridiculous idea  about not provoking the enemies and opponents, as the liberal  circles should have described them. Enemies are essentially  provokers against the people, the homeland, independence, and  national sovereignty of Iraq or any other country which upholds  similar principles. Were it not for the belief in these  principles and their efficacy, their revolutions would not have  succeeded and victories would not have been achieved in this  country or any other country. The experiences of Egypt under  al-Sadat and Mubarak, the experiences of other Arab states, and  the experiences of 'Arafat with "Israel" all indicate the  disastrous course followed by all those Arab sides, which  finally led them to surrender to the imperialist and Zionist  forces.    The escalation of Iraqi action on the political and media  levels against the United States, the West, and the Arab forces  which are allied to the imperialists is not only consistent with  great Iraq's spirit of challenge against all those quarters as  embodied in the glorious word "no", which leader Saddam Husayn  has uttered and with which he expressed the steadfastness of the  people and the homeland against the blockade, but also  harmonious with the principles of the great 17-30 July  Revolution and the principles of Saddam Husayn, the engineer of  the revolution and its leader to the end.    Our dispute with the different enemies is a deep one. The  solution of this dispute is only possible on the basis of those  enemies recognizing Iraq's right to freedom, independence, and  progress, not on any other basis as the aggressors and their  collaborators want and imagine. Perhaps, the enemies'  insistence on harming Iraq despite its implementation of the  so-called "UN resolutions" is proof that the hostile stand  against our country has not changed. This calls for a similar  stand at all times. They did not lay down their political,  military, and economic weapons against us, and therefore we must  continue to use the weapon of information and steadfastness  against the aggressors from now and until they are forced to  change their stand against us.</p>

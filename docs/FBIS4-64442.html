			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ignacio Cembrero report: "Prime Minister Cancels Official </F> Visit for Domestic Reasons for First Time"]    [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday  canceled the official visit that he had planed to pay to Romania  and Bulgaria starting tomorrow. This is the first time since  acceding to the prime ministership in 1982 that Gonzalez has  canceled an officially announced visit for domestic political  reasons. In mid-morning a communique from the general  secretariat of the government spokesman's office announced the  indefinite postponement of the visit to the aforementioned  countries.    The announcement of the cancellation came 40 hours before  the  departure time and when some members of the official retinue --  mainly bodyguards -- and several journalists from Madrid were  already in Bucharest.    Foreign Ministry officials believe that the deterioration in  the domestic political situation poses a threat to the prime  minister's entire program of international activity in May and  June, which is a very busy one.    Gonzalez's next official visit, starting 15 May, is to  Paraguay, the only Latin American country which he has not  visited. "Let us hope," one diplomat joked yesterday, "that  Mariano Rubio does not disappear two days beforehand --  following Luis Roldan's example -- and set back this visit too."    In diplomatic circles it is also considered a virtual  certainty that Gonzalez's summit meeting with Helmut Kohl --  scheduled for 6-7 June in the former East Germany, five days  before the European elections -- will also be canceled.    The same circles also fear that the Conference of Latin  American Nations in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June  will be neglected in the Spanish press. Gonzalez plans to  arrive there the day after the European election, and his  interpretation of the results will relegate the meeting to the  background.    Apart from Cartagena, another appointment that the prime  minister cannot avoid is the European summit in Corfu, Greece,  on 23-24 June, which will appoint the next president of the  European Commission.    Gonzalez had so organized matters as to leave most of his  international activity until after the PSOE [Spanish Socialist  Workers Party] congress in March. The following week he  received President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and in  April he received Russian chief of state Boris Yeltsin and UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.    Immediately after the Rubio scandal exploded Gonzalez's  joint  press conference with Yeltsin 12 April was the shortest that  people could remember in the hall of the government spokesman's  general secretariat. The Spanish prime minister made sure to  take questions from journalists that he knew and that would only  ask him about matters relating to foreign policy. There were no  questions about the Rubio affair.</p>

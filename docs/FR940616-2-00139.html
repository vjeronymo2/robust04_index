			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Budget <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The organization must submit a comprehensive line item budget. Costs for US and NIS students are to be listed separately. Details are available in the application packet. Grants awarded to eligible organizations with less than four years of experience in conducting international exchange programs will be limited to $60,000. Organizations should be familiar with grant regulations described in OMB circulars A110, A122, and A133. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cost sharing is encouraged. Cost sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The grant recipient must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation, as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A110, Attachment E_Cost Sharing and Matching should be described in the proposal. In the event the recipient does not provide the minimum amount of cost sharing as stipulated will be reduced in proportion to the recipient's contribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility. Proposals will be deemed ineligible if they do not fully adhere to the guidelines established herein and in the application packet. Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. All eligible proposals will also be reviewed by the appropriate geographical office of the U.S. Information Agency, and the Agency's budget and contract offices. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Agency's Office of the General Counsel. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director of Education and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with the Agency's Office of Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Review Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Technically eligible applications will be competitively reviewed according to the following criteria: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Quality of the Program Idea <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should exhibit originality, substance, rigor, and adherence to the criteria and conditions described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Reasonable, Feasible, and Flexible Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the institution will meet the program's objectives and plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Multiplier Effect/Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed programs should strengthen long-term mutual understanding, to include maximum sharing of information and establishment of long-term institutional and individual linkages. A program is also considered to have a strong ``multiplier effect'' if it affects a significant number of persons in addition to the actual program participants. For example, a group of high school students may have extensive interaction with community groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Value to U.S._Partner Country Relations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Assessments by USIA's geographic area desk, and USIS officers overseas of the need, potential, impact, and significance in the partner country(ies), as demonstrated by a sustainable partnership with an organization in the former Soviet Union. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Cost Effectiveness <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overhead and administrative components of grants, as well as salaries and honoraria, should be kept as low as possible. All other items should be necessary and appropriate. Proposals should to the extent possible maximize cost-sharing through other private sector support as well as institutional direct funding contributions. Other things being equal, a proposal with a low cost per participant and/or a low cost per participant program day will have a competitive advantage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Institutional Capacity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed personnel and institutional resources of both the U.S. applicant and the NIS partner organization should be adequate and appropriate to achieve the program or project's goals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Proposals Should Demonstrate Potential for Program Excellence and/or Track Record of Applicant Institution <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency will consider the past performance of prior grantees and the demonstrated potential of new applicants. A documented record of successful exchange programs, whether USIA financed or not, is one way in which an applicant may demonstrate strength in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Follow-On Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the stated objective of a sustainable partnership with an organization in the former Soviet Union, proposals should provide a plan for continued follow-on activity which ensures that USIA supported programs are not isolated events. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Evaluation Plan <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposals should provide a thoughtful and comprehensive description of how the project will be evaluated in terms of meeting the objectives listed above and how such an evaluation would present quantitative data on participants, contacts, interactions, activities, achievements, etc., as well as qualitative appraisals of successes and shortcomings and suggestions for program improvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Selection Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All participants must be between the ages of 14 and 17 at the time they begin the program. In all cases, selection should be merit-based. Selection criteria should include actual or potential leadership qualities, and may also include some or all of the following: Maturity, academic achievement, interest in the program, motivation, recommendations of teachers, and language ability, although no participant should be chosen solely on the basis of his or her language ability. As far as possible, participants should reflect the diversity of the communities from which they come. Ability to pay should not be a determining factor for either American or foreign participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Geographic Diversity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent possible, the Agency will seek to fund programs from different geographic areas within the former Soviet Union and within the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Participant Diversity <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Programs should strive for a diversity of participants and include members of underrepresented groups; e.g., racial and ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The terms and conditions published in this RFP are binding and may not be modified by any USIA representative. Explanatory information provided by the Agency that contradicts published language will not be binding. Issuance of the RFP does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government. A final award cannot be made until funds have been fully appropriated by Congress, allocated, and committed through internal USIA procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All applicants will be notified of the results of the review process on or about March 1, 1995. Awarded grants will be subject to periodic reporting and evaluation requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 8, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John P.

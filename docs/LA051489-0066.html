			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON PARK TO VOTE ON TAX FOR MORE POLICE, OTHER SERVICES  </P> <P> The City Council is scheduled to decide Monday night whether to impose a  utility tax on residents and businesses to generate $2.74 million for increased  police protection and other services.  </P> <P> The council will hold a special public hearing before it votes on the proposed  tax, which would impose on residents and business owners an assessment equal to  7% of their telephone, electricity, gas and water bills. The tax would take  effect July 1, the beginning of the new fiscal year.  </P> <P> Mayor William P. Cunningham said last week that he strongly supports the  utility tax to pay for about 15 additional police officers and other services.  The City Council would decide how to spend the money during deliberations on  the 1989-90 budget this summer.  </P> <P> "There's more crime in Huntington Park like there's more crime everywhere,"  Cunningham said. "And there're more people also. It's impacted all services."  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously last week to introduce the ordinance, setting up  the final vote Monday night. There has been little public opposition so far.  The city sent out notices of the special hearing last week.  </P> <P> "It's not the easiest thing to do politically, but I really think we have to do  it," Cunningham said.  </P> <P> City Administrative Officer Donald L. Jeffers recently presented a proposed  budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year to the City Council that was austere but  balanced. The spending plan anticipated more than $200,000 in cuts for tree  trimming and other city maintenance. It also reduced the budget for items such  as Christmas decorations for Pacific Boulevard and a subsidy for the Huntington  Park Symphony Assn., Jeffers said. It also includes no raises for city  employees. Huntington Park employees received a 4.2% raise for this fiscal  year, which costs the city about $300,000 annually, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> Jeffers said the city is feeling the full effects of Proposition 13 now that  state and federal subsidies have been reduced or eliminated. Revenues flowing  into the city's general fund, which pays for most city services such as law  enforcement and fire protection, have not increased.  </P> <P> The city received about $9.8 million in general-fund revenues in the 1987-88  fiscal year, for example, while revenue for the current year is projected to be  several hundred-thousand dollars lower. Without the utility tax, revenues are  projected to rise during the 1989-90 fiscal year to about the 1987-88 level,  according to the preliminary budget.  </P> <P> The Huntington Park Redevelopment Agency also has contributed to the city's  financial woes, city officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income Not Generated  </P> <P> The agency's financial difficulties began in 1984, when several developers  operating in a climate of high interest rates began defaulting or backing out  of projects, city officials said at the time. Substitute developers were  eventually found, but the projects failed to generate the property tax income  that the Redevelopment Agency had counted on to meet its $4.4-million annual  debt payments.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency has relied on the city to help make the bond payments.  Sales tax revenue, which would otherwise go into the city's general fund, has  been loaned to the agency over the past several years.  </P> <P> The city loaned the Redevelopment Agency about $1.5 million during the 1987-88  fiscal year. That amount is expected to be reduced to about $800,000 this year,  and to about $500,000 during the coming fiscal year as more projects are  completed and generate tax revenue for the agency, Jeffers said.  </P> <P> City officials said the loans were responsible for a cash-flow crisis in 1987  that forced the City Council to eliminate 13 positions and make other spending  cuts.  </P> <P> The Police Department suffered the brunt of the cutbacks, losing the positions  of three officers, and five clerical and support positions. The department is  authorized to have 59 sworn officers, but two officers are injured and two  positions are vacant, said Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly.  </P> <P> The preliminary budget includes money to restore one of the lost positions,  Connolly said. But the chief says he needs at least two more sergeants, and 13  more officers to meet the law enforcement demands in Huntington Park, a city of  about 52,000 people. The department also needs three more jailers, two  dispatchers and two clerks, Connolly said.  </P> <P> About $1 million of the revenue generated by the utility users tax has been  tentatively earmarked to pay for those 22 Police Department positions, Jeffers  said.  </P> <P> The chief based his assessment on crime statistics that show a 21% increase in  reported serious crimes from 1983 (3,573 arrests) to 1988 (4,334 arrests).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Study at UC Berkeley  </P> <P> In addition, the city's ratio of officers to residents is lower than the state  average, according to a recent study by the Institute of Transportation Studies  at the University of California at Berkeley.  </P> <P> With a population of about 52,000, Huntington Park has 1.13 officers per 1,000  residents. The average city police department in the state has a 1.51 officers  per 1,000 residents, the report said. The 1980 U.S. Census counted 46,223  residents in Huntington Park.  </P> <P> Because of that, Councilman Jim Roberts said the need for the tax "is almost  critical."  </P> <P> "I would say without additional police, we're going to lose our streets and we  have no funds to buy additional police," Roberts said.  </P> <P> Other money from the tax has been tentatively earmarked for tree trimming and  other maintenance ($284,100), and for the city's self-insurance and vehicle  maintenance funds ($500,000), Jeffers said. Officials also have proposed  restoring a $13,000 grant for the symphony association and about $19,000 for  Christmas decorations along Pacific Boulevard.  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance to impose the tax would allow the council to exempt some  parties, if it so decides. But no such exemptions are planned, Cunningham and  Roberts said.  </P> <P> The hearing will be at 7:30 p.m. in the council chambers at Huntington Park  City Hall, 6550 Miles Ave.  </P></p>

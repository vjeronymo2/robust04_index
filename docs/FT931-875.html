			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fenner warns of attributable loss SHARES IN Fenner fell sharply from 87p to 65p yesterday, after the Hull-based engineering group warned it would make an attributable loss for the six months to February 28. The group expects to break-even at the pre-tax level after charging exceptional items due to professional charges related to aborted merger talks held four months ago, and to further redundancy costs. In spite of profit from disposals, a substantial charge for tax on overseas earnings and minorities will result in an overall loss, the group warned. On present trends, prospects for the full year are unlikely to produce a profit for ordinary shareholders, the group said. Despite cost cutting measures on the UK manufacturing side, trading has continued to deteriorate in the distribution networks, particularly in continental Europe where the group suffered a 20 per cent fall in demand during the last three months. The current uncertainty over the proposed UK pit closure programme also had an adverse impact, said the group, which last year made less than 7 per cent of its sales to British Coal.</p>

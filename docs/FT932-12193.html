			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Plateau gets holders' assurance PLATEAU MINING, a natural resources group which is now a shell, has been assured by shareholders owning more than 47 per cent of the company that they do not intend to accept the Pounds 1.2m hostile bid from Kingstream Resources, a small Australian exploration company. Mr Donald Driver, chairman of Plateau, said: 'It is most unusual for shareholders to come out against a bid at such an early stage. Major shareholders have made their view clear about the Kingstream offer and other shareholders will no doubt take the same view. Accordingly, Kingstream should now give up gracefully and save everybody further costs.' Kingstream launched its bid on April 13. Its offer of one share for every eight Plateau values the latter at 2.62p, compared with the recent suspension price of 3p. Kingstream is reconsidering the terms after Plateau this week announced the sale of a royalty interest to Delta Gold, an Australian group, for shares worth more than Pounds 1.5m. Guinness Mahon, adviser to Plateau, said the shell company had more than Pounds 1m of net cash, as well as the Delta holding.</p>

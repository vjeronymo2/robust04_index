			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: INTO THE GROOVES:  </P> <P> If you've been keeping track, you've probably noticed that A&amp;M president  Gil Friesen isn't the only key exec who has abruptly left the troubled label in  recent weeks. So far our scorecard includes Jeff Gold (who's joined Warner  Bros. as senior vice president of creative services), David Steffen, the  label's sales and distribution chief, and Jesus Garber, the chief of its black  promotion department, who have departed without announcing any official plans.  While the dust settles, A&amp;M is being run by Jerry Moss, who sold the label  to PolyGram Records last year but remains a powerful force, especially with  PolyGram battling its own leadership-vacuum dilemmas. With the exception of its  current Janet Jackson smash (which has topped the 4-million mark in sales),  hits at the label have been few and far between. Which brings us to the next  big question: Will Charlie Minor, A&amp;M's colorful promotion mogul, be the  next to depart?  </P> <P> Officially, nobody at A&amp;M is talking. Industry insiders say Minor might  stay, but probably only if he gets offered presidency stripes. If not, he could  take one of several job possibilities -- it's been widely reported that Minor  has been talking to Irving Azoff about joining his new record label, though  Azoff has insisted there are still several candidates for the job. Meanwhile,  it's likely that A&amp;M won't be looking outside the label to replace the  departed execs. "They'll have fewer chiefs," says one industry observer. "But  PolyGram will give Moss autonomy, as long as he can get the label going again."  That should be a challenge. A&amp;M has broken Seduction, a young female  dance-music act, but its upcoming pop releases focus on adventuresome (but  low-selling) critic faves like Suzanne Vega, John Hiatt and the Neville  Brothers. The label's biggest commercial hope is a fall album from Bryan Adams,  who had several huge mid-'80s hits, but needs to rebound from a disappointing  last album.  </P></p>

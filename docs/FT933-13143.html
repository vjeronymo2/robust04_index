			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / London looses more than a quarter of small businesses LONDON HAS lost more than a quarter of its small businesses since 1990, the London Enterprise Agency and the Labour-dominated Association of London Authorities say in a survey published today, Charles Batchelor writes. They report that the number of businesses with annual sales of less than Pounds 100,000 fell from 126,600 to 93,500 between 1990 and 1992. About 15,000 jobs were lost from inner London and 18,000 from the suburbs. The decline of small businesses was greater than that of businesses as a whole. The total number of businesses fell 12 per cent from 243,000 to 213,500. However, the number of businesses with turnover of Pounds 1m or more rose 5 per cent to 26,000. The agency and the association were concerned that the disproportionate fall in the number of small businesses could have serious implications for future job creation. During the last period of economic growth up to 1989 businesses employing fewer than 10 people generated more than half of all new jobs in inner London. They were particularly concerned at the loss of small businesses in sectors such as distribution, catering, banking, finance and services which account for nearly half the capital's jobs.</p>

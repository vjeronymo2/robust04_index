			<p>BFN     [Text] President leader Saddam Husayn, may God protect  him, has chaired a meeting for a number of ministers and experts  in trade and industrial affairs.    The conferees discussed several economic and trade issues,  including the issuance of legislation punishing those who sell  foreign currency outside the officially-licensed offices. These  traders are regarded as thieves liable to the stipulations of  Decree No. 59 issued by the Revolution Command Council on 4 June  1994. Also liable to punishment are farmers who deliberately  fail to deliver grains to the marketing centers. This includes  merchants who stockpile items listed in the ration cards with  the aim of monopoly and tampering with prices in a departure  from the fixed price. This also includes the profit margin,  which should be reconsidered in order to encourage merchants to  trade in these items, and to put prices within a reasonable  framework for the citizen who purchases them in addition to his  share provided by the state through the ration card. The  conferees agreed that the profit margin for wholesalers and  retail merchants be declared regarding these items.    During the meeting, specific ideas were raised to give the  state a positive role in stabilizing the Iraqi dinar's exchange  rate against the dollar, and not accepting the common idea that  the state's selling and purchasing ability is dependent upon the  exchange rates of the dollar and dinar, which vary according to  speculators and profiteers in the black market, who tamper with  their exchange rates.    The conferees agreed on the importance of pursuing violators  after announcing the set restrictions based on the new  legislations. They also agreed on implementing these  legislations with due firmness because the blockade is a form of  war, and will remain so until it ends in decisive victory, God  willing, through the resolve of the dedicated Iraqis and the  glorious Iraqi women after having relied on Almighty God.    The conferees also agreed on the importance of deepening the  discussions and highlighting what is agreed in a later expanded  meeting in order to entrench it in the form of laws and specific  regulations, so each concerned party precisely knows the limits  of its rights and duties, and so all will work with  determination to bring Iraq to safe shores, God willing, where  the homeland will be cherished, lofty, and in good shape at a  time when Iraq's people and victorious march, as well as all the  good people, will enjoy inevitable pride which God will choose  for them and which God will turn into a decisive victory and a  steadfastness with an early end that promises both good and  prosperity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati, who is currently visiting  Germany on an official invitation from his German counterpart,  met German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and conveyed a message from  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    Among the issues discussed during the meeting were the  situation in Europe; developments in the European Union [EU] in  view of the fact that Germany will assume the presidency soon;  ways of expanding relations between the Islamic Republic of Iran  and the European Union [EU]; multilateral cooperation with  Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Economic Cooperation  Organization [ECO].    In addition, the head of the Foreign Policy Committee of the  German parliament and the spokesman for the Social Democratic  Party [SPD], the opposition, as well as the spokesman of the  ruling Christian Democrat party met with Dr. Velayati. In the  course of these talks, the stances of the two countries on  regional and international issues, especially those pertaining  to Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq, and developments in the Middle  East were elaborated on.    Ever since the victory of the Islamic revolution--except for  the first few years when the SPD under the leadership of Helmut  Schmidt was in power--relations between the two countries have  not been able to strengthen under the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU] led by Helmut Kohl. [sentence as heard] In the period  that this party has been at the helm, it has achieved some  victories, such as German unification. In view of the recent  successes of the CDU in the presidential elections and with its  gaining the necessary votes in the European parliament, the  continued rule of this party seems likely in the future.    In this period, the relations between Tehran and Bonn have  been one of the most stable with any European country. Every  year has witnessed an increase in the number of economic and  financial exchanges between the two countries. Germany is  Iran's foremost trading partner and heads the list of importers  of Iranian commodities. The largest volume of Iran's non-oil  exports is sent to Germany, which collaborates with Iran in  numerous infrastructural and industrial projects.</p>

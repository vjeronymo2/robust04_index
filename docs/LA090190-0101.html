			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : DANA DEPUTY GRAY TO RUN AGAINST GALANTER  </P> <P> In a prelude to a showdown next spring, Mary Lee Gray, senior deputy to Los  Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana, announced Friday in Playa del Rey that  she is running against Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter.  </P> <P> At a news conference on the Ballona Creek bicycle trail, Gray accused Galanter  of "a lack of leadership" in failing to solve the council district's critical  problems, including crime, traffic, overdevelopment, gang violence, air  pollution and airport noise.  </P> <P> "Herunresponsiveness to community problems has greatly concerned me," Gray  said.  </P> <P> The early announcement and decision to formally establish a campaign committee  next week will allow Gray to start raising money for what could become an  expensive and partisan race against the first-term councilwoman.  </P> <P> In response, Galanter said she will defend her record during the campaign,  which ends next April. "I intend to win reelection by doing my job and doing it  well," she said in an interview.  </P> <P> Galanter served notice that her new opponent's association with Dana will  likely become an issue in the heavily Democratic district, which includes  Venice, Playa Del Rey, Westchester, Mar Vista and the Crenshaw District.  </P> <P> Gray insisted she is running an independent campaign and warned against "guilt  by association" and negative campaigning in the contest.

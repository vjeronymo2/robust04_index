			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S REPORT ON MALATHION  </P> <P> In response to "State Panel Says Malathion No Serious Health Threat," Part A,  Aug. 16:  </P> <P> So the state Department of Health Services issued its pro-malathion  "health-risk assessment" report. There were no surprises, since we had  previously been told what the report was to conclude.  </P> <P> My wife was made so ill from the sprayings (verified by five-figures in medical  costs and her doctor's opinion) that she has fled our home of 15 years and  resided in a hotel outside the spraying areas for four months. Don't tell us  about the health risks of malathion!  </P> <P> Does anyone see anything ironic here:  </P> <P> 1) We spray first, investigate later?  </P> <P> 2) We spray people, not fruit?  </P> <P> 3) We declare spraying is safe, but the victims cannot sue the state to let a  jury hear the evidence and decide the issue?  </P> <P> 4) Smog has to be reduced because it's unhealthy, but it is acceptable to spray  a biocide on the populace?  </P> <P> 5) We export pesticides to other countries that are illegal here and import the  fruit on which it has been used, while saving our fruit for export?  </P> <P> The spraying of malathion over populated areas is a political act perpetuated  by politicians in pursuit of agribusiness support. Unfortunately for them, the  people have issued their own "health-risk assessment," and it is against  malathion.  </P> <P> Gov. Deukmejian's decision not to run for reelection has rendered him  impervious to the will of the people and he is able to impose the spraying.  However, those who have been harmed by it will long remember the politicians,  bureaucrats and physicians who conspired to injure them.  </P> <P> RICHARD SIGLER  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

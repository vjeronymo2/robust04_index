			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Lehman Brothers to advise OMV on potential partners OMV, the state-controlled Austrian oil and chemicals group which has a stock market listing, has appointed Lehman Brothers International to advise on the selection of new strategic investors and business partners. The appointment follows the decision by the Austrian state holding company, Osterreichische Industrieholding, which owns 70 per cent of OMV shares, to sell another large block to cover losses in its other holdings. The Austrian press has speculated that stakes in OMV might be purchased by a leading international oil company or the government of an oil-producing country, such as Kuwait. OMV is seeking to strengthen its position in the promising oil and gas markets of central and eastern Europe, and new shareholder-partners could help it achieve those goals.</p>

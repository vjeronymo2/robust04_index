			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAB LEADERS EXTEND SUMMIT INTO THIRD DAY  </P> <P> Arab League leaders extended their summit into a third day, to this morning,  amid wrangling between moderates and radicals over how strongly to criticize  U.S policy in the Mideast.  </P> <P> The summit was called at the urging of the Palestinians to discuss the recent  influx of Soviet Jews into Israel. Arabs fear that the immigrants may be sent  to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, dampening hopes for a  Palestinian state there.  </P> <P> Late Tuesday, a compromise was reported on drafts of summit resolutions that  would allow criticism of U.S. policy but in measured tones.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Communist Party Politburo member Maria de los  Angeles Garcia has stressed the need to consolidate teaching  methods in each school to achieve efficiency in the coming  school period. On concluding in Havana the national meeting on  teaching methodology in preparation for the next school year,  she said that we must generalize the experience on joint  methodological work and systematize that method to perfect  relations among the province, the municipality, and the school.    Maria de los Angeles Garcia added that this meeting must  verify the results of this method and see whether its  implementation is advisable or not. She said that children and  adolescents are also protagonists of the economic adjustments  being adopted in the country and for this reason the teachers  must explain to them the causes of these measures so that they  may find the just answers to their concerns.    At the preparatory meeting for the next school period, Maria  de los Angeles Garcia stressed the importance of increasingly  linking the school with the family and the community. She added  that informal education must be consolidated so that teaching  will reach all young people, namely those who are under five  years of age and are not going to the childcare centers. She  added that the optimization process is beginning a special stage  because there are many points that will require the effort,  intelligence, and political touch of all in order to conclude  successfully this stage.    She added that the evaluation of teachers must be an element  of incentive, control, and differentiation of teachers, in  addition to being just.    Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez Gutierrez also  participated in the meeting in preparation for the next school  period, and he also stressed the changes being made in the  registration of students for adult education. He added that  these changes are made in accordance with the current economic  situation that must be changed. He said that appropriate  measures are being adopted and will be released soon.    The education minister added that adult education cannot  become a refuge of teachers who are not suitably trained to give  classes in those centers, and for this reason they must be given  further training in education.    He added that English teachers must be trained further to  give classes in high schools, where they are most needed,  perhaps more than in the language schools.</p>

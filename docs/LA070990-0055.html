			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILLIE BROWN DENIES CHARGES BY FINANCIER;  </P> <P> DOCUMENTS: RICHARD T. SILBERMAN OFFERED FBI AGENTS ALLEGEDLY INCRIMINATING  EVIDENCE ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER. COURT RECORDS SAY THE BUSINESSMAN SOUGHT  LENIENCY IN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE.  </P> <P> Richard T. Silberman, once the top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., sat  face to face with FBI agents in a San Diego hotel room, his reputation and his  freedom in jeopardy. Federal agents had detained him on suspicion of laundering  money that an undercover agent had characterized as profits from an illegal  narcotics deal.  </P> <P> Desperate to avoid prosecution, Silberman, a consummate negotiator, made an  offer, according to court documents and trial testimony: In exchange for  leniency, he would provide incriminating information about Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown, the San Francisco Democrat considered the state's second most  powerful politician after the governor. Silberman told the agents that Brown's  law firm had connections to businesses with a stake in legislation under the  powerful lawmaker's control, and he offered to expose the ties.  </P> <P> Apparently, the FBI turned down Silberman's proposal. They arrested the San  Diego businessman and prosecutors put him on trial. Last month, he was  convicted on a federal currency charge and is in jail in San Diego awaiting  sentencing to federal prison.  </P> <P> Silberman's allegations about Brown and others, made more than a year ago, were  revealed in court documents filed in May by Silberman's lawyers. Their  publication Friday has rankled the Assembly leader, who long has complained  that the police and the FBI are out to get him.  </P> <P> Brown, in an interview with The Times, emphatically denied Silberman's  accusations, which he said were "totally and completely unsupported."  </P> <P> "It's an irresponsible allegation made by a sick man who's been convicted,"  Brown said.  </P> <P> Notes of the meeting between Silberman and FBI Agent Charles Walker indicate  that Silberman described Chula Vista City Councilman David Malcolm as Brown's  "bagman" and said Brown's San Francisco law office had a connection to  legislation involving the state unitary tax law and the proposed merger of  Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.  </P> <P> Part of the notes read:  </P> <P> "7/83 -- Jap. meeting re unitary tax"  </P> <P> "25K 'legal fee' -- millions in savings"  </P> <P> After leaving Brown's staff, Silberman lobbied the Legislature on behalf of  Japanese business interests seeking to overhaul the state's unitary tax law,  which involves the way the state assesses multinational corporations that do  business in California.  </P> <P> In 1986, the Legislature revised the system in a way that lightened the  California tax burden on foreign corporations.  </P> <P> Silberman, as a top Democratic Party figure and a lobbyist, would have been  well positioned to broker or observe a deal between the Speaker and the  Japanese businesses. But Brown emphatically denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> "I'd really like to have him (Silberman) go through my client list and tell me  which one of those non-Japanese were involved in the unitary matter," Brown  said. "I represent developers and movie stars and record executives and that's  it."  </P> <P> Brown also said his law firm has never been connected to Southern California  Edison. And he said he had "no idea" why Silberman would describe Malcolm as  his "bagman" -- a term used in political circles to describe a person who acts  as an intermediary for illicit payments from special interests to elected  officials.  </P> <P> Brown twice has appointed Malcolm to the state Coastal Commission, but he said  he first did so at the recommendation of local officials and members of the  Legislature. He said the two are not close and noted that Malcolm, a  Republican, raises campaign contributions for GOP politicians.  </P> <P> "I wish I could get him to raise money for me," Brown said. He said Malcolm has  had no connection to his law firm and has never recommended clients to him.  </P> <P> Despite his denials, Brown said he could understand why Silberman, seeking to  escape prosecution, would try to shift the attention to someone else.  </P> <P> "I practiced law for a long time, and every time I've represented anybody who's  gotten nailed, the first thing they start asking me about is, is there some way  we can give them (the police) somebody," Brown said. "They say we'll give them  somebody who can't get back at us, and we'll give them somebody they might  believe.  </P> <P> "Why Willie Brown? I have no idea. I have no connection at all."  </P> <P> Weintraub reported from Sacramento and Abrahamson from San Diego.  </P></p>

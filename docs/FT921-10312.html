			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Engineer seeks to build confidence - The new bank chief has a tough job MR Pertti Voutilainen must have one of the most unenviable jobs in Finland at the moment. The 51-year-old engineer who has spent most of his working life with Outokumpu, the mining company, took over as chief executive of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), Finland's leading commercial bank, only five weeks ago. But as he announced the bank's disastrous results for 1991 with a FM1.643bn (Dollars 378m) loss yesterday, he might be forgiven for wondering whether he had been sensible in agreeing to try to rescue a once-proud and prudent bank. His hapless predecessor, Mr Jaakko Lassila, resigned last October, suggesting there was a personal vendetta against him in the Finnish media. 'In today's unstable and turbulent conditions, this kind of persecution is more detrimental to the bank than it can be to me personally,' he wrote in his resignation letter to the bank's supervisory board chairman. It is in these troubled circumstances that Mr Voutilainen must try to revive the bank's profitability. 'It was a difficult decision for me to come to KOP,' he admits. 'I was given half-an-hour to decide on taking the job.' But after last year's scandals, which included a breach of stock exchange rules leading to the KOP board being fined last week, and the bizarre share-dealing operation of New York-based financier Mr Pertti Kouri, the bank needed to look outside its own staff to find a saviour. Mr Voutilainen admits he has no direct banking experience. 'I'm not sophisticated enough to get involved in the kind of transactions the bank has carried out recently,' he admits. But he was a long-time member of KOP's supervisory board and is finding his feet very quickly as he grapples with the bank's massive problems. A small working group has been set up under his chairmanship to chart a new course for the bank. This will be ready with a report by April and after that KOP can expect to see changes in both its management and priorities. Mr Voutilainen is already clear about what needs to be done. 'We have to restore confidence in the bank,' he says. 'Our image has been damaged.' He emphasises the need to 'improve the quality of the bank's services' to its customers. The bank's staff has been demoralised, he admits, by last year's events, and he has spent much of his time since arriving in the job 'walking round the organisation' trying to convince his employees to believe in themselves. His style of leadership already looks different from that of his rather patriarchal and secretive predecessor, Mr Lassila. 'I want to be more open,' he says. 'We have been too reluctant to tell the whole truth. People do not like that.' He is concerned that many bank customers may have lost confidence in the Finnish banking system. Mr Voutilainen is also clear that KOP must concentrate its efforts on what it knows best and that means sticking to basic banking operations. 'It would be a deception to expect that everything will change overnight,' he warns. 'The general operating environment holds little promise of drastic amelioration.' He explains there is no danger of a KOP collapse. 'We can stand one or two years without any profits,' he says. 'But banks live on confidence. If you lose that you can't continue.' Although only five weeks into the job, he already sees a big difference between running a bank and an industrial company. 'In industry, you can take a pause before making a decision. But in the bank that is not possible. Decisions have to be taken much more quickly,' he explains. What he needs more than ever, he admits, from KOP's shareholders, is 'patience,' time to ensure the bank can once again 'bring a competitive yield on their investment'.</p>

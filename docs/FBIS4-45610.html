			<p>BFN     [Text] A crackdown on illegal logging activities in Koh  Kong Province -- conducted jointly by a deputy state secretary  for economy and finance and a deputy state secretary for  agriculture -- has proven successful. The five-day raid was  launched on a hideout in the province where lawless activities  took place to destroy trees and export logs. Four foreign  barges loaded with some 5,000 cubic meters of wood were seized  pending a decision by the government in accordance with the law.    Chea Peng-chheang, deputy state secretary for economy and  finance, told REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA upon his return to Phnom Penh  on the afternoon of 25 May that the operation had been  successful. There were no clashes or casualties even though the  stronghold the operational team raided -- where destructively  felled trees were stored for unlawful export -- had previously  been inaccessible. The deputy state secretary added: We seized  a crane, four barges, and 500 cubic meters of logs suspected of  being illegal.    A Singapore company called Maxtron, the owner of one of the  four seized barges, is angry about the crackdown, arguing that  it forgot to bring its authorization along on the barge, and  that it had permission and paid taxes for the export of 1,000  cubic meters of wood, including the seized logs. Who would have  dared to issue such authorization?    Commenting on this issue, Chea Peng-chheang said: We have  not yet made any decision on the seizure. It is up to the  government to solve this problem.    May Sam-oeun, the deputy state secretary for agriculture who  also participated in leading the operation, said: The seizure  of those barges was correct. The Agriculture Ministry is  perfectly entitled to make arrests and seize the means of  transportation and logs if the owners do not have authorization.  The ban on log exports became effective 1 April 1994.    It should be pointed out that the crackdown on illegal  logging was launched following a report that the illegal export  of logs from Koh Kong Province was continuing, and after a  terrifying clash between a combined team that sealed the Sre  Ambel pass and a gang protecting the log export merchants.    May Sam-oeun added: We achieved complete success this time,  unlike the unsuccessful operations we carried out with forestry  officials in recent months. Some of those officials, he added,  continue to issue log export authorizations to a number of  foreign companies in violation of the government's ban on log  exports. He did not elaborate on the cause of the first  operation's failure.    Commenting on the capture of two members of the combined  team  by the gang protecting the log exporters following a clash on 18  May, Chea Peng-chheang said: These two officials have already  been released unharmed by the gang without any preconditions.  The primary goal of the 130-member operational team was to  crack down on the armed gang that fired at a combined team in  Sre Ambel. They all fled before the reinforcement group arrived,  however. It is not yet known who the ringleader of the gang is,  but there is already a hint about his identity.</p>

			<p>930904 FT  04 SEP 93 / International Company News: Income jumps by 52.3% at Espiritu Santo ESPIRITO Santo Financial Holding, one of the largest financial groups in Portugal, yesterday reported a 52.3 per cent rise in first-half consolidated income to Dollars 19.5m. The group said the increase was due to a higher percentage of ownership in Banco Espirito Santo, higher non-interest income from banking and related activities, improved insurance results, as well as the effects of a strict cost control programme. At the same time, growth of net income was adversely affected by the strength of the US dollar against European countries.</p>

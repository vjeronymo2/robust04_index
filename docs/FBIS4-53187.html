			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu holds series of talks with Thai leaders  Wednesday, discussing economic and security issues of the region  and mustering support for Seoul's position on North Korean  nuclear controversy and support on its bid for non-permanent  seat on the U.N. Security Council.    Han, here on his second stop of Southeast Asian tour, meets  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and calls on King Adunyadet  Phumiphon before centerpiece talks with Thai Foreign Minister  Sunsiri Prasong in the evening.    On the economic front, Thai leaders are expected to ask  active advancement by South Korean businesses and more  investment. They are likely to point out the trade imbalance  between the two countries.    Two-way trade totaled 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last year  with  Seoul taking 1.2 billion dollars in profits.    Han's aides said much of the meetings here will deal with  regional rather than bilateral issues, especially with Thailand  chairing this year's Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference.    Agendas include exchange of opinions on latest political  developments, the future of ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) which  opens for the first time this year, and the future of  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and its relationship  with ASEAN, the aides said.    Han's key points will include briefings on North Korea's  nuclear issue and getting Bangkok's support form Seoul's  non-permanent membership in the U.N. security Council for  1996-1997.</p>

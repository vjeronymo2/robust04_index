			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STORIES SHOULD REFLECT MORE GOOD, NOT BAD  </P> <P> Although sports have undergone a drastic change from "fun" to "big business," I  really think the average fan and sports page reader still looks at sports  through the eyes of their childhood when all sports were "fun."  </P> <P> I abhor the current sports columnists and "beat writers" who only emphasize the  negatives and seldom feature the positive aspects of a player or a game.  </P> <P> Now, in your departmentalized format, even the headline writers have become  negative. Take your Saturday, Sept. 15, editions, for example. Of the six  stories on your front page, five have negative connotations. "Head Coaches Risk  Disgrace for Brillance," "Past Doesn't Leave Henning at a Loss," "Past Glory  Won't Help at the Coliseum Today" and "Aztecs Must Clean Up their Act by  Tonight" are samples.  </P> <P> I suggest your staff look for the silver lining and not the clouds in their  approach.  </P> <P> HAROLD H. LITTEN, Carlsbad  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A REACTIONARY SNEAKS UP ON THE TRUTH;  </P> <P> CONFESSIONS OF AN ORIGINAL SINNER BY JOHN LUKACS (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: $18.95;  331 PP.; 1-55584-143-0)  </P> <P> Do you recall the 1960s, when only radicals were entitled to full Liberal  credentials? By now, the pendulum has swung the other way. To earn his stripes  as a solid Conservative, the prolific historian John Lukacs is well-advised to  claim the status of a Reactionary.  </P> <P> All such labels are troublesome, of course. The "reactionary" Lukacs calls  former Sen. Joseph McCarthy "a radical vulgarian" and dislikes (the  insufficiently conservative?) Ronald Reagan "not because he was a Hollywood  actor but because he never stopped being one." Now and again, Lukacs will sound  like a concerned populist. For example, he remarks that in a democracy, "more  and more people speak," while in our bureaucratic society, "fewer and fewer  people listen."  </P> <P> Yet Lukacs' deepest convictions are firmly rooted, should labels be used, in  conservative soil. The Hungarian-born former president of the American Catholic  Historical Assn. appears almost allergic to any trace of Marx, Darwin, Freud,  ecumenism, church reform and "liberation theology" in contemporary culture. As  an impassioned disciple of St. Augustine and Blaise Pascal, he even rejects  such time-honored ideas of enlightened rationalism as the "Cartesian and  Newtonian views of man and of the universe."  </P> <P> What does it take to be a reactionary? Reactionaries, Lukacs says, believe in  original sin and the "immutable essence of human nature." His "Confessions of  an Original Sinner" tell the story of how he came to hold this view and many  related opinions expressed in his 12 earlier books. Published by commercial  rather than academic presses, these books address a wide range of topics and  include "A History of the Cold War," "Historical Consciousness" and "Outgrowing  Democracy: A History of the United States in the Twentieth-Century."  </P> <P> Lukacs grew up in Budapest a generation after Georg Lukacs (no relation), whose  Marxist philosophy and politics he dismisses in a spiteful, ad hominem  paragraph. At age 21, he experienced Hungary's passing from the German into the  Russian orbit as a very mixed blessing. Having seen that Hitler's National  Socialism was more popular in Central Europe then Stalin's Communism, Lukacs  concludes that the forceful rhetoric of nationalist dictatorships represents a  greater ideological threat to Western-style democracy than the "hopelessly dull  and outdated" writings of Karl Marx.  </P> <P> Soviet military power is a different matter altogether. For Lukacs, it has  always stood for the ominous geopolitical aspirations of the East against the  West. He notes, for example, that the looting, burning, raping Red Army that  came to occupy Budapest in 1945 included many "narrow-eyed Mongols." His early  opposition to the Vietnam War seems to have stemmed from similar geopolitical  considerations. As an "anti-anti-Communist," Lukacs thought that "all of  Indochina, South and North, Vietnam, Minh, Cong, were not worth the bones of a  single United States Marine."  </P> <P> Statements like this make you realize that Lukacs, who has lived in  Pennsylvania for more than 40 years, wants to redraw the Cold War boundaries  between the superpowers for Euro-centric reasons. He engagingly says, "Europe  is my mother, America is my wife." But he shows no awareness of having entered  something like an interracial marriage.  </P> <P> As a self-styled reactionary, Lukacs proposes to pit a now old-fashioned  "common-sense way of thinking against the abstract projections of progressive  nonthinking." For example, he maintains (contrary not only to Marx but to Adam  Smith as well) that "Economic Man is a myth" because "vanity is so much more  powerful, and so much more wide-spread than greed." He even insists that "what  happens is inseparable from what people think happens and that therefore the  worth or the price of anything, even of the crudest piece of matter, is what  people think it is."  </P> <P> Along similar lines, Lukacs points out that sexuality "is in abstraction when  considered independent of the historical and social situation of the lovers."  He argues that, in general, we should pay much less attention to motives than  to purposes: What matters is "not where a person's thoughts come from but where  they are going." According to the doctrine of original sin, our motives will  always be mixed: "Man is born imperfect and stays imperfect." But purposeful  hope and "faith in a loving and forgiving God" make it possible for a  reactionary to "believe in progress -- of a certain kind."  </P> <P> The kind of progress Lukacs has in mind is emphatically not the lock-step march  of brain-washed masses toward some earthly paradise. Instead, he clearly favors  the progressive approximation of truth by increasingly enlightened individual  seekers. Oddly enough, Lukacs ascribes to Kierkegaard G. E. Lessing's memorable  sentence about just this kind of progress: "If God held all truth concealed in  his right hand, and in his left hand the persistent striving for truth, and  while warning me against eternal error, should say: Choose! I should humbly bow  before his left hand, and say: 'Father, give! The pure truth is for Thee  alone!' "  </P> <P> In some context or another, the 19th-Century Danish proponent of faith beyond  knowledge may well have cited the enlightened German writer's words of 1778.  But Lukacs' habitual failure to document his quotations makes it hard to find  out whether this is indeed the case. Perhaps his distaste for bibliographical  accuracy and other customs of the tribe of professional historians has kept  Lukacs from overcoming his life-long academic isolation. With resentful  memories of a few visiting professorships at prestigious graduate schools, he  takes great pride in having remained on the faculty of a small Catholic women's  college since 1947.  </P> <P> Despite the apparent crumbling of the Soviet empire, the reactionary Lukacs is  very displeased with most turns taken by the contemporary world under radical,  liberal, and conservative governments alike. But the harsh tone of his testy  "Confessions" will wax lyrical whenever he speaks of the Budapest of his  parents and grandparents or the Pennsylvania of the parents and grandparents of  his American friends and neighbors. Indeed, Lukacs' "Budapest 1900: A  Historical Portrait of a City and Its Culture" is a loving, informative, and  beautifully illustrated book.  </P> <P> Issued by the same publisher earlier this year, it provides more satisfactory  reading than the lively but self-righteous and self-indulgent confessions under  present view.  </P></p>

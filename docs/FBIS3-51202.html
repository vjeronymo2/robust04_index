He thus ended the conflict over the law on the  Council for Magistrates.    After the ceremony, the head of state noted that this  agreement has "a deep meaning that far exceeds the importance of  its own objectives." He stated that "disagreements should  always be surmounted through dialogue in order to set an example  for our society, which has entrusted the different branches of  government with the responsibility of ruling the country."  Wasmosy said he hoped "this would be the starting point for the  much sought-after national unity -- to the exclusion of no one  -- so as to build a better Paraguay."    The president urged all levels of society -- businessmen,  workers, trade unionists -- "to find this path of dialogue." He  termed the agreement "a symbol of maturity."    "Today is 13 January, a controversial date in our history  [on  13 January 1947 the Colorado Party dismissed all ministers  belonging to other parties in the ruling coalition, becoming the  sole ruler of the country]. Well, let this 13 January be the  date on which we embark upon the path to lift our country out of  underdevelopment," he stressed. After the president's speech,  Justice Minister Juan Manuel Morales, a signatory to the  document as well, read the decree whereby the executive  partially vetoed the law on the Council for Magistrates.    By virtue of the agreement, the executive branch pledged to  veto only Articles 42 and 47 of the law enacted by Congress, and  congressmen committed themselves to accepting this veto so that  the law might come into force as soon as possible. Article 42  pertains to the controversial issue about the required consent  by the executive to the nomination of Supreme Court justices and  Higher Electoral Court members. Article 47 deals with the  procedure for the appointment of the prosecutor general.    On behalf of all congressmen, [Senator] Miguel Abdon Saguier  [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] pointed out that he wanted to  "reassure" Paraguayans that this agreement would not entail the  manipulation of justice or its subordination to political  interests.</p>

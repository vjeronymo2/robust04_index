			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (1): A guide through the maze of technology - The industry's jargon explained for perplexed customers of the latest equipment TODAY's business telecommunications user may sometimes feel in need of a guide for the perplexed. Such is the variety of services now available in the marketplace. The first reason for confusion is that users can become drowned in techno-babble. Services tend to have acronyms which, even when spelt out, leave customers none the wiser. For example, ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital Network, and MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network. But such translations on their own would hardly enlighten the uninitiated. Meanwhile, expressions such as the fashionable 'outsourcing' have different meanings for different people. A second reason for customer confusion is that, although the state of technology is similar throughout all the world's developed economies, the availability of services is far from uniform. This is to a large extent the result of restrictive regulations which protect monopoly telephone companies in many countries. A third reason for confusion is that telephone companies have not traditionally been good at marketing their services, though this is now changing. Often services have failed to make a breakthrough because of inadequate marketing. For example, free-phone services - which have been a great success in the US - have so far made comparatively little impact in Europe because their benefits have not been sold to customers. At other times, the telecommunications industry has pushed services which are strong on technology but do not address customer-needs. ISDN, which allows customers to speak and send pictures or data simultaneously down a telephone line, is a case in point. Now, after 10 years of hype by the phone companies, services are only just beginning to take off. Nevertheless, users have an incentive to cut through the jungle of confusion because of the large productivity benefits new telecommunications services can offer. Communicating with customers, suppliers or colleagues is at the heart of modern business. New services can increase efficiency in two main ways: first, by increasing the number of contacts people can make, so speeding up every aspect of business from design through production to retailing; second, by improving quality so that communication is more accurate. It is possible to classify new telecommunications services under four main headings. First, services which make it easier to track down people. Traditionally, telephones have not been an effective means of making contact with people. The person wanted may be engaged, not at his desk or there may be nobody to take a message. ONE solution to this problem is mobile communications. In the developed economies, cellular systems, the main established form of mobile communications, are being converted to digital technology which will provide clearer communication. At the same time, new forms of mobile communications are being introduced. For example, over the next year the UK will see the introduction of personal communications networks which eventually promise to use smaller handsets than traditional cell phones at a lower price. Another solution to the problem of not making contact is messaging. Phone companies are increasingly offering their customers voice mail, the equivalent of an answerphone in the heart of the network. Such services can also be installed on a company's switchboard. Alternatively, calls can be forwarded to a different telephone number when a person moves location. A variation on the idea is personal numbers which forward calls destined for particular individuals but not those destined for particular locations. The first such personal numbers were launched in the US earlier this year by American Telephone and Telegraph. A second group of new services provides businesses with alternatives to the traditional arrangement of charging calls to the line where they originate. The most popular, free-phone services, involves the receiver of the call paying the bill. These services have been such a success in the US that they have changed the nature of the retailing industry. Many companies have discovered that they can dispense with shops and use '800' numbers instead to encourage customers to buy their goods. At the other extreme, premium rate services charge callers more than the normal rate, which is then shared between a service provider and the phone company. Such services have proved a useful way for companies to get paid for providing entertainment and information over the phone. Another alternative billing arrangement is the telephone card, which allows people to charge calls to their companies' accounts irrespective of where they make calls. A third group of new services relies on the fact that it is now possible to pump more information down a telephone line than in the past. Traditional analogue lines are adequate for ordinary conversation, although even then the quality of the sound is fairly poor. But they are not good enough to transmit moving pictures or large amounts of data. For some time, telephone companies have catered for businesses needing high-speed communication by providing private circuits. The carriers are now providing high-speed facilities on their public networks. This is the main feature of ISDN, which converts an ordinary analogue line into two high-speed data channels (see page ten). These can then be used for applications such as high-speed facsimile, video telephones and desk-top video conferencing. Other services cater for businesses needing even faster data links. For example, metropolitan area networks (MANs) allow computer networks in different parts of the same city to communicate as though they were part of a single computer network. MANs are already available in cities such as Munich and Amsterdam and, according to Mr Stefan Zehle, a project director for Frost &amp; Sullivan, the market researchers, such services will grow very fast in coming years. The fourth group of new services can be loosely described as 'outsourcing'. This involves a company contracting out part or all of the running of its telecommunications network. The main idea is that telecommunications has become so complex that most organisations do not want the hassle of employing the specialist staff needed to run their own systems. The term 'outsourcing' covers a wide range of services, from the fairly basic to the all-singing, all-dancing variety. At the simpler end is centrex, which involves a company contracting out the running of its switchboard to the local telephone company. Slightly more complicated are 'virtual private networks'. These give organisations the impression that they are using their own private networks to communicate between branches while in fact calls are routed over the telephone company's public network. There are also many types of public data network, alternatives to companies running their own private data networks. Such 'managed data networks' started as domestic services but have increasingly developed a global reach. At the top end of the outsourcing category, carriers are positioning themselves to provide multinational companies with comprehensive telecommunications services across the globe, (see page 11). BT, the UK group, has been the most aggressive company in this market through its Syncordia subsidiary, based in Atlanta, Georgia. The essential idea is that a multinational deals with only one carrier - instead of one for every country - receives a single bill and gets 24-hour multilingual support to deal with problems. Such top-end services are expensive. But, for customers perplexed by the myriad of offerings in the market, they are the ultimate solution.</p>

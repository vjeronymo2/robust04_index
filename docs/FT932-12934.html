			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Concern in E Europe over trade barriers EAST European governments are frustrated by growing protectionism among western states pledged to assist economic reform in the region, several east European trade and economy ministers warned yesterday. The ministers voiced their concerns during a weekend meeting in Tokyo of ministers and businessmen from the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations and their counterparts from east European and former Soviet states. The conference discussed proposals to assist micro-economic reforms such as privatisation, small business development and trade promotion in east Europe. But growing signs of protectionism in west Europe sparked prolonged and heated debate. Several east European delegates warned that without access to export earnings it would be harder for former communist states to reduce foreign debts and so stabilise public finances. Dr Karel Dyba, the Czech economy minister, told the meeting that to attract foreign investment from the west, eastern states needed access to export markets. Mr Dyba said: 'If we are to help ourselves we have to have access to markets. We are worried by some tendencies in some western countries towards more protectionism.' Mr Bela Kadar, Hungary's minister for international economic relations, said: 'We want to speed up the implementation of a free trade agreement within Europe. But the propensity of the west to speed up the removal of trade obstacles seems to have diminished in recent months.' Western officials conceded that trade tensions were a growing concern. Ms Helle Degn, Danish minister for development representing the EC presidency, said trade liberalisation could not proceed as quickly as the east wanted because some west European industries were sensitive about low-cost competition. Mr Andrei Shapovaliants, the Russian deputy economic minister, said the issue of protectionism had been the most vexed. 'We have to export to repay our debts,' he said.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources rejects claims ALLIANCE Resources, the Louisiana oil and gas producer, yesterday rejected claims by its former broker, Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, that it had failed to respond to demands for payment of fees relating to the company's London flotation. Mr John O'Brien, chairman, said: 'The existence of a dispute and the current investigation has been the subject of correspondence between solicitors instructed by Alliance and Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott.' He said the board was investigating the Dollars 1.5m fees incurred in Alliance's flotation at 40p in 1991. Gilbert Eliott claims it is owed Pounds 38,346 - in addition to the Pounds 71,635 already paid - and has served a petition to wind the company up. Mr O'Brien also confirmed that Manx Petroleum, where he is also managing director, had agreed to loan Alliance Dollars 200,000 to develop reserves. That agreement was officially concluded just two weeks ago, he said, and the money paid to Alliance. The chairman of Manx is Mr Algy Cluff, the natural resources entrepreneur. In addition to the loan agreement, Alliance undertook to pay Manx management fees of Pounds 10,000 a month. These charges were being accumulated and treated as debt to be repaid with the Dollars 200,000 loan. Mr O'Brien, who became chairman of the struggling Alliance on May 5, denied the management fees were high. He said Alliance shareholders would benefit from his restructuring of the company. He draws no salary from either Manx or Alliance, he said. Before he agreed to become chairman, Mr O'Brien set out the loan and management fee conditions in an agreement dated April 30. This was passed by the Alliance board on May 4, the day before he joined. The document also sets out an agreement in principle which states that 'when Alliance is sufficiently large to make an offer for Manx without prejudicing Alliance's listing . . . Alliance will make a recommended all-paper offer for Manx.' This would involve the issue to Manx shareholders of 11 Alliance shares for every one of Manx's. Mr O'Brien holds 29.9 per cent of Manx. The agreement was never made public. But Mr O'Brien said yesterday that Manx, having completed due diligence at Alliance, was no longer interested in the offer.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Howard set to hearten the grassroots MR MICHAEL Howard is a home secretary to hearten Tory grassroots supporters, at a time when they feel under siege in what should be the party's strongest ground. Their only reservation about the combative, articulate right-winger who is in favour of capital punishment is likely to be that he is a clever lawyer. For Mr Howard the home office is a consolation prize for not becoming chancellor, but it is still a promotion to responsibilities in which he has long expressed an interest. His ability to take on the opposition will be prized by Tories dismayed by Labour's effective 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime' campaign earlier this year. His emphasis on Labour's employment policies in the run-up to last year's election, showed him as a formidable if not a sympathetic campaigner. Up against Mr Tony Blair, now once more his opposite number, he relentlessly highlighted the opposition's union links and the number of jobs at risk from the social charter and the minimum wage. The main political charge laid against Mr Howard is that he lacks passion and conviction, instead merely arguing whatever brief he has been given - like the experienced QC he is. His supporters indignantly deny this, insisting that he is the most Euro-sceptic minister in the cabinet and is a strong believer in free enterprise and low taxation. 'Were it not for some of Thatcher's recent outbursts, I'm sure he would be pleased to call himself a Thatcherite,' one aide said. He entered the Commons, for the relatively safe seat of Folkestone and Hythe, in 1983, several years after his contemporaries in the 'Cambridge mafia' - Norman Lamont, John Gummer and Kenneth Clarke. In the years before his election, after fighting the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Edge Hill in 1966 and 1970, he turned to developing a successful legal practice specialising in planning and employment cases. Within two years of becoming an MP, Mr Howard was making up for lost time. He became a junior minister at the department of trade and industry, responsible for taking the complicated and technical financial services legislation through the Commons. His reward was promotion to the Department of the Environment after the 1987 election. He took through the poll tax legislation; privatised the water industry; and then became employment secretary as unemployment began to rise. Colleagues joked about the dangers of being so clever as to be the automatic choice for unpleasant and difficult tasks. Officials describe him as very demanding, able to absorb a vast amount of material, but a bad delegator who lacks a close relationship with his junior ministers. They admit, however, that he has worked hard with local authorities to make the council tax a success. His advisers suggest that he will hope to build a similarly close and co-operative relationship with the police. A tough crime policy and a more satisfied police service would leave the Tory party in the country well-pleased with Mr Howard's appointment.</p>

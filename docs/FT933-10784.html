			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Three-year peak for flotations FLOTATIONS have hit their highest quarterly levels for three years as venture capitalists and private companies seek to take advantage of the current vogue for equities among investors. A report published today by brokers KPMG Peat Marwick shows that 43 companies came to the stock market between April and June against 16 last year, 20 in 1991 and 25 in 1990. So far this year 59 companies have been listed, including two on the unlisted securities market, raising total funds of Pounds 1.1bn. This is more than the Pounds 899m raised in the whole of 1990, excluding introductions and adjusting for government privatisations and the Abbey National flotation. Mr Neil Austin, KPMG's head of new issues, said the enthusiasm for new issues was likely to last until the autumn when worries over possible budget measures would begin to materialise. The sharp rise this year had been fuelled by a number of factors, from the generally buoyant stock market to the opportunistic approach of venture and development capitalists. 'With the renewed confidence in the economy and current level of the market, those that have been waiting in the wings are putting their plans into action,' Mr Austin said. 'They see a window of opportunity and are not certain how long it will last.' Most companies coming to the market were small with market values of less than Pounds 30m. Mr Austin warned that, particularly in the light of the demise of the USM, this should make investors cautious.</p>

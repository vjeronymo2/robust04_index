			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCKBUSTER BOYCOTT  </P> <P> Regarding the comment of Mark Hayden, marketing director of the Blockbuster  Video chain, that "The Last Temptation of Christ" was "enough of an insult to  our senses that we chose not to carry it" (Morning Report, May 10): To which  senses does he refer? With video titles such as "Saturday Night Sleazies," "The  Sadist" and "Rest in Pieces" currently available in Blockbuster stores, one can  reasonably assume that those senses exclude taste, morality and intelligence.  </P> <P> What my senses detect is an arbitrary and hypocritical censorship and  spinelessness in the face of controversy.  </P> <P> RAYMIE MUZQUIZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> A spokesman for a Southland Blockbuster store said that the "Saturday Night  Sleazies" series deals with old "B" movies and that the other two movies are in  the horror genre.  </P></p>

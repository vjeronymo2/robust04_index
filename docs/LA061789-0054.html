			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LES MORMONS AND MYTH  </P> <P> Several letters in the June 10 Calendar section denounce the act Les Mormons.  Unlike those writers, I have seen the funny and enlightening burlesque-style  performance.  </P> <P> Letter writer John Arnerich, who said that Les Mormons are attacking prejudice  with prejudice, should be informed that they attack prejudice only with a call  for change in myths long overdue for an overhaul.  </P> <P> The Les Mormons duo -- Curtis York and Robert Daniels -- are men ahead of their  time, guilty only of assailing the isolation and confusion associated with  church-supported bigotry.  </P> <P> DALE SPENCER GRINER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

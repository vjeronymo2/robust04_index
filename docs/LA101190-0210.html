			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ATTACK SUSPECT FACES TRIAL AS ADULT;  </P> <P> CRIME: BAIL IS SET FOR 17-YEAR-OLD CHARGED IN WHAT CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAVE  CALLED A RACIAL ASSAULT ON 15-YEAR-OLD AMBER JEFFERSON.  </P> <P> An Orange County Juvenile Court judge gave prosecutors the go-ahead Wednesday  to try a 17-year-old white youth as an adult for allegedly throwing the piece  of glass that disfigured 15-year-old Amber Jefferson in what her supporters  claim was a racially motivated crime.  </P> <P> As Amber's mother sobbed, Judge C. Robert Jameson ordered Kurt David Wimberly  held in lieu of $50,000 bail in connection with the Aug. 7 brawl outside the  youth's Stanton home. The incident became a rallying point for civil rights  activists who have said the attack is evidence that racism is prevalent in  Orange County.  </P> <P> "Because of the seriousness of the case and the failure to comply with court  orders in the past, the court sets bail at $50,000," Jameson said, explaining  his decision to transfer the case to adult court. "Previous attempts to  rehabilitate Mr. Wimberly have failed. In fact, he was on a furlough when this  incident occurred."  </P> <P> Wimberly is charged with felony mayhem, assault with a deadly weapon,  infliction of great bodily injury, and battery. The judge's decision Wednesday  means that if convicted, Wimberly would serve all of his sentence in state  prison rather than in a juvenile detention facility. Also, the offenses would  become a part of his permanent adult record.  </P> <P> After the brief hearing, family members from both sides proclaimed victory.  </P> <P> "Thank God, we finally got a little something," said Amber's mother, Cody  Donnelly. "I feel it should have happened a while back. . . . "  </P> <P> Wimberly's relatives and friends also said they were pleased with the ruling  because the youth will now face a jury trial, rather than the judgment of a  single judge as would have been the case in Juvenile Court. Also, he will now  be entitled to bail. He has been held as in a juvenile facility for the last  two months.  </P> <P> "I think it's great," said 19-year-old Colleen Gallagher, who said she is  Wimberly's fiancee. "There's more than a reasonable doubt in this case, and now  he's got bail, so an innocent person doesn't have to remain in jail."  </P> <P> On Aug. 7 Amber, the daughter of a white mother and black father, was injured  in the parking lot of a Stanton apartment complex during a brawl. According to  authorities, 12 people were involved in the fighting in which youths on both  sides armed themselves with baseball bats and boards. Amber was the only one  seriously injured.  </P> <P> She suffered an inch-wide gash from her temple to the side of her neck, and  doctors say it will be at least a year before they can consider performing  reconstructive surgery.  </P> <P> Amber and other members of the group she was with say that some of the whites  in the other group hurled racial epithets before the fighting broke out. But  prosecutors decided not to file racial hate-crimes charges, maintaining that  the attack was not racially motivated. Although racial slurs were reportedly  exchanged, the prosecution said, the confrontation resulted from an argument  between two girls over a boy.  </P> <P> Besides Wimberly, authorities charged two others in connection with the case:  Wimberly's father, Earl, 42, was charged with assault and exhibiting a deadly  weapon, and Trevor McClure, 21, another white, was charged with exhibiting a  deadly weapon and challenging to fight. The only black charged was Louis Jones,  19, who was cited for fighting in public and malicious mischief.  </P> <P> The elder Wimberly and Jones are free on bail pending their next court  appearances. Meanwhile, authorities have issued an arrest warrant for McClure,  who disappeared shortly after the incident and has never appeared in court on  the charges.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Salvatore Ciulla argued Wednesday that the stories from both  sides are conflicting and that some witnesses have told investigators that  someone other than Wimberly threw the glass shard that injured Amber.  </P> <P> "This was a street fight. Everything was a reflex to what was going on," Ciulla  said. "The seriousness of the injury has overshadowed this case to the minor's  detriment, and I don't think this is appropriate."  </P> <P> However, Jameson agreed with prosecutor Kathi Harper and a probation report,  ruling that the case be transferred out of the Juvenile Court system. Although  Juvenile Court records are confidential, he cited a previous conviction for  residential burglary and two pages of violations in Wimberly's Juvenile Court  file.  </P> <P> Wimberly is scheduled to appear Friday in West Orange County Municipal Court to  be arraigned as an adult on the charges.  </P></p>

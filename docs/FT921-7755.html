			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: French group agrees Pounds 9.4m cash offer for Polymark POLYFINANCE, the French laundry and sports equipment distributor, plans to move into the UK via a recommended cash offer for its former parent, Polymark International, the industrial laundry and label manufacturer and supplier. Polyfinance, which was set up as a separate company in 1990 following a management buy-out, is offering 37p and 164 1/2 p respectively for each ordinary and A share. This represents respective premiums of 10.4 per cent and 25.6 per cent above Tuesday's closing prices. The offer values Polymark at about Pounds 9.4m. Polymark's ordinary shares, which traded at 25p before the bid was first mooted in January, gained 2p to 36p. The A shares added 32p to 163p. Polyfinance, which has operations in France and Germany, said it wanted to expand its laundry business into the UK and identify cost savings. Polymark has accepted the offer. Directors hold 0.23 per cent of the ordinary and 8.44 per cent of the A shares. The offers will be made by Societe Generale Merchant Bank on behalf of Polyfinance.</p>

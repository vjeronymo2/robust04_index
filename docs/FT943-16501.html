			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Market watches for dollar support - Currency markets Foreign exchange markets look set for a bumpy ride this week as traders watch anxiously to see whether G7 countries come up with a concerted plan of support for the dollar. While the release of US labour market data on Friday will be closely watched as usual, the prior focus will be on a plethora of important policy meetings around the globe. In Japan the Bank of Japan branch managers meet today and tomorrow, the Federal Open Markets Committee in the US meets tomorrow and Wednesday, the UK chancellor meets the governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday, and the Bundesbank council meets the following day. Crowning it all is the G7 summit which starts in Naples on Friday and continues over the weekend. The weakness of the dollar, and its impact on financial markets and economic growth, will certainly be high on the agenda in Naples. But dollar-bulls will be hoping for good news from the central banks before then. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of global research at SBC in London, predicts erratic trading. He says the market has convinced itself that the G7 will try to help the dollar, and is likely to react sharply to any dollar sensitive information. Mr O'Neill says a key issue is how the market is positioned. Based on the view that the market is probably reasonably square, he predicts that the dollar will trade in a DM1.56-DM1.61 range, while it could fall as low as Y95 against the yen. The market will be looking for clear evidence that leading industrial nations are prepared to take active and concerted measures to bolster the dollar. Some analysts have raised the prospect of co-ordinated interest rate changes. The chances, however, are slim. In particular, few analysts would bet on the FOMC raising rates. Late last month Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said the inflation outlook was reasonable. Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at NatWest Markets, commented: 'Although dollar weakness does not help, this is as much product of expectations about Japan and Germany. The Fed may feel that raising US rates alone will not change these expectations and only risk harming a decelerating economy.' The Bank of Japan has repeatedly said that it is not planning to cut its discount rate from 1.75 per cent. While the Bundesbank may be more keen to cut rates, it is likely to want to do this at a time of its own choosing.</p>

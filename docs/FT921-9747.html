			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Date set for European news TV satellite launch THE prospects of Europe launching a satellite television news channel designed to rival Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network have increased. A launch date has been set for January 1 1993 for Euronews and the first tranche of finance has been agreed. The European Community has said it will contribute Ecu3m (Dollars 3.87m) to the project and a matching amount has been promised by the governments of France, Italy, Spain and the French speaking community of Belgium. The aim is to broadcast the news channel across all of Europe using the Eutelsat satellite system. The aim of the channel is to reflect the cultural diversity of Europe. Initially the channel will be broadcast in English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. A shortlist of European cities has been drawn up for the headquarters of the channel and a decision is expected before the end of this month. The contenders are Munich in Germany, Valencia in Spain, Charleroi in Belgium and Lyons in France.</p>

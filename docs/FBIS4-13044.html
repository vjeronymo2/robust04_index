			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait, 16 Apr -- Kuwaiti Interior Minister Shaykh  'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah said in an interview published  today that "the Iraqi forces amassed south of Iraq are not far  from Kuwait," but he reassured citizens that "these forces,  although they are a cause of disturbance to the Kuwaiti  authorities, are present -- as has been repeatedly announced --  to quell the rebellion in southern Iraq."    Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim al-Sabah told the AL-WATAN  newspaper in his first interview as interior minister that the  Ministries of Interior, Defense, and National Guard were  "prepared to block any possible aggression, especially as these  forces are operating under joint and clear coordination."    Responding to a question on his future plans for the  Interior  Ministry, he said "work in the Interior Ministry is different to  that in defense but the minister is required to work in the  light of the state's general strategy."    "There are many ideas, including developing work in the  departments, circulating some officials, and finding ways  capable of handling citizens' dealings as quickly as possible,"  he said.    He added, "the ministries and the state's apparatus suffer  from a shortage of qualified human cadres" and indicated that  modern equipment would be required to compensate the shortage  and overcome bureaucracy.    Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah said there were "several ideas to  develop the work of sentries and village chiefs to find a bigger  and more comprehensive role for them.    "I am not superman and I alone cannot carry out all  achievements. That is impossible without the intertwining of  efforts, which would emerge by concentrating on ingraining the  spirit of responsibility and confidence in security men, be they  small or large." In that context, he stressed his rejection of  centralization of the administration.    "Kuwait's interest is above any consideration and I will not  delay in punishing and reprimanding all who try to disturb the  security of this country and the unity of the people of Kuwait,"  he said.    Asked about some security members who sullied their  positions  and their work places with their conduct, he said that "this  matter cannot be considered a phenomenon but there are some  individual acts that give the security apparatus a bad name and  we will try to select elements of high skill and abilities to  carry out excellent performances."    He spoke of his wish to establish the principle of every  citizen being a sentry so that he could, in the future, be  responsible for his country's security, which was a joint  responsibility.    Asked about tackling the problems of illegal residents and  the position of Kuwaiti women married to non-Kuwaitis, the  minister said that he could not go into those two issues at  present until he had seen all figures and information found in  reports.</p>

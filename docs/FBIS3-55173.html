This is the problem," member of the  Presidential Council Georgiy Satarov told ITAR-TASS here today.    He claims that the present state apparatus is inefficient.  Any transition of power from elected politicians to a  bureaucratic apparatus engenders an urge to uphold corporative  interests, not the interests of the electorate. This leads to  the formation of an "army of state bureaucrats" in Russia.    "The obviously low level of professionalism is another  drawback of Russian bureaucracy," Satarov believes. This is why  politicians of the "latest call-up" have "raised much fuss and  have provoked political squabbles in the upper echelons of  power, turning apparatus offices into party headquarters". This  resulted in the apparatus's deep politisation which leaves it  very little time for real work.    Consequently, the bureaucrats have abused the powers given  them by the apparatus to satisfy personal political ambitions.  The Russian people could witness this before the latest  parliamentary elections.    Satarov noted that "Boris Yeltsin has realised the existence  of this problem, and this is confirmed by his intention to  revamp his own administration and the government by cutting the  number of officials". Moreover, the president told a press  conference on December 22 that it was necessary to pursue a  publicly open policy, to promote a permanent dialogue between  the authorities and the society."    Satarov believes that both these things are most important,  as well as the personnel policy's orientation on  professionalism, which could "reduce the share of politicised  bureaucrats and their destructive influence".</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 May Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] A top Foreign Ministry official commented on the  evening of 24 May on the possibility of a visit by Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa to the United States in view of the  agreement to resume the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. He  indicated that there is very little possibility that the U.S.  visit can materialize before the OECD executive ministerial  committee meeting in early June.    This source also disclosed that Kakizawa told U.S. Trade  Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor during a telephone  conversation on the same evening that an early trip to the  United States would be unlikely, and that the two men agreed  that Japan and the United States should consider holding a  foreign ministerial meeting during the OECD meeting in Paris on  7 and 8 June.</p>

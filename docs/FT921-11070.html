			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Company News: Banesto pre-tax profits surge 27% BANESTO, the Spanish retail bank, lifted pre-tax profits of its financial group in 1991 by 27 per cent, to Pta75.6bn (Dollars 763m), and will raise its dividend by 5 per cent to Pta157.5 net per share. The financial group, excluding industrial holdings, increased its operating margin by 26 per cent. Income from commissions grew by 67.7 per cent. The profit figure was boosted by the first inclusion in the consolidated results of the Banesto-controlled Portuguese bank, Totta y Acores, and by Pta34.1bn from the disposal of assets, a 50 per cent increase on 1990. Last year, Banesto sold its majority stake in the petrol refiner, Petromed, to British Petroleum; 24 per cent of its insurance arm, La Union y Fenix, to France's AGF; and a small subsidiary bank network, Catala de Credit, to a consortium that included the Italian bank San Paolo di Torino. The pre-tax consolidated profits of the bank's industrial conglomerate, Corporacion Industrial y Financiera de Banesto, showed a 16 per cent fall last year, to Pta27.7bn. Telefonica, the telecommunications group and one of Spain's foremost corporations reported a net 1991 profit increase of 6.7 per cent. Telefonica lifted net profits to Pta80bn. In the second half of the year, the telecommunications company reduced its financial charges from 21.3 per cent of income to 16.8 per cent. Banco Exterior de Espana, the state-controlled Spanish retail bank which pooled its business last year with smaller public credit agencies, posted net profits of Pta31.4bn in 1991. This represents a 47.4 per cent increase on the sum of the profits declared by its constituent banks the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CENTRAL BANKS SELL DOLLAR TO STEM SURGE;  </P> <P> U.S. CURRENCY FAILS TO WEAKEN AS EXPECTED WHEN INFLATION FELL MORE THAN  PREDICTED  </P> <P> Monetary authorities around the world sold dollars today as part of a concerted  effort to stem a sharp surge in the U.S. currency, senior banking sources said.  </P> <P> But the dollar still managed to hold on to gains against major foreign  currencies.  </P> <P> Central banks decided to intervene after the dollar failed to weaken, as  expected, in reaction to what should have been negative figures for the dollar,  said a market source, who requested anonymity.  </P> <P> The dollar fell briefly after the release in Washington of unexpected news on  the U.S. producer price index for July but almost immediately rebounded on  renewed buying interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renewed Auto Buying  </P> <P> The news that the inflation index fell 0.4% would normally have been bearish  for the dollar because it implies that an easing of interest rates may be at  hand. The market had expected producer prices to be up only 0.1%.  </P> <P> A separate report on U.S. retail sales helped alleviate some recession fears.  Retail sales, paced by renewed spending on autos, rebounded 0.9% in July after  posting their first back-to-back monthly declines since early 1986.  </P> <P> A string of European central banks including West Germany's Bundesbank, the  Bank of England and banks of Belgium, Italy and Switzerland were among those  selling dollars. The U.S. Federal Reserve also sold dollars, currency dealers  reported.  </P> <P> Several central banks, such as the Bundesbank, confirmed their actions that  were first reported by currency dealers. The Fed's policy is not to comment on  market reports of intervention.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.5940 to buy  one pound, compared with $1.5988 at mid-morning and $1.6280 late Thursday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  rose 1.05 yen to a closing 140.10 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a  higher rate of 141.50 yen versus 141.05 yen before the intervention.  </P> <P> Selected dollar rates at mid-afternoon, with morning rates in parentheses and  compared with late Thursday's rate, included: 1.9285 (1.9230) West German  marks, up from 1.8905; 1.6615 (1.6612) Swiss francs, up from 1.6325; 6.5025  (6.4965) French francs, up from 6.3955; 2.1860 (2.1608) Dutch guilders, up from  2.1275; 1,388.00 (1,382.00) Italian lire, up from 1,356.75; and, 1.1720  (1.1725) Canadian dollars, down from 1.1722.  </P></p>

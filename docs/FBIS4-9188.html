			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 22 (AFP) -- Herewith is the latest  radio message received Friday [22 April] morning from two women  doctors working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees  [UNHCR] in the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde, in eastern  Bosnia, and released by the organisation here. "The last two  days here are a living hell. I'm sure you have all the casualty  figures and do not need them again. I want instead to give a  picture of the daily lives of the people here. Both residents  and refugees are crowded into crumbling buildings waiting for  the next shell. When it hits, many are killed as there are such  crowds in each building. It is usually many from the one  family. The wounded lie for hours in the debris as it is  suicidal to try and bring them to the hospital. One UNHCR local  worker said he could hear the cries of the wounded in the  houses, on his journey to our cellar yesterday. All 3 UNMO (UN  military observers) cars are now engaged in ambulance service.  There is no safety of effective treatment in the hospital.    ``Shells batter down the walls there and machinegun fire  rakes the wards. Twenty people were confirmed killed in one of  the hospital apartment yesterday. The Serb excuse for  targetting it, is that it is a military institution. I've been  in all parts of the hospital a hundred times in the last month  and can assure the outside world that this is a lie. The  theatres and all sterilizing equipment were destroyed by a shell  yesterday morning, so no further operations can be carried out.  Now the hospital has little more to offer the patients who get  there alive, than sympathy. The dead are hastily buried at  night by covering them with a thin layer of sand. If it ever  gets hot here, there would be epidemics of disease. Our  refugees have increased in numbers to approximately 100 now,  mostly women and children. As yet, we are lucky in that only  one child was wounded and is still alive. They pack the stairs  to our cellar and when the shelling gets particularly heavy, we  bring them into our living quarters. They are so quiet and  leave again for the upper floors when things get quieter. It  was some of these children we asked to send their plea to Geneva  last night and gave us these messages from their hearts.    ``They have little food and we cannot help them as our  rations would be gone in one hour if we tried. At least we can  give this little band water when ours is running but God knows  how long they will last. They all have terrible stories to  tell, but I cannot speak to them or look them in the face as I  am too ashamed at how little we can do for them. Only  occasionaly, as when dressing some of their wounds, do we hear  these stories. One old lady cried for her relative, an eight-  month's pregnant lady who was killed together with her three  children by a direct hit on their apartment on April 19.  Another man with burned hands was the only survivor of the fire  that burned the UNMO's worker and three others to death the same  night.    ``Presidents (Bill) Clinton and (Boris) Yeltsin want to hold  talks about the future of Bosnia next month. There will be  little left in Gorazde by then, but corpses and rubble".    ``With best regards"... xxx and xxx (names retained by  UNHCR for reason of safety)</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries With the market braced for a dour results season, the cash-generative capacity of BAT Industries and its aggressive dividend policy were always likely to win friends. Yesterday's figures confirmed that damage limitation in UK insurance is now feeding through into higher earnings, while tobacco continues to generate cash in the old way. Moreover, as losses at Eagle Star are staunched, BAT starts to look a less hopelessly tax-inefficient investment vehicle. ACT is again being utilised and the effective tax rate is down to 42 per cent, from 57 per cent last year. Yet the outlook for Eagle Star remains unclear. Provisions against domestic mortgage indemnity business show no sign of declining from the current rate of Pounds 25m a quarter. While the company has tightened underwriting criteria and promised to get tough with the building societies over the terms of new business, losses on policies already written are linked to the rate of repossessions, over which it has no control. Increased marketing spend on US tobacco suggests competitive pressures are building, while the weakness of the dollar could depress second-half US earnings on translation. But while there are still risks, BAT has promised at least to maintain the 9 per cent rise in the interim dividend for the full year. On this basis alone the stock may have further to go, even after outperforming the market by 20 per cent so far this year. Assuming it can carry on delivering dividend growth above inflation beyond the current year, the prospective yield of 6.6 per cent looks undemanding.</p>

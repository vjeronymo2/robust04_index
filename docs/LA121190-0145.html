			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: PARADISE IS PUT ON THE BACK BURNER  </P> <P> I stopped by Dr. Bill Anderson's house in Laguna Beach the other day to talk to  him about Saudi Arabia, from where he recently returned. We ended up by  spending most of our time talking about his lifetime fantasy -- which he also  lived out recently -- of returning to the American frontier.  </P> <P> Anderson is a 46-year-old general practitioner who spent six years as the  director of student health services at UC Irvine. He was also the doctor for  Bill Mulligan's UCI basketball team, and Anderson and I spent a good many  evenings over those six years sitting in the stands at the Bren Center  second-guessing Mulligan's coaching decisions. One of the few pieces of good  luck Anderson has enjoyed the past two years is being happily absent during  UCI's 5-23 season.  </P> <P> Anderson cut out of Orange County in 1988 to take his wife, Catherine, and two  small children to Big Sur country, where he would go back to basics, live off  the land and be a country doctor. We talked about this when we weren't talking  basketball, and his eyes would light and his voice grow animated whenever he  projected it.  </P> <P> I had some misgivings, especially when he told me he would be moving his family  into a converted barn, temporarily without electricity, at the end of a 3-mile  torturous dirt road that hugged a cliff and turned into a quagmire when it  rained. He made it sound like Valhalla.  </P> <P> Well, it was something less than that -- how much less depends on whether you  are talking to Bill or Catherine. Country doctoring turned out to be  impractical as a livelihood, and the nearest place Bill could find work was  Hollister, a two-hour drive away. Bill worked in the emergency room there -- 24  hours on ("24 hours in hell" he called it) and 48 off. Catherine assured me  that most of the crises at the old homestead took place when Bill was either at  work or on his way.  </P> <P> There was, for example, the matter of the Doberman. The Andersons' dog, Comet,  took to hanging out with two Doberman pinchers at their nearest neighbor's, a  mile away, because they offered a house with heat, food served indoors, and  other amenities to which Comet had become accustomed in an earlier life. To woo  Comet back to the family, the Andersons adopted a Doberman from the nearest dog  pound.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter their livestock began to disappear, notably chickens and  geese. The evidence was circumstantial until they caught the new Doberman with  a dead goose just as Bill was leaving for work one morning. "Tie the goose  around the dog's neck," he instructed his wife, "and that will cure him of this  forever." Then he left.  </P> <P> So Catherine tied up the Doberman and hung the dead goose around his neck. A  few minutes later, having chewed through the rope, the Doberman bounced into  the converted barn, dragging the bloody goose along. Twice, Catherine  re-secured the Doberman, re-affixed the goose, and retreated to the house -- a  little more hysterical each time. And twice the Doberman returned, his psyche  apparently undamaged by the corpse around his neck. When Bill finally came  home, his wife was waiting in the driveway with a badly shaken psyche of her  own to take the Doberman back to the pound.  </P> <P> There were dozens of stories like this. It took two months, for example, to get  a generator working to supply the Anderson family electricity, and then it  wouldn't store up power but had to be running whenever the lights were on. It  shook so violently that the whole barn would quiver and pictures would dance on  the walls.  </P> <P> To avoid such distractions, Catherine would serve dinner at 3:30 during the  winter so they wouldn't have to eat in pitch darkness. At Christmas, when  Catherine's family came to visit, it rained for a week and her father sat up  most of every night feeding paper and wood into the stove that provided the  only heat, convinced they would all freeze if he didn't.  </P> <P> "People we invited up would look at me kind of strangely after they got here,"  Bill told me, apparently still puzzled over this.  </P> <P> The plan was to live in the barn only until they were able to buy land and  build their own house. But several factors weren't considered when the plan was  made. Like a local requirement that every new house must be located on a tract  of at least 40 acres of land. And a tough building code. And environmental  restrictions that probably would have taken many months to work through.  </P> <P> By the end of the first year, it was clear that they wouldn't be able to build  -- and that they had to locate somewhere closer to civilization. With maybe a  grocery store and a gas station.  </P> <P> So the Andersons bought a splendid, spacious home in Hollister -- and moved in  two days before the earthquake that shook the Bay Area last year. Their house  survived better than their psyches, so their stay in Hollister was probably  foredoomed from the beginning.  </P> <P> "Two days after we moved," says Anderson, "we were without water and  electricity again -- and that's when I started suspecting I was doing the wrong  thing."  </P> <P> When they decided last summer -- to the immense relief of Anderson's old  patients -- to move back to Laguna, Bill got restless. That's where Saudi  Arabia comes in. A doctor friend told him that the King Faisal Specialist  Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh was looking for American doctors to fill  in for a month for vacationing staff physicians, so Bill went. And his luck  held. He's written a long piece about it which is full of thoughtful insights.  </P> <P> He stressed two of these in particular that he feels have not been presented  very clearly to the American people.  </P> <P> "I have to assume," he told me, "that our intelligence has made clear to the  people setting policy in this country the vast differences in culture and  thinking between the Western and Arab countries. I don't think these  differences are fully appreciated here. They need to be escalated to another  plane where these factors are taken much more strongly into consideration.  We're not going to get anywhere by trying to force them to play our rules by  using Western logic."  </P> <P> And, second, Anderson pointed out that we have very little comprehension of why  some Arab nations have thrown in with us against their Arab brothers. "The  overthrow of the royal family in Kuwait," he said, "is the first time that the  proletariat has ever risen up successfully against a royal family in the Arab  world.  </P> <P> "That has a lot of royal families worried. They don't want to see that  precedent set in Kuwait, and that's why they are supporting us. The first  rumors we heard in Riyadh were that rank-and-file Kuwaitis were throwing in  with Iraq because they wanted out from under the royal family. There's still a  lot of that feeling around."  </P> <P> He added that the people in Riyadh -- the capital of Saudi Arabia -- were  "pretty well insulated from day-to-day news because this is a very closed and  controlled society. People were nervous but not afraid. This is a society where  everything stops five times a day for prayer. Everything. That's the extent of  control."  </P> <P> So Bill Anderson follows the news out of the Persian Gulf with a special  fascination while he tries to reorder his life in Orange County. At the moment,  that means re-establishing his private practice while he works two gigs at  Emergicenter Family Care in Costa Mesa and Anaheim Memorial Urgent Care in  Anaheim Hills. He also plans to catch some UCI basketball games.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he hasn't let go of his fantasy, just put it on the back burner. "I  want to go back there someday, and I will," he says firmly. "We gained a lot  from that experience. This country grew out of that kind of spirit. A lot of me  is still there and always will be."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG GAME;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGUITO OFFENSE TO TEST SOUTHWEST DEFENSE IN OPENER  </P> <P> Two years ago, San Dieguito High and Southwest played in one of the top  football games of the season.  </P> <P> At the end of the third quarter, the game was tied, 10-10. Each team then  scored two touchdowns, and Southwest held a 25-24 lead.  </P> <P> With less then a minute to play, sophomore Sean Newcomer caught a 30-yard  scoring pass to give San Dieguito a 32-25 victory that would eventually propel  it into the 3-A playoffs with a 5-5 record.  </P> <P> "It was definitely a barn-burner," said Coach Ed Burke, entering his fifth  season at San Dieguito. "We were lucky to get out of that one."  </P> <P> Tonight at 7:30 at San Dieguito, the Mustangs and Red Raiders play each other  for the first time since that game.  </P> <P> While revenge could be on the minds of Southwest players who would have been  sophomores in '87, both teams are looking to build on successful 1988 seasons.  </P> <P> San Dieguito is coming off an 8-3 season in which they lost to eventual  champion Morse, 14-6, in the 3-A quarterfinals. The Mustangs had the  seventh-best offense in the county, averaging 25.3 points per game.  </P> <P> Southwest established itself as the county's No. 1 defensive team, allowing  just 7.6 points per game during a 9-3 season. The Raiders also lost in the  quarterfinals, 28-0, to Orange Glen, the 3-A runner-up.  </P> <P> Southwest should again be strong defensively with returning standouts Laurence  Estes (defensive back), Jermaine Brown (linebacker) and Mike Johnson and  Fernando Villalboza (defensive line).  </P> <P> San Dieguito will counter with quarterback Bryan Thistle, running back Mike  Henry, tackle Kevin Barres and guard Brad Emery leading the wing-T offense.  </P> <P> Having met three times in the past four years, Burke and Carl Parrick,  Southwest's ninth-year coach, respect each other's programs.  </P> <P> Said Parrick: "Preparing for San Dieguito is preparing for a well-coached team.  That's what I keep telling my kids."  </P> <P> And Burke: "Carl and Greg Raby (defensive coordinator) do a superior job down  there."  </P></p>

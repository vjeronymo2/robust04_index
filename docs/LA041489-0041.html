			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS;  </P> <P> MEMOIR OF A DISTORTED ADOLESCENCE IN BROOKLYN  </P> <P> Leaving Brooklyn by Lynne Sharon Schwartz (Houghton Mifflin: $15.95; 146 pages)  </P> <P> To the precocious 15-year-old narrator of this novelized memoir, Brooklyn is as  much a burrow of the spirit as a borough of New York, and she has no intention  of allowing herself to be trapped in its cozy depths. Insular, parochial and  full of contented philistines, Brooklyn in the 1950s is clearly no place for a  burgeoning writer like Audrey. To relive her parents' lives among the  tree-lined streets of Flatbush is the most terrible fate she can imagine, and  her every waking minute is devoted to avoiding the destiny her family most  desires for her. To her mother, that means settling down and marrying a  suitable young man from an identical background. Even the word settle chills  her blood.  </P> <P> An injury to her eye has given her a distorted view of the world, and she makes  the most of it, turning a disability into a unique advantage. "The eye was of  scant use in seeing what had to be seen in daily life in Brooklyn. It was made  for another sort of vision. . . . Its world was a Seurat painting, with the  bonds hooking the molecules all severed, so that no object really cohered; the  separate atoms were lined up next to one another, their union voluntary, not  fated." That's precisely the sort of union Audrey seeks in her own life, and  her damaged eye becomes the inadvertent means of achieving it.  </P> <P> From earliest childhood, Audrey possesses a special kind of double vision, "not  simultaneous. Alternate." She can close her normal eye and see the world in a  secret way, as unconnected components; a view not vouchsafed to anyone else. To  her family and schoolmates, the world is all of a piece; to Audrey, it offers  infinite possibilities for recombination. This flawed eye becomes the central  symbol of the book, not only providing the author with metaphor, but with the  pivotal incident that serves as plot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clumsy Lenses  </P> <P> When Audrey is 15, contact lenses have just come into use -- not the delicate  membranes we have now, but clumsy plastic bubbles covering the entire cornea.  Her mother, eager to alleviate the one flaw in her otherwise perfect daughter,  arranges an appointment with one of the few contact-lens specialists then  practicing in Manhattan, and Audrey reluctantly cooperates. The lens is  uncomfortable; difficult to insert and remove, but the ophthalmologist is  uncommonly patient and gentle. Her initial trepidation quickly vanishes, and  soon she's actually looking forward to her trips across the Brooklyn Bridge to  the doctor's office.  </P> <P> Professional tenderness rapidly escalates into caresses and then into mutual  seduction; a progression that Audrey does nothing to stop, accepting the sexual  act as passively as she did the lens itself. Her peculiar vision allows her to  see these passionate afternoons on the doctor's sofa as completely isolated  from the rest of her daily life, just as she could see "a piece of face or the  leg of a table or frame of a window . . . break off and drift away." Now as an  adolescent, she toys with the ophthalmologist the way she used to play with her  physical surroundings, an illusion to be summoned and dismissed at will. When  she realizes that the man has actually become infatuated with her, she ends the  relationship as casually as she let it begin. "He had no right to feel that way  about me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Skewed Perspective  </P> <P> Emotionally still a child, she finds a child's solution by simply flushing the  lens down the toilet, but the doctor refuses to be disposed of so summarily. He  insists upon seeing her again, and only then does Audrey begin to understand  how the world must look to everyone else. By then, of course, she has begun to  leave the conventions of Brooklyn far behind, though it will be some time yet  before she knows herself to be absolutely out of danger.  </P> <P> Seen entirely from the author's skewed visual perspective, neither Brooklyn nor  the other characters in the book quite come into focus. Schwartz's relentless  use of the eye metaphor eventually deprives the book of the peripheral view  necessary to a novel. In the end, "Brooklyn" is everywhere and anywhere; the  writer's family is generic. With the crucial distinctions blurred, "Leaving  Brooklyn" becomes solely a matter of losing one's innocence, something that  happens even to adolescents with perfect binary vision.  </P></p>

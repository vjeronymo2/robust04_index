			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Hasan Sabra: "Butrus-Ghali, Listen to the </F> Bosnians"]    [Text] "If you have any honor, you should resign." This is  what Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic told UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali following the barbaric Serbian attack on  Gorazde.    We cannot but congratulate the Bosnian president for his  words to the UN secretary general, although we are confident  that the latter will not heed Izetbegovic's advice for obvious  reasons of which the secretary general is aware.    The secretary general is in the habit of denouncing any  legitimate operation mounted by dispossessed Palestinians  against the Jewish usurpers in the land of Palestine, equating  such actions with the attacks the Zionists wage against  Palestinians, Lebanese, and Arabs everywhere every day. Such a  man, of course, will hardly find fault in the failure of the UN  forces to perform their simplest duty in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  that of stopping the massacres against the inhabitants of that  country.    We never thought the secretary general likely to deviate  from  the Western line of thinking and decision-making.  Butrus-Ghali's elevation to his current job was, after all, a  reward for certain policies of which he and the Egyptian regime  are aware. The day Butrus-Ghali defies Western--more  specifically American--wishes will certainly be his last on the  job. Nor do we hope for a UN secretary general who is not of  Butrus-Ghali's type in the foreseeable future.    We do not think that Butrus-Ghali's being Orthodox makes him  sympathetic to the Orthodox Serbians in their continuous and  barbaric aggression against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We do not think that ethnic bias taints his position in the  Muslim- Serbian strife.    The secretary general, an Arab, will understand the meaning  of the Arab saying: "Do not flaunt your sins." Is there a  worse sin against ethics, values, and human rights than to  remain silent when you monitor and know, even beforehand, the  massacres the Serbs are perpetrating against Bosnians, whose  only crime was to want a separate home of their own.    We did not need to wait for the UN's silence about Serbian  crimes to reach Izetbegovic's conclusion. We long ago made up  our minds about the secretary general--an Arab, to our lasting  shame.    Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who fully backs Western and U.S.  persecution of Iraq, its people, and its children through an  embargo of which innocent Iraqis bear the brunt? The real  criminals are still free in Iraq, and living very well at the  expense of their downtrodden people.    Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who condoned, and still  condones,  U.S.-Israeli pressure on a weak and defeatist Palestinian  leadership? The latter is now set to cooperate in the  liquidation of the Arab-Zionist conflict, an outcome that suits  Western, particularly U.S., interests.    Is not Butrus-Ghali the man who condones Zionist crimes and  the way in which the United States backs these crimes at the UN  Security Council?    Would this secretary general ever tell us what he thinks  when  he sees UN resolutions trampled under the feet of the Zionists,  the West, and the United States, particularly those resolutions  concerning the Arab-Zionist conflict? These are resolutions  that merely aim to deter Israel, psychologically at least, from  attacking Arab children, women, and men.    We did not await Butrus-Ghali's silence about the Serbian  barbarism in Bosnia-Herzegovina to say to the man: Speak up and  walk out. He made up his mind a long time ago. Since the  moment he got on the payroll of the United Nations he become an  employee of the U.S. Administration. He takes his orders from  the United States, particularly in matters involving the  flogging of his fellow Arabs and Third World wretches, doomed to  live under the U.S. thumb.    Butrus-Ghali came to office to follow orders. If he does  not, he will lose his job. And he knows that. He would not  want to trouble his remaining days with moral questions or  ethical considerations that only bother prophets, and he is not  one.</p>

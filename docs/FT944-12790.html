			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Personal View: 'Highway' to transport of the future The Pounds 5 gallon of petrol is now firmly on the UK political agenda, alongside electronic road tolls. Last year, the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, announced that petrol duties would rise 5 per cent a year in real terms for the foreseeable future. In the forthcoming Budget, he is likely to go further in raising taxes on motoring, supported by last week's report from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. The automotive age is drawing to an end, choked in its own congestion and pollution. But what follows? Calls for massive investment in conventional public transport, even if privately financed, seem out of touch with the needs of a generation that has grown accustomed to the predictability and door-to-door security of auto travel. Equally, visions of a nation of 'lone eagles', telecommuting from their eyries in the countryside or suburbs, seem overdone. The information revolution holds the key, but it is about far more than telecommuting. Its true potential is in allowing much better use of existing transport resources. Off-peak buses and suburban trains usually run well below capacity, with load factors that would make an airline bankrupt. Taxis rarely fill all their seats, and operate at a zero load factor when plying for hire. The new technologies can raise these utilisation rates dramatically. One contribution would be to provide up-to-the minute information on what is available, and make booking empty spaces easier. A more exciting contribution would be in creating a more flexible pricing structure for public transport. A hint of what is to come is given by the on-line computer terminals used in many taxis in London and other European cities. These allow cabbies to choose a preferred job from among those offered on the screen - in most cases, the one nearest to them at the time. However, this offers nothing new on pricing. When you buy a taxi ride, you get privacy, door-to-door transport and immediate service. Not everyone wants all of these services, but they are not available separately. The only public transport alternative is a bus or train - and these offer none of the three. Information technologies will allow these services to be unbundled. The pensioner can book a cab to get (possibly shared) door-to-door service to the supermarket, at a time chosen by the taxi company. The fare will be far below the price charged to a business customer who needs to go at a specific time. The discount reflects the increase in load factors towards 100 per cent, achieved by the flexible scheduling possible when servicing a mix of consumers, some of whom do not mind when they travel, and some of whom don't mind sharing. The result is a taxi service - or elements of it - at bus prices. Mini-bus operators will join companies in these new markets. Conventional bus services can also raise load factors by offering extra services, such as tailoring their routes to demand. The distinction between buses and taxis will become blurred. This is a great vision, but it will not happen by itself. Someone has to build communications networks to link would-be travellers with the vehicle operators. It might require the government to license just one or two operators for a period to encourage investment in such networks. The question must also be addressed of whether to have common ownership of communications networks and of vehicle fleets, or separate them, as is planned with the split between the owners of the track and the trains for British Rail. These issues may seem technical now, but they could be real politics soon. The electorate will not accept that secure, convenient transport is a prerogative of the rich. The narrow political challenge is to set the regulatory framework for a responsive, information-based transport system and put the finance - public, private or mixed - in place . But there is a broader challenge. Even if the new buses and taxis offer a low-cost 'product', poorer people may be unable to use it if booking by phone requires use of a credit card. Electronic payment of social security benefits would solve this, since claimants would gain (a limited amount of) creditworthiness by allowing transport operators and other firms to debit their future benefits electronically. Political talk about 'on-ramps to the information superhighway' is easy. The hard reality is that the information age is starting to open up a series of very difficult issues, all closely intertwined. These will be at the core of political debate in the next few years.

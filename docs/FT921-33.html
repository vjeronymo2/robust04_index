			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;G trust misses targets after political intervention M&amp;G, the fund management group, has raised just Pounds 129.8m for its Recovery Investment Trust. The group had expected to raise Pounds 300m when the trust was launched last month, and had capacity to accept Pounds 1bn. Promotion costs, which included extensive press advertisements and a television campaign, was about Pounds 3m. M&amp;G admitted the figures fell far short of expectations. It blamed this on two political announcements which, it said, would ultimately be to the group's benefit. In February, the Labour party announced that, were it to win the general election, it intended to maintain personal equity plans, which allow investment in equities free of income or capital gains tax. Previously it had said it would allow existing plans to continue, but prevent new plans. Marketing for the trust had centred on the ability to put the shares into a Pep, and the announcement of continuity dampened demand for the 1992-93 tax year, which had previously been heightened by the risk of a Labour government closing this opportunity. Then, the chancellor announced in the Budget that the maximum which could be put into a unit or investment trust Pep - more attractive to small investors than direct equities because of their diversified risk - would rise from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000 a year from 1992-93. This announcement, by lifting the ceiling on the amount that could be invested in a Pep, made a loophole in the Pep regulations, which M&amp;G hoped to exploit, irrelevant. Mr Roger Jennings, marketing manager of M&amp;G, said these moves could be good news for the company in the long term, but were 'rather average news' for the Recovery Investment Trust launch. M&amp;G took solace from Pounds 114m which was raised on the retail side - from direct sales and independent intermediaries - rather than from institutional investors. The group remains convinced that the launch was timed correctly to catch a significant rise in 'recovery' stocks. Trading in the shares will begin on April 3.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Ciba to acquire RPR's consumer medicines arm Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US-based drugs arm of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company, is to sell its north American consumer medicines operations to Ciba of Switzerland. The deal, worth up to Dollars 500m over seven years, includes the sale of Maalox, a 45-year-old brand that has lost market share in recent years and is no longer the best-selling antacid in the US. RPR blamed the decline of Maalox for its decision to sell. The company was only 16th in the US non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) market and 'did not have the necessary critical mass'. It had tried to forge alliances with other companies without success. Mr Roland Jeannet, head of Ciba's OTC division, said the acquisition would add about 20 per cent to the sales of Ciba's OTC division worldwide, which stand at about SFr1bn (Dollars 752m). It would almost double US sales, putting the company into the top 10 there, said Ciba. RPR said its OTC business in the US and Canada was expected to have 1994 sales of Dollars 154m, with Maalox contributing Dollars 100m. The agreement calls for an initial payment by Ciba of Dollars 189m for assets and intellectual property rights for seven years. Ciba also pays Dollars 24m a year for seven years, at the end of which it has the option to buy the intellectual property outright for Dollars 143m. The net present value of the transaction is Dollars 407m, assuming the option is exercised. Ciba also has first refusal on RPR prescription products eligible for sale as consumer medicines in North America. RPR said sales by its North American OTC brands represented less than 4 per cent of total sales. The company keeps its European OTC business, including the right to sell Maalox outside north America. Maalox in Europe had most of its sales through hospitals and pharmacies, rather than supermarkets as in the US, presenting it with fewer marketing problems than in the highly competitive US market. Ciba said the acquisition would not have a significant effect on gearing or earnings per share. The deal is the largest by Ciba in OTC. The most recent was the Dollars 140m acquisition of UK company Fisons' consumer medicines business in North America in 1992.</p>

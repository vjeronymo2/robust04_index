			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (3): A series of overlapping relationships - Foreign policy: pragmatism born out of vulnerability to changes in world economy FOR the small multi-racialisland state of Singapore, foreign policy has inevitably been primarily determined by domestic economic and national security considerations - its life blood is trade and it is wedged between the Moslem-dominated countries of Malaysia andIndonesia. 'We must make a living,' says Mr George Yeo, senior minister of state for foreign affairs, 'and then we must look after our security so that we can continue to make a living. I think our entire foreign policy turns on these two modalities. The smaller you are the more acutely you feel these two modalities.' Singapore's low key, pragmatic foreign policy stance, like many other important decisions, stems not only from the fact that in global terms Singapore's voice is still just a whisper in spite of the country's obvious wealth, but also from the widely held view among Singaporean's that they are fragileand vulnerable in both economic and strategic terms. 'Singapore's total trade is about three times the size of its gross national product, whichmeans we are very vulnerable to changes in world trade and world economic growth and we are particularly linked to the state of the US economy,' says Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister. 'Fragile in the sense that we are three different communities located on a very small island. So long as the economy is growing, there is plenty for everybody, I don't think people will fight over smallthings. But if the pie is shrinking, that will be the real test whether we are cohesive, solid or whether we are fragile,' he says. The prime minister has made it clear that his priorities over the next two years are domestic rather than foreign and that in the foreign policy arena in particular he will lean heavily on the advice of former prime minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew. Singapore's former prime minister is the architect of much of the country's foreign policy, and while there may now be small changes they are unlikely to be radical. It was Mr Lee who maintained close links with both Taiwan and China which eventually led to Singapore normalising relations with Peking last year - but typically only after Indonesia had moved first. It was Mr Lee who, in spite of the receding communist threat in Indochina, insisted that Singapore should stand fast behind the sanctions against Vietnam until there is a comprehensive UN peace settlement in Cambodia and it was the former prime minister who, in whatsome have described as a parting gift delivered a water supply agreement with Malaysia late last year. Mr Lee, a veteran analyst of superpower influencein the region, also foresaw the danger of a power vacuum in the region should the US, described by Mr Yeo as the most benign superpower be forced, for domesticbudgetary reasons, to withdraw from the region. In November Singapore, to the chagrin of Malaysia in particular, signed an agreement with the US to allow greater American use of Singapore's military facilities, and in spite of serious misgivings about any Japanese military build up, has encouraged Tokyo to 'help strengthen the (US) pillar and not to build an alternative.' In fact, Singapore's foreign policy is based upon a series of overlapping relationships - 'the more beams, rafters and columns the safer our space,' says Mr Yeo. 'We are very loath to remove any one of them because they are old and crumbly, we leave them there.' As a small country Singapore is a fierce advocate of the upholding of international law, particularly by the UN. It sent a small contingent to the Namibia peace keeping force and a medical team to the Gulf. More particularly it is simultaneously a member of the Five Powers Defense Arrangement along with Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. It is an increasingly active participant in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) whose summit it will host, probably early next year. The agenda, according to Prime Minister Goh, is likely to focus on Asean's political future now that tensions in the region, particularly Indochina, are easing. However, Mr Lee Hsien Loong, first deputy prime minister and Mr Lee Kuan Yew's son notes:'One of the reasons Asean has been successful is that we do not try and cohabitate closely together, we are friends and we have generally the same views on issues that affect us . . . we work on areas where we can agree and where we see eye to eye, where there are disagreements or differences we just put those aside for a moment.' Singapore has supported the fledgling Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum and, some suspect as much for political as economic reasons, Malaysia's proposal for an East Asian Economic Group. Perhaps most significantly and in spite of some criticism that Singapore's foreign policy is still too reactive, it is gradually and very cautiously beginning to parlay its economic power into political influence, at least within the region. Although Singapore generally resists giving aid, preferring instead to provide technical assistance and training, the so called growth triangle concept, embracing Singapore, Malaysia's southern state of Johor and Indonesia's Riau islands is, with Singaporean determination, becoming a reality. 'Singapore is like the power house,' says Prime Minister Goh, 'and they are trying to plug into this power house in order to attract investments to Batam and Johor.' Aside from eventually providing a separate source of water for Singapore, the growth triangle concept will almost certainly bring about closer economic and political co-operation between the three nations. So far, Singapore has signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia, although Johor is said to be keen to do the same. As Mr Lee Hsien Loong says, 'eventually there will probably be a trilateral piece of paper but there is no great hurry.' In spite of occasional hiccups, relations between Singapore and its immediate neighbours 'have neverbeen as good as they are now,' says Mr Yeo. Singapore exists and prospers by being of use to others. Today there is considerably more economic co-operation and more joint defence exercises between Singapore and its neighbours, in spite of some lingering suspicions. However, that does not mean that Singapore is about to let its guard down. Singapore, with its efficient and powerful, albeit small, military machine, has been likened to a brightly coloured poison prawn while Mr Goh has described the country as being like a porcupine. Neither is to be trifled with. Either way the intention is to deter aggression through a combination of plugging the island state into as many multilateral agreements as possible (a small fish is safer swimming in a shoal), careful diplomacy,and as a last resort, by maintaining a well equipped and trained defence force. 'We must be prepared to explore multiple approaches for regional security which will accommodate big and small regional countries in a constructive framework that will minimise conflict and encourage dialogue, confidence and co-operation,' Mr Wong, the foreign minister said in a recent Parliamentary debate. The long term security of the region, he said, was 'best served by havingan engagement of all powers, large and small, if necessary in overlapping and multiple security and political frameworks.'</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: LIVENING UP 'BERNIE'S'  </P> <P> "It heavily involves a dead body -- who's heavily dead," says Catherine Mary  Stewart of "Weekend at Bernie's," a comedy farce in which she stars with  Jonathan Silverman, Andrew McCarthy and Terry Kiser as the late, unlamented  Bernie.  </P> <P> "The body does stay intact," she says. "But it gets involved in all kinds of  situations. And since Jonathan is responsible for the body -- trying to hide it  as well as hide the fact that it's dead -- it sort of comes between our  romance."  </P> <P> "Bernie's" is one of a string of movies the Canadian-born actress has recently  completed. " 'World Gone Wild,' 'Dudes' and 'Riding the Edge' -- they all came  and left around the same time," she says cheerfully. "They actually played for  a weekend at least, maybe even two."  </P> <P> She tries not to let it get her down: "Whether or not a movie is successful is  so unpredictable. I can't spend my life sitting around wondering if the next  one is going to make me a movie star."  </P> <P> As for the three-name syndrome, that's pretty much out of her hands too: "Mary  Stuart Masterson, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio -- it sounds like a bunch of  Catholic girls running around Hollywood, doesn't it? My real last name is  Nursall, but in the first movie I did, the director hated my name and said,  'You've got to change it.' So I took my mother's maiden name, Stewart." Because  there was another Cathy Stewart in Equity, she tacked on her middle name, Mary.  "It seemed like a good idea at the time."  </P> <P> Stewart, whose TV credits include "Hollywood Wives" and "Passion and Paradise,"  is also the veteran of some interesting casting -- like playing the young Joan  Collins character in the 1986 miniseries "Sins."  </P> <P> "What a match, huh?," she says, giggling. "I did have my hair dyed black, so  that helped. The funny thing was, Joan, my younger brother and I all spoke with  an English accent -- but our sister spoke with a French accent, and so did our  mother. It was a real international potpourri."

Originally provisional, this project has become definite.  Henceforth it will be taken over by the European Environment  Agency because its mission foreshadows that of the new  institution: To study the feasibility of an information system  on the environment. The aim is to design a geographical  database (maps), which would need to be comparable from one  country to another, on various environmental issues. Six  inventories are currently being drawn up or have been completed:  on atmospheric emissions, water quality, biotopes, coastal  erosion, soil erosion, and finally land use. This is a vital  tool for carrying out thematic studies at European, national, or  regional levels.    The land use program called "CORINE Land Cover" is being  carried out under the leadership of the French Environment  Institute (IFEN). It uses photographs transmitted by the  (American) Landsat and (European) SPOT satellites, but also many  aerial photographs, to draw up an accurate inventory (on a scale  of 1:100,000) of the land used by towns, agriculture, forests,  and other natural spaces. Compared in time (with old maps),  these data make it possible to follow the progress of urban  development, the erosion of natural areas, the development of  pollution, and so forth, in 22 European countries. A valuable  tool for planners, and especially for regions, but also for the  allocation of EU [European Union] regional aid.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed NEGA report from the "Azerbaijan" column: </F> "Geydar Aliyev Plans To Go to Tehran, Receives Iranian  Diplomats"]    [Excerpt] President Geydar Aliyev has received  representatives of Iran's Foreign Ministry: Deputy Foreign  Minister Morteza Sarmedi and culture representative Ramin  Mekhmanperast [names as transliterated]. The Azerbaijan  president said that in spite of his busy schedule he always, and  with great pleasure, receives guests from Iran, also expressing  profound condolences over a recent tragic incident in Iran: an  explosion at the Mashhad mosque.    The Iranian guests spoke about their visits to the Ministry  of Culture and Press, the TV and Radio Company, and the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs. During a meeting at the Foreign Ministry  the sides came to the general conclusion that the situation in  the region is extremely unstable and calls for more intensive  interstate contacts, discussions, and joint political actions  because what is going on here noticeably impacts on world  politics.    In this respect Geydar Aliyev's upcoming visit to Iran is  very important. Sarmedi stressed that the close friendly links  that have been established between the two states should be  thoroughly strengthened because these interrelations influence  the whole region. President Aliyev for his part said that he is  making serious preparations for his visit to Iran, attaches  great importance to it, and hopes that the negotiations there  will substantially help consolidate friendship and cooperation  between the fraternal peoples.    The meeting then went into a closed session, as was the case  with the meeting between Azerbaijan parliament speaker Rasul  Guliyev and UN representative to the republic Mahmud al-Said  [name as transliterated]. After a brief welcome speech the  journalists were asked to go, leaving them, as usual, to guess  at the content of the upcoming talks. Journalists from  Habar-Service only managed to learn from a foreign diplomat that  the UN appropriates to Azerbaijan $31-32 million in humanitarian  aid while local UN officials want to have this sum increased to  $40 million.

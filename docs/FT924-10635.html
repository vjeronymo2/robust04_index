			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Russians seek Pounds 2bn UK deal on helicopters RUSSIA is bidding for the Pounds 2bn British Army attack helicopter programme with its revolutionary Ka-50 aircraft, PA in London reports. A widely-expected preliminary bid has been made to Britain's ministry of defence. Group Vector, based in Geneva and Washington, which is handling the bid by the Russian manufacturer Kamov, is seeking a British prime contractor to lead the bid. Mr Steve Stylianoudis, Group Vector's UK president, told Jane's Defence Weekly the company had approached Edinburgh-based GEC-Ferranti and US helicopter giant Sikorsky. Cornerstone of the bid was that the Ka-50, which carries the Nato code-name Hokum, was cheap at Pounds 8m, and 30 per cent cheaper to run than the other competitors, he added. It is expected the Ka-50, which has two sets of rotor blades placed above each other, will be powered by Rolls-Royce/Turbomeca RTM 322 engines with sensors supplied by GEC-Ferranti. Mr Stylianoudis said the single-seat aircraft had distinct advantages for the Army, such as its speed of 170 knots. However, there are concerns about buying Russian equipment, given its poor reliability record and problems with acquiring spares. The Apache AH-64, offered by Westland and McDonnell Douglas, remains the favourite with the Army Air Corps to win the contract for 117 helicopters. A strong body of support exists for the Franco-German-designed Tiger, which is being offered by Eurocopter and British Aerospace. The other contenders are GEC Avionics, teamed with Bell Helicopter Textron of the US, to offer the Cobra Venom, and Boeing Helicopters with the Comanche.</p>

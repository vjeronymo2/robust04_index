			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS  </P> <P> Looking at the millions of dollars spent on himself -- via the inaugural  festivities -- George "read my lips" Bush appears to be saying "let them eat  cake" rather than something about a "kinder, gentler" nation. I wonder what  some of those millions might have done for the homeless or programs for abused  and neglected children?  </P> <P> JENNA LINDQUIST  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P></p>

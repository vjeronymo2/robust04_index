			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] Minister of Health Dr. Sujudi stated that  medical personnel should not cause panic among AIDS patients and  that patients with AIDS should not be treated differently from  sufferers of other diseases. [passage omitted]    The Minister of Health also acknowledged that some medical  personnel are still unwilling to treat AIDS patients for fear of  being infected. [passage omitted]    Sujudi said that there are now 13 million AIDS patients in  the world. The number of patients continues to rise as time goes  on. There are now 177 AIDS patients in Indonesia. "To keep down  the number of AIDS patients, husbands shouldn't play around;  they should think of their wives at home and the teachings of  their religion," he added.    In the meantime, it was reported from Mataram that starting  the end of this year the Department of Health will begin the  official use of a reagent produced by Laboratorium Hepatika  Mataram, Lombok, which can detect the HIV virus, the cause of  AIDS, for surveillance purposes. Dr. D. Soemarsidi, director of  Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram, told KOMPAS last Wednesday (1  December) that 60,000 units of this HIV test reagent had been  shipped by his distributor in Jakarta. In addition, 15,000 units  of this test were sent to the Greater Jakarta Special Capital  Region Provincial Government for the same purpose.    The Department of Health's order for this means of  surveillance proves that this AIDS reagent, which uses the  trademark Entebe dipstick HIV and is produced domestically, can  be used to detect AIDS in our country. The World Health  Organization has acknowledged the ability of this reagent to  detect AIDS. This year the Department of Health has put in an  order for 170,000 tests, which will be filled in the near future.    Soemarsidi said that the first acknowledgment came from the  Department of Microbiology of the WHO Collaborating Center on  AIDS in Antwerp, Belgium, at the end of last year. Studies show  that the sensitivity of the reagent to AIDS has reached as high  as 97 percent, with a specificity of 99.1 percent after it was  compared with the Western Blot test.    A study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of Sirirat  Hospital, Mahidon University, Bangkok (Thailand) shows even  better results. Reports on the results of the study at the end  of last year show that the sensitivity level reached 100  percent, with a specificity of 99.52 percent. The Laboratorium  Hepatika Mataram has been trying to produce this AIDS reagent  for commercial purposes since the beginning of this year.    Although the WHO evaluation has been very convincing,  marketing the reagent is not as simple as one might imagine. In  fact, since they were convinced that the market would absorb  their product immediately Laboratorium Hepatika Mataram produced  it in large quantities. But in the middle of 1993 about 60,000  HIV dipstick tests had to be destroyed because their expiration  dates had passed.    Because of the orders from the Department of Health and from  the Greater Jakarta Special Capital Region Provincial  Government, Dr. Soemarsidi is optimistic that the product will  be absorbed by the domestic market. In fact, Laboratorium  Hepatika Mataram is prepared to produce up to 50,000 tests per  month.    Nevertheless, Soemarsidi explained that this AIDS reagent  should be produced for human needs, like the production of a  Hepatitis B reagent in the past. That is why he thinks that the  reagent should be used for surveillance purposes, even though it  will be marketed and distributed through distributors appointed  for that purpose.    The selling price of the reagent was not mentioned, but  KOMPAS noted that the price was fixed last year at 1,500 rupiahs  per test, much lower than the cost of other detection substances  which had the same or even lower sensitivity levels.</p>

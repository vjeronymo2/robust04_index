			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: GAIT plans split to balance share price and net asset value GOVETT Atlantic Investment Trust, the shareholders of which have been pressing for reforms, is to split into three new funds. The proposals will be put to shareholders in a circular next month. Some of GAIT's shareholders had demanded a special meeting to discuss ways of narrowing the gap between the share price, down 1 1/2 p to 199 1/2 p yesterday, and the net asset value, currently around 225p. GAIT directors have been discussing proposals with several shareholders and now the notice requisitioning the meeting has been withdrawn. The plan would involve putting about Pounds 145m of the trust's Pounds 183m assets into a new unit trust tracking the US equity market to be called the Govett US Index Fund. A minimum of Pounds 25m of GAIT's assets would form the basis of Govett American Smaller Companies Trust, a new limited life investment trust specialising in small- to medium-sized North American companies. Shareholders would be able to elect to take different proportions of these two funds. GAIT's unquoted and illiquid investments, worth Pounds 12.2m, would be transferred to Realisation Company, a new company which would sell the assets and then be liquidated. Shares in RC would be distributed pro rata to GAIT holders. All three new funds would be managed by John Govett, which manages GAIT, although it would not charge a basic management fee for the RC, John Govett would be entitled to more than Pounds 2.1m of compensation for the ending of its contract to manage GAIT, but has agreed to take Pounds 1m. GAIT represents about 10 per cent of the funds John Govett has under management.</p>

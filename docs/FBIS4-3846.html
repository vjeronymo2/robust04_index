			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev today urged Bosnian Serbs to carry out  their own obligations, describing this as the only alternative  before the planned NATO air strikes.    In an interview with the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY, the Russian  minister stressed that the decision, made by the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) Thursday [21 April] on imposing  ultimatum on Bosnian Serbs, accords with the U.N. demands.    He said that the military leadership of the Bosnian Serbs  has  thrown down an criminal gauntlet to elementary norms of  humanity, demands of the U.N. Security Council and Russia.    However, Kozyrev pointed out that NATO should coordinate  with  U.N. Peacekeeping Forces and should not overstep the limits of  the tasks aimed at protecting security in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

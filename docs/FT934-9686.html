			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (16): Passengers would rather go to sleep - Airline service IT IS said that there are four kinds of airline service: the amiability of a Qantas or Virgin Atlantic, the formality of a British Airways or Lufthansa, the deference of a Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific and the surliness of just about any US domestic carrier. The comparisons are, of course, slightly unfair. The US domestic market is dominated by bruising price wars. The drive to save a few more dollars on the ticket cuts the numbers and wages of cabin crew. Add to that the damage to morale engendered by an airline on the verge of bankruptcy, and it is easy to sympathise. In theory. In practice, the business traveller has got plenty on his or her mind, too: it is a rare employer who is prepared to spend thousands of pounds sending someone on a trip without demanding rapid and concrete results. More than that, the airline will have in its charge a more demanding customer than in recent years. He or she is a survivor of corporate cost-cutting, someone who is probably overworked for whom a few hours on board an aircraft should be a haven of peace, an opportunity to recharge the batteries. The job of the airline, then, is to deliver passengers to their destination in as good as, or better, condition than it took them on board. It is a task that can involve everything from the meal menu to headphones and how staff deal with a complaint. But according to Mr Chris Lane, chairman of management consultancy TMI, many airlines' response to this imperative is to pile on the techno-gadgets. From seatback televisions offering eight tracks of entertainment to check-in by mobile telephone before you get to the airport, the business passenger is regaled with technology. Yet the real struggle that faces the airlines, says Mr Lane, is how to improve the 'soft' aspects of service. How do they make the customer feel like an individual, create a relaxed yet reassuring atmosphere, and deal with complaints and mishaps? Ms Sue Moore, BA's general manager, relationship marketing, agrees: 'The core of being different in the airline business is customer service.' Such sentiments are easy to proclaim and difficult to realise: it is simple to install a new piece of hardware, much trickier to find a way to delight the passenger with the human touch. One method being introduced by BA is its decision to allow non-cash compensations for delayed passengers. Ground staff now have the authority to send flowers or wine to a passenger's spouse if a delay means that an anniversary celebration is missed. As well as being a winning way with passengers, the strategy is cost-effective, says Ms Moore. 'They are low value items compared with paying cash compensation.' The idea came from BA's programme of consultation with managers and customers. The airline holds seminars to which members of its Executive Club, the frequent flyer programme, are invited. The seminars have produced most of the service changes at BA in the last 18 months. These include the sleeper service in which passengers on a short overnight flight of less than nine hours can be fed on the ground to maximise the time they have to sleep. The idea has already been copied by other airlines. Another result of the seminars, BA's Well-Being In The Air programme, has also been copied. It is a health regime that suggests exercises for passengers while they travel and offers menus of low fat, high-fibre foods. An awareness of health issues has spilled over into the centrepiece of airborne service: catering. Most large carriers now offer light meals as well as the more traditional rich meats and cheeses. But sometimes the emphasis on health can go too far, as at United Airlines, the second biggest US carrier. 'Last year we went heavily into earthy foods like lentils and beans,' says Mr Len Sacchitello, manager of worldwide catering at United. 'This time around, we are hearing from flight attendants and direct calls from customers that these ingredients don't belong in the first-class cabin.' The speed of response at United to such complaints has improved in the last two years through computerisation of 'flight attendant feedback', says Mr Sacchitello. Flight attendants can record customer requests or complaints on computer terminals when the aircraft lands. The scheme has already led to the English tea service - including scones and clotted cream - being extended from first and business class to economy on its US-bound flights from the UK. But passenger feedback can produce different findings in different carriers. United remains resolutely formal in first class. When menus are proposed by the airline's consultant chefs, for example, cabin crew representatives still test them to decide whether they can be distributed by 'silver service', someone holding a fork and a spoon in one hand. Other airlines eschew such formalities. Virgin Atlantic says that crews are encouraged to express their personalities, to respond appropriately to different kinds of passenger. The idea is to generate a sensation of personal attention for the passenger. It is a strategy that has led to the employment of eight beauty therapists who travel on many flights between London and New York and Los Angeles. The airlines lay great store in these niceties of service. But does does the regular business traveller take much notice? A survey published last week by Official Airlines Guides, a publisher of airline timetables, gives conflicting evidence. Among business travellers, it says, eating is the second most popular pastime on a long-haul flight. But it is beaten in the popularity stakes by the desire for a good, long sleep.</p>

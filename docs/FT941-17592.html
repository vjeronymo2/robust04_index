			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Founder's son transformed IBM: Obituary Thomas Watson Jr, the son of the founder of International Business Machines and the man who led the company into the computer business, died yesterday at a hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut, aged 79. Mr Watson, who died of complications following a stroke, was chief executive of IBM from 1956 to 1971 and presided over a spectacular period of growth which catapulted the company to global leadership of the computer industry, with its revenues rising from around Dollars 700m a year to Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.7bn). His father, Thomas Watson Sr, was the only son of an immigrant Scots-Irish labourer, who rose through the ranks of the National Cash Register company before joining in 1914 the Computing-Tabulating-Recording company, a punch card accounting business which was the forerunner of IBM. Thomas Watson Jr, born the same year, was a tall, awkward, shy boy. He was overshadowed by his charismatic father and had no desire to enter business. However, service as a military pilot in the second world war allowed him to escape his father's influence. He joined IBM in 1946, and was appointed president in 1952 and chief executive in 1956. In his remarkably frank autobiography, Father Son &amp; Co, published in 1990, Mr Watson said that when his father died six weeks later 'I was the most frightened man in America. . . I'd heard so many stories about sons of prominent men failing in business. . . I worried I'd end up the same way.' Instead, he presided over a remarkable period of growth, thanks largely to his championing IBM's entry into the computer business in the 1950s. In his autobiography, he said his father initially thought the electronic computer would have no impact on the way IBM did business. Mr Watson stepped down from the chairmanship in 1971 after heart trouble but became ambassador to the Soviet Union under President Jimmy Carter between 1979 and 1981. He also retained links with IBM, serving as its chairman emeritus, and was careful to avoid criticism of its management as the company's profits and share price tumbled over the past two years.</p>

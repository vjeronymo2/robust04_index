			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Wet and Dry" column by Joelmir Betting] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Who Wins </H5>   From January 1990 to March 1994, the stock exchanges, which  were refilled by foreign investors, have demonstrated that the  Brazilian public companies, en masse, experienced the greatest  benefits from private investments.  <H5>  A Horror </H5>   During that period, the amount of state companies with  shares  listed on the stock exchange jumped from 29 to 46. Their total  market value jumped from $10 billion to $74 billion. And their  participation in the value of all the negotiated shares  increased from 22 percent to 56 percent.  <H5>  Telebras [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] </H5>   The apple in the eyes of investors then, Telebras's  performance skyrocketed on the exchange floor: Its market value  went from a feeble $470 million to a vigorous $13 billion. Did  the Workers Party know about this?  <H5>  Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc.] </H5>   Just as monopolistic as Telebras, Eletrobras also overcame  its misery. During the same period, the value of its shares rose  from $910 million to $14.5 billion.  <H5>  Who Loses </H5>   The volume of Brazilian shares controlled by foreign  institutional investors amounts to approximately $13 billion. If  they decided to sell as a result of PT threats, the public  companies' share value will suffer enormous losses.</p>

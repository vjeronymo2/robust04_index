			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified "official source" in Sanaa on 2 </F> May]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.  Every now and then and all of a sudden, the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] political and media lies and deception machine  produces false and deluding statements fraught with falsehoods,  rancor, and obscenities. These statements are issued in the  name of the YSP Political Bureau, its information center, or its  illusionary Defense Ministry. The latest of these statements  was disseminated yesterday by a Political Bureau spokesman  through the official news media, which the YSP has turned into a  deceptive stronghold to promote secessionist feelings and  justify the use of aggressive means even if it drowns the  national, Arab, and world public opinion with daily lies,  fabrications, and falsehoods. All these actions denote a grudge  against everything in our country; a relinquishment of all  national and moral values and constitutional and legal  principles; a blatant disavowal of the two accomplishments of  unity and democracy; a deliberate vindictiveness with all means  against the cause of responsible freedom; a growing hostility to  and derision of the people's powers and the state institutions  and agencies, particularly the House of Representatives, the  Presidential Council, the Council of Ministers, and the military  and security establishment. This is done for reasons known to  the bloody and domineering secessionist elements in the YSP, who  are still suffering from (?thirst) for absolute power, the  dictatorship of a single party, and a deceitful grudge against  all those who are assuming national responsibility in any  position, even if they were from within the YSP leadership  itself, unless they are the ones in power and unless all  strategic joints of power are in their hand and not others  whoever they may be and regardless of the people's will and the  results of the real elections.    This fact was also confirmed by the treacherous acts against  themselves throughout the past historical stages of which we  remind the people without needing to explain in detail. These  acts consecrated their personal interests and their pragmatic  political creed because any position occupied by any of them in  the party is above all positions of official responsibility  within the state. They consider the party to be above all powers  and that no voice should rise above that of the party, even if  it is the voice of the people through the ballot boxes and the  exercise of democracy by all bodies. This is the secret behind  the Political Bureau members' strife over government portfolios  and over their distribution in a regional spirit which [words  indistinct] any of them.    They thus ignore the fact that the Yemeni homeland, since  the dawn of Yemen's unity on 22 May, 1990, has ascended to a new  historic era and new civilisation where power rests only with  the people. It is the people who can decide the fate of the  homeland, now that they, once and for all, buried the state of  division, toppled the one-party dictatorship, banished from  their life and land the venomous ideas, and committed themselves  to the option of democracy and political party pluralism in a  free society and a unitary democratic state whose constitutional  institutions are the property of the people. This is because  such a society is the result of a free will and responsible  human action as it manifested itself in a lofty reality and  civilized achievement on 27 April, 1993 when the Yemeni homeland  launched a new march to pursue building its modern and  developing life under a popular consensus. The new march has  shown all the Yemeni people to be able to move with the times  and to fulfill the requirements of sustained great struggle for  political, economic, and cultural progress on the road and  pride, equality, justice, dignity, virtue, and morality. From  the beginning, these principles were opposed by the people who  harbored hatred for unity, democracy, and the building of the  institutions of the unitary state. They used all forms of  circuitous and veiled sabotage and job distribution by a  diabolical exploitation of freedom, tolerance, dialogue, and  openness until their scheming against unity and democracy was  exposed. All their plans of disinformation were exposed during  the crisis -- a crisis that was fabricated skillfully and that  peaked in the rebellion against constitutional legitimacy  including an infringement of military [word indistinct] with an  eye to attaining two aims: Rebellion against the authorities of  the unity state, or secession in order to return to the  one-party dictatorship in the six governorates that knew  bitterness and torment before 22 May, 1990. Toward that end, the  elements that had control over the party blocked the enactment  of uniform legislation and the unification of the state  institutions. They also impeded the integration of the Armed  Forces into one national institution and the disengagement of  the officers, noncommissioned officers and ordinary ranks from  loyalty to the party. These elements reacted to all national,  sincere calls by condemning and disrupting all efforts aimed at  unifying the Armed Forces through procrastination and outright  rejection. We would ask these: How does your feigned [word  indistinct] to an integration of the Armed Forces square with  your demolition of these forces, with your party plunging the  Armed Forces into bloody fighting and massing forces along old  border lines in order to trigger warfare among the sons of the  homeland? Where are do the military personnel rightly belong?  Should they be part of advancing decent life and sharing in  shouldering responsibility or in the graves scattered at the  approaches of every village? They thus confirm that the party's  rejection of all efforts to integrate the Armed Forces is aimed  at affording it the opportunity to retain control over certain  units as a means of advancing the aforementioned goals if  political action does not succeed or if the rioting,  assassinations, and sabotage, and other means fail -- actions  that are backed up by a brazenly hostile information policy that  peaked toward the end of the provisional period.    This policy exacerbated and became more frenzied when those  secessionist elements who hold sway over the media and official  institutions in the economic and trade capital of Aden took  charge last December. These elements allowed official media to  become involved in the quagmire of the crisis as an advanced  instrument for deception, for casting doubts about all national  values and principles, and for fragmenting national unity. One  of the ugly aspects of this policy manifested itself through the  repeated announcement banning citizens from entering their  economic and trade capital of Aden [words indistinct] the good  militant Yemeni people in statements issued by the highest  echelons in the party [words indistinct] in addition to harming  all the national leaders and symbols. The party has become  addicted to this condition even when it unabashedly deals with  its own leaders. The same applies to fabricating accusations,  concocting justifications, and issuing directives to the  commands of the units which they control to have them fight  their brothers as part of a dark and treacherous chain in the  crisis. Unfortunately, such a thing recently took place in  'Imran among the comrades in arms and represented a momentous  national loss for the people and the national military  establishment. This fact denotes the intentions to continue the  heated confrontation the secessionist clique holding sway within  the YSP command had wanted, planned for, and is implementing as  a means to attain the secessionist objectives and to implement  the plan of fragmenting the Yemeni homeland as defined by the  hatred of their masters and by their own designs. However,  these schemes will utterly fail as did the previous ones thanks  to the alertness of the people and all their sons in the Armed  Forces and the Public Security and thanks to the wisdom of their  political leadership and the confrontation of the unionist  forces of what is now endangering the people's lives and harming  their eternal unity.    All this targets the Yemeni people's free and united state.  The people realize that those who harbor rancor against them  and against the authorities will not hesitate to carry out any  form of treacherous aggression. The Yemeni people strongly  believe that when they established a new Yemen through freedom  and democracy that enhances the march of the homeland of  freedom, dignity, loftiness, and equality, there will be no  individual in this homeland who will regret the era of  oppression, darkness, repression and blood baths, whether those  represented by the repressive Imamate era, [words indistinct]  colonialism, or class and regional hatred.    It does not befit our lofty Yemeni people to go back to the  eras of the bloodbaths which one of the YSP leaders referred to  in a joking manner but which made him lose his life. [Words  indistinct] clarifies that the YSP Political Bureau is made up  of a group of people who destroy one another. If this is the  case, what happens when they deal with the oppressed citizens?  In spite of this, we strongly believe that no force or person  in Yemen can trample democracy and constitutional legitimacy as  it is now more sacred and loftier than [word indistinct]  henchmen of the party dictatorship, and those who advocate the  return to the totalitarian or secessionist rule.    We say to those that the accord document is being distorted  by false philosophical statements and the entire people began to  sympathize with the values and ambitions which the document  contained [words indistinct] who each day create objectionable  reasons to prevent progress through the state's constitutional  bodies and the Political Forces Dialogue Committee toward  implementing the accord document. We also say that those who  are showing off their intelligence in [word indistinct]  national awareness and are inventing analysis at the level of  political speeches and words despite their spirit and clarity  enjoy lying to all the people who listened to the speech which  brother comrade 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council, delivered at the 70 Square during the  anniversary of democracy day on 27 April when their bad  intentions made them imagine that his speech included a  declaration of war on everyone in the same way that they  understood the slogan of unity or death in the speech which he  delivered in front of a large crowd of citizens in Ta'izz  Governorate when he visited it last January.    As for being subservient to outside forces, events  throughout  history have confirmed this, whether it was to the despotic  regime or those preceding or coming after it. It is as if the  YSP cannot exist without being subservient to some master.    In conclusion, our people have a firm and unshakable faith  that unity and democracy will triumph on the Yemeni soil because  the great hopes to start a new life by overcoming all obstacles  and challenges is a reality that cannot be canceled or denied.  Moreover, understanding the crisis and all its bad aspects  permitted a breakthrough so that prospects would open again for  the marvels of work and generosity and for championing the will  of goodness and construction. Therefore, we caution the good  and unionist brothers in the YSP to quickly save the party from  this destructive clique. Authority is not something pampered but  is the right of the people who approve and develop it with their  free democratic will. Unity is not a game that ends as soon as  it starts. It is a sacred historical and cultural value and a  historical accomplishment that champions the eternal presence of  people and their land as a history and immortal fate in the past  and present.    Moreover, the pillars of the Yemeni homeland are not as soft  as those rash secessionists imagine. The innocent members of  the YSP have had enough bitterness in their lives and hearts  because of the conspiracy, and they should be saved from the  humiliation resulting from the stands of the domineering  secessionist elements toward the people's greatest and most  serious issues, foremost of which is the issue of unity and  democracy. Our Yemeni people are well aware of those  secessionists and are waiting for them.'    [Dated] 2 May 1994</p>

In a situation in which both development  opportunities and serious challenges co-exist, whether China's  finance and banking has the strength to withstand the onslaught  has become a matter of general concern. It was in this  connection that the writer visited Professor Liu Guoguang, a  member of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee and deputy chairman  of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.  <H5>  Trend of the Times </H5>   Reporter: Foreign banks began to enter China more  than a decade ago, but it has been only during the past two  years during China's efforts to re-enter GATT that the issue of  the introduction of foreign banks has aroused extreme concern.  Please tell us about this situation.    Liu Guoguang: It is my understanding that opening  the country to foreign banks was an important decision in  China's reform and opening to the outside world that was made  more than a decade ago. In 1979, the Beijing Office of Japan's  Long-Term Credit Bank hung out a shingle, becoming the first  foreign banking institution to set up shop in China since  founding of the New China. Later on, some well known Japanese,  U.S., British, French, German, Canadian, and Swiss banks also  came pouring in to set up offices in China. At first, these  offices were permitted to perform only tasks that produced  indirect profits. Not long afterward, however, they obtained  permission to take part directly in business activities in the  special economic zones [SEZ]. Thus, these foreign owned banks  began to do more than 10 different kinds of business including  foreign currency savings accounts and foreign trade settlements.  A large number of foreign owned bank branch offices opened for  business in the SEZs. During the 1990's, the opening up of  Pudong in Shanghai provided new opportunities for the entry into  China of foreign owned banks. In June 1992, the Chinese  Government further opened seven coastal cities including  Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Dalian  to the entry of foreign banks. According to the most recent  statistics, 250 offices of foreign banking institutions, foreign  bank branches, Sino-foreign joint venture banks, and wholly  owned foreign banks from 30 different countries and territories  have been set up in China's 14 cities that are open to the  outside world.    The speed of arrival and the large number of foreign banks  coming to China have astounded the world. The degree to which  even the four small Asian dragons made inroads when China first  opened to the outside world is incomparable.    Not long ago, the Chinese Government tendered to the GATT  secretariat a revised tenatively agreed to bill of particulars  on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which made  the following tenative promises about finance and banking  services: Foreign banks may use the following four kinds of  financial institutions to conduct investment and provide  services: foreign owned banks, foreign bank branches,  Sino-foreign joint venture banks, and Sino-foreign cooperative  joint-venture banks.    This shows that the opening of China to foreign banks is an  irreversible major trend. Not only is this an important measure  for the opening of China's finance and banking sector to the  outside world and a requirement for China's GATT restoration,  but it is also a major way for China to establish and develop a  socialist market economy and to dovetail China's economy with  the world economy.  <H5>  Is the Wolf Coming? </H5>   Reporter: Many people still find it difficult to  accept the large scale introduction of foreign owned banks, or  they are even filled with anxiety about the prospect. They feel  that this will hurt domestic finance and banking and harm  development of the indigenous economy and the finance and  banking sector. This is termed "crying wolf." What are your  views about this?    Liu Guoguang: Whether the wolf is coming is  impossible to say categorically, and if the wolf is indeed  coming, that is not necessarily a bad thing. At least it brings  some external pressures to bear. I would like to explain several  levels of thinking about this question as follows:    On the one hand, bringing in foreign banks will face all of  China's big domestic banks with strong competitors. They will  face more severe challenges. In many ways, they will be  adversely affected and buffeted about. This goes without saying.  We know that foreign banks have not only abundant experience and  skill in dealing with international banking and financial  competition, but they also have self-sustaining, flexible,  sophisticated, and highly effective business methods, management  mechanisms, and technical equipment. Therefore, foreign banks  hold a marked advantage in both their operation and the  attraction of capable people. Practice in China during recent  years shows that in areas and business fields that foreign banks  have entered, such as the international clearing business and  the foreign exchange credit business, China's domestic banks  have been stricken in varying degrees. This has showed up in a  fall off in business volume, a loss of customers, and the flight  of skilled personnel. If foreign banks are permitted to do  business in the renminbi, the predicament of the domestic banks  will be even worse. These are inescapable facts. From this point  of view, I feel that some people's worries about the wolf coming  make sense. They should not be regarded as groundless fears.    On the other hand, we must realize that what follows from  the  influx of foreign banks is not all negative. There are many  positives. For example, the presence of foreign banks will make  it easier for domestic banks to learn sophisticated foreign bank  management methods and the newest business techniques. This will  enhance the domestic banks' ability to provide services, and to  upgrade domestic finance and banking in terms of management,  service, and skills. it will help increase the competitiveness  of domestic finance and banking institutions, enliven financial  markets, and accelerate the modernization of domestic finance  and banking. It will also help develop new financing methods and  bring in foreign capital. It will increase Sino-foreign economic  and technical cooperation, and it will promote the integration  of Chinese finance and banking with world finance and banking,  etc. The benefits are numerous.    At the same time, we must also realize that as the lifeblood  in operation of the national economy, finance and banking truly  power the national economy. It is also for this reason that even  nations that have opened their financial markets to the outside  world have instituted strict and effective control over foreign  banks. Cases in point are Japan and South Korea, which have  strict regulations regarding the sphere of business of foreign  banks. Australia and Malaysia likewise have strict restrictions  on foreign banks establishing branches in their countries. The  current situation in China suggests implementation of a limited  and gradual deregulation of the sphere of business and the  operating area of foreign owned banks. The "Shanghai Foreign  Owned Finance and Banking Institution and Sino-Foreign Joint  Venture Finance and Banking Control Methods," which was  promulgated in 1990, provides detailed regulations on this  matter. The tenatively agreed to GATS bill of particulars that  China recently made public further provides as follows: When  providing services, foreign finance and banking institutions  must abide by "People's Republic of China Special Economic Zone  Control Regulations Regarding Foreign Banks and Sino-Foreign  Joint Venture and Contractual Joint Venture Banks," as well as  by "Shanghai Foreign owned Finance and Banking Institutions and  Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Institutions Control Methods."  Foreign investors shall be finance or banking institutions that  have had offices permanently located in China for three years.  Foreign banks shall have no less that $10 billion total assets  and enjoy a good reputation in their home country before  applying to invest in China. Foreign banks may deal only in  foreign currencies. Therefore, looked at from this angle, I  believe that there is nothing to worry about to be afraid of  from bringing in foreign banks.    To summarize the foregoing several levels of thinking, my  conclusion is that in an overall sense and in long-range terms,  the advantages of bringing in foreign banks outweigh the  disadvantages. They will ultimately play a positive role in the  reform and development of China's finance and banking.  <H5>  Shortcomings of Chinese Finance and Banking </H5>   Reporter: As far as GATT requirements are  concerned, particularly the provisions pertaining to trade in  financial services in the GATS, it should be said that there is  little disparity between China's finance and banking and  customary international practices. Please comment on problems in  this regard.    Liu Guoguang: It is true that many problems remain  in China's finance and banking, which is in the midst of reform  and development. These problems are found in both the system of  organization and the management mechanism as well as in service  methods and techniques, and the caliber of personnel. A look at  the finance and banking system as a whole shows the  macroeconomic regulation and control ability of the central bank  to be weak, and a commercial banking system that stands on its  own two feet as a business and is responsible for its own  profits and losses has yet to be built. The entire finance and  banking business remains highly monopolized by the national  banks, effective and normalized competition in financial markets  a long way from taking shape. In the system for the management  of capital, we continue to control the total amount of funds  available, setting the total amount of credit on the basis of  national plan expenditures. All the specialized banks must  strictly control the amount of funds they make available,  largely ignoring the safety, the fluidity, and the appreciation  of credit funds. In the interest rate control system, interest  rates are still set mostly by plan or administrative fiat, no  market interest rate mechanism having been truly formed or  playing a role. The specialized banks' assets are undiversified;  techniques for controlling assets and liabilities are  antiquated; an effective mechanism for stimulating profits and  an understanding of modern competition are lacking; and both the  efficiency and quality of financial services are very low. In  addition, finance and banking legislation lags, and first rate  finance and banking talent is hard to find. This situation is at  variance with, and even falls far short of, the major trend  toward deregulation of China's finance and banking, as well as  requirements for restitution of China's GATT status. Given such  a finance and banking background, China's domestic banks come  under strong competitive pressure from foreign banks. They are  in a disadvantageous position that is difficult to avoid.  <H5>  Increasing Strength To Meet Challenges </H5>   Reporter: What do you feel the priority task is  for China's finance and banking sector given the need to develop  a socialist market economy and the moderate introduction of  foreign owned banks?    Liu Guoguang: The introduction of foreign owned  banks is already a major trend that cannot be reversed. This  being the case, our focus should not be on increasing  limitations on foreign banks' entry into China's finance and  banking markets. In fact, this is unwise and even impossible.  Our emphasis should be on the needs of the market economy and  opening to the outside world. We should accelerate reform of  China's finance and banking system, and we should do all  possible to move ahead with international normalization with the  goal of improving in every way the adaptability and  competitiveness of China's banking system. This requires close  study of the experiences and lessons of developed nations,  developing nations, and of China itself in opening its banking  system to the outside world, and relating them to our own  formulation of measures related to the applicable provisions of  GATT.    Much work must be done in these regards. I feel that work on  the following matters is crucial: enhancement of the central  bank's functions to hasten the formation of a unified and  effective macroeconomic regulation and control mechanism in  order to ensure currency stability; and reform of the central  bank's methods of controlling the funds of the specialized  banks. Adoption of the 8 percent international practice (i.e.,  capital plus savings must amount to 8 percent of risk assets),  going all out to promote strict control of the ratio between  assets and liabilities and to control risks in the specialized  banks, increasing the specialized banks' self-restraint  capabilities, and establishing a mechanism to supervise and  control risks; quickening the transformation of the nation  specialized banks' operating mechanisms so that they can  gradually become economic entities responsible for their own  operating decisions and responsible for their own profits and  losses; reforming the interest rate control system, interest  rates eventually being set by the market; appropriate  development of finance and banking institutions of many various  kinds to promote competition; use of both international and  domestic means to hasten the training of highly qualified  financial service personnel to bring about the quickest possible  upgrading of the caliber of personnel through the banking  business; widespread use of computer technology and modern  communications equipment to hasten the modernization and  computerization of finance and banking tools to improve service  efficiency; and earliest possible finance and banking  legislation.    Finally, I want to emphasize the need for discretion on the  issue of the scale and speed with which foreign banks are  brought into China. Their entry must be in keeping with the  level of domestic finance and banking, and the legal climate.  There can be no rushing headlong into precipitate action.  Prudence is also needed in permitting foreign banks to deal in  renminbi. In addition, control and foreign owned bank business  transactions and auditing, supervision, and inspections must be  enhanced.</p>

The survey says that the per capita living space for rural  residents increased from 11.8 sq m in 1978 to 25 sq m in 1993.  Seventy percent of the newly-built houses are made of bricks and  timber or bricks and concrete.    In Yunyang Prefecture of northwestern Hubei, more than  14,000  rural households have moved into newly-built houses from caves,  shabby thatched shacks, or endangered houses.    The city government of Enshi, in southwestern Hubei,  earmarked funds for helping to build new houses to move its last  group of 400 rural households who used to live in caves.    Many new villages for fishermen, as well as a large number  of  house-boats made of cement, have been built in many of the  province's lake areas, helping more and more fishermen settle  down in fixed abodes.</p>

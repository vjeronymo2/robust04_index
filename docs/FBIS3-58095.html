			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Croatian Ambassador to Germany </F> Professor Ivan Ilic by unidentified announcer -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Ambassador, why was Bonn chosen as  the venue for the talks between Franjo Tudjman and Alija  Izetbegovic?    [Ilic] Why Bonn? One could say that President Tudjman made  the suggestion to continue the talks in Bonn, after Vienna.  President Izetbegovic agreed and both sides asked the German  side to host the talks. Germany has so far made great efforts  to bring about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has the complete  trust of both sides.    [Announcer] So this initiative to choose Bonn as the venue  for the meeting was made by Croatia and not by the German  Government?    [Ilic] That is correct. [words indistinct] the initiative  came from the Croatian side and, one could say, also from the  Bosnian side.    [Announcer] Ambassador, could the German Government mediate  a  little during the meeting, even though the Foreign Ministry  officially denies this?    [Ilic] As far as I can see, the Federal Republic of Germany  will in this case not directly participate in the talks; it will  only be the host. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] We now have the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which  envisages a three-way split of Bosnia-Herzegovina into a Muslim,  Croat, and Serb part. It is obvious that before such a plan is  signed all sides will attempt to secure as much territory as  possible. Should such a three-way split come about, will  Croatia aim to unite with the Croatian territories in  Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future?    [Ilic] Croatia wants, and it is in the interest of Croatia,  that Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a whole, a whole state. Croatia  does not want to annex anything. Croatia only wants to defend  the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is obvious though  that the Serbs want to create a greater Serbia and that is where  the idea of a breakup of Bosnia-Herzegovina emerges. The  Croatian side does not want this.

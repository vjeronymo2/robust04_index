			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Books: Purity vs promiscuity - Sex in history SEX IN GEORGIAN ENGLAND by AD Harvey Duckworth Pounds 20, 205 pages THE MAKING OF VICTORIAN SEXUAL ATTITUDES by Michael Mason Oxford Pounds 17.99, 256 pages More is talked and written about sex now than at any time in our history. Until recently we took this as a sign that ours is a time of sexual liberation. Because of the erratic genius and even more erratic scholarship of Michel Foucault, however, we have been made to see that this is not so. We are, according to him, still in the grip of repressions and inhibitions which have grown apace since the 17th century. Few historians accept Foucault's consciously wayward treatment of the facts, but on this point at least he seems right. Neither AD Harvey nor Michael Mason make use of his views in reporting the complex recent history of attitudes to sex, but it is hard not to conclude, after reading their books, that despite Freud and improved contraceptive technology, we are - as Foucault claimed - scarcely more rational, liberal, or active now than our forebears were in 1700. Note the phrase 'attitudes to sex': these books are not about sexual practices but about ideas and opinions. Harvey traces the change in attitudes to sex during the 18th century, Mason the nature of attitudes to sex in the 19th century. There is considerable overlap between them, not just in subject matter but also in time. Together, although unintentionally, they provide a continuous history of changes in attitudes to sex in the two centuries before Freud. In early Georgian England it was commonplace to believe that women had stronger sexual appetites than men. 'A woman is 10 times more inclined to, and delighted in copulation than a man,' wrote one supposed authority; 'in the rites of love,' wrote another, 'a woman is too many for a man, and capable of tiring him quite down'. The robust picture of female sexuality implicit in Shakespearean bawdy is recognisable here. But by the beginning of the 19th century, women had become frail and delicate, and 'expert' opinion now proclaimed that the normal female sexual appetite was 'dormant, if not non-existent'. In Harvey's view, what was going on was a denial of female sexuality coupled with an increasing concern for female 'purity'. With the view of women as inferior and vulnerable there grew up new mythologies of seduction and rape  -the former being what happened when girls said 'yes', the latter when they said 'no'. The common belief was that girls who had 'mislaid their virginity' were doomed to the streets. Harvey reports Georgian England's increasingly anxious attitudes towards sex, and its concomitant attempts at repression and control. Mason, who recently published a much-praised account of Victorian sexual life, focuses attention on the surprising fact that it was secular, rather than religious, opinion which turned Georgian anxiety into Victorian obsession. The usual view is that Methodism and evangelical Anglicanism were responsible for the primness of Victorian sexual attitudes. Mason shows that religious orthodoxy in England was on the whole in favour of sexuality - within marriage, of course - and strongly disapproved of the celibacy of Roman Catholic priests and nuns. 'Anti-sensualism' came not from vicars and bishops but from progressive opinion, such as the followers of Bentham, the proponents of working-class self-improvement, and the feminists, most of whom were opposed to liberalised sexual attitudes and birth control. This odd inversion is explained, according to Mason, by the progressive belief that the more human beings aspire to civilised values, the less instinctual and animal they become - and this means, the less they are gripped by sexual appetite. Mason calls this 'aspirational anti-sensualism'. The claim that such views, rather than canting religious sentiment, are the chief engine of Victorian morality is a striking and original thesis. Mason does not deny that religious sentiment played its part, but he accords it a 'passive' role. There is one important gap in Mason's account. The growing confidence of Victorian medical science put a weapon into male Establishment hands which obstructed a clear-eyed understanding of sexuality in general and female sexuality in particular. Much of what was believed about sex by Victorian doctors has since been stood on its head, but surprisingly many of its prejudices remain. Only now, for example, is it again being acknowledged that women have as robust a sexual appetite as men. These are instructive and important books. Apart from their special interest, they show yet again that the study of history is an absolute necessity for understanding most things human.</p>

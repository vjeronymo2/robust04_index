			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from correspodent Joao Ligio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The negotiators in Lusaka are subdued by the stands  adopted by both the government and the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in discussions on national  reconciliation. For over a week now, the mediator and the  troika of observers have been trying to find a common stand  between government proposals and UNITA's replies. Mr. Alioune  Blondin Beye only now understands that he is going nowhere. To  end the game of words, he therefore decided to fly today to  Huambo and then to Luanda to listen to the voices of ultimatum.  He was at the airport, but did not travel because the aircraft  had a breakdown. He will therefore leave for Huambo tomorrow.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Greek current account boost Greece's current account deficit fell sharply in the first four months mainly thanks to increased transfers from the European Union structural funds. The January-April deficit totalled Dollars 91m (Pounds 60m), against Dollars 654m for the same period last year, according to central bank figures. However, the underlying trade deficit worsened as exports fell by 12 per cent to Dollars 1.56bn, maintaining last year's steady downward trend, while imports rose by 2.3 per cent to Dollars 5.88bn. The 32 per cent rise in EU transfers, totalling Dollars 2.4bn, was due to much-increased funding for infrastructure improvements, which is due to continue over the next four years. At the same time, income from shipping and remittances from Greeks working abroad declined by 6.5 and 1.3 per cent respectively, while earnings from tourism rose by just 2.3 per cent for the first four months this year. Consumer prices in the west German state of Hesse rose 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-July for a year-on-year increase of 3 per cent, the state statistics office said. Baden-Wurttemberg reported consumer prices flat in July compared with June and up 3 per cent from a year earlier. The figures for North Rhine-Westphalia were 0.1 per cent and 2.7 per cent. Ukraine's industrial output fell 36 per cent in the first six months compared to the same period last year, but the downward trend has slowed since May, the statistics ministry said.</p>

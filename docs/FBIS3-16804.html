			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] This afternoon the Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis and representatives of the government cabinet returned  to Riga from Italy, having discussed on their two-day official  visit future co-operation between the two countries. From Riga  airport, where a news conference took place, our correspondent  Ainars Asaks has returned. Let's listen to the president's  brief assessment of the visit.    [Begin Ulmanis recording] This was my first visit this year  outside the country's borders, and I regard the visit as  successful. We are satisfied with the results of our work. For  two days we were in two states: Italy and the Vatican. The  first purpose of this visit was to create mutual understanding  between Italy and Latvia, the Vatican and Latvia. In the two  days we met both the Italian president and the foreign minister  and Foreign Ministry representatives. On the second day there  was to my mind a very important reception at the Vatican. With  great sympathy, with great support, the Pope very attentively  listened to the problems that are current in Latvia. The  parties to the talks (?assessed) Latvian- Russian relations.  Although the Pope did not promise anything, nevertheless, I  understand from what he said that he regards Latvia and the  Baltic lands as very important geopolitically for the  development of this region, which could be a golden key in the  formation of relations between East and West. [end recording]    After the withdrawal of the Russian troops, Italian-Latvian  relations will become more stable, emphasized Foreign Minister  Georgs Andrejevs at the news conference.    [Begin Andrejevs recording] On questions of a general  nature,  there was of course interest in how Italian-Latvian relations  could develop in the future. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

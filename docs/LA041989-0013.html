			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> LIKE SO MANY TEXAS POLITICIANS, WRIGHT'S RUT LANDED HIM IN MUD  </P> <P> It's not any fun unmasking Jim Wright anymore.  </P> <P> There is a certain delight in depomping the more gaseous representatives of the  political species, but only when they are fully inflated. Once they start  twisting in the wind, the party's over. Where's the sport? When the old  amusement gives way to the first pangs of pity, there's nothing left but the  formalities. Whatever verdict his colleagues in the House may pass down, The  Hon. Jim Wright has been found out; the rest is anticlimax.  </P> <P> "The Wizard of Oz" is a great book -- but only until Toto draws back the  curtain and the Wonderful Wizard of Oz is revealed as a poor, pitiable mortal  with a good public relations program. Then all the author has to do is tie a  few loose ends together and get Dorothy back to Kansas. The suspense has gone,  and with it any sense of indignation or satisfaction.  </P> <P> It's hard not to think of Jim Wright as the Speaker of Oz, and by now he  incites not scorn but pity. Oh, he's still pontificating. His  denials/excuses/sentimentalities are as numerous as ever, but the curtain has  been drawn back. Soon even congressmen will have to admit the transparent, or  deny it so unconvincingly that they will indict their own judgment -- and their  own institution.  </P> <P> L. Frank Baum could have written the Speaker's lines at this point: "I didn't  do it, but if I did, I didn't mean to, and doesn't everybody do this sort of  thing, and how dare you?" If the audience is supposed to feel pity for this  poor, defrocked wizard, it cannot hope to match the Speaker's own self-pity,  which is now as thick as his bluster was before. He's reached the point of  rolling out his wife and family. It is not pleasant to watch. Pathos has become  bathos.  </P> <P> There is still something in this petty affair that is satisfying to expose, and  that is the attitude among the oh-so-knowing in press and politics that it  really doesn't matter if a Speaker of the House takes a little baksheesh. It is  explained sotto voce, just between us sophisticates, that this fuss over ethics  is a luxury, considering the really important issues facing the country -- like  the drug war, environmental protection and what to do with Oliver North.  </P> <P> It's a terribly sophisticated attitude, with the emphasis on terribly. Because  it shows not the vaguest understanding of the importance of an ethical standard  in leaders and thus in a society. Has Watergate been so long ago that the  country has forgotten that a government without character is soon enough a  government without conviction or credibility? Ethics is not an afterthought in  society, much as it has been treated that way in this one. It is the  foundation, as those who ignore it will find out soon enough. And that is the  moral of this story.  </P></p>

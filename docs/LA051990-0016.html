			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERRYMANDERING IN CALIFORNIA AND MERITS OF PROPS. 118, 119  </P> <P> Sherry Bebitch Jeffe ("Changing the Shape of Politics, in Homage to Gerry's  Memory," Opinion, May 6) is wrong to suggest that reapportionment necessarily  has to be a political process, or that today's battle over the two  reapportionment initiatives on the June ballot, Propositions 118 and 119, boil  down to a Republicans versus Democrats issue.  </P> <P> She is also wrong when she says that the debate over fairness in redistricting  is simply "smoke and mirrors" to mask partisan motives. These are the usual  refrains either of long-time political observers who have grown cynical, or of  partisan Democrats who are the chief beneficiaries of the current unfairness,  and who seek to discount efforts to change it by characterizing their opponents  as similarly motivated.  </P> <P> The fact is that Californians have been without effective representative  government for a decade. Millions of our state's voters have been  disenfranchised by lines on a map. The Phil Burton-Jerry Brown gerrymander of  1982 cemented into place districts that so favored incumbents of both parties  that you stand more chance of removing someone from the Soviet Politburo than  of mounting a successful electoral challenge in California.  </P> <P> Not only does this make legislators less responsive to the voters, it rewards  extremists in both parties because they only have to win their party primary in  these lopsided districts, and not worry about appealing to the moderate center  in the general election. The result is unresponsive, unrepresentative, bad  government.  </P> <P> It is also one reason that the initiative process has gone wild, because  popular initiatives are one of the few ways around an imperial legislature.  </P> <P> It does not have to be that way. Either Proposition 118 or Proposition 119 can  help to promote more sensible districts that more accurately reflect voter  sentiment, and that do not have as their chief goal the protection of  incumbents. We will get better government in California if we promote  competitive elections.  </P> <P> Nor is it true that all approaches are the same. Jeffe's article reports Rep.  Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) as saying that the legislative process depends on  who gets elected. But who gets elected, in turn, can be the result of fair and  competitive elections, or of lines drawn on a map in a smoke-filled room. I  would hate to see the day when "fairness" has no place in the political  process. Propositions 118 and 119 are attempts to reintroduce it.  </P> <P> RICHARD P.

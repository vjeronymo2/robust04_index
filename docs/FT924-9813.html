			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: French bonds see more rate cuts THE Bank of France took the bond market by surprise with its decision to cut official interest rates on Monday. However, given the stability of the French franc in the wake of the cuts, many bond market analysts believe there is scope for a further easing in French interest rates within the next few weeks, even without a simultaneous reduction in German rates by the Bundesbank. Hopes of a further interest rate cut are expected to boost the French government bond market and economists are predicting a narrowing in the French-German yield spread over the next couple of months. Last week, the Bank of France lowered its five-to-10 day repurchase rate to 10.5 per cent from 13 per cent. That reversed a rise in the middle of September, when the franc came under considerable speculative pressure. By lowering the rate to 10.5 per cent, the Bank of France was seen as signalling an end to the currency crisis. Whereas the markets had expected the return of the five-to-10 day repurchase rate to its pre-crisis level, Monday's announcement - of a cut in the repurchase rate to 10.25 per cent and a quarter point cut in the intervention rate to 9.35 per cent - came as a surprise. 'The franc has held up extremely well since the cut,' said Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international economist at Midland Montagu. The franc traded at 3.3880/83 to the D-Mark yesterday, and Ms Owens Thomsen predicts it will appreciate further to reach 3.37 by the end of the year. She believes the Bank of France is allowing call money rates, currently at 9.5 per cent, to slip lower, testing the franc's ability to hold up in the foreign exchange markets and making room for a small cut in official interest rates. 'If the central bank allows market interest rates to fall and the franc holds up, we could see another cut in the official interest rates,' she said. However, such a cut is likely to be limited to about 25 basis points, said Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities - though if the Bundesbank cuts its key interest rates soon, the Bank of France would have scope for a bigger easing. Mr Adrian James, economist at NatWest Capital Markets, predicts the 10-year French-German yield spread will fall from the current 79 basis points to 50 basis points over the next 12 months, given the strong economic fundamentals in France. Inflation at 2.6 per cent is well below German levels, and economic growth of 2 per cent is forecast for this year. While political concerns are likely to come to the fore in the run-up to the general election next March, the immediate prospects for the bond market appear favourable.</p>

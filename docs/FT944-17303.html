			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Cuddly appliances for a dream kitchen - Lucia van der Post tests designs for the caring '90s Have you heard about the sweet, caring 1990s? In case you had not noticed we have left the bad, greedy, tough 1980s behind and now we all are all supposed to be as soft as pussycats, full of peace and goodwill. This, at any rate, is the message the fashion pundits have been trying to press upon us. Now it has reached the kitchen. Alessi, a hugely innovative and enterprising Italian company most renowned for its fine cookware and its collaboration with French designer Philippe Starck, has joined forces with Philips, the Dutch company most renowned for its efficient but visually unexciting domestic appliances, to produce a small Philips-Alessi line of kitchen aids. They have clearly taken the new 1990s to their hearts. Soft pastel colours, cosy rounded shapes, cute little cuddles between the two parts of the coffee maker ('the two parts snuggle up to each other like cuddly pets,' say the makers) - all this says Philips-Alessi, is part of a partnership designed to 'rehumanise' the kitchen. Alessi has a fine record for managing to combine innovative design with genuinely improved function. I still think the range of cookware it devised with some of the world's top chefs way back in '87 is one of the best and, whatever you think of kettles with sweet little singing birds, Alessi has injected a lot of wit and fun into what could otherwise be sombre utilitarian objects. Certainly it was a desire to inject some warmth into the kitchen that inspired the collaboration. Stefano Marzano, Director for Philips Corporate Design, perceived among 1990s people a desire to recreate the Elizabeth David ideal of the kitchen as 'the heart and soul of home life.' Or as Alberto Alessi puts it: 'Philips tended to see design as a way of satisying needs, whereas we were inclined to see it as a way of fulfilling dreams. By combining these two approaches . . . we believe we've created the best of both worlds.' The toy-town-meets-Disney aesthetics seem to be part of an attempt to humanise the objects and the companies' statements are spattered with anthropomorphic phrases. The products, they say, 'clearly form a family.' And: 'Clever, 'human' touches in the design provide the products with extra personality which . . . will encourage users to feel more involved in the rituals of food and drink preparation.' All very nice, too. But do they work? Alessi and Philips between them do seem to have gone to immense trouble over function. The citrus press, for instance, works silently and quickly, the glass simply sits beneath the spout which after the juicing is over can be pushed back so that there are no drips. The toaster has a sensor system which means every piece of bread is toasted to the same colour and the slot is able to cope with large, thick slices of bread. The kettle is cordless, boils one litre of water in just over three minutes and has a scale filter. All are made from combinations of polypropylene and stainless steel. Like most artefacts with strong personalities, these will not be to everybody's taste but those who love them will love them dearly. Three of the products (the citrus press and toaster) go on sale today in Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1, Selfridges, John Lewis and many other stores throughout the country, including House of Fraser Stores outside London. The coffee maker will be on sale in January.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is proposing to require single-service towels or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable hand drying devices to ensure that microbiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination does not occur though the repeated use of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towel by several individuals. A hot-air blower is an example of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a suitable hand drying device because contamination from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual to individual is eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection and documentation of the location of hand washing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities be performed at sufficient frequency to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is compliance with &sect;123.10(a)(8)(i). Generally, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure will be necessary only after construction or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant building or process modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor inspect, and document that it has inspected, the hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing and hand sanitizing facilities to ensure that they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly equipped no less than once per day. This procedure will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that cleaning and sanitizing preparations, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towels or hand drying devices, are present whenever needed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10 (a)(9) and (a)(10)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the processor protect the food, food-contact surfaces, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food packaging materials against adulteration by chemical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical contaminants. Such protection is necessary to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the food produced by the processor is safe. The use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxic compounds (e.g., pesticides, cleaning and sanitizing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agents, and lubricants) is frequently necessary in the processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment. For example, lubricants and fuel are necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate equipment. Improper use of these compounds is a frequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cause of product adulteration throughout the food industry (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 74). Thus, it is necessary to ensure that food, food-contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces, and food packaging materials are not contaminated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these toxic compounds. Food and food packaging material should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be protected or removed from areas where pesticides are used, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caustic cleaning compounds should be thoroughly removed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food-contact surfaces before processing begins. Finally, as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional protection, FDA is proposing to require in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.10(a)(10) that toxic compounds be labeled, held, and used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the food is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protected from toxic compounds, and that this inspection be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented. This check should normally be performed before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> start of operations, at a time when the equipment can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively inspected, and in time to prevent adulteration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product. Because processing conditions vary on a day-to-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, FDA has tentatively concluded that daily inspection is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(a)(11) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor ensure that products are not exposed to contaminants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may drip, drain, or be drawn into the food. An example of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a contaminant is condensate, which may form on the ceilings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and equipment in a processing plant. If the condensate forms on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an insanitary surface and then falls on the product, it may carry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with it filth and microbiological contaminants from that surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the food (Ref. 65, pp. 24 and 25).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such contamination is minimized, and that this inspection be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documented. This check should normally be performed during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual operations, at a time when condensate or other such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminating conditions are likely to be present. As explained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the agency has tentatively concluded that daily variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in processing and climatic conditions necessitate daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(a)(12), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processor ensure that compressed gases that contact food or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food-contact surfaces of equipment are filtered or treated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such a way that the food is not contaminated with unapproved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirect food additives or other chemical, physical, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbiological contaminants. Compressed gases can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated with oil from the compressor, filth and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbiological contaminants from the air intake, and rust or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other physical contaminants from the compression, storage, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution equipment. Filtration at the air intake and after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compression, storage, and distribution is an effective means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing the risk of such contaminants entering the food (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 89).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

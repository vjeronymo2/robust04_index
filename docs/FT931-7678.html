			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Management buy-out talks at Caithness Glass MANAGERS of Caithness Glass, the Scottish ornamental glass maker, are negotiating to buy the company from Drambuie, the liqueur company which acquired it in early 1991. That Drambuie, owned by the McKinnon family which founded it, is prepared to shed Caithness is a reversal of its previous, widely publicised strategy of diversifying away from dependence on the after-dinner liqueur. The Caithness acquisition was said at the time to be the first in a series of purchases of Scottish companies making quality products. But no further acquisitions were made and Mr Peter Shakeshaft, the finance and development director who spearheaded the new policy, left in February 1992. Yesterday Mr Alastair Mair, managing director of Caithness Glass, confirmed that an MBO was being negotiated. He did not say who would be backing it. Caithness employs 250 people at factories in Perth, Oban and Wick. Last year it closed its plant at Kings Lynn, Norfolk. It has shed 120 jobs because of recession.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Call for wider regulatory net The sale of savings products such as Tessas, which were seen as alternatives to investment products, should be included in the retail financial services regulatory regime, Mr Jim Stretton, deputy managing director of life insurer Standard Life, said yesterday. He told the Commons Treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation that the rules should cover all products which seemed to be in competition with each other. These included some of the building societies' savings vehicles, which customers saw as quite similar to unit trusts.</p>

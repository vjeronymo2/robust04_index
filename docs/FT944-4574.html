			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Delors attacks Nato plan to expand east Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday strongly criticised US efforts to expand Nato membership into eastern Europe, describing it as a 'dangerous mistake'. 'I think it was a premature initiative which was badly timed,' he said in Brussels, speaking ahead of a two-day summit for EU heads of state in Essen, Germany, which starts tomorrow. Earlier this week, western nations endorsed US-inspired plans for a faster expansion of Nato to include the former Warsaw Pact countries - a move that was welcomed by the countries concerned, but which infuriated Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Mr Delors' attack on the push for early expansion comes amid renewed transatlantic tension over the situation in Bosnia. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, told parliament his government had asked the UN and Nato to intensify planning to withdraw peacekeepers from Bosnia because international mediation efforts there had reached a dead end. His call came as the UN was completing a plan to evacuate up to a third of the 1,200 UN Bangladeshi soldiers billeted in the north-western Moslem enclave of Bihac, which is under Bosnian Serb attack. Mr Delors' misgivings are shared elsewhere in Europe. The UK, for example, has private reservations about the decision to press for early enlargement of Nato. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, told Mr Yeltsin this week that any expansion of Nato would be gradual and balanced. 'If I had had something to say in the matter, I wouldn't have advised the US to advocate enlargement of the Atlantic alliance,' Mr Delors said. He is expected to announce soon whether he will stand for the French presidency, but yesterday only repeated that he had made up his mind on the matter. The Nato expansion strategy has split the allies, angered the Russians and failed to help security in the region, Mr Delors said. It had also complicated matters for the EU in its efforts to bring the countries of east and central Europe into the Union. At the Essen summit, Mr Delors hopes that EU leaders will send a positive signal to the Union's neighbours, but particularly those on its eastern flank - Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia  -whose leaders will meet their EU counterparts on Saturday. A central issue at the Essen summit will be discussion of eastwards expansion, focusing particularly on a paper setting out what needs to be done by the six countries to adjust their economies to those of their western neighbours.

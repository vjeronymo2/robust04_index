			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "111th Meeting of the ESA Council: </F> A Decisive Step Forward for the European Space Endeavour"]    [Text] At its 111th meeting, concluded in Paris on  Tuesday, 15 February 1994, the ESA Council adopted an "Act in  Council" giving the definitive go-ahead for the MSTP (Manned  Space Transportation Programme) and the Columbus Programme.    "These decisions give us, for the next two years, the means  to lay the foundations of the European space programmes for the  year 2000. While taking due account of economic realities and  political developments in Europe and the world, they mark ESA's  commitment to vigorous and coherent pursuit of its ambitions,  both with regard to the environment, science and its  applications and telecommunications, and in the area of launch  systems and manned spaceflight," said Mr. Jean-Marie Luton, ESA  director general. "Furthermore, in proposing general use of the  ECU from 1997, ESA is playing its part in asserting Europe's  identity."    Today's "Act in Council" lays the legal and financial basis  for the MSTP (203 MAU [Million Accounting Units] -- at 1993  economic conditions; exchange rates as at 1 January 1994. 1 AR  = 1 ECU) and Columbus (267 MAU) for the years 1994 and 1995. It  also confirms the establishment of a unified structure for  managing those programmes, which should result in the creation  of a combined programme under the heading "Space Activities  Related to Manned Spaceflight" in March 1994. The combined  programme will comprise a crew transportation vehicle (CTV), an  automatic transfer vehicle (ATV) and a Columbus in-orbit  element, all three to be launched by Ariane-5, as well as  flights in cooperation with the Russians (EUROMIR) and Americans.    The ESA Delegations have thus confirmed their resolve to  participate in the worldwide cooperative effort and in the  negotiations with all the Partners (U.S., Russia, Japan and  Canada) aimed at developing an international space station.    At the 111th meeting, Council also confirmed that: the  Envisat and Polar Platform Earth observation programmes will  similarly be combined under a unified management structure; and  the definition phase of the data relay satellite programme (DRS)  now has the necessary financial cover.    Finally, a number of legal texts and agreements were  approved, including, in particular, the Declaration on FESTIP  (Future European Space Transportation Investigation Programme).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["At the Federation Council: Appeal to the Peoples of </F> Ingushetia and North Ossetia" -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA headline]    [Text] We Federation Council deputies, concerned with the  quest for a peaceful solution to the protracted conflict between  Russians living in the Ingush Republic and the Republic of North  Ossetia, urge the Ossetians, Ingush, and representatives of all  nationalities living in these republics to lay down their  weapons and resolve the problems that have built up over a long  period by peaceful means.    Stop, people! Brothers! Fathers! Men and sons! Give your  land peace! Give your mothers, sisters, and daughters peace!  Give your peoples a chance to be constructive! The mountain  people have always been respected for their wisdom, honesty,  dignity, and tolerance. You have lived side by side and  together found a way out of the most difficult of situations  while respecting one another. Have the mountain people really  lost these qualities today?    We appeal to the women of Ingushetia and North Ossetia.  Mothers! We ask you to hold your sons back from the awful brink  of going on with interethnic war. There have been enough wars  and devastation! There have been enough tears and suffering!  Your land can no longer bear so much pain. It will curse  everyone who sheds people's blood.    We appeal to you, veterans! Esteemed wise veterans! You  traveled the terrible roads of the Great Patriotic War under  fire. You drained the cup of grief. You have learned the wisdom  of life. So stand up straight and bar the way to a war that may  destroy the land of your forebears and annihilate your sons!    We appeal to the clergy, to all believers. God gave all  people the same right to life. And no one has a right to  violate the main commandment in the Koran and the Bible -- do  not kill! Help cool hot heads and calm people's hearts. It is  time to start the work of mutual reconciliation and forgiveness,  remembering that it is not they who are to blame for this  tragedy but the totalitarian Stalinist regime and politicians of  various stamps. It is intolerable for ancient peoples to still  be political hostages. You cannot live in the past. There has  been enough destruction. You must revive and construct your  homeland. And everyone needs peace to do that.    Peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia! We believe in your  wisdom and common sense. We support you in the cause of  reconciliation and construction.    [Signed] Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation  Council deputies    [Dated] Moscow, 17 March 1994    No. 86-1 SF</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Clinton team fixes sights on Medicaid THE Clinton administration is considering phasing out the Medicaid health programme for the poor and integrating the provision of healthcare for low- and middle-income families as part of a series of changes to make the health system fairer and more cost efficient. Speculation that Medicaid might be phased out surfaced yesterday as the White House healthcare reform task force held its first public meeting in Washington, just five weeks before President Bill Clinton is due to send a reform proposal to Congress. The meeting was due to hear evidence from consumers, business, the medical profession, unions, minorities and the health insurance industry. Mr Al Gore, vice-president, pledged at the beginning of a marathon session, scheduled to last 13 hours, that every American would be delivered from the fear of unpayable medical bills. He was standing in for Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, chairwoman of the task force, who was in Arkansas with her sick father. Medicaid was set up by the Johnson administration in 1965 and is financed by state and federal government. The cost of the scheme has escalated sharply in recent years even though it covers only about half of those living below the official poverty line. The New York Times reported yesterday that the task force was considering phasing out Medicaid as a way to end 'segregation of the poor' in a low-quality programme in which access to care was more tightly restricted than for more affluent Americans. The administration was considering introducing several new benefits for the poor, including more generous dental care and transport to surgeries. The reform plan is expected to be based on a variant of 'managed competition'. Leaks in recent weeks suggest the administration wants to group Americans in large regional 'health insurance purchasing co-operatives' that would buy care on behalf of individuals and companies from networks of competing providers in the private sector. The hope is that the HIPCs would have the market power to drive a hard bargain with doctors and hospitals, thus restraining the rate of healthcare inflation. But many prominent Democrats, including Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York state, are lobbying for more direct controls on the price and volume of medical services.</p>

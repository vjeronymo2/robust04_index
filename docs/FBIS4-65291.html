			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tuomo Lappalainen: "Parliament: Foreign Policy </F> Minor Role Performers; International Duties Take Up Increasingly  More of Members of Parliament's Time"]    [Text] The seminar at which Russia's membership on the  Council of Europe was discussed and that brought Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy to Finland also again gave rise to a discussion of  parliament's foreign policy role.    The 10-member delegation of members of parliament  representing Finland on the council hosted the seminar.  Delegation chairman Olli Rehn (Center Party) thought up the idea  of organizing it.    In the course of time the sizable network of groups  occupying  themselves with international affairs in parliament has grown.  At the present time many members of parliament also have foreign  policy duties either on official committees or delegations or in  various friendship groups.    Headed by Pertti Paasio (Social Democrat), the Foreign  Affairs Committee has retained its leading position as a  parliamentary monitor. The changed international situation has,  however, also strengthened the Defense Committee's foreign  policy role. As for that big committee, it is now being turned  into an integration committee that deals with EEA [European  Economic Area] and in future EU [European Union] affairs.    Furthermore, delegations have been separately appointed in  parliament in the EEA and EFTA [European Free Trade Association]  members of parliament committees, the Council of Europe, the  Nordic Council, the CSCE Parliamentary General Assembly, and the  Interparliamentary Union (IPU). The Joint Finnish and European  Parliaments Committee was formed over a year ago to keep track  of the progress of the EU negotiations.    Since last year, Paasio and Kalevi Lamminen (Conservative),  the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Defense  Committee, have been participating as observers at Western  European Union (WEU) members of parliament meetings. Eeva  Kuuskoski has been representing the Finnish parliament in the  North Atlantic Assembly, an organ corresponding to NATO.    Those members of parliament who are most active in terms of  foreign policy simultaneously participate in many of the  committees and delegations: Kimmo Sasi (Conservative) in six of  them and Centrists Sirkka-Liisa Anttila, Juha Korkeaoja, and  Mirjas Ryynanen, as well as Social Democrat Erkki Tuomioja in  five of them. Olli Rehn, Jorn Donner (Swedish People's Party),  and Ilkka Suominen (Conservative), who will be leaving  parliament in May, each head two delegations.    This heightening of parliament's standing in the handling of  foreign affairs is not only a Finnish phenomenon; the same thing  has in fact been happening in many European countries. In  Finland, however, this development has been progressing in a  surprisingly smooth fashion. Members of parliament have avoided  interfering in matters of a sensitive nature without consulting  the Foreign Ministry beforehand. Zhirinovskiy's visit also had  the Foreign Ministry's blessing.    However, a small territorial struggle arose on Arkadianmaki  [parliament location] between the Foreign Affairs Committee  (UAV) and the new delegations. In an unpublished official report  drafted last December, the parliamentary International Affairs  Committee alludes, among other things, to the UAV's desire to  "strengthen the link" between it and the CSCE Members of  Parliament Delegation. The same members of parliament -- and, in  addition, the speaker of parliament -- are currently  representing Finland at CSCE Parliamentary General Assembly  meetings as are on the Council of Europe.  <H5>  Friendship Across Borders </H5>   In parliament there are at present about 30 friendship  groups  with various countries. In addition to the most important  European countries, China, Japan, Cuba, Israel, and Nicaragua,  among others, have acquired their own groups. Most of them were  formed after the mid-1980's. The oldest of them, the  Finland-Korea group, has been active since 1974.    In its report the International Affairs Committee also dealt  with friendship groups. It expressed the opinion that members of  parliament's activities built "on voluntary participation" were  still necessary "because friendship groups enable us to more  closely observe the countries involved, to enter into closer  relations with the embassies of the countries in question, and  to play host in parliament to the delegations arriving from  these countries."    Estonia has the largest friendship group -- over 50 members  of parliament. About 40 members of parliament belong to each  group involving the Arab nations, South Africa, China, and  Hungary.    The groups' political power relations vary considerably. The  entire Christian League parliamentary delegation is in the  Israel group, but only one leftist, Aarno von Bell (Social  Democrat), is. There are as many Left Leaguers in the Cuba group  as members of all the other parties together.    Parliament's backbenchers also get a chance to give vent to  their foreign policy activism in the friendship groups. Pekka  Leppanen (Left League) belongs to 14 groups, Riitta Kamppinen  (Center Party) and veteran Ensio Laine (Left League) to 13, and  Hannu Kemppainen (Center Party) and Eeva-Liisa Moilanen  (Christian League) to 11.    Influential heavyweight members of parliament demonstrate  their friendship much more selectively. Paavo Vayrynen is a  member of only the Albania group and Esko Aho of only the South  Africa group opposed to racial oppression, while Paavo Lipponen  belongs to no group at all.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Sport: Sorry lot of the A Team - Teresa McLean meets the stoical skipper of the England seconds / Cricket THE ENGLAND 'A' Team losing all ends up to Essex on a damp day at Chelmsford is not everyone's idea of fun. But it was interesting, and once it had emerged from the drizzle it proved to be well worthwhile. Partly, I'm afraid, this was because it reminded me how empty and dead English county cricket is, and partly because it reminded me how much at ease Essex always appear when playing at Chelmsford, however empty its tiers of seats and, lest we forget, how much at ease Graham Gooch looks in the teeth of battle. Admittedly, with a first innings lead of only 74 to defend, the A Team bowling amounted to little more than a skirmish, but Gooch batted strongly, especially to good balls. He is never graceful, sometimes tucked up, but almost always hard-hitting. If he captains England this summer he is likely to be level-headed against the Australians who are under the knowing hand of that other Essex stalwart, Allan Border. I hope the England selectors create an attack with some character against Australia by choosing a couple of good spinners, preferably one leg, one off, this summer. Far the most effective bowler at Chelmsford was the Essex off-spinner Peter Such, playing for his county; he took 11 for 124, making England's batting hopefuls look pretty silly in the process. Such toured Australia with the A Team last winter and, as in Chelmsford, so in Canberra 'Screaming Lord Such', as the locals call him, bowled well. Against the Australian Cricket Academy his match figures were 11 for 144. Such, like the nippy rather than fast Andy Caddick, had some good games on tour and came back confident. I went to see A Team captain Martyn Moxon at Chelmsford, when he was still contemplating the misery of his team's batting.   He said he thought there had been some 'writing down' of the A Tour in Australian reports, to devalue it and stop improving players like Such and Caddick getting full benefit from it. One thing the A Team did learn on a tour their hosts never really took seriously was resilience in the face of failures and defeats, uncomfortable distances and disorders, empty grounds, some second-rate opposition and only second-class status for games. Moxon struck me as refreshingly uncomplaining, with traces of old-fashioned enthusiasm yet reluctant to speak unless he had something to say. He is one of a series of nice captains chosen for the England A Teams: Mark Nicholas took the first to Kenya and Zimbabwe in early 1990; Hugh Morris took the next to Pakistan and Sri Lanka and stood in for the injured Moxon in Bermuda and the West Indies in the winter of 1991-92. I asked Moxon whether the A Team players really saw themselves as future England players or whether there was a danger of them becoming has-beens, not-quites and also-rans, strengthened by the presence of Test players such as Jack Russell and himself, but falling short of Ted Dexter's claim at the start of the A Tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka that 'it's about producing future Test cricketers for England.' Misfortune has taught Moxon to look on the bright side. There is no other way to survive as captain of Yorkshire. He gave me a reassuring smile. 'It's every English cricketer's dream to play for England. But if it doesn't happen, it doesn't' I decided perhaps I did not need one of Moxon's patent Tizer mixtures to keep me going after all. Somebody near us in the pavilion bar had just ordered one and Moxon described them, rather alarmingly, as something to really get his benefit year going. He deserves to do well. The winter was a hard one, dogged by the bad luck which seems to blight him whenever his dream comes true and he finds himself picked for his country, whatever the level. He was picked for the 1984 Lord's Test against the West Indies but had to withdraw because of injury and wait until 1986 to make his Test debut. He has played in 10 Test matches, never with his place safe or settled. His highest Test score is 99. Nor have the A tours brought him much better luck. The 1991-92 tour to the Caribbean was demanding and England lost, but Moxon broke his right index finger in a casual game before he had a chance to take part in the fight. He hurt that same finger again in Australia this winter, though it recovered in time for him to score, inter alia, 123 not out in Canberra. It may even be that he was better off with only a limited share in a tour which, like the unfortunate one to Pakistan and Sri Lanka, victim of political unrest in Pakistan, failed to get the top rating it sought. Two A tours have worked and two have not. The A Team idea was built under the sympathetic guidance of Keith Fletcher and has encouraged a host of Test cricketers, such as Mike Atherton, who averaged 83 on the first, gentle trip to Kenya and Zimbabwe. It is the two most ambitious ones, to Pakistan and Australia, that have stayed trapped as second-rate efforts. Perhaps next winter's tour of South Africa will do better, combining tough cricket with good relations. There have always been reserves and youth teams; Moxon himself has played for England, England B and England A in his international career. I am inclined to be sceptical about the notion of an A Team breeding-house for future Test players and cannot help noticing how well the best countries manage without one, but it is worth a try. This last tour was difficult and even the many injured players - Moxon, Graham Lloyd, James Boiling, Mark Ilott, Dominic Cork, Caddick - learnt a lot. Graham Thorpe has now been on all four A tours; he is a stylish left-handed batsman and a fine fielder. Surely it will soon be time for the selectors to give A Team veterans such as him a chance to play a Test.</p>

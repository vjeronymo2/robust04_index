			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from Mashhad, Khorramabad,  Khodabandeh, and Ahar and Haris gave preagenda speeches. Then  the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of  our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  Mohammad Hadi-'Abdkhoda'i, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>   It is the skilled academic work force that is bringing the  nation to a peak of cultural, political and economic authority.    The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was 'Abdkhoda'i, deputy from Mashhad. He offered  condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Javad (peace be upon him).  He said: The Majles is at the end of the First Five-Year Plan  and the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan. There is much to  say about the splendidness of the Islamic revolution and its  power to endure, about the crimes of world imperialism and its  practices, about the cultural invasion and ostentation, about  the economic programs and the mistakes of some of their  planners, about high prices, inflation and ways to keep them  down, about balance between the private and government sectors  and avoiding one-dimensional activity, about controlling prices,  about excessive purchases of goods, about borrowing and its  consequences, and about the need for subsidies to support the  deprived.    He continued: The Second Five-Year Plan must bring the  country as close as possible to independence and nondependence.  It must rely on high production, less consumption, more exports  and fewer imports, and it must anticipate consequences and  problems.    The speaker also discussed higher education programs. He  said: The experts are presenting factors that will help a  country grow and develop such as natural resources, manpower and  proper management, but above all these things one can consider  skilled academic manpower. Even capable management and useful  manpower arise from their ranks.    Continuing, 'Abdkhoda'i said: It is the skilled academic  work  force that is bringing the nation to a peak of cultural,  political and economic authority and makes the best use of  natural resources.    The deputy from Mashhad said that to the extent it is able  the government must invest in manpower training in the Second  Five-Year Plan. He said: In this regard there is need for  several reminders:    1. Manpower training must be done with proper planning based  on needs.    2. The educational centers must definitely place great  emphasis on the quality of education. Today we have little  skilled manpower at the research and doctoral levels compared to  our needs, and in this regard the doctoral programs must be  reinforced both in quality and quantity.    3. The universities must give importance to applied  knowledge  and make knowledge work with ability. Some of our professors are  even more advanced than the foreign professors academically, but  unfortunately there are two shortages. One is that although they  are strong in theory, in the area of practice they are not as  strong, and they also lack the tools for work.    'Abdkhoda'i then said: A short experiment in the year 1372  [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] was hopeful. As the result of  cooperation between the academic institutions and the executive  universities, by the end of the month of Azar [30 December], 453  projects were carried out or were under way. A total of 19.8  billion rials was spent and there was a good return.    The speaker discussed education at the doctoral level. He  said: It was a disaster at our universities that last year in  the nonmedical fields we had only about 1,200 doctoral students  inside the country. In the same regard I must say that one of  the benefits of forming the Ministry of Health was the admission  of more students. In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978]  844 students were admitted, but in the year 1365 [21 March  1986-20 March 1987] the number reached 6,480, almost eight times  as many, and this is considered a source of pride for the  Islamic Republic of Iran. Unfortunately, however, after that the  figures declined, so that in the year 1372 medical student  admissions throughout the country was 3,656, and this figure is  fully evocative.    The deputy from Mashhad discussed the shortage of physicians  in the country and the fact that the number of our physicians is  about one-fifth the number of physicians in some industrial  nations. He said: Why are our professors unable to accept more  students?    At the end of his speech, the deputy from Mashhad discussed  the deprived areas in the Second Five-Year Plan. He said: On the  fringes of the major cities and also in their rural areas we  have places that are living in deprivation, but because they are  close to prosperous areas, they do not receive the benefits of  deprived areas, and their needs must definitely be addressed.  Today one of the important sources of foreign exchange is  tourism, and Mashhad can be the best base for attracting  visitors from all the Islamic nations. However, the government  must invest, and it must see Mashhad as a national city in  relation to all of Iran and an international city in the world  of Islam.  <H5>  Mohammad Saleh-Taheri, Deputy From Khorramabad </H5>   In the last 15 years we have not had a firm and  comprehensive  policy on economic matters.    The next speaker was Taheri, deputy from Khorramabad. In his  speech he said: In the last year we have not had a firm and  comprehensive policy on economic matters. Although the president  of the republic, as the most concerned executive official, has  always worked unceasingly and has not been out of range or  immune to damage from domestic and foreign enemies, God has  always been generous with his boundless help at sensitive times.    He added: The chaotic foreign exchange market; the 7-tuman  competitive rate and the 80-tuman rate for foreign exchange; the  failure to anchor the inflationary rate for the dollar; the  release of contradictory guidelines by the banks themselves;  insubstantial and increasing taxes, which in my view erode the  principle of investment; increases in the rate on bank deposits  to 18.5 percent by the Money and Credit Council, which is very  strongly rumored; the increase in the rate on foreign exchange  for investment in projects without setting priorities; and the  failure to control either the unregulated or the government  prices. [sentence as published]    The deputy from Khorramabad noted: For example, the price of  a kilogram of cucumbers increases from 15 to 150 tumans between  the time it leaves the hands of the producer until it reaches  the consumer of Africa Street. The oil price crisis and the  playing with OPEC that is being done by foreigners and economic  speculators, low prices whenever production is high, low  production whenever prices are high and thousands of other  problems have given our country an ailing economy.    Our people know well that everyone was mobilized during the  war and they were never psychologically shocked in victory or in  defeat under the leadership of the late leader of the  revolution, the fifth anniversary of whose death is approaching,  because the participation of the people and the close  relationship between the leader and the people prevailed over  the problem of the war. Unfortunately, that formula is not  working in the economic situation.    He explained that in his view the people are innocent. He  said: The people do not doubt the sincerity of the officials.  Today economic planning requires a lot of manpower. A handful of  experts, no matter how good, will not solve the problem. Mr.  Hashemi is the guardian of policy, culture, society, and  religion. Economics is another matter.    In my view we need to reconsider the situation. I myself  have  been among the gentlemen for 30 years, with the revolutionaries  both before and after the opening of Mecca. We ourselves still  have not been unable to understand, much less our other people.  Deputies, there is still time, but tomorrow will be too late.  While we still have these honest companions of the Imam, while  we are still under the shadow of the leader and the vice regency  of the chief jurisconsult, who always has the last word, you  must clarify the nation's economic situation. This problem must  be solved.    Taheri discussed the fact that we do not reject work and  service in the country. He said: Work has been done in all the  ministries. These communications and their extensive reach,  fiber optics and copper cable in Yazd, petrochemicals in  Bandar-Emam and thousands of other phenomena are undeniable.  These phenomena should stimulate questions and conversation,  instead of us having interpellation and bringing the country to  a standstill, although interpellation is the clear right of the  deputies and in some cases is a necessary and unavoidable  procedure.    The blessed trip by the president of the republic to the  province of Lorestan, the new political coordination in the  province thanks to his visit, and the documented report from the  province's political official made at the Administrative Council  in the presence of the president of the republic were and are  desired by all the general managers, Friday imams and the  province's contingent of deputies, and the report must be  published in the province.    He added: Among this trip's many blessings was the lighting  of the gas flame at Borujerd and Aligudarz and the ground  breaking for the gas facilities at Khorramabad by the minister  of petroleum. For this purpose 2 billion tumans has been set  aside and allocated. The rightful promise of the petrochemical  units in the province are compensation for the losses to  Lorestan caused by the oppressive construction of the  petrochemical complex in Arak. Continuing, Taheri issued a memo  to the minister of the interior about creating governorates in  Azna, Alshotor, and Poldokhtar. He noted: The main problem in  the country is clarification of the economic situation and its  disrupted state in all its dimensions. The main problem in the  province of Lorestan is unemployment, unemployment and  unemployment.  <H5>  Seyyed Mohammad 'Ali Musavi, Deputy From Khodabandeh </H5>   The Second Five-Year Plan must be designed in such a way  that  the people will be optimistic about the nation's future.    The next speaker was Musavi, deputy from Khodabandeh. During  his speech he offered condolences on the occasion of the  martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him). He  discussed the exalted leader's New Year's message with regard to  the work ethic, social order, and designing the Second Five-Year  Plan. He expressed the hope that the plan will be designed in  such a way that the people will be more optimistic than before  about the nation's future.    The speaker then discussed the report on activities carried  out by the president of the republic with regard to the First  Five-Year Plan. He said: It is hoped that the Majles and the  toiling government will take hopeful steps to stop the bad  effects of inflation and high prices and to reform the nation's  administrative structure, which is already under discussion.    The deputy from Khodabandeh then discussed the various  advances that have been made in the country. He said: In the  year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] 3.79 million tons of  wheat was produced, while 10.8 million tons was produced in the  year 1372. With regard to communications, the results of one  year of activity in communications were equal to 20 years of  communications activity before the revolution.    In conclusion, he said:    1. The minister of petroleum is asked to take note of the  cold climate in the Khodabandeh region and its short season for  laying gas pipes, and he is asked to give attention to the  matter of supplying gas service to this municipality.    2. I ask the minister of roads and transportation to deal  expeditiously with the first section of the road from Qidar to  Bijar, which was abandoned incomplete, while its second section  from Bijar to the east was completed, and also to attend to the  road from Qidar to Kabudarahang, on which work is proceeding  slowly.    3. I asked the minister of agriculture to help his  representative more than before with the procurement of  agricultural implements.  <H5>  Valiollah Ahmadi-Zadsaray, Deputy From Ahar and Haris </H5>   To solve the problems of the people, some thinking must be  done so that they will no longer be subjected to the pressures  of inflation and high prices.    Ahmadi-Zadsaray, deputy from Ahar and Haris, was the final  preagenda speaker. During his speech he offered condolences on  the martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him) and he  commemorated Teacher Week. He said: Now, as the task of studying  the government's Second Five-Year Plan is on the agendas of the  Majles commissions, I ask my respected colleagues to give  attention to the following as they study the plan: In view of  the situation that has developed and is developing in the world  with regard to oil prices, destroying the justification for the  prices, in designing the Second Five-Year Plan measures must be  adopted to deliver the nation from dependence on oil, and the  planners must give great importance to agricultural and  livestock products and their export.    He added: Many studies must be done concerning the creation  of conversion industries and agriculture and animal husbandry,  and we must give priority to the creation of such industries.  The importation of nonessential and decorative goods must be  avoided.    Consideration must be given to the problem of youth  unemployment, especially those who have sacrificed, combatants  and injured war veterans, and more attention must be given to  the creation of employment-creating projects. To solve the  problems of the people, especially the deprived and oppressed  classes of society and the government staff workers, they must  do some thinking and planning so they will no longer be  subjected to the pressures of inflation and high prices.    He expressed thanks for the trip by the minister of energy  and his entourage to the area. He said: During Teacher Week Ahar  witnessed the minister of education and training going among the  people and the teachers. On the auspicious occasion of this  esteemed week, the teacher training building was opened, and I  thank him for that.    I ask the government to allocate industrial and  employment-creating projects in view of the fact that the  necessary potential exists in the municipalities of Ahar and  Haris, and to take effective steps to create employment for the  region's unemployed to bring about economic growth in the region.    I ask the minister of education and training and the  minister  of higher education to start the agricultural college that was  approved years ago, and to construct a building on the donated  land. He also mentioned the shortage of athletic facilities in  his electoral district.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Motion on Procedures for Rendering Obligatory Service for </H5> Graduates in the Judicial Sciences    The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was continued consideration of the report from the first  consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission  concerning the Motion To Spend the Period of Obligatory Service  for Graduates From the Judicial Affairs Colleges in the Nation's  Public Prosecutor's Offices and Judicial Courts, the general  form of which was approved.    It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned motion  states:  "Graduates from the judicial affairs colleges affiliated with  the Ministry of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have  not performed their service as soldiers, provided they commit to  at least five years of service in the judicial power, are exempt  from service under the flag in peacetime."  <H5>  Reasoning of Opponents and Supporters </H5>   To summarize the remarks of the motion's opponents, this  action is discriminatory and is not a good innovation. What is  the difference between law colleges and other universities and  the Ministry of Justice Judicial Sciences College, that the  students in the judicial sciences should be exempt, but not  students from the other colleges? The other government  universities are going to learn that they must say that their  graduates should be exempt from service as soldiers.    Supporters of the motion claim that this action is not  discriminatory, but it is a solution to the nation's judicial  problems. They say if it were discriminatory, we would not  permit students in teacher training colleges to spend their  obligatory military service time as teachers in various regions.    Likewise, with regard to this motion, Dr. Shahrzad, deputy  from Esfahan, issued a warning in accordance with Article 75 of  the Constitution that this motion entails a financial burden and  is a violation of the Constitution.  <H5>  Motion To Elect Members of the Commission To Reclaim the </H5> Wages of Deputies From Dissolved Majleses    The second item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission  concerning the Motion To Elect Members of the Commission To  Reclaim the Wages of Deputies From Dissolved Majleses, the  general form of which was not approved and was rejected.    It is worth mentioning that Article 1 of the motion states:  "The chiefs of the Judicial Affairs Commission and the  Accounting Court and the chief of the Majles Administrative  Organization are designated as members of the commission  mentioned in the Law on Procedures for Collecting the Wages Paid  to Those Who Were Appointed as Deputies between 3/15/1342 [June  5 1963] through 11/22/1357 [11 February 1979], enacted 5/19/1358  [August 10 1979], and the amendment dated 3/25/1359 [15 June  1980]."  <H5>  Iran Joins the Maritime Search and Rescue Convention </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report from the Housing  and Urban Construction Commission concerning the Bill To Add the  Islamic Republic of Iran to the Maritime Search and Rescue  Convention. The aforementioned bill was approved by the Majles.  <H5>  Bill on Employment and Social Facilities for Wounded Veterans </H5>   The next item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Administrative and Employment Affairs  Commission on the Bill on Employment and Social Facilities for  Wounded Veterans of the Islamic Revolution, the general form of  which was approved.    The aforementioned bill's goals include:    (a) creating the necessary conditions to preserve and extend  the spiritual and ongoing presence of wounded veterans in  economic and cultural settings    (b) supporting the aspirations, perpetuating the ideological  and cultural activities of wounded veterans and improving their  individual, family and social circumstances    (j) creating the ability to apply and coordinate the  nation's  administrative and employment regulations with the special  bodily circumstances of wounded war veterans.    Rashidi, the commission's expert, said concerning this bill:  The period allowed for the experimental implementation of this  law, which was approved in the year 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March  1991], has already expired, and the government has presented  this bill to the Majles.    He then added: It is the duty of the government and the  Majles to strive to alleviate the social deficiencies for our  sacrificing wounded war veterans, who have expended their bodies  and souls to preserve and guard the valuable achievements of the  Islamic revolution, and who now have bodily and psychological  defects.  <H5>  Motion To Prohibit the Use of Satellite Antennas </H5>   The Motion To Prohibit the Use of Satellite Antennas (Dish  Antennas) was presented by a number of deputies as a  single-urgency motion. Mr. Nateq-Nuri deemed it advisable to  give priority consideration to this motion and to have it placed  on the Majles agenda as an ordinary motion with priority.    It is worth mentioning in this regard that Mr. Nateq-Nuri  said: This motion does not need an urgency rating, but I ask  that it be given priority.    This motion, whose arrival was announced at the Wednesday  open Majles session (yesterday), emphasis is given to the  prohibition on importing, construction, distribution and use of  the satellite antennas.    The motion states: The Ministry of the Interior is required  to use the police to gather up satellite antennas in the  shortest time possible, through the use of police forces.    The Ministry of the Interior is also required to use any  possible means to prevent the importation, manufacture or  distribution of satellite antennas, and, in the course of  confiscating the aforementioned implements, to turn over the  perpetrators to the competent courts.    In this bill, which was signed by about 20 deputies,  penalties are provided for violators.  <H5>  Views of Engineer Yusefpur Concerning the Motion To Prohibit </H5> Satellite Dishes    Mr. Yusefpur, deputy chief of the Councils Commission and  deputy from Ardel, discussed the Motion To Prohibit Satellite  Dishes with our parliamentary correspondent. He said: Because  satellite dishes are a new phenomenon in our country and because  there is now no law of any kind concerning their use or  prohibition, and because the executive organizations are now  uncertain how to deal with them, a motion was prepared to permit  individuals and organizations who need to use satellite dishes  to perform their duties with authorization from the Ministry of  Islamic Guidance.    He noted: Currently the use of satellite dishes is  prohibited  to all the people except in special cases in most Western and  non-Islamic nations. We must realize that the Western nations  are not willing to tolerate the slightest cultural phenomenon  from us. How can we leave them free to freely spread various  kinds of political and cultural propaganda in our country?    Discussing the important points in this bill, Mr. Yusefpur  said: In this motion the unauthorized use of satellite dishes is  prohibited, importers and producers will be punished, and the  satellite antennas will be collected.    In conclusion he said: Some people believe that the  phenomenon of satellite dishes cannot be physically opposed, but  these people must be told that there is a way to fight any  technical or specialist phenomenon that is produced.</p>

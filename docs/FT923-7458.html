			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television If last week's programme was a good example, Shaking The Heavens is a heartening series about the strengths of old age. Last week a poet, this week a composer: Minna Keal used her pension as a student grant and now, at 83, has become a composer of serious music (7.45 BBC2). There follows the first in a series, Floyd On Spain, (8.30) in which Keith Floyd extends his culinary globe-trotting once again. If he can withstand the blandishments of those who would turn him into another arm-waving, cliche-spouting 'character' and stick to his natural good humour we shall be in for another treat. The star of BBC1's two-part drama Children Of The Dragon (9.30) is, yet again, Bob Peck. The story, we are told, is of 'love and intrigue set in 1989 against the backdrop of the violent political events of Tiananmen Square'. BBC2 begins The John Bull Business (9.40), a series of five documentaries on British business culture, with a programme which features Freddie Laker, the man who took on the big airlines in the 1970s. . . and lost. He and others discuss why in recent years it has been easier to get established in business but also easier to fail.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Water stocks rise on Thames payout: Utility lifts interim dividend 11% after comparable rise in profits to Pounds 151m A surprise increase in the interim payout at Thames Water pushed most stocks in the sector higher yesterday as the market upgraded dividend expectations. Thames kicked off the sector's interim season with an 11 per cent increase in the interim dividend to 8.2p, against expectations of an 8 per cent rise. Water shares rose 2 per cent in a falling market. Thames, however closed  1/2 p down at 531 1/2 p. Analysts said Thames's 'surprisingly generous' action could prompt other water companies to follow suit, assuming it did not spark an adverse political reaction. 'We are expecting companies to show earnings improvement of 10 per cent overall,' said an analyst. 'If the others follow Thames's line they could deliver 10 per cent dividend growth quite easily.' However, the water sector's critics lined up to attack the increase. 'It just confirms customers' views that the original price controls allowed companies and shareholders to benefit more than consumers,' said the National Consumer Council. Thames justified the rise saying it had achieved 11 per cent underlying earnings growth to 36.8p and enjoyed an exceptionally good first half. Pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent to Pounds 151m, excluding last year's Pounds 25m exceptional charge for rationalisation and losses on contracts. Turnover was 6 per cent ahead at Pounds 572m. Sir Robert Clarke, chairman, was confident of a good outcome for the rest of the year, although he would not be drawn on the outlook for the dividend. He warned investors not to expect such a generous dividend under the new pricing regime. 'Life is going to be tougher,' he said. 'To expect increases of 11 per cent would not, perhaps, be sensible.' Thames's non-core international businesses - which had been responsible for the unexpected Pounds 25m charge last year, increased losses from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 6.6m in the first half, excluding last year's charges. Sir Robert stressed that Thames was taking a long-term view on international operations. They were expected to be contributing profits of about Pounds 20m by the turn of the century. The utility business increased profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 176m on turnover up by 5 per cent to Pounds 455m. Operating costs were held and capital investment fell from Pounds 173m to Pounds 139m. Thames also announced the appointment of two new non-executive directors to the board. They are Mr Roger Carr, chief executive of Williams Holdings and Mr Tony Hobson, finance director of Legal &amp; General. Lex, Page 22; Buoying up sector, Page 24</p>

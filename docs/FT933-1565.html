			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Observer: Paying the piper Impoverished east Germans tuned into Norddeutscher Rundfunk radio station yesterday to hear the cheerful tidings that the 46 directors of the Treuhand agency were allegedly earning DM379,000 apiece, just DM51,000 less than Chancellor Helmut Kohl. At DM242,000 with cars and housing thrown in, the 135 heads of department are apparently not exactly on the breadline either. In the popular mind, the agency charged with privatising and restructuring east German industry goes down as the fons et origo of almost every conceivable economic ill in the region. In fact, its officials work incredibly long hours, putting up with all manner of criticism, particularly should they appear to be flogging cheap east German enterprises to their plutocratic western friends. But tell that to the average citizen, let alone the 35 per cent of the labour force that are either without work or on job creation schemes. No doubt relieved that the end of its task is in sight - the agency is due to be wound up some time in the middle of next year - the Treuhand spluttered yesterday how it was 'totally incomprehensible why NDR has released these sorts of figures which are simply not right'.</p>

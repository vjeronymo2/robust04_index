			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPEAN REPORT: </F> "EU/Ukraine: Commission Suggests Agricultural and Nuclear Aid"]    [Text] Having got a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement  with Ukraine under its belt, the European Commission has now  turned to the more urgent task of how to help the former Soviet  republic's farm production and civil nuclear energy systems out  of crisis. EU [European Union] External Economic Relations  Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan went to the Foreign Affairs  Council in Luxembourg on April 18 armed with a "first thoughts"  paper on Ukraine, containing three major proposals. The  Commission will consider the full paper at its April 27 meeting,  then pass it back to the Foreign Affairs Council in May.  <H5>  Options </H5>   "The paper proposes alternatives. These must go to Council  and one cannot be sure they will materialise," an EU source  said. Sir Leon told ministers about U.S. studies calculating a  shortfall in agricultural inputs in Ukraine worth about 120  million U.S. Dollars, and suggested this problem could be  addressed by provision of seeds and fertilizers to Ukraine  either directly or via a loan for purchase of materials.    A second option would be a straight balance of payments loan  to Ukraine, although this would have to be part of an  International Monetary Fund package. The Commission has not put  any figures to these suggestions yet, and officials said  budgetary implications of the ideas would be considered as they  became more concrete.    Option three would be an aid scheme for building nuclear  reactors with modern technology and improving their safety  record. However, this type of assistance would only be granted  on the condition that the Ukrainian authorities bite the bullet  and close down the ill-fated Chernobyl plant, where the world's  worst nuclear accident on April 26, 1986 polluted the  surrounding countryside and large areas of Europe, causing many  deaths and leading to a high incidence of cancer in the Ukraine.  The advantage of this proposal would be that it would finally  close Chernobyl and show EU citizens that their governments were  doing something for their safety, an official said. He admitted  this would cost "very big money," and would have to be  coordinated with the other major donors as the Group of Seven.</p>

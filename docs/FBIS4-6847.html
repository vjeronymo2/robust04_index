			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Outgoing Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, who is virtually certain to become premier later  in the day, repeated suggestions Monday that he may ask Social  Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to join the  new cabinet.    Hata also indicated at a press conference after an  extraordinary cabinet meeting, where the eight-month-old cabinet  of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, that the changes  in the new cabinet will be small to middle-scale.    Hata said that "in general," it is better to have heads of  coalition parties in the cabinet to reflect the parties'  opinions, indicating he may ask Murayama to join the cabinet.  There were six SDP cabinet ministers in the Hosokawa government  but Murayama did not hold any cabinet post.    Hata, who was also deputy premier in the Hosokawa  administration, said that in principle, it is desirable for the  ministers who helped compiled the fiscal 1994 budget bill to  remain in the cabinet and respond to upcoming Diet  interpellations on the budget.    Reviewing his eight-month-long tenure as foreign minister,  Hata said he felt the world expected Japan to speak up more on  the international scene.    Japan could make various proposals on problems such as  population, environment, AIDS, disarmament and arms control, he  said.    Hata also said foreign ministers should not change so often  and that he regrets he was only able to hold the post for eight  months.    He also said Japan should push ahead with deregulation.</p>

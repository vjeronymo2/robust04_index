			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRAY TO SHARE TECHNOLOGY WITH HITACHI  </P> <P> Cray Research Inc. of the United States, the world's largest supercomputer  maker, and Hitachi have agreed to share technology in Cray's first deal with a  Japanese computer maker, according to media reports.  </P> <P> The nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun newspaper, Japan Broadcasting Corp. and  Kyodo News Service, all quoting unidentified "industry sources," said the two  have agreed to exchange supercomputer hardware technology, including circuits  for high-speed analysis of scientific information.  </P> <P> New technology as yet to be patented by either company as well as existing  technology will be shared, the reports said.  </P> <P> Hitachi and Cray officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Kyodo News Service reported that the agreement will enable Hitachi to obtain  technology from Cray, which has more experience than Hitachi in supercomputers,  and will allow Hitachi, which has never sold supercomputers overseas, to step  into the U.S. and European supercomputer markets.  </P> <P> The deal also helps Hitachi avoid patent troubles with the Minneapolis-based  Cray, Asahi reported.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the agreement will give Cray access to Japanese technology and help  it expand sales in Japan by using Hitachi's marketing network, Kyodo said.  </P> <P> The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a daily business newspaper, reported that Hitachi  also made an agreement with Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, to share  technology to produce sophisticated computer workstations.  </P></p>

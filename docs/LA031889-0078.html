			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING / EARL GUSTKEY;  </P> <P> HOLYFIELD-DOKES BOUT GIVES FANS A REASON TO TAKE HEART IN THE SPORT  </P> <P> In a way, it was awful to see. No one, no matter how much they are paid, should  take that many hard blows to the head.  </P> <P> And no one, in any lifetime, should be asked to summon that much courage, that  much heart, short of wartime combat.  </P> <P> But it was a war, last Saturday's heavyweight battle between Evander Holyfield  and Michael Dokes in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Boxing, for all its blemishes and critics, every so often rewards its followers  with something so special it makes it easier to put up with the frequent  mismatches, the phony ratings and the rest of the sport's nonsense.  </P> <P> As a group, boxers aren't eloquent. Few could tell you, for example, why they  possess such courage and so many of us do not.  </P> <P> But neither Holyfield nor Dokes needed to say a thing after they had assaulted  each other for just short of 10 rounds. When Dokes finally went crashing down  in the 10th, he had absolutely nothing left.  </P> <P> You found yourself wondering in the aftermath about the nature of courage  itself -- about how Dokes, 30, could display such heart inside a boxing ring  and yet be so ill-equipped to handle drug addiction, which took 33 months out  of his career.  </P> <P> The 10-round battle between Holyfield and Dokes ranks as the most exciting  heavyweight bout since Larry Holmes beat Ken Norton in 1978. On a list of most  exciting heavyweight fights since the mid-1950s, it makes the top 10. Some  others:  </P> <P> 1955 -- Rocky Marciano-Archie Moore, New York.  </P> <P> 1973 -- Muhammad Ali-Ken Norton II, Los Angeles.  </P> <P> 1974, 1975 -- Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier II and III; New York, Manila.  </P> <P> 1976 -- George Foreman-Ron Lyle, Las Vegas.  </P> <P> 1978 -- Larry Holmes-Ken Norton, Las Vegas.  </P> <P> 1983 -- Michael Dokes-Mike Weaver II, Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Actually, 1989 is already a big year for memorable boxing matches. The Roberto  Duran-Iran Barkley bout in Atlantic City, N.J., last month also makes the  long-remembered list.  </P> <P> After he had lost a decision and his World Boxing Council middleweight  championship to Duran, Barkley said a lot about the primal appeal his sport  holds on so many people when he said of the 37-year-old Duran:  </P> <P> "It was his heart; it just wouldn't go."  </P> <P> Ken Sanders, Holyfield's manager, caught a lot of headlines with his  $25-million, winner-take-all challenge to Mike Tyson after the Dokes fight,  which was his intent, but don't look for it to happen.  </P> <P> Dan Goossen, middleweight champion Michael Nunn's manager, was talking about  the winner-take-all proposition the other day.  </P> <P> "It's absolutely ridiculous," he said.  </P> <P> "Holyfield stands to make an absolute minimum $8 million fighting Tyson. You  don't throw that away. Even if you're convinced your guy will win, what about  if he loses on a cut in the first round?  </P> <P> "Tyson-Holyfield doesn't need a gimmick to make serious money. Remember, Tyson  brings a lot to the table."  </P> <P> Boxing Notes  </P> <P> Derrick Kelly defends his North American Boxing Federation championship against  Derwin Richards Monday at the Forum. . . . Nevada State Athletic Commission  figures show the Tyson-Frank Bruno fight drew 6,167 paid spectators and a live  gate of $3,675,850. The hotel paid $7 million to acquire the fight. . . .

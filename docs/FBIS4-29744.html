			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Mitsubishi Oil Co.  announced Monday [20 June] its subsidiary has discovered a  potentially rich oil field off the southern coast of Vietnam.    The area, spanning 3,370 square kilometers, lies about 80 to  200 km southeast of Ho Chi Minh city near the Bach Ho oil field.    Japan Vietnam Petroleum Co. (JVPC) spudded the well in late  April and started production tests from mid-June at a depth of  more than 3,000 meters.    The company found that more than 10,000 barrels of light  crude oil could be produced daily -- the greatest production on  a test basis in Southeast Asia.    The oil is seen as a high-quality, low-sulfur crude similar  to that of the Bach Ho oil field which produces 130,000 barrels  daily.    JVPC officials said they will hold discussions with the  Vietnamese Government on further development of the area, which  they believe could turn out a huge oil field. The company hopes  to begin commercial production as early as the latter half of  1996.    Several oil companies are continuing exploration along the  southern coast in the hope of tapping abundant oil fields.</p>

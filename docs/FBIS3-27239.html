Policies  related to taxation, import and export trade, customs tariffs,  and the use of foreign capital will be slanted in terms of trade  sector. This was recently decided at an important meeting in  Beijing.    Up to now, the Chinese Government has granted a series of  favorable policies to coastal areas, thus enabling these areas  to become prosperous ahead of others. By benefiting from the  favorable policies, the coastal areas have effected  unprecedented economic growth. In particular, the coastal areas  of Guangdong have achieved enviable economic development as they  have benefited from favorable policies and being adjacent to  Hong Kong.    The new policy decision of the Chinese Government will  terminate the overall policy structure which was favorable to  the coastal areas and resulted in a widening the gap between  different areas, and this is related to the increasing  discontent in society.    In recent years, many people have criticized the practice of  giving more favorable policies to some areas. They pointed out  that during the period of reform and opening up, substantial  economic development in the coastal areas, especially the  coastal areas of Guangdong, was not a result of their own  efforts to a great degree, but was gained at the expense of the  interior's development. The special and favorable policies the  central government adopted for the coastal areas have had some  negative effects.    The manpower and material resources of the interior have  been  continuously flowing to Guangdong and other coastal areas at low  prices. As time goes on, the poor will become poorer while the  rich get richer. As various localities have to hand over  similar amounts of tax revenue and profits to the state, the  coastal areas can keep more funds in their own hands, and this  is extremely unfair. A scholar revealed in an article that, for  a time, funds flowing to Shenzhen accounted for one-third of the  country's total working capital. The slanted policies might  have created a false impression of prosperity, but this was not  something one should be proud of because it was just an abnormal  situation.    In the interior provinces and regions, people, from  government officials to ordinary people, are discontented with  the biased policies favorable to the coastal areas. If such a  situation continues, it will certainly bring about certain  serious social problems nationwide. The termination of the  policy structure favorable to the coastal areas, to a great  degree, is aimed at preventing social unrest rather than meeting  the needs of economic development.    On the other hand, the Chinese Government has also now  decided to stop the practice of giving favorable treatment to  the coastal areas because it fears that some local forces might  strengthen excessively. For example, in the past 10 years or  more of reform and opening, Guangdong's local economic strength  has increased substantially and people there have become rather  arrogant on the basis of their wealth. Their practice of  "making full use of the policies" and "daring to jump red  lights" has also startled people in other parts of the country.  If it is allowed to continue to enjoy favorable policy  treatment, it is doubtful whether the central government will  still be able to control the province effectively. When they  made the favorable policy arrangements, the central authorities  hoped that economic growth in the coastal areas would bring  common development to other areas. Now, in discovering this  tendency to go beyond their control, it is certain that the  first thing they should do is to check such a tendency.    However, the change in the policy structure tilted in favor  of certain areas to a policy structure tilted in favor of  certain industries also shows that the government has become  more mature in guiding economic development. In the vast  territory of China, excessive imbalances between different areas  will inevitably cause great obstructions to economic development  rather than promoting economic development. The improper  industrial structure will eventually cause economic growth to  lack momentum.    In the past, Hong Kong people's investments were mainly  concentrated in Guangdong and other coastal areas, and such  investments yielded handsome returns. This year, China's  economic reform will undergo another major turning point, and  the scope of foreign investment will be extended to commerce,  banking, insurance, and shipping industries, and no restraint  will be imposed on the scale and technological level of foreign  investment projects. The industrial tilt will become a major  characteristic of macroeconomic guidance policies. It can be  said that, this year, in order to achieve better results in  investment in China, Hong Kong investors should first give  consideration to the impact of the guiding policies the Chinese  Government has adopted.</p>

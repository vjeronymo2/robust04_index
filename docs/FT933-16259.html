			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Bank code faces big shake-up THE committee reviewing the code of practice for banks and building societies is to consider changing it. The aim would be to ensure that societies inform investors more clearly of alterations in the level of interest paid on different accounts. The lack of clear notification to investors that their accounts offer lower returns than newer products from the same society has become one of the main sources of complaint by customers. The review committee, set up by clearing banks to discuss changes to the code from next March, is also likely to consider stronger requirements for banks to obtain the free consent of customers before disclosing account data internally. Some banks including Barclays have been criticised for requiring customers to sign clauses consenting to their account details being given to the bank's sales subsidiaries. Sir George Blunden, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England who is heading the review committee, said that he could not prejudge the outcome of discussions, but it was already clear that several aspects of the code would have to be examined over the next few months. Sir George said that initial submissions from interested parties, including consumer groups, had raised a number of concerns. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux last week said that the voluntary code was being ignored by many banks. The committee is reviewing how the voluntary code, signed by the British Bankers Association and the Building Societies Association, has worked since its introduction in March 1992. It was intended as an alternative to legal regulation. The committee's work is backed by banks and societies but some officials believe there could be conflict between the committee and financial services companies if its recommendations proved onerous. Other revisions to the code which the committee is likely to consider include: Banks having to give stronger warnings to business partners - particularly the spouses of small business owners - of the unlimited liability they could incur by giving personal guarantees to underwrite business loans. Banks being required to 'pre-notify' charges to be deducted from customers' current accounts, rather than simply publishing account tariffs. National Westminster introduced such a policy this year. Banks and societies being barred from imposing 'interest on charges' in cases where charges on accounts put customers into overdraft and so attract interest payments. Banks are already barred from making account charges in such cases. Although banks and societies might resist changes which will cost them large sums to implement or disrupt attempts to sell more products to their customers, the committee will be under some pressure to respond to public opinion. The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux last week published its submission to the review committee, which called for banks to observe a statutory code of practice. It said they were ignoring the spirit of the voluntary one.</p>

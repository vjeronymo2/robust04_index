			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Chen Hegao: "International Mediation </F> Impact on S. Africa's Election"]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The international  mediation between the African National Congress (ANC) and the  Inkatha Freedom Party over constitutional difference, which is  due to start tomorrow, will have a great impact on South  Africa's first non-racial election slated for April 26-28.    The ANC accepted Inkatha's proposal for international  mediation on March 3 in an attempt to break the deadlock over  Inkatha's participation in the election process. However,  Inkatha insisted later that the election be postponed if the  mediation starts. Because of Inkatha's precondition the  mediation has delayed.    At the four-way summit among President F.W. de Klerk, ANC  President Nelson Mandela, Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi  and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini last Friday [8 April], the  mediation issue was raised again. Though the problem of the  terms of reference for the mediation was not resolved, the  leaders decided to go ahead with the process.    The government has been lukewarm about the international  mediation, fearing it could reopen a range of already-settled  constitutional issues. But at the summit it agreed to become a  party to the mediations process.    The constitutional differences between the ANC and Inkatha  focused on the autonomy power of regions after the election.  Inkatha favors virtual regional autonomy, while the ANC only  agrees to extension of regional powers.    The differences made Inkatha more determined than ever to  boycott the election process. Inkatha's anti-election campaign  has prompted the political fighting between supporters of the  two organizations. Last month, 552 people died of political  violence in South Africa, of them 310 in Natal-kwaZulu, the  stronghold of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.    The failure of last Friday's summit marked the end of the  road in a long line of efforts to woo Buthelezi into the  transitional process and made the prospect for the successful  conduct of the poll more gloomy.    In such a situation, the beginning of the mediation seems  more crucial for breaking the deadlock before the election in  two weeks' time.    ANC President Mandela said today that he is confident the  international mediation can resolve the deadlock over Inkatha's  participation in the election process.    There are indications here that if the mediation makes  progress in settling part of the constitutional difference,  Inkatha might contest the regional election.    As Inkatha failed to confirm its participation in the  election and submit its candidates before the deadline set by  the independent electoral commission, it has lost the chance to  contest the national election.    But analysts said that Inkatha's participation in provincial  election could help check the wave of political violence and  create conditions favorable to the election.    In an interview with XINHUA yesterday, ANC spokesman Carl  Niehaus said that the ANC welcomes Inkatha's participation in  the election process because it could help stabilize the  political situation before and after the election.    The ANC spokesman said that Friday's follow-up summit among  the four leaders is "really a last attempt" to resolve the Natal  crisis and remove obstacles to the election, but a positive  outcome is unlikely.    Upon his arrival here today, former British Foreign  Secretary  Lord Carrington, one of the seven foreign mediators, declined to  make comment on prospects of the mediation.    He said he and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry  Kissinger  felt honored to have been invited to mediate.    It is reported that the terms of the reference for the  mediation will be determined once the seven mediators arrive.    But ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa today warned  against Inkatha's expectations that the election might be  delayed once the mediation starts.    It is still unknown if Inkatha will stick to its demand for  the postponement of election as a precondition for the  mediation. If so, the mediation could fail to achieve its  objective.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REALISTIC FINANCIAL HELP  </P> <P> Roberto Godinez is a young man with a critical problem. Several weeks ago he  learned that one of his kidneys was not functioning and that the other was on  the verge of shutting down. Without dialysis treatment, or a kidney transplant,  he faced certain death within a matter of weeks, doctors at the UCI Medical  Center, where Godinez was hospitalized, told him.  </P> <P> But Godinez, whose wife is expecting the couple's fourth child, is an  undocumented worker from Mexico. And he has no money or medical insurance.  </P> <P> The UCI Medical Center is a hospital with a critical problem. It is losing  money, the only one of the five state university hospitals doing so. Last  fiscal year the hospital reported an $8.6-million operating loss. This year the  loss may run more than $13 million. Continued losses, in fact, may force the  medical center to stop treating indigent patients or eventually go bankrupt and  close down, one Irvine campus official warned earlier this month.  </P> <P> The two critical problems meet head on daily. People like Godinez need medical  help. But patients like Godinez, who are on Medi-Cal or other public programs  that do not cover the costs of treating indigent patients, exacerbate the  shortage of county, state and federal funds hospitals face.  </P> <P> It is not a problem that affects only the UCI Medical Center. But in Orange  County it is the UCI Medical Center that has borne the brunt of the burden. The  center has only 6% of the total hospital beds in the county. Yet it treats more  than 50% of the county's indigent patients. In fact, about seven out of of  every 10 people it does treat have no private insurance and represent a  financial loss. And the more poor people that are treated, the more money the  medical center loses.  </P> <P> The medical center staff knew that when they admitted Godinez. And they knew  that several days ago when they decided that Godinez would get the expensive  dialysis treatment that he needs to survive, and maybe even a kidney  transplant. Godinez is a greater financial risk than usual because there is a  chance that even the under-funded Medi-Cal program will stop paying in a few  months because of his undocumented status.  </P> <P> But doctors and hospital administrators had their priorities straight and put  no price tag on the value of human life. The county and state must do no less  in providing realistic financial support to the health-care system. There are  too many people facing death and needless disability to do otherwise.  </P></p>

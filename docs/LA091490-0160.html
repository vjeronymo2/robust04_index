			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FESTIVAL '90;  </P> <P> PIANIST LOOKS FOR CLEAN START;  </P> <P> MUSIC: AVANT-GARDE PERFORMER SANDRA TSING LOH COMPOSES A SYMPHONIC SCORE FOR  DRIVERS AT A SANTA MONICA CARWASH.  </P> <P> Classically trained pianist Sandra Tsing Loh wants to be taken as a serious  musician even though her Open Festival event Saturday, "Music at the Bonus  Carwash," may do little to dispel her reputation for staging amusing  avant-garde musical performances.  </P> <P> The former Caltech physics major and USC English literature graduate student  whose '87 Fringe Festival concert over the Harbor Freeway became the butt of  Johnny Carson's "Tonight Show" monologue has composed a five-minute symphonic  work that's said to combine eerie "Twilight Zone" sounds with Gershwinlike  passages to accompany the wash, rinse and dry processes.  </P> <P> "Some people will think it's funny, brilliant or silly," Loh said. "What's  important is that people respond, show up and it becomes a topic of  conversation."  </P> <P> Loh, 28, expects 40 participants between 6 and 8 p.m. to pay $15 to sit in  their cars while listening to her audiocassette. Ten people have made  reservations; 40 will cover her $300 costs for the event and the carwash on  Lincoln Boulevard in Santa Monica cannot accommodate more cars in the two-hour  period.  </P> <P> After 1988's "Self-Promotion" concert when she showered her audience with 1,000  $1 bills and last year's "Night of the Grunion" performance with the Topanga  Symphony in Malibu -- complete with spawning fish -- Loh feels it's time to  strive for critical recognition. Her first solo album, "Pianovision," produced  by jazz musician Buell Neidlinger, is set for a fall release.  </P> <P> "I've always wanted to create a big image that people will remember for the  rest of their lives, a surrealistic dream people will walk away from and say,  'I can't believe somebody did this,' " Loh said. "But with the album, my music  is appraised on its own merits, not because there's money flying in the air or  fish in the sand. It'll have to stand on its own."  </P> <P> Loh's comedic musical monologue on American movie musicals was well received at  Theatre/Theater in July and she has performed at local clubs.  </P> <P> And Loh is working on next year's project: "Sigalert," a participatory traffic  jam on an abandoned freeway that climaxes with a staged five-car collision.  </P></p>

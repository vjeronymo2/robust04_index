			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Birt admits BBC's share of funding will fall THE BBC has reconciled itself to attracting a third of the radio and television audience and winning about a third of broadcasting funding as commercial broadcasting expands, Mr John Birt, who will become director-general next month, said yesterday. Launching the BBC's vision of its future, Mr Birt denied he was planning an orderly retreat for the corporation. It was simply a realistic assessment of what was likely to happen, and there was no point trying 'Canute-like' to hold back the tide of competition or plunging downmarket in pursuit of ratings. 'The average British household will still watch or listen to BBC services for something like 24 hours a week,' Mr Birt said. The BBC at present has between 42 per cent and 45 per cent of audiences. 'The BBC in the late 90s will continue to be a significant and positive force in everyday life in Britain,' he said. Flanked by Sir Michael Checkland, the departing director-general, and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman, Mr Birt yesterday outlined the BBC's view of its future. The document argues that a single integrated corporation should survive and provide all its present services, funded almost entirely by a universal licence fee. The main changes will be in the type of programme offered, the efficiency with which they are made and the corporation's accountability to the audience in everything it does. Because all households pay the licence fee the BBC will continue to serve all groups and work in all programme areas. But increasingly it will seek to complement commercially funded broadcasting by providing services which will be put under pressure or not provided elsewhere in a more competitive broadcast market. The BBC, Mr Birt said, would stick to its traditional task of providing a rich mix of programmes which entertain, educate and inform, but 'in ways which press forward; which break new ground; which pioneer; which innovate and challenge the audience; which are marked by intelligence, invention and wit; which strive for quality and excellence'. The BBC would move away from making or transmitting programmes of the kind provided abundantly elsewhere or making programmes which are derivative or imitative. Mr Birt said that 'significant sums' would be released for programmes from the review of overheads and the initiative giving BBC producers the right to buy services in the outside market. In future the BBC will set itself four roles to complement the commercial sector: Providing comprehensive and impartial news and information across a range of broadcasting outlets, with serious information programmes staying in prime-time slots. Supporting and stimulating the development and expression of British culture and entertainment. Guaranteeing the provision of programming and services that create opportunities for education. Stimulating the communication of cultures and ideas between Britain and abroad. BBC1 will be the main national network television channel delivering programmes to a wide audience, while BBC2 should be more innovative, addressing different audience groups. Radio 1 and Radio 2 would survive, but the BBC would develop 'distinctive and innovative services', he said. There is a commitment to the BBC orchestras but there will be discussion of 'ways in which they can play a full part in the national pattern of orchestral funding and provision'. The BBC also plans to be more accountable to its audience both with the value for money that it provides and on dealing with complaints. A well-defined framework of objectives and performance indicators will be created, against which management will be held accountable. It will involve much more detailed research on who is watching what and how appreciative the audiences are. A further document is expected soon setting out a more clear division of responsibilities between the BBC governors and the board of management. Mr Birt promised that the future BBC would be a 'lean, efficient, enterprising, unbureaucratic BBC,' dedicated to quality and focused firmly on programme creativity and innovation. With the publication of the document - the product of more than 15 internal committees - the debate on the renewal of the BBC's royal charter which runs out at the end of 1996 is officially under way.

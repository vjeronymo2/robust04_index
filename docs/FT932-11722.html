			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Letter: Financial strength of with-profit companies Sir, You recently quoted my remarks on with-profits business in the life insurance industry ('Mutual sacrifice puts new thinking into boardrooms', April 21). I would like to set these remarks in the wider context of the benefits of with-profit life assurance, namely the smoothing of investment returns. It is inherent in with-profits business that the policy holder enjoys a smoothed investment return. During a period of rising investment returns, smoothing will entail distribution of less than the assets that have been earned and hence a strengthening of the free reserve position. Conversely, in a period of falling investment returns, the time lag of the smoothing process will lead to companies distributing more in assets than they have been earning on investments. While this excess will be paid for out of free reserves, our research indicates that the average cost of paying this excess in 1991 amounted to around only one half of one per cent of the total funds. We do not believe this has had a significant effect on the financial strength of with-profit companies.

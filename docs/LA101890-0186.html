			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO;  </P> <P> ANNEXATION HEARING SET  </P> <P> A special meeting will be held tonight at 7 at Huntington Junior High School to  hear comments from San Marino residents regarding the growing number of county  residents outside the city's borders seeking annexation.  </P> <P> Two groups have formally applied for annexation, and city officials expect a  third to do so.  </P> <P> Thanos Trezos, president of the Sunnyslope Land Owners Assn., said last week  that an annexation petition is circulating among residents of his area. The  petition must be signed by at least 5% of the registered voters who live in the  area. The association represents people who live outside the city's eastern  border but within its school district limits.  </P> <P> Trezos contends that since children in his neighborhood already attend San  Marino schools, the city's borders should be extended to include the area.  </P> <P> The other two groups, made up of residents of the San Pasquale island, an  unincorporated county area on the city's northern border, are not within the  school district. Spokesmen for the groups said they have petitioned for  annexation because they want their children to attend San Marino schools.  </P></p>

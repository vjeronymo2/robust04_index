			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The government decided to  lift all financial restrictions on the Hyundai Business Group  Thursday, one day after President Kim Yong-sam's pronouncement  that no businessmen should suffer from factors unrelated to the  economy, according to government sources.    The government decided to allow Hyundai to issue Deposit  Receipts (DR) abroad and to receive loans for the expansion of  production facilities from the Korea Development Bank (KDB) as  soon as possible, the sources said.    The government had already accepted applications Tuesday  from  three Hyundai subsidiaries -- Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai  Housing and Industrial Development and Hyundai Elevator -- for  registration on the over-the-counter (OTC) market.    Five Hyundai subsidiaries, including Hyundai Merchant  Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development, that have already  applied for OTC registration will be treated the same as other  firms if they seek listing on the stock market, said the sources.    Hyundai will be allowed to float deposit receipts abroad  during the fourth quarter because the Korea Securities Dealers'  Association has already given the go-ahead to companies issuing  DRs in the third quarter, they said.    Hyundai will also be entitled to receive KDB loans during  the  year because the KDB accepts loan applications at any time, they  said.    President Kim had announced at a meeting of businessmen  Wednesday that no business should be subjected to favors or  disadvantages for political reasons, hinting at the lifting of  all restrictions on Hyundai.    Hyundai has reportedly faced great difficulty in proceeding  with various projects after the government imposed financial  sanctions on the nation's largest business group in the  aftermath of honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong's run for the  presidency in the 1992 election.</p>

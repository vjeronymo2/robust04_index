As the president  of the Soviet parliament until 1991, for many years he was the  most powerful man in the USSR, after Gorbachev. Arrested and  imprisoned as one of the promoters of the failed coup against  perestroyka, he suddenly seemed a finished man, destined to end  his days in jail. However, after having been released on  parole, last December he was elected deputy for the Smolensk  uninominal constituency ("supported by 102,000 voters," he  emphasized proudly), in the most democratic elections in  Russia's history. He represents a unique case worldwide, worthy  of the Guinness book of records: a defendant who, in his  capacity as deputy, voted in favor of his own amnesty, and thus  pardoned himself. In this interview with LA REPUBBLICA, this  resilient "great old man" explained the Duma's sensational  decision.    [Franceschini] Was the amnesty a way of challenging the  president?    [Lukyanov] No. It was a legitimate step, a proposal aiming  at peaceful coexistence, so that we stop treating each other  like enemies.    [Franceschini] But an amnesty is a "pardon": By accepting  it, are you not in fact acknowledging your guilt as regards  involvement in the 1991 coup?    [Lukyanov] Not at all. The amnesty provides for the  suspension of the proceedings. It does not bring in a verdict  of guilt. I never admitted being guilty, and I certainly will  not do so now.    [Franceschini] You are known as an eminent jurist. Is this  amnesty -- which pardons at the same time those who were  persecuted for ideological offenses and those who fired their  weapons and killed people during last October's insurrection --  not abhorrent to you?    [Lukyanov] If, among the rebel parliament's defenders, those  who fired should be prosecuted, then those who fired on  parliament should also be prosecuted -- those who opened fire  first, and those who ordered the White House to be shelled. The  authors of that attack were never prosecuted, so it is only  natural that those who were on the other side should also be  pardoned.    [Franceschini] Has the Duma permanently given up conducting  an enquiry into last October's violent incidents, in exchange  for the amnesty? Will you no longer attempt to prosecute  Yeltsin?    [Lukyanov] We would have been forced to give up sooner or  later, anyway, because the government was not providing us with  any of the necessary evidence for an enquiry. However, even  without our contribution, some day public opinion will demand  that this matter be cleared up. The country wants to know the  truth.    [Franceschini] Do you think Yeltsin will try to block the  amnesty at the very last minute?    [Lukyanov] If he does so, he would be smothering the  new-born  constitution. The Duma has acted lawfully. A reasonable  politician will not take such a step. He does not enjoy enough  popular support to afford doing that kind of thing.    [Franceschini] Does this mean, then, that the struggle  between the president and parliament has come to an end?    [Lukyanov] Can the struggle come to an end if the government  does not change its policy? No, it cannot. Because of such a  policy, social inequality has reached unprecedented levels in  Russia. If Yeltsin does not change his policy, the struggle  will flare up again even more forcefully.    [Franceschini] Do you not think that Yeltsin has already  changed his policy, by making the radical reformers leave the  government, and slowing down the pace of reform?    [Lukyanov] It is too late. He should have done so two years  ago. I hope that common sense will prevail now. If Yeltsin  defends the state's heritage, if he safeguards the most basic  human rights, if he seriously combats crime, and protects our  country's -- rather than some other country's -- interests in  the international arena, then we will support him.    [Franceschini] Once he is free, will former Vice President  Rutskoy become the head of the opposition?    [Lukyanov] Rutskoy is jointly responsible for a large part  of  Yeltsin's policies, starting from the liquidation of the USSR.  His former political prisoner's halo will not be enough to  enable him to become the country's new leader.    [Franceschini] Gorbachev has expressed concern over the  amnesty.    [Lukyanov] Gorbachev should be happy that he will not have  to  testify in our trial. Thus he will not risk ending up on the  defendants' bench rather than staying among the witnesses.    [Franceschini] Do you consider yourself a communist? Would  you like to restore the dictatorship of the proletariat?    [Lukyanov] We cannot go back, dictatorship will never again  be possible. Despite the fact that today we are living under an  authoritarian, Bonapartist regime, with all the power  concentrated in the president's hands, democracy is a conquest  that no one can take back from us. Within the Duma, I am not  part of the communist group, but the communists call me the  parliament's Deng Xiao Ping. Said by them, I regard it as a  compliment.    [Franceschini] While you were in prison you wrote poetry.  Are you still writing any or did your inspiration dry out?    [Lukyanov] I am still writing. However, in prison I wrote  200 poems, but I have only written 30 as a free man. "Outside"  there is no time to reflect. Who knows, perhaps I would be  happier "inside."</p>

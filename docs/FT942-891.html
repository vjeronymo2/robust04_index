			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / International Company News: PosGold cleared to buy stake in Boddington mine The West Australian Supreme Court has cleared the way for Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Posiedon group, to purchase a 40 per cent stake in the Boddington gold mine from Reynolds Metals. The court dismissed a claim by Newcrest Mining, which has a 20 per cent interest in the West Australian mine, that it had certain pre-emptive rights over the sale of interests in the joint venture. However, Newcrest is seeking a stay of proceedings 'pending consideration of the grounds for any appeal'. That was duly attacked by PosGold, which is therefore unable to complete the deal and said it was 'disappointed at the prospect of further delay and expense'. The Reynolds/PosGold deal - which involves payment of USDollars 116m plus delivery of 30,000 ounces of gold over seven years - had originally been due to close in March. The ruling, if it is upheld, may facilitate Shell Australia's planned sale of its metals interests, which include 37.5 per cent of the Boddington mine.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The United States today officially recognized  the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYRM] and said it  will establish full diplomatic relations with it. A statement  issued by the White House notes that the decision was made in  recognition of the democratic expression by FYROM of the duty to  establish a sovereign and independent state based on democratic  principles. The full recognition was announced today but full  diplomatic relations will be established when Skopje gives  assurances that it will cooperate constructively for the  settlement of its dispute with Greece, a U.S. ally for many  years, as the statement points out. [passage omitted]    Skopje President Kiro Gligorov, who constantly refers to his  country as the Republic of Macedonia, said that its independence  and stability are a prerequisite for peace and stability in the  Balkans. He also noted that good-neighborliness is a vital  interest of his country and that Skopje is prepared to begin  immediately to negotiate with Greece within the UN framework in  goodwill and a desire for mutual understanding and respect for  mutual interests. He also said that his country respects the  territorial integrity and borders of Greece and of all the  neighboring countries.    In Athens, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou tonight  received  U.S. Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles, who conveyed to him an  official invitation from President Bill Clinton to visit the  United States in April.    On the U.S. recognition of Skopje, government spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos made the following statement: The Greek  Government expresses its discontent at the U.S. decision to  recognize Skopje. This development is certainly not pleasant for  Greece. It is a wrong move by the United States. However, it  is a significant fact that the United States is specifically  reserved about diplomatic relations with Skopje and links it  with conditions that refer to Skopje's hostile propaganda  against Greece and to a respect for human rights. [passage  omitted]    There has also been strong reaction by the opposition. New  Democracy chairman Miltiadhis Evert described the U.S. decision  as a bad option and added that the Greek Government was taken by  surprise and was confused.</p>

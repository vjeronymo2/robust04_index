			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Deadlocked in a costly embrace: In the wake of this week's bombing raids on Iraq, Roger Matthews explains why the west's continued confrontation with Saddam Hussein is fraught with risk Few recent international tragedies have become so rigidly and hopelessly institutionalised as the one being inflicted on the people of Iraq. Wednesday's raid by allied aircraft on the south of the country serves principally to confirm the extent to which President Saddam Hussein on one hand, and the US, Britain and France on the other, are locked into positions from which there is no retreat and equally little sign of advance. The political career of Saddam Hussein since he fully assumed the leadership of Iraq in 1979 has been characterised by military conflict and relentlessly narrowing options. For all but four years since then Iraq has lived on a virtual war footing. The survival of the regime became, during the eight-year war with Iran and in the wake of of the crushing defeat in Kuwait, the only rationale of government. Saddam's behaviour might appear less irrational to western governments if it was better understood that domestic repression and external threats are the sole remaining pillars of his authority. He came to power imbued with dreams of Arab leadership as Egypt was abdicating that role by making peace with Israel. He tried to live out the dream by attacking Iran and later Kuwait. Both adventures were disasters for Iraq, but the flag he raised of Arab defiance to Persian and western ambitions, flutters still, albeit raggedly. Having marched down this road so consistently and for so long Saddam has no alternative but to continue. The effectiveness of sanctions offers him no possibility of improving living conditions for the bulk of the population. The generous compensation given to the families of soldiers killed in war has long since ceased. Inflation is rampant, medical and food shortages are worsening. It is possible that the tolerance of the Iraqi people will finally snap or an assassin will put an end to Saddam. But in the absence of such unpredictable acts the western allies are faced with an open-ended policy of containment and with it longer-term risks for the overall stability of the region. The Iraqi regime is bound to remain defiant because domestically it cannot risk appearing anything less. It may for a while appear to accept the implementation of United Nations resolutions, such as the return of weapons inspectors to Baghdad and the removal of missiles systems from the exclusion zone north of the 36th parallel and south of the 32nd. But the very nature of the allied response on Wednesday to his repeated provocations will almost certainly tempt Saddam to probe again within weeks or months. The fact that Saddam virtually invited the allies to attack showed that he thought himself to be in a no-lose situation. The limited allied raid inflicted little damage on the regime, enabled Saddam to appear on television heroically claiming victory against overwhelming odds, and rattled the dovecots of those Arab regimes which might be vulnerable domestically to a close association with the US. It will have been with some satisfaction that Baghdad heard Mr Sharif Zeid Bin Shaker, the prime minister of Jordan, say his government had received with 'deep regret and reprehension' the news of the air strikes. Arabs and Moslems felt a growing anger, he said, over the double standards in enforcing Security Council resolutions. While the allies attacked Iraq they were not willing to do anything about the defiance to the UN shown by Israel and Serbia. Egypt, Turkey and Syria, all vital components of the allied Gulf war alliance, expressed similar sentiments. And, with the exception of Kuwait, there is anxiety among the monarchies of the Gulf about the consequences of further attacks on Iraq. It seems probable that the limited nature of Wednesday's air attacks were in part designed to accommodate those fears. Some Pentagon officials had indicated privately that the raids were going to be massive and widespread, an option that existed and one, which if carried out, would certainly have had a more damaging political impact on the Baghdad regime. When further provocations come from Iraq in defiance of Security Council resolutions there will be a temptation for the allies to increase the dosage of the medicine that they have prescribed and with equally little assurance of short-term beneficial effects. But there is the risk of two, worsening, long-term side effects. The first is the eventual disintegration of the country as a single, governable political entity. The two no-fly zones have already given the Kurds a degree of autonomy in the north, and the Shia the beginnings of a regional identity in the south. Even if Saddam goes, the structures of the ruling Ba'ath party would be hard to dismantle and its officials would be still wedded to the concept of a single Iraq governed by the Sunni minority in the geographical centre of the country. The greater the suffering imposed on the people of Iraq, the greater the probable retribution which will eventually flow, and the higher the risk of Iraq one day descending into the sort of political chaos witnessed in Lebanon. Second, and even more difficult to assess, is the impact that the west's renewed military operations against Iraq will have on the peoples and governments of the Middle East. There has been no more durable tightrope walker for the past three decades than King Hussein of Jordan, and the reaction of the government in Amman shows which way he is leaning. Elsewhere, the collapse of pan-Arabism, the now unchallenged military supremacy of Israel, the continued denial of Palestinian self-rule and the general sense of political drift have created a vacuum that Islamic fundamentalists, inspired by Iran, are striving to fill. The perception that the US, Britain and France will do nothing to aid the Moslems of Bosnia or the Palestinians forced out of the occupied territories, while they determinedly bomb Iraq, is potent propaganda. 'Why just Iraq?' was the question being asked in several Arab capitals yesterday. Whatever the western answer it will not diminish the unease of those governments, such as Saudi Arabia, which are unable to distance themselves from the allied action. From the day last August when the government in Riyadh reluctantly permitted the return of allied aircraft to police the southern no-fly zone, it had to accept a close association with policies and actions that might be deeply unpopular among Moslems throughout the world. At the same time it was aware that the weaker that Iraq became the greater was the potential influence of Iran, which has made little attempt to disguise its contempt for the Saudi monarchy since the 1979 revolution. In the long historical rivalry between Iran and Iraq, one's misfortune has always been the other's success. There are signs of growing concern in Washington about Iranian ambitions, nuclear and political. However much these may be denied by the more pragmatic elements of the leadership in Tehran, it is probable that the presence and actions of American forces in the Gulf will most aid those who wish to give greater substance to Washington's suspicions. Awareness of all these risks is not, however, likely to have more than a tactical impact on the allies' pursuit of Saddam Hussein and their determination that he should abide strictly by the terms of UN resolutions. The commitment to the no-fly zones is open-ended while the dispatch of American troops to Kuwait ties Washington more closely to the survival of a government which enjoys little international respect and is subject to persistent domestic criticism. In such a situation, where the only western response to further Iraqi provocation is military, it is almost inevitable that the allies lose control, if not sight, of the political repercussions. That is the cost which will have to be borne from a confrontation in which Saddam Hussein, perhaps desperate and his options bared to the bone, continues to dictate the direction and pace of events.</p>

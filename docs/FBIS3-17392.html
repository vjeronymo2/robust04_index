Anenkova; place and date not given: "The Lessons of History Are  Always Costly"]    [Text] [Anenkova] Leonid Ivanovich, you have been  nominated candidate for deputy of the Supreme Council from the  Communist Party of Crimea, which you head. The attitude toward  the Communists among the electorate is, as far as we know,  ambiguous: from unreserved solidarity to categorical rejection.  Would it not have been safer, knowing the situation, to have run  as an independent candidate?    [Grach] What have I to hide? Yes, I am one of the few  politicians who in the period since the putsch has not changed  colors and who has not betrayed his ideals, for which I have  endured incredible moral terror unleashed in the news media.  Many of my former party associates were afraid even to visit me  in the hospital, for fear of sullying their new, "democratic,"  reputation. More important to me, though, than any portfolios (I  could have had as many as I wanted) is my reputation as a  person. It was for this reason necessary to negotiate all the  anathemas. Life, as the song goes, does not end tomorrow: It  will sort everything out itself. The people very quickly sensed  for themselves what life was like under the Communists and the  sort of troubles they are swallowing under the so-called  democrats. On the one hand it is unique, on the other, entirely  natural, that at the time of the presidential elections the  Communist Party underwent a kind of registration among the  people and was reborn, considering all the objective and  subjective realities and fabricated stereotypes of its dismal  perception--this was a very good result. For this reason,  today's recognition by thousands upon thousands of nonparty  people is for me extraordinarily valuable and important. When  people say that this is not a great number of votes, they sin  against objectivity: It is sufficient to recall how the entire  machinery of state--from the Supreme Soviet, Council of  Ministers, and chairmen of the city and rayon soviets through  enterprise managers--together with many political forces were  literally bent on destroying me. No candidate was subjected to  such pressure as Grach. The party absorbed the first assault in  my person and after that test acquired, it should be noted,  moral fortitude and stood up straight on its own two feet.    Let us not deceive ourselves and admit honestly that the  sole  actual party that we have today is the Communist Party. It alone  has a scientifically substantiated program of the building of a  socially just society, experience of state administration, and a  reserve of skilled managerial personnel, another school for the  training of those we simply do not have.    And, most importantly, our party slate includes  authoritative, decent, highly professional people. Among these  are Yu.I. Bogatikov, people's artist of the USSR; A.M. Kalinin,  admiral and former commander of the Black Sea Fleet; A.M.  Rasnitsov, hero of the Soviet Union; and many other  representatives of various professions, cities and rayons, and  nationalities.    [Anenkova] What do you see as the solutions to the impasse,  and why, in your opinion, have we for so long been wandering  around in the dark?    [Grach] First let us look at the state of prostration in  which we have found ourselves. We have taken the past away from  ourselves. We have not created a present. And we are not in a  position to imagine the future, even in the form of a vision.  Reform presupposes a change in the system of life and activity  with the simultaneous reproduction of the actual  framework-principle of this life.    We are today instead experiencing a typical  pseudo-morphosis,  that is, a chimera. One of its most important signs is the  "mystery" of the rules of the so-called "reform," more  precisely, redistribution, of property, which is being  undertaken on the sly, under the table. The mechanism of this  operation is not being made public deliberately in order that it  might be possible to concentrate all the benefits in the hands  of the "reformers." According to the laws of the civilized  world, if it does, indeed, resolve to divide itself into two  classes--rich and healthy on the one hand and poor and sick on  the other--three basic conditions are observed. First, national  principles of the implementation of the reform--the "rules of  the game" by which the new society shall be built--are  announced; second, the equality of the "initial" rights of all  categories of society in this "game," precluding any advantages,  is recognized; and, third, labor efforts and sharpness of  intellect ensuring competition are deemed to be the basis for  stratification.    In our situation, however, the powers that be are beyond  competition: They want to get into both capitalism and paradise  by pulling strings. Even the socialism-capitalism concepts,  which are counterposed to one another like unambiguous  antipodes, have not been conceptualized.    Is there a way out of the gapping chasm? I am profoundly  convinced--such that in my conviction I am like a fanatic, a  zealous believer--that until we find a solution to the  socioeconomic impasse, there is no nor will there be any way  out. Paradise will never be built in Crimea by itself, inasmuch  as there are laws of systemic order and interdependence which  exist regardless of the wishes of politicians. I am sure that it  will not be even six months before everyone is saying the same  things as myself and that the restoration of a unified state  based on common borders, customs, financial system, and monetary  units will ultimately be the inevitable reality. A special  historical role has been prepared for Crimea, however, in the  unification process--the motivating factor of integration in an  economic union with Russia, Ukraine, Belorusia [Belarus], and  other republics. Such, in brief, are the strategic tasks.    [Anenkova] Is it possible to mitigate the fate of the "poor  and sick," as you put it, in emergency fashion? After all, while  politicians are seeking their formulas, needy Crimeans are  literally  dying.    [Grach] Stabilization of Crimeans' living standard within  the  framework of today's possibilities is the Communists' paramount  task. We intend to seek to ensure that the Supreme Council pass  a law on the creation of a state system of social protection of  the populace in accordance with the principle of the controlled  conformity of wages, pensions, and grants to the actual  subsistence minimum. We will demand of the executive the  implementation of specific measures aimed at combating  unemployment and creating new jobs, introducing government  subsidies fixing the price of bread and milk, and ensuring free  health care and education, higher included, and the  accessibility of children's establishments to each family and  other social safeguards, which must be observed as the holy of  holies. We feel particularly for the children, who have been  deprived of the legitimate right of harmonious development: They  have been thrown out onto the street and into basements and have  been forced to criminally acquire the wherewithal to live. We  are duty-bound to defend our women. We are in irredeemable debt  to our old people, who as gratitude for lives given to the  state, have been condemned to stand cap in hand at the church  porch.    [Anenkova] On what basis do you plan the restoration of  Crimea's economy?    [Grach] The economic basis should, in our opinion, be a  multistructured economy with the retention of the leading role  of public property and state regulation. It is state regulation  that should ensure the extrication of the national economy from  the severe economic crisis, and the multistructured economy is  the way of achieving the social harmony that we so much need on  the basis of a concurrence of interests of the broadest strata  of society: from the worker and employee through the  entrepreneur. For the purpose of stimulation of the producer of  any form of property (private included), we will seek a  fundamental change in financial policy in the direction of  privileged taxation and lending with a simultaneous expansion of  the tax and investment field, the establishment of government  subsidies for agriculture, and the removal of the "price  cutters" in respect to agricultural and industrial products and  will contribute in every possible way to the development of both  the kolkhozes and sovkhozes and tenant and private farms.    [Anenkova] What is your attitude toward property?    [Grach] Only those who are filling their pockets with  dishonest money may fear the program of the Communists: We will  conduct a relentless struggle against crime, corruption, and  profiteering, creating all the conditions for the  producer-proprietor to thrive. The sole area where private  property is unacceptable is land, the basic wealth of Crimea,  which must belong to all the people. Land may be leased,  indefinitely included, and may be inherited, but may not be  bought and sold. Otherwise, we would face the threat of becoming  on our native peninsula not only "emigres" but also colonized  slaves. There are already such trends on the territory of the  former Union.    [Anenkova] What kind of system of state administration would  seem optimal to you?    [Grach] We are for a broadening of the sovereignty of the  soviets of all levels--as a guarantor of the strengthening of  the state status of Crimea, excluding the possibility of the  establishment of an authoritarian dictatorship. The optimum path  of the solution of strategic questions of the republic's  socioeconomic development could be, in our view, consultation  with the people via referendum. And we are prepared upon  entering the Supreme Council to offer the people, together with  the government, a program, if national salvation is what you  want.    [Anenkova] Leonid Ivanovich, have there been in your life  events, meetings, and achievements that have made a particular  mark on your memory?    [Grach] There have been a multitude of memorable meetings,  of  course: As a party official, I preferred to work among people  and help them resolve their problems--people were always coming  to my office, and not in vain, probably, confident that they  would get a sympathetic reception. But there is in the sequence  of events an achievement of which I am particularly proud: the  referendum that revived in 1991 from Crimea Oblast the Republic  of Crimea.    Remember the Varfamaleyevka reprisal against the Meskhetian  Turks and the tent compounds of the Crimean Tatars (refugees)  pitched in Crimea? We formed a peacemaking delegation at that  time and set off for the scene of the events in Uzbekistan. The  tragedy that we saw there was impossible to contemplate with an  easy heart: ashes in the place of yesterday's dwellings, faces  contorted by horror and anger.... An Uzbek woman, the secretary  of the rayon party committee, as I recall, gave shelter in her  home to 100 terrified casualties and went out to meet the  infuriated mob. In a yard near Fergana, I picked up from beneath  my feet a note in a child's handwriting: A young girl had  written in a letter to her brother in the Army that Papa and  Mama were working and that all were alive and well and doing  alright.... The night before, the whole family had been wiped  out. This incident was, evidently, the last straw, scarring the  heart and the memory. The lessons of history are always costly.  And a person who cares more about his own health than about the  fate of near ones and dear ones and about the fate of the  motherland is hardly capable or deserving of being called a  statesman.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Halifax turns in 29% advance to Pounds 411m HALIFAX, the UK's biggest building society, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 29 per cent to Pounds 411m in the six months to July 31 this year. It said the increase reflected its decision to concentrate on quality lending, prudent provisioning and control of costs. Mr Michael Blackburn, chief executive, said: 'This is a further good set of results. They are what they are: very strong.' Gross lending fell to Pounds 3.9bn compared with Pounds 4.6bn in the first half of last year, and net lending declined to Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn). Net interest received rose to Pounds 739m (Pounds 611m) and other income and charges increased slightly to Pounds 186m (Pounds 180m). Management expenses rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 358m (Pounds 338m). Provisions increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 156m (Pounds 135m), but additional suspended interest - or interest payments written off - almost halved to Pounds 18m (Pounds 37m). The number of mortgages at least one year in arrears fell to 21,100 (23,600), or to Pounds 235m (Pounds 320m) by value. That represented a reduction in arrears as a proportion of total mortgages to 0.44 per cent (0.63 per cent). Mr Blackburn warned that the housing market was 'anaemic' but said: 'The worst is past. We are optimistic that there may be a few red corpuscles coming through.' He said applications for new mortgages were at about the same level as last year, which had been distorted by the government's temporary suspension of stamp duty. The Halifax's market share of mortgage lending fell back to 15 per cent from an unusually high 19 per cent in the first half last year, but its share of liquid savings almost doubled from 9 per cent to 16 per cent. The balance sheet was strengthened, with the gross capital ratio rising to 6.69 per cent (6.02 per cent). 'We are in a very strong position to take advantage of the recovery when it comes,' Mr Blackburn said. The net interest margin rose to an annualised 2.32 per cent for the half year from 2.04 per cent, which he said partly reflected a move from the previous Halifax emphasis of 'favouring the saver at the expense of the bor-rower'. In line with the practice of a number of other companies in recent months, the Halifax had its figures examined by KPMG Peat Marwick, its auditors, although such an inspection is not required. 'We want to be at the forefront of best practice,' said Mr Blackburn.</p>

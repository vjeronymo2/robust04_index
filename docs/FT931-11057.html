			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chrysler's credit upgraded by S&amp;P CHRYSLER, the US carmaker which raised dollars 1.78bn gross on Tuesday in an international share offering, yesterday saw this success result in an upgrading of its credit rating by Standard &amp; Poor's. The rating agency's move brought the car company to within one notch of its declared goal of getting its senior debt re-classified as investment grade, rather than the more speculative 'junk' label it has now. Chrysler's stock offering was priced at dollars 38 3/4 a share, the closing price of the company's shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday night. The shares rose yesterday to stand at dollars 38 7/8, up dollars 1/8, before the close. Demand from investors was sufficiently strong that the company and its underwriters, led by First Boston, increased the size of the offering from 40m shares to 46m. Chrysler's share price has nearly quadrupled since the start of last year as the company's financial prospects have improved and the shares continued to perform robustly after the new issue was announced on January 11. The shares stood at dollars 36 3/8 immediately before the announcement, dipped a little immediately afterwards, but then rose, helped by a strong fourth-quarter earnings report. Standard &amp; Poor's, which raised the company's debt rating from Single-B-plus to Double B when the issue was announced, lifted it a further notch yeaterday, to Double-B-plus. The next grade up is Triple-B-minus, which qualifies as investment grade. The company has indicated that it will use almost half of the funds raised to reduce the underfunding of its pension obligations. The shortfall stands at about dollars 4bn and Chrysler has left open the possibility that all the cash could be contributed to the pension fund. S&amp;P said that further success by Chrysler with new product launches could enable the company to bolster financial flexibility to levels adequate to protect the company in the event of another severe downturn in market conditions. 'Thus the company could achieve its standard goal of achieving investment grade ratings by early 1995 - or even sooner,' S&amp;P added.</p>

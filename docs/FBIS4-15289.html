			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 30 (CTK) -- An intergovernmental  protocol on the mutual supply of goods in 1994 was initialed  today in Moscow by the Russian Ministry for Internal Economic  Relations [as received] and the Czech Trade and Industry  Ministry.    Among other goods, the document calls for the purchase of 7  million tons of Russian oil and 6.9 billion cubic meters of  natural gas.    Both countries have agreed that instead of drawing up yearly  protocols, medium or long-term agreements should be concluded in  coming years, Deputy Trade and Industry Minister Vaclav Petricek  said.    The Czech delegation in Moscow agreed to cooperate further  on  the construction of natural gas works on the basis of 1982  agreements, according to which the Czech Republic should get  Russian natural gas in return for Czech supplies and labor.    Petricek in Moscow also discussed the possibility of Czech  participation in the modernization of the natural gas industry  in Russia and in the construction of a new natural gasline from  Russia to Germany via Belarus and Poland. Czech firms could  help build the gasline on Russian and Belarussian territory.  Further negotiations concerned the possibility of hooking the  gasline up to the Czech Republic's natural gas distribution  network.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOING TO THE CHAPEL  </P> <P> If you're desperate to be a June bride, it's not too late. There is still one  day left. And that is 23 hours more than you need to get married in a Las Vegas  wedding chapel.  </P> <P> Last year, Pat Allen, an executive in the Clark County Recorder's Office,  registered 7,217 June weddings. That's one ceremony every six minutes, which is  logistically feasible since the wedding chapels are open 24 hours a day.  </P> <P> The state laws of Nevada make immediate-gratification weddings possible, and  the Clark County Courthouse works on convenience-store hours, dispensing $27  marriage licenses.  </P> <P> The wedding chapels have one-stop shopping. Charolette Richards, who owns four  Las Vegas wedding chapels, estimates that most couples spend $150 to $200 on  the big event. That amount will rent the chapel and buy flowers, photographs, a  souvenir book to hold the hastily procured license and instantly developed  photographs, and a cassette tape of the ceremony. Nancy Youngbeck, a  spokeswoman for Modern Bride magazine, says their research shows the average  cost of a formal wedding, usually planned months in advance, is $13,300.  </P> <P> Pulling off a Las Vegas wedding is so easy that Gordon Gust, owner of the  Candlelight Wedding Chapel, where both Bette Midler and Whoopi Goldberg tied  the knot, estimates 75% of his brides and grooms do it on a whim.

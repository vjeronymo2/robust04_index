			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Identical Attitudes With Serbian </F> Socialists"]    [Text] The press conference of the Democratic Christian  Party in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM], held in Belgrade, focused on the Orthodox religion and  Macedonia. Representatives of this party have been guests of the  ruling Socialist Party in Serbia [SPS] for already two days. We  are discussing possibilities of opening a process of unity of  all orthodox and Christian peoples in the Balkans, as a part of  the all-European integration process, the party leader Vasil  Ristevski said. He stressed his party has identical points of  view with the Serbian Socialists on all main issues concerning  the Balkan political crises. He also pointed out he had been  assured Macedonia is not faced with any danger coming from its  northern brotherly neighbor.    Representatives of the party were also received by the  Serbian Government and the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox  Church.</p>

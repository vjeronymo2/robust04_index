			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Donaldson to step down at NYSE in May Mr William Donaldson is to step down as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange when his first term ends next May. His decision, which was expected, revived speculation over the identity of his successor. The most likely candidate to take over is its current president and chief operating officer, Mr Richard Grasso. During his 27 years at the NYSE, the 48-year-old Mr Grasso has built up a wealth of knowledge of the exchange's inner workings. He is also popular with the exchange's floor traders and specialists, and industry sources say it is unlikely the NYSE's board will choose an outsider.</p>

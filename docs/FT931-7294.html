			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Bid may block holiday companies' sunshine: The tour operators looking for a bright side in the proposed takeover THOSE whose business is selling sun-drenched dreams have little difficulty putting aside their own regrets and disappointments. Even the fiercest opponents of Airtours' proposed takeover of rival tour operator Owners Abroad were yesterday determinedly searching for the bright side of trade and industry secretary Mr Michael Heseltine's decision not to refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The Thomas Cook travel agents' chain is potentially the biggest loser from yesterday's decision. A takeover by Airtours would scupper its own planned alliance with Owners Abroad. It could also leave it at a disadvantage against competitors such as Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel, owned by tour operators Thomson and Airtours respectively. Yesterday, however, Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook chief executive, said that if Airtours does gain control of Owners Abroad, 'we will be the biggest independent, solely consumer-driven company in the business'. He added: 'We've had a material number of contacts with people who would wish to do business with us.' Mr George Asprou, managing director of independent tour operator Aspro Holidays, also saw advantages in not being part of either Thomson or an enlarged Airtours, which would each control about 30 per cent of the market. He said: 'A merger between Airtours and Owners Abroad would emphasise our position as one of the largest independent tour operators in the country. When news of this merger first came through we received calls from travel agents all over the country who are keen to do business with us.' Speculation on Mr Heseltine's motives was widespread. Mr Tim Cocking, president of the National Association of Independent Travel Agents, wondered whether Mr Heseltine's dismissal of the OFT's recommendation reflected the low priority the government attached to the travel industry. He said: 'I've always come away from government departments with the impression they'd rather be doing something more important.' Before launching its bid, Airtours cast doubt on small companies' ability to operate in the travel industry. In its 1991 annual report, Airtours said: 'The (package) tour market continues to provide exciting opportunities for innovative operators although smaller companies will find it increasingly difficult to compete with their larger and more integrated competitors. Potential new entrants to the market will be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining bonding, cost-effective flying and distribution of their product.' Representatives of the smaller companies did not hide their bitterness - and incomprehension - over Mr Heseltine's decision. Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said: 'The OFT is supposed to act as a buffer to protect the best interests of the public. It cannot be in the public's best interests to allow the power base of the travel industry to sit in the hands of just two companies.' Mr Chris Parker, chairman of medium-sized tour operator Unijet, said barriers to entry had been raised substantially over the past five years. The Civil Aviation Authority, which grants licences to companies taking holidaymakers abroad by air, had become more vigilant in its monitoring of travel groups' financial health. Another constraint was the increasing cost of technology. Travel agents have sophisticated computerised booking systems and tour operators need to buy compatible technology. Mr Parker said: 'If you want to make sure that the multiple travel agents sell your product you've got to have a fairly sophisticated computer system.' Whatever consternation Mr Heseltine's decision caused in the industry, Mr Bruce Shepherd, sales director of AT Mays, a travel agents' chain with 289 shops, doubted a takeover of Owners Abroad would change much. 'There's still plenty of choice of holidays on the market and there always will be. I don't think the customers will see any difference,' he said.</p>

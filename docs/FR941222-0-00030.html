			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This rulemaking does not cover site-specific NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensees; however, the NRC is not ignoring them. Under NRC regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility has two options in using dry cask storage of spent fuel: (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee may apply for a site-specific license from NRC; or (2) the licensee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may use an NRC-approved cask under the general license provisions of Subpart K  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 10 CFR Part 72. However, not all licensees may be able to use the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> license provisions, either because the fuel type they possess is not storable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in any cask listed in 10 CFR 72.214 or because none of the cask designs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> envelope the reactor site parameters. The NRC is also not ignoring site- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific license considerations relating to modifying cask designs. Quite the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrary, the criteria that apply to modifications of an NRC-approved cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as the Standardized NUHOMS are the same as the criteria that apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications of site-specific ISFSIs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because the populations of several states and provinces, including two-thirds of the population of Quebec, are based along the St. Lawrence Seaway, one commenter wanted an Economic Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted with a cost/benefit analysis citing possible adverse impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tourism and sport fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A regulatory analysis, which considers both benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and impacts of adding the Standardized NUHOMS to the list of NRC-approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> casks under Subpart K of 10 CFR Part 72, was prepared in support of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking action. It was included as a part of the notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking and is also included in this final rulemaking notice. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this regulatory analysis reflects the limited scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the rulemaking does not provide any site-specific NRC approvals, NRC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not evaluate site-specific economic impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter wanted to restrict the use of the cask to reactor sites that have responded on schedule to NRC Generic Letter 88&hyph;20,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplement 4, ``Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE).''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  IPEEE response submittals will not address dry cask  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage and are not necessary for Standardized NUHOMS use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H.8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that NUHOMS must not receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generic approval because site-specific characteristics must be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter stated that placing this cask on the shores of Lake Erie is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential ecocide and the cask is not terrorist-proof. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the potential engineering problems of storing high-level nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste in a variety of climatic and geologic regions of the United States are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A utility's use of the Standardized NUHOMS, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage of spent fuel in casks at a reactor site, would not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on the environment. This finding is supported by the NRC safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental evaluations for the Standardized NUHOMS, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant's demonstration of compliance of the cask with NRC requirements, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as by the 1990 rulemaking on dry cask storage and the 1984 and 1989 waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence proceedings. Because the Standardized NUHOMS can only be used by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensee if the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in the SAR and SER, cask storage of spent fuel near the shore of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lake Erie within the specified parameters would not have a significant impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. The following comments relate to the transportability of dry storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> casks to an off-site location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter questioned how the cask transport methods used at both on-site and off-site locations are related.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In this rulemaking, the NRC reviewed the cask vendor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed means for transporting the Standardized NUHOMS canister and transfer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cask outside the reactor buildings to the on-site storage pad under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. This on-site movement occurs within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an owner-controlled area where access can be limited and where operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be safely managed by the general licensee. The NRC did not review the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standardized NUHOMS for transport off-site, for example to a DOE MRS or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repository. Generally, off-site transport of spent fuel occurs in public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> places where the shipper has fewer access restrictions and limited control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the surroundings. Off-site spent nuclear fuel shipments must be made in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation cask approved by the NRC pursuant to NRC's regulations found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR Part 71, ``Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Material,'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must also comply with pertinent Department of Transportation (DOT)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. At this time, the NRC is approving the Standardized NUHOMS for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> storage only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter, citing a Wisconsin Public Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission EIS for Point Beach, questioned the statement, ``The baskets'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavier weight and larger diameter make the transportability of an intact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUHOMS canister to an MRS site or repository questionable.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC has not reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking for off-site transportation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

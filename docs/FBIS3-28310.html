			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been revealed that the Air Self Defense  Force [ASDF] has been compiling a draft research report on  operation plans regarding the action of its units in the event  of emergency situations. A number of ASDF officials have  provided verbal evidence. Among a number of points, the report  suggests that an "exclusive zone" be designated in the airspace  directly above international waters and adjacent to sovereign  airspace, and in the event an unidentified aircraft enters this  zone, the ASDF should be permitted to take the same course of  action against such aircraft as when a violation of territorial  airspace occurs -- such as firing warning shots -- even if the  prime minister or the director general of the Defense Agency  [DA] has not yet given orders to take defensive actions. Not  only have such details been left unreported to the DA director  general and to the intra-agency bureaus, but they go as far as  to imply revision of the current SDF law. Consequently, this is  expected to arouse much controversy.    The draft report which has been worked out in secrecy by the  ASDF is entitled, "Operational Regulations, Part 2." ASDF  uniformed officials independently compiled the draft report on  such points as inadequacies under the current SDF law regarding  unit operations and civil support in emergency situations when a  direct military threat is imminent to Japan and the surrounding  areas.    The draft report expressly states in its generalizations  that  "this is on the precondition that revisions would be made to the  SDF law." It then lists, according to the type of operation,  the particulars in detail. Current legislation only authorizes  action against violation of the 12-mile territorial airspace.  In the particulars, the draft report includes a suggestion that  in order to have enough time to prepare against surprise  attacks, a certain area outside the sovereign airspace should be  designated as an "exclusive zone" and treated in the same manner  as if it were within sovereign airspace. The size of the "zone"  itself has not been indicated.    In addition, the draft report touches on the issue of  building facilities for holding enemy soldiers in custody should  they be captured inside the country and on the issue of  procedures regarding the utilization of commercial airports and  recruitment of commercial ships and other means of transport  during emergency situations.    Copies of the draft report are in safe-keeping at ASDF  regional headquarters, as well as at the Air Defense Command  Headquarters (Fuchu, Tokyo). They are being treated as "defense  secrets."    The DA has traditionally formulated an annual defense  buildup  program (nenbo) for each fiscal year on the presumption of a  military assault from the outside. Regarding basic matters  which can be handled within the limitations of current  legislation, the ASDF has worked out, within its defense buildup  programs, concrete measures in the form of "operational  regulations," which are equivalent to operation plans, and these  have been channeled to the ASDF's various units. For example,  they include key points regarding the process of advancing  fighter units all over the nation to air bases which are located  close to the site of conflicts and ways to reinforce aircraft  scrambling readiness.    In the backdrop of work being done on compiling the draft  report are concerns among uniformed defense officials who point  out that under current legislation the use of weapons is  prohibited before an order is issued to take defensive action,  even if it has been determined that an emergency situation  exists, except in cases which necessitate action for self  defense or emergency evacuation. Deep- rooted concerns have  been particularly voiced in the ASDF pointing out there are many  problems. For example, under current legislation, ASDF pilots  cannot retaliate against enemy aircraft before an order has been  issued to take defensive action unless a friendly aircraft has  been shot down; procedures regarding action in response to  surprise air attacks need to be worked out.    A senior Air Staff official stated: "I can make absolutely  no  comments about details regarding operational regulations since  the SDF Law designates them as confidential matters."    Opinion is said to be divided even in light of international  laws regarding the propriety of designating "exclusive zones" in  the airspace over international waters according to the level of  tension during a crisis. These exclusive zones are said to be  similar to "security zones" which various nations have declared  for such purposes as missile firing ranges and the air zones  that the British military has set up during such instances as  the Falkland War. However, the draft report does not give legal  grounds for its proposed designation of exclusive zones.</p>

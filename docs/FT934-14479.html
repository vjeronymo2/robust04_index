			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sleepy Kids wake up to pet shop vampires SLEEPY KIDS, the USM-traded animation and merchandising group which is behind the licensing of Budgie the Little Helicopter, the cartoon character invented by the Duchess of York, is turning its hand to a slightly darker side of children's entertainment. Through Transylvania Pets, its 50.1 per cent-owned subsidiary, the group has sold the television rights for one series, comprising 13 half-hour episodes, of Transylvania Pet Shop to Carlton Television. The series centres around Dr Scuzzbag, a fiendish scientist and owner of the only pet shop in Transylvania, a cobwebbed castle populated by zombies, vampires and dinosaurs. He is assisted in his endeavours by Horrifido, a skeletal hound. Sleepy Kids' shares rose 3p to 56p yesterday, a net rise of 15p on the week; on Thursday the directors said they knew of no reason for the strength of the shares. The Stock Exchange would not comment on yesterday's announcement but said: 'We will look into any share price movement that looks unusual.'</p>

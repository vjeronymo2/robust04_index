			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONMOUTH'S 3-POINT BURST BEATS PEPPERDINE  </P> <P> Pepperdine had defenses for the rest of Monmouth's players, Tuesday night, but  none to stop the three-point shots of Dave Calloway.  </P> <P> Calloway, a junior guard from Williamstown, N.J., made nine three-pointers,  tying a Firestone Fieldhouse record and leading the Hawks to a 56-54 victory  before 1,371.  </P> <P> He finished with a game-high 27 points, making nine of 14 three-point attempts.  </P> <P> But Calloway's missed shot on a drive down the lane nearly cost Monmouth a  chance to win the game in the last seconds.  </P> <P> Pepperdine had tied the score, 54-54, on a steal by Dexter Howard and a  breakaway basket by Shann Ferch.  </P> <P> With 12 seconds remaining, Monmouth called a timeout and took the ball out at  half-court in an attempt to make the winning basket.  </P> <P> The Hawks succeeded in getting the ball to Calloway, but he drove the lane and  missed the shot. Teammate Alex Blackwell got the rebound and made a layup  shortly before time ran out.  </P> <P> Monmouth (4-6) was trailing, 23-22, in the second half when Calloway went on a  three-point binge. He made four straight three-pointers around two baskets by  Craig Davis, and the Hawks went ahead, 32-27, with 14:19 left. Calloway made  seven three-pointers in the second half.  </P> <P> About four minutes later, the Waves regained the lead, 38-36, on a basket and a  three-point play by Tom Lewis.  </P> <P> After a sloppy first half, Pepperdine led at intermission, 20-18.  </P> <P> Each team shot 29.2% from the field in the first half, each making seven of 24  shots. The Waves led only twice -- at 9-8 and at halftime on a Geoff Lear  basket.  </P> <P> Dexter Howard led Pepperdine (5-6) with 14 points, Craig Davis scored 13 and  Lewis had 10.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW TRIAL ORDERED IN PALME SLAYING  </P> <P> An appeals court today agreed to a new trial for Christer Pettersson, convicted  in the slaying of Prime Minister Olof Palme, the national TT news agency said.  </P> <P> Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede with a criminal record, was sentenced to life  in prison last month after his conviction. He denied shooting Palme and  appealed.  </P> <P> The prosecution also appealed because it wanted also to convict Pettersson of  attempted murder in the wounding of Palme's widow, Lisbeth, who was slightly  wounded in the attack in February, 1986. Pettersson was convicted of the lesser  charge of endangering Lisbeth Palme's life.  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Compensating family trusts WITH reference to compensation limits for building societies accounts, what is the position when family trusts make such investments? Specially, I am concerned (as settlor) with (1) an interest-in-position trust and (2) an accumulation to maintenance settlement, each with two primary beneficiaries, and four trustees. The accounts are normally opened in the name of the trust by two of the trustees. The trustees are together as a single body of persons, and so will have protection up to Pounds 20,000 only, however great the sum held by them: see paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Building Societies Act 1986. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town June 9 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela  said on Thursday he was personally opposed to privatisation as  it amounted to a form of maintaining apartheid in economic  issues. Answering questions at the World Economic Forum  conference in Cape Town, he said in terms of privatisation,  people with capital were advantaged -- that is, "not blacks,  only whites".    The "democratic government" would therefore be deprived of  resources.    "This (privatisation) is not seen here in the same way as in  Switzerland," Mr Mandela added to laughter.    The privatisation of such assets as airports and harbours  "cannot be in the interests of the masses of the people".    Asked whether he was prepared to give a glimpse into the  June  22 budget, Mr Mandela said to more laughter that he did not want  to "take you into confidence" but that he was sure the minister  of finance, Mr Derek Keys -- who was present at the conference  -- "will be pleased to answer".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Yeltsin's edict on fighting banditry and  organized crime is accumulating an ever larger number of  opinions. Former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy, the famous  champion of the fight against corruption, has not remained on  the sidelines. Presently in Krasnoyarsk, Rutskoy, chairman of  the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, has criticized  this edict. One of his arguments is: Name me a single document  which could be implemented, Rutskoy said in an interview to a  RIA correspondent. Rutskoy believes that the edict has not been  thoroughly worked out, and not only violates human rights, but  is contradictory to legislation. With the aid of the edict, the  authorities intend to drive society into a condition of total  pathological fear, Rutskoy said.</p>

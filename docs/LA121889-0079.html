			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH 'NUTCRACKER' HAS TOO MANY ORNAMENTS  </P> <P> Crammed with special effects, the familiar Long Beach Ballet version of "The  Nutcracker" has nearly everything that money can buy. This year, the  spare-no-expense innovations include a shower of fireworks behind the  production's trademark flying sleigh, the dancing of two guests from the  Bolshoi Ballet and the authoritative conducting of ballet specialist Patrick  Flynn.  </P> <P> Obviously, if all you want from any "Nutcracker" is an opulent,  family-oriented, nominally cultural holiday entertainment, seek (and read) no  further.  </P> <P> Those who prize choreography and dancing may be less satisfied. On Saturday  afternoon at the Terrace Theater, the version by David Wilcox and Terri Lewis  again lurched from broad storytelling pantomime to faceless classicism and back  for no apparent reason. Clara kept going onto pointe and noodling about -- but  who could tell how her steps and poses related to her feelings or the plot? The  why of this version proved very weak indeed.  </P> <P> Corps passages (including the Mirlitons ensemble) looked well drilled Saturday  afternoon, but all of the company soloists were technically unreliable except  for the accomplished Helena Ross as Dewdrop. Indeed, Ross' refinement and the  bravura of the Bolshoi guests only heightened the sub-professional execution of  Long Beach Ballet as a whole.  </P> <P> Dancing their Bolshoi choreography in their Bolshoi costumes, Vitali Artyushkin  and his wife, Alla Khaniashvili-Artyushkina, capitalized on the extreme stretch  and velocity of Soviet style. Unfortunately, they also demonstrated some of the  crudities of that style: stop-and-go phrasing (lots of walking and waiting  between feats) and the tendency to force virtuosity onto unsuitable music.  </P> <P> Artyushkina is far too unyielding a dancer to be an ideal Sugar Plum Fairy --  if she had been in the original cast, Tchaikovsky would probably have scored  her solo for steel guitar rather than celesta. But she can do turns  brilliantly, and did on Saturday at every opportunity. Her husband partnered  her attentively and their daughter appeared with 19 other kiddies in the Mother  Ginger divertissement.  </P> <P> Twins Meagan and Leah Watson doubled as Clara, bringing off switcheroo effects  in both acts. Dudley Davies made a sprightly Drosselmeyer and Tzer-Shing Wang  looked highly promising as the Snow Queen.Lewis Segal  </P></p>

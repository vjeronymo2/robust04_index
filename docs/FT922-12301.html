			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Harrogate district hospital extension A building contract worth Pounds 9m has been won by CLUGSTON CONSTRUCTION to expand Harrogate District Hospital for the newly-created Harrogate Health Care NHS Trust. It means that Clugston has made a promising start to 1992 winning contracts worth Pounds 21m since Christmas. Work at Harrogate starts straight away on building four wards and three extra operating theatres, enabling the NHS Trust to greatly increase the number of beds, including special facilities for the elderly and raise the number of operating theatres to five. Other contracts include a supermarket for Morrisons in Lincoln.</p>

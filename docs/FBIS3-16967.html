According to the Ukrainian  Labor Ministry's forecast, the figure is expected to rise to 1  million by the end of 1994. Meanwhile, Ukrainian Deputy Prime  Minister Valentin Landik has said that the number of people out  of work will rise even higher following mass bankruptcies of  enterprises. By year's end, up to 3.4 million of Ukraine's  able-bodied citizens, that is, every ninth resident of the  republic, will be fully or partially unemployed.</p>

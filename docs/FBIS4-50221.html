			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhao Shulan (6392 3219 5695): "Ending Deficits of Some </F> State-Owned Enterprises Is the Emphasis of the Current  Enterprise Reform"]    [Text] From 27 to 29 April, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the  provincial party committee, traveled to Handan and Xingtai  cities to hold forums of the local party and government  principal leaders and enterprise plant leaders and managers, and  offered important ideas.    Xu Yongyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, and Li Zhanshu, member of the standing committee of  the provincial party committee and secretary general of the  provincial party committee, attended the forums.  <H5>  Ending Deficits and Increasing Profits of Some Large and </H5> Medium- Sized State-Owned Enterprises Is One of the Emphases of  the Current Deepening of Reform    Cheng Weigao pointed out: At present, one of the important  tasks facing the party committees and governments at all levels  is to seize the opportunity, concentrate energy, and accelerate  the progress of enterprise reform. Through deepening reform, we  should strive to help some state-owned deficit-incurring  enterprises or enterprises running at half capacity or brought  to a standstill end deficits and increase profits and enable  them to free themselves from a difficult position; through  changing operational mechanism, we should make enterprises link  with the track of the market economy and to enter the orbit of a  well-rounded cycle.    Solving the problems of money-losing enterprises,  particularly the problems of the state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises running in the red, is the emphasis of  the current deepening of reform. It has a bearing not only on  guaranteeing and increasing the value of state-owned assets but  also on stabilizing the basic contingents of the state.  Invigorating state-owned enterprises is the key of the  transition from the planned economy into the market economy.  Enterprises have played a leading role in the play of the  market economy. If enterprises fail to enter the market, this  play cannot be staged. Therefore, regardless of speaking from  the angle of reform or from the angle of development, reform of  the state-owned enterprises is very important, and is the key  and priority of the establishment of the market economic new  structure.    All localities across the province have actively explored  ways to deepen enterprise reform and solve the issue of helping  enterprises end deficits and increase profits. Handan city has  proposed that the key to invigorating enterprises is to have  "good plant directors, good products, and good mechanisms."  Xingtai city has adopted the measures of "reforming, helping,  readjusting, and stimulating" money-losing enterprises. These  good methods should be upheld continuously. However, generally  speaking, we have failed to grasp this work forcefully.  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Eliminate Three Ideological Obstacles </H5> While Deepening Enterprises Running in the Red    Cheng Weigao said: Some of our leading cadres still have  ideological obstacles of varying degrees in deepening reform of  enterprises running in the red. First, some held that the  increase in the enterprise deficit range is a general  phenomenon. They never felt anxious, and they lacked a sense of  urgency; second, regarding the problem of deficits, they usually  found reasons of deficits objectively and seldom found reasons  from enterprises themselves; third, they simply applied the  measures for development to increasing input and starting new  projects, and held that it has big risks and great difficulties  if they rely on reform to invigorate the existing enterprises.  Therefore, they failed to pay a high degree of attention to the  issue of enterprise reform and to exert sufficient efforts to it.    We must clearly understand that in maintaining the mainstay  status of state-owned sector of the economy in the course of  developing the socialist market economy, on the one hand, the  state must increase input and carry out some good projects, and  on the other hand, the value of state-owned assets must be  guaranteed and must increase. Only thus, can we guarantee the  unceasing expansion of the state-owned sector of the economy.  The deficits of state- owned enterprises are the main reasons  for the losses of state-owned assets. Successfully ending the  deficits of state-owned enterprises and helping them increase  profits is an important aspect of guaranteeing the state-owned  assets to maintain and increase the value and to further develop  the productive forces. Therefore, we must pay great attention  to the reform of state-owned enterprises and helping them end  deficits and increase profits.    We Must Be Good at Seizing the Opportunity and Never  Lose the Current Favorable Opportunity of the In-Depth Reform    Cheng Weigao pointed out: It is true that the favorable  conditions are the opportunities and difficulties and the  problems are also opportunities. Grasping the difficulties and  problems while conducting reform is also a way to seize the  opportunity. At present, deficits of enterprises have  increased. Although there are reasons of one sort or another,  generally speaking, this has precisely exposed the  contradictions of enterprises of incompatibility with the market  economy and the fact that their ideological concepts,  operational mechanism, operational strategy, and management  policymaking are incompatible with the technological progress  and enterprise management and with the impact caused by the  unceasingly changeable market situation. This has also  negatively showed that enterprises must carry out reform. These  contradictions and difficulties have made the urgency and  necessity of enterprise reform more striking. The pains brought  by enterprise deficits have urged cadres and staff members to  enhance their ability to withstand the strain of reform and  provided a favorable ideological foundation for enterprise  reform. So, we can say that enterprises may also have the  opportunity of reform even when they meet with difficulties. We  should seize the opportunity brought by difficulties and  extricate ourselves from a difficult position by deepening  reform, changing mechanisms, and overcoming difficulties.  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Conscientiously Conduct Investigation and </H5> Study and Formulate Plans for Deepening Reform, Changing  Mechanism, Ending Deficits, and Increasing Profits    Cheng Weigao pointed out: Leaders at all levels should go  deep to the money-losing enterprises to clearly understand their  degree of deficits and reasons for the deficits one by one, and  then, formulate reform measures and methods for grasping the  major contradictions and solving problems according to the  merits of different cases. Some enterprises should reselect  responsible persons and do a good job in selecting and employing  trained personnel by introducing the competitive mechanisms;  some enterprise deficits are caused by the problems of products  and technological transformation which must be solved by  adopting various methods, such as introducing technology and  developing internal cooperation, updating and upgrading  products, and transforming equipment and technology; some are  caused by ineffective reform of the international management  system which must be resolved by intensifying the degree of  internal reforms and exerting efforts to grasp reform of the  personnel, labor, and wage distribution systems in enterprises.  Some enterprises whose fixed assets cannot pay off their debts  and have no hope of ending deficits should be ordered to merge  with other enterprises, lease out, or turn into state-owned but  people-run enterprises if necessary. A small number of such  enterprises should declare bankruptcy. In short, each and every  money-losing enterprise should do a good job in formulating its  own reform plan aimed at ending deficits and increasing profits.  It is necessary to use two or three years to gradually  revitalize money- losing enterprises.  <H5>  Accelerating Reform on the Selection and Management of </H5> Enterprise Cadres Is the Precondition for Deepening Enterprise  Reform    Cheng Weigao believed that to deepen enterprise reform,  first  of all, we must further deepen reform on the selection and  management of enterprise cadres. It is necessary to adopt the  mechanism which combines incentives with restraints, select the  superior and eliminate the inferior through competition, enable  a great batch of outstanding entrepreneurs to show up, and  eliminate managers and plant directors who are incompetent to  improve the backward enterprises. The key to successfully  running an enterprise is to have a good manager or plant  director. With a good manager and plant director, an enterprise  may produce products and introduce technology and funds even  though it does not have any. On the contrary, an enterprise  cannot run well without a bright and competent plant director  even though it has all given conditions.    To implement reform of the personnel system, we must  formulate reform methods according to the merits of different  categories of enterprises. Enterprises implementing the  corporate system should choose and employ cadres in line with  the company law, and enterprises implementing the contract  system should establish a strict mechanism that combines  incentives with restraints and select managers and plant  directors on this basis.    To push Hebei's economy forward, the most important is to  solve the issue on making proper use of personnel. Only by  successfully building ranks of party and government cadres and  enterpreneurs, can Hebei have hopes. If it simply makes no  difference whether the enterpreneurs of a place work or loaf,  whether they do a good or bad job, or whether they make  achievements or not, this place will have no hope of running its  enterprises well.  <H5>  It Is Necessary To Emancipate the Mind and Find a Way To </H5> Extricate Ourselves From a Difficult Position Through Various  Methods, Such as Reform and Opening Up    Cheng Weigao stressed: Difficulties are many, but methods  will usually outnumber difficulties. As long as money-losing  enterprises emancipate the mind and seek development actively,  they will finally find a way to overcome difficulties and to  extricate themselves from a difficult position. Enterprises  with given conditions should strive to find partners in foreign  countries or outside the territory and conduct transformation  through grafting because this will be helpful not only to  promoting technological progress but also to changing  operational mechanism. Some plants in the downtown areas may be  moved to the suburban areas so as to make room for developing  commerce, service trade, and real estate industry. All  state-owned industrial enterprises should make use of their own  conditions and advantages to actively develop tertiary industry  so as to disperse the surplus labor forces, to develop social  service industry, and to increase enterprise income.    Party committees and governments at all levels should stress  the dedicated spirit of enterpreneurs and give them full  political honor and material incentives. As for enterpreneurs  with great contributions, the party and government should give  them a handsome award with perfect assurance, and enterpreneurs  should also boldly take the awards. It is also necessary to  strictly punish enterprise responsible persons who cause an  enterprise to close down for subjective reasons so as to give a  fairly big impetus to and impose a pressure on plant directors  and managers of enterprises.  <H5>  Paying Attention To Study and Strengthening Study Is the Key </H5> To Coping With the New Situation and Successfully Carrying Out  Reform    At present, we are facing many new problems in the course of  deepening reform. Along with the unceasing deepening of reform,  we have to step up our efforts to get familiar with many things  unfamiliar to us and to resolve many new problems. It will be  difficult to smoothly accomplish enterprise reform if our reform  knowledge, ideology, and understanding cannot catch up with it.  Therefore, party and government cadres or plant directors and  managers should strengthen study and pay attention to study. We  should study the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the market economic knowledge, all sorts of  major reform measures issued by the central authorities, and the  relevant laws and regulations on the market economy. Young  cadres, if conditions permit, should also study international  economic knowledge and foreign languages.</p>

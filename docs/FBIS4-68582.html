General Provisions </H5>   The state program for the demonopolization of the economy  and  the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets  (main avenues and priority measures), hereinafter referred to as  the State Program, establishes the goals, priorities, and place  of the demonopolization of the economy and the development of  competition in the overall state policy of economic reforms, the  stages and methods of the formation and development of a  competitive environment, the tasks and measures to demonopolize  the economy and develop competition at federal, sectorial, and  regional levels, and also restrictions in this field.    The aim of the state policy of the demonopolization of the  economy and the development of competition on the Russian  Federation markets is to increase social production efficiency  on the basis of the market regulation of economic processes.    The main task of the demonopolization of the economy and the  development of competition on the Russian Federation markets in  1994-1995 is to reduce the concentration of production and to  create the necessary conditions for the development of  competition on the Russian Federation markets for priority  groups of commodities (operations and services).    The implementation of this task envisages:    --the analysis of the commodity markets which have taken  shape and the behavior on them of enterprises and various  associations of enterprises which are not the subjects of a  natural monopoly;    --the formation of the necessary economic organizational  prerequisites for effective competition on the Russian  Federation markets;    --the establishment and maintenance of a single economic  area  on the territory of the Russian Federation;    --the creation of a system of state control and regulation  of  the activity of subjects of natural and state monopoly;    --the creation of legal and economic organizational  conditions for activating the market mechanisms for optimizing  commodity flows and forming prices and tariffs for socially  important goods and services which are relegated to the sphere  of a temporary monopoly;    --the consideration of the market structure when privatizing  enterprises with a view to enhancing the competitiveness and  effectiveness of their activity;    --the development of entrepreneurship.    The demonopolization of the economy and the development of  competition on the Russian Federation markets are interconnected  with financial stabilization, anti-inflation measures, and  investment and export and import policy. The provisions of the  State Program are used when forming other federal programs,  including programs for the structural restructuring and  development of the economy as a whole and of its individual  sectors and also programs for the regions' socioeconomic  development.    The direct protection of the competitive environment and  businesses [khozyaystvuyushchiye subekty] against monopoly  activity is effected on the basis of the Russian Federation Law  "On Competition and the Restriction of Monopoly Activity On  Commodity Markets" and is not the subject of this State Program.    The process of the formation and development of a  competitive  environment for markets is geared to the long term, with the  annual specification of priorities.    Sectorial programs for the demonopolization of the economy  and the development of competition are an inalienable part of  the State Program. They include the analysis of the structure  of commodity markets broken down by sector output and of the  level and forms of the manifestation of sectorial monopolism,  validated proposals for the list of subjects of a natural  monopoly, and plans for the demonopolization of the economy and  development of competition on the markets of temporary  monopolies at federal level. Plans for the demonopolization of  the economy and the development of competition on the markets of  temporary monopolies which have geographical market borders  inside national-state and administrative-territorial formations  are coordinated with the organs of executive power of components  of the Russian Federation as regards measures affecting the  economic interests of national-state and  administrative-territorial formations.    Regional programs for the demonopolization of the economy  and  the development of competition are included in the programs for  the region's socioeconomic development and are an inalienable  part of these programs. They include an analysis of the  structure of commodity markets, validated proposals for the list  of subjects of a natural monopoly, and plans for the  demonopolization and development of competition on the markets  of temporary monopolies at local level. Within regional  programs proposals are formed for demonopolization and the  development of competition on interregional commodity markets.    The process of the demonopolization of the economy and the  development of competition on the Russian Federation markets  stipulates a consideration of the following general requirements:    --orientation toward the creation of a competitive market  and  the protection of consumers' rights and interests;    --the comprehensive nature of the solution of the tasks of  demonopolization, privatization, and the structural  restructuring of the economy;    --a differentiated approach toward the targets of  demonopolization wit a consideration for social interests and  sectorial (product) and regional features;    --the interconnectedness of the solution of demonopolization  problems and the development of competition at the federal,  sectorial, and regional levels;    --a consideration of factors of the Russian economy's  integration into the world economic system and the openness of  commodity markets to international competition combined with  measures to protect Russian commodity producers;    --the monitoring of the change in the structure of the  market  and the compliance of the program implementation mechanism for  demonopolization and the development of competition with its  structure;    --the ensuring of publicity for the measures which are  implemented and for their results.    Temporary monopolies which have arisen as a result of the  use  of inventions and the introduction of patents and equipment  produced under license are not subject to demonopolization for  five years as of the moment the license or patent is acquired or  the invention is registered.    The State Program does not include among demonopolization  measures the establishment of state control and the regulation  of prices for temporary monopolies. When high (or low) monopoly  prices are set, the suppression of this abuse is in accordance  with article 5 of the Russian Federation Law "On Competition and  the Restriction of Monopoly Activity on Commodity Markets."    For the purposes of the State Program the following concepts  are used:    --commodity market -- the market for each commodity, type of  operation or service (hereinafter referred to as commodity) or  for each group of interchangeable commodities;    --interchangeable commodities -- commodities which are close  to each other in terms of consumer properties and satisfy  basically the same needs;    --the market's commodity borders -- the selection (list) of  goods which are interchangeable or satisfy a specific need;    --geographical borders of the market -- the sphere of  circulation of a commodity and its substitutes, defined on the  basis of the economic opportunities of consumers for acquiring  the commodity on the relevant territories and the lack of such  opportunities outside the territories' borders (by relevant  territories, together with national-state and  administrative-territorial formations is also understood groups  of population centers or other territories within the borders of  these formations);    --demonopolization -- the reduction of the concentration of  the production of goods and the creation of the necessary  conditions for the development of competition on commodity  markets;    --natural monopoly -- a monopoly whereby the creation of a  competitive environment on the commodity market (including  through the import of output onto a given market) irrespective  of the level of demand is impossible or economically ineffective  given the existing level of scientific and technical progress;    --state monopoly -- a monopoly created in accordance with  Russian Federation legislation defining the commodity borders of  the monopoly market, the subject of the monopoly (monopolist),  the forms of control and regulation of his activity, and the  competence of the contrloling organ;    --temporary monopoly -- a monopoly under the conditions of  the temporary absence of competition;    --group of enterprises -- amalgam of businesses having  relations based on direct or indirect property control of one  business over one other (or other) businesses through the  possession of a controlling block of shares (holdings, stakes)  in the incorporation capital or by exerting decisive influence  by other means on the decisions which are made. With regard to  the aims of demonopolization a group of enterprises is seen as a  single business.  <H5>  2. Priorities of Policy of Demonopolization of the Economy </H5> and Development of Competition on the Russian Federation Markets  for 1994-1995    The following priority avenues for the policy of the  demonopolization of the economy and the development of  competition on the Russian Federation markets are defined for  the immediate future:    --the creation of a legal normative and organizational basis  for state control and regulation of the activity of the subjects  of natural and state monopolies;    --the implementation of priority measures to demonopolize  economic complexes: the trade, construction, communications,  transport and road (except for railroad), and machine building  complexes;    --the implementation of state control over the progress of  the privatization of state and municipal enterprises with a view  to observing antimonopoly requirements and preventing the  creation of new monopoly structures which are not natural  monopolies;    --the elimination of economic and administrative barriers  for  the free movement of commodities, services, and capital on the  Russian Federation markets;    --the reduction of financial and economic, organizational,  and legal barriers to the entry of new competitive structures  onto the market (footnote), (by financial and economic,  organizational, and legal barriers is meant the usually  non-returnable expenditure when organizing and carrying out  production, various restrictions when investing in projects and  providing credits, leasing premises, making use of land, and  gaining access to sources of raw material, technologies, sales  markets, and commercial information);    --the propaganda of the policy of the demonopolization of  the  economy and the development of competition on the Russian  Federation markets and the training of cadres for the  implementation of antimonopoly legislation and the  demonopolization of various spheres of the economy.  <H5>  3. Policy of demonopolization of the economy and </H5> development of competition on the Russian Federation markets  under the conditions of integration processes in industry    The Russian Federation law "On Competition and the  Restriction of Monopoly Activity On Commodity Markets"  stipulates the absence of opposition to structures which  dominate the Russian market if:    --their activity is economically justified, accords with  consumers' interests, and does not lead to the narrowing of the  market's competitive environment;    --they do not abuse their dominant position on the Russian  market and do not allow monopolist actions, defined by articles  of the Russian Federation law "on competition and the  restriction of monopoly activity on commodity markets."    That is why, when determining the expediency of creating  industrial or financial and industrial groups operating on  Russian markets, there must be a consideration of the predicted  likely impact of a group's activity on the state of competition.    Here it is essential to observe the following conditions:    --to avoid abuse of a dominant position large industrial or  financial and industrial groups are not allowed to acquire  monopoly influence on local commodity markets or to restrict  access to them to other businesses, including foreign subjects;    --an industrial or financial and industrial group must not  include supplying firms or consuming firms if they occupy a  dominant position on the relevant markets;    --when creating industrial or financial and industrial  groups  on the basis of the principles of export cartels, firms which  are competitors on a particular commodity market should not  unite if the inclusion of these firms in the group will lead to  the substantial complication or restriction of competition on  the domestic market.  <H5>  4. Organizational and Cadres' Backup for the State Program </H5> for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of  Competition on the Russian Federation Markets.    The implementation of measures to demonopolize the economy  and develop competition on the Russian Federation markets  provides for the creation of the relevant organizational  mechanism for implementing the State Program.    The implementation of the State Program is assigned to the  Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and  the Support of New Economic Structures and its territorial  administrations and organs of executive power of the components  of the Russian Federation.    The coordination of the actions of ministries and other  federal organs of executive power and the organs of executive  power of components of the Russian Federation in implementing  the State Program is implemented by the interdepartmental  commission for competition policy.    Regional commissions for competition policy can be created  at  regional level by a decision of the organs of executive power of  components of the Russian Federation.    To ensure the implementation of the State Program it is  essential to implement measures to form a positive public  opinion of problems of the demonopolization of the economy and  the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets  and of the work of the organs assigned the implementation of the  State Program.    Propaganda support for the State Program envisages:    --the holding of regular consultations between antimonopoly  organs and societies for the protection of consumers' rights,  unions of entrepreneurs and industrialists, trade unions, and  other public organizations;    --acquainting representatives of ministries and other  federal  organs of executive power and organs of executive power of  components of the Russian Federation, businesses, entrepreneurs,  trade unions, and the population with the State Program and  antimonopoly legislation;    --disseminating in the mass media items on questions of the  demonopolization of the economy and the development of  competition on the Russian Federation markets.    The training and retraining of cadres in the field of  demonopolization envisages:    --the study of the need for cadres and the development of  training programs for avenues of demonopolization of the economy  and the development of competition on the Russian Federation  markets;    --the preparation of complete sets of training and  methodological manuals, the translation and adaption of foreign  materials on questions of the demonopolization of the economy  and the development of competition on the Russian Federation  markets;    --the organization of training, retraining, and the  improvement of qualifications for workers in the organs assigned  the implementation of the State Program;    --the formation and development of the relevant centers for  training cadres and the organization on their basis of a  consultative service for questions of the demonopolization of  the economy and the development of competition on the Russian  Federation markets.  <H5>  5. Information and Technical Backup for the State Program </H5> for the Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of  Competition on the Russian Federation Markets    Antimonopoly regulation, demonopolization, and the  development of competition on the Russian Federation markets  require information on the level of monopolization of markets  and the monopoly actions of businesses on them.    To this end an information and reference system should be  created for antimonopoly regulation and the demonopolization of  the economy and development of competition on the Russian  Federation markets.    To implement this task it is necessary:    --to put in order the Russian State Committee for  Statistics'  existing system of statistical reporting with a view to ensuring  the comprehensive provision of information on the reforming of  the economy, expanding the use of selective methods of  collecting information about businesses of all organizational  and legal forms of ownership operating on commodity markets, and  determining the procedure for obtaining information on the  activity of businesses on commodity markets and the transmission  of this information to the organs assigned the implementation of  the State Program;    --to integrate the information resources of ministries,  other  federal organs of executive power, and the organs of executive  power of the components of the Russian Federation, to simplify  information exchange procedures, to organize the collaboration  of organs assigned the implementation of the State Program with  the organizations holding the relevant information, and to  ensure the use of existing data bases and banks and the creation  of new ones to analyze quantitative and qualitative indicators  of the commodity markets;    --to create software for the proposed information and  reference system and automated work stations for the solution of  tasks and the implementation of plans for demonopolization and  the development of competition on the Russian Federation markets.  <H5>  6. Financial Support for the State Program for the </H5> Demonopolization of the Economy and the Development of  Competition on the Russian Federation Markets    The sources of finance for measures and work to implement  the  State Program and to elaborate, amend, and implement the  sectorial and regional programs for demonopolization and the  development of competition which are being implemented within  the framework of the State Program are the funds of the federal  budget and the budgets of national-state and  administrative-territorial formations of the Russian Federation  and also the funds received from the privatization of state and  municipal property and the relevant extrabudgetary funds and  voluntary contributions from enterprises, institutions, and  organizations.    Here measures and operations for the information backup for  the implementation of the state program, for the conducting of  the relevant targeted research, the preparation of legislative  acts and methodological norm materials, the organizational and  technical backup for the organs assigned the implementation of  the State program, the training of the relevant specialists, and  the monitoring of the progress of implementation, are financed  predominantly through federal budget funds allocated directly to  the Russian Federation state committee for antimonopoly policy  and the support of new economic structures.    The financing of measures and work to elaborate, amend, and  implement regional programs for the demonopolization of the  economy and the development of competition is through the  budgets of the relevant components of the Russian Federation and  the money received from the privatization of state and municipal  property.    The financing of the elaboration, amendment, and  implementation of sectorial programs for demonopolization and  the development of competition is mostly through the relevant  extrabudget funds and voluntary donations from enterprises,  institutions, and organizations.    The diversification and deamalgamation of enterprises,  institutions, and organizations with a view to creating  competing structures are implemented and financed as a rule  within the framework of programs for the structural  restructuring of the economy and conversion.    Tax benefits stipulated by legislation can be used to  encourage initiative-driven deamalgamation of businesses.    Specific shape to the provisions of the State Program set  out  in sections 1-6, the most important work and measures to  implement it, and the basic tasks of the demonopolization of the  economy and the development of competition on the Russian  Federation markets and also general methods of resolving these  tasks are given in appendices 1-5 of the State Program.  <H5>  Appendix No. 1.

Standard List of Tasks for the </H5> Demonopolization and Development of Competition on the Commodity  Market with a Stable Structure    The standard list of tasks for the demonopolization and  development of competition on the commodity market with a stable  structure is used to form sectorial and regional programs for  the demonopolization of the economy and the development of  competition. It is based on an analysis of the relevant market  and the provisions of the State Program for the demonopolization  of the economy and the development of competition on the Russian  Federation markets and proceeds from the goal of creating  conditions for the development of competition on a specific  commodity market.    I. General Signs of the Presence of a Competitive  Environment on the Commodity Market    1. There should be operating on the market suppliers --  independent in property and organizational terms -- of goods in  a quantity sufficient for the emergence of competition between  them. The independent suppliers of a commodity under review can  be independent producers of this commodity or sellers of a  commodity from independent producers, or independent sellers of  the commodity of one producer on condition that there is no  vertical agreement between suppliers and producers restricting  the freedom to set prices and delivery volumes. The quantity of  suppliers on the market sufficient to create a competitive  environment depends on the form of commodity, the nature of  consumption, and the level of demand. That is why the task of  creating a competitive environment for each commodity requires  its own special implementation mechanism.    2. There should be operating on the market purchasers --  independent in property and organizational terms -- of  commodities in a quantity sufficient for competition between  them and for the formation of a certain level of effective  demand. Independent purchasers can be the final consumers of a  particular commodity or middlemen in its sale. To implement the  real independence of middlemen it is essential that they supply  their commodity to consumers who are independent in property and  organizational terms. The number of purchasers on the market  sufficient to create an independent environment depends on the  type of commodity, the nature of its consumption, and the level  of demand.    3. To ensure effective competition on the market under  review, the economic dimensions of enterprises should be  comparable (footnote) (the economic dimensions of enterprises  competing on the market depend on production expenditure, the  level of demand, and the market's geographical and commodity  borders and as a rule are measured by the annual turnover of  capital and volumes of production or deliveries).    4. The market's competitive environment is maintained by the  lack of economic and other obstacles in access to raw and  semifinished materials, subassemblies, capital, manpower  resources, technologies, and information backup for market  relations and of barriers to entering the market in the form of  territorial, legal, property, and other economic restrictions.    5. A competitive market is characterized by the independent  economic behavior of suppliers and consumers (the lack of deals  and horizontal agreements).    II. Requirements for Indicators Characterizing the Economic  Situation on a Competitive Commodity Market. (These requirements  determine guidelines in the process of making decisions on  demonopolization and in the choice of methods for demonopolizing  markets with a stable structure. Specific markets dictate their  own individual conditions for the development of competition.)    6. The total number of suppliers of output to a given  commodity market should meet the requirements of competition.  The minimum necessary number of suppliers for the creation of a  competitive environment can be set by proceeding from the  specifications of the output, the size of the market, and other  indicators. If the actual number of suppliers on the market is  less than standard, measures to demonopolize it should include  an increase in the number of suppliers.    7. All suppliers of output to a given commodity market with  a view to effective competition and to avoid abuses of a  dominant position must to a certain extent be comparable in  terms of volumes of deliveries to a given commodity market in  physical terms. This requirement does not apply to markets in  the period of the alteration of their structure, for instance  thanks to the expansion of the volume of deliveries or to  deliveries of new output as a result of the improvement of the  organization and (or) technology of production.    III. Standard List of Tasks for Demonopolization and the  Development of Competition on the Commodity Market    8. The standard list of tasks for demonopolization and the  development of competition on the commodity market includes:    a) the formation of proposals for the composition of natural  monopolies with a consideration for the possibility and economic  effectiveness of creating a competitive environment on the  commodity market under review, including through the import of  output. The inclusion of natural monopolies in the system of  observation, control, and regulation of activity on a  legislative basis;    b) the definition of commodity priorities and stages of  demonopolization and the development of competition on commodity  markets of temporary monopolies at federal and regional levels  on the basis of an analysis of the volumes and structure of  output consumption and the distribution of levels (groups) of  consumption of output according to degree of priority;    c) the determination of the geographical borders of  commodity  markets categorized as commodity priorities in the relevant  stage of demonopolization and the development of competition;    d) the assessment of the actual structure of the commodity  market and the indicators characterizing the economic situation  on the commodity markets which have been hived off and their  recording as standard markets. This work is performed with the  aid of the information and reference system for antimonopoly  regulation, the demonopolization of the economy, and the  development of competition on the commodity market. The actual  structure of the commodity market and the indicators  characterizing the economic situation on it are to be published  regularly. On the basis of the results of an analysis of the  actual structure of the commodity market and the economic  situation on this market the standard number of suppliers on the  market under review is selected and a decision is made on the  sufficient number of suppliers of output to a given commodity  market or on the need to increase them. A business which has  undergone registration at the relevant organ of executive power  or which has a license to supply output to the commodity market  under review can be described as a supplier of output to a given  commodity market provided that the business' property is not  controlled by another business supplying output to this market.  Otherwise both businesses must be regarded as a single supplier.  A decision is also made on the absence or presence of the  domination of businesses on the commodity market under review  and the need (or absence of need) to take steps to change the  structure of this market;    e) the formation of a list of subtasks for the stage of  demonopolization of a given regional or federal commodity market  whose composition and content are determined by the need to  encourage the transformation of these markets' monopoly  structure into a competitive structure;    f) the elaboration of measures for demonopolization and the  development of competition on the commodity markets which have  been hived off, which must be synchronized and can include  successively:    --an increase in the number of suppliers and the volume of  output deliveries through the import of output from abroad or  from other regions;    --the lowering of barriers to entry onto the market;    --the abolition of interregional barriers to commodity  exchange;    --the privatization and hiving off of independent  enterprises  from their associations;    --the creation of corporate bodies on the basis of  structural  subdivisions of existing enterprises on condition that the main  production is preserved and there is a demand for this output;    --the development of entrepreneurship and the creation of  small enterprises to saturate the market with these enterprises'  finished output or to create a competitive environment for the  repartitioning of technologies;    --the inclusion of the output of monopoly enterprises in  market systems for its sale on competitive markets, including  foreign markets;    --the sale of output through the organization of marts and  auctions;    --the extensive provision of information for purchasers on  prices for commodities in other regions.  <H5>  Appendix No. 4.

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett concentrates on corporate broking IN A move expected in the City for weeks, Hoare Govett, the securities firm, yesterday cut 60 jobs from its staff of 440, slicing research and market making in order to concentrate on corporate broking. The firm, which has been looking for new backers since October when Security Pacific, its owner, merged with BankAmerica, is in discussions with potential backers of 'many nationalities, including British', said Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman. He described the changes as 'appropriate under any ownership structure', but they are understood to be crucial for its negotiations with new investors. Until the SecPac merger, the firm was planning a management buy-out of 51 per cent, and a gradual earnout over 10 years of the balance. The management hopes to have a stake in any new ownership. However, Mr Meinertzhagen said yesterday that the management could not - even after the trimming of the business - finance a full MBO unless it operated on the bare minimum capital 'which would be unwise'. Capital of about Pounds 50m is thought to be needed to support the firm's annual costs. There are three main changes: The number of stocks researched will fall by 30 per cent, but the firm estimates that it still covers 80 per cent of the UK stock market's value. Its eight-strong economics team has been cut to three, and Mr Richard Jeffrey, the firm's leading economist, departs. It will stop market making in stocks in which it has less than about 7 per cent market share - cutting its coverage by 137 to 400 equity, convertible and ADR stocks. Its mergers and acquisition department closes, with the loss of some 10 jobs  -the department had begun to conflict with the interests of the firm's corporate clients. Mr Meinertzhagen said that he regarded these activities as expendable for a corporate broker. However, some institutions said yesterday that they were puzzled that the moves appeared to leave the firm part-way between a niche business and a generalist. Executives in rival broking houses said that they feared that the burden of comprehensive coverage was an inescapable consequence of the market's intense competition, and a fundamental change in its structure since Big Bang. In Mr Meinertzhagen's view 'Some of the old past practices are now seen to be more effective than today's integrated houses. Those don't have the the ethos of the individual, and Hoare Govett has survived because of that ethos. This is not nostalgia.'</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: Boeing to reduce its aircraft production BOEING, the US aerospace company, plans to reduce the production rate for the 757 and 767 aircraft, two of its commercial airline models, with the loss of about 2,500 jobs next year. The group put the blame on the soft market for new aircraft. 'Our customers' delivery needs are changing as a result of the difficult time many of them are having,' said Mr Dean Thornton, president of Boeing's commercial aircraft group. 'We are adjusting our rates to meet their needs,' he added. Many of the world's airlines have been making losses, and the large US aircraft industry, battling against overcapacity and severe fare wars, has lost more than Dollars 7bn during the past three years. Boeing did not attribute the production cuts to any particular order change, but said they reflected 'the cumulative recent requests of a number of our customers for changes in their delivery streams'. Under the new production programme, Boeing will reduce the 757 production rate from 8.5 aircraft a month, to seven a month in June 1993, and then cut this to five a month in November 1993. The company, which stepped up the production rate of 757s from seven a month last January, had planned to push the rate back to this level in September 1993. Meanwhile, the rate for 767s will be trimmed from five a month to four a month in November 1993. Boeing said that the changes to the production schedule would probably mean the loss of 5,000 jobs on the west coast and about 500 in Wichita, Kansas. Boeing is expected to have reduced its Seattle workforce by about 6,500 people this year. The company currently employs about 84,000 people in its commercial aircraft division, and some 134,000 people worldwide. Aerolineas Argentinas, the airline run by Spain's Iberia, plans to cut about 1,300 people from its staff of 7,800, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. 'The reductions will be made over an indefinite period of time, Aerolineas said. 'We'll talk everything over with our unions; we won't just dump hundreds of people out on the street,' the airline added. Two years ago the Argentine government turned an 85 per cent stake in its airline over to a consortium led by Iberia in a deal involving Dollars 260m cash and Dollars 2bn in Argentine debt paper. Due to a dispute over payments between Argentina and the consortium in July, the government had to take back part of the airline's shares to save the privatisation deal from foundering.</p>

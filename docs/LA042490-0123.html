			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: PAULETTE GODDARD -- AN AMERICAN BEAUTY  </P> <P> The deaths, in a matter of days, of Greta Garbo and Paulette Goddard (who died  Monday in Switzerland at the age of 78) is among other things a reminder of the  amazing range of charismatic men and women Hollywood found to play in its films  during its great, golden years that stretched from its earliest hand-cranked  times to the mid-1940s, when television changed everything.  </P> <P> It would be hard to imagine two public personas much more different than  Goddard was from Garbo. And yet, long after either had made a film, both  continued to excite the imagination and command the interest of millions of us  who had seen them on the large screen or the small. They attest to the  immortality that the motion pictures grant to those who have been seen in them.  </P> <P> What the two women shared was that they had had to go to work very young, Garbo  lathering the customers in a barber shop, Goddard dancing in Florenz Ziegfeld's  chorus line, both girls only 14.  </P> <P> Both were uncommonly beautiful, in quite different ways, Garbo beautiful in a  classical, patrician, almost aloof way, yet with that wonderful throaty voice  which declared without saying so that where there was ice there was fire, and  sailor beware.  </P> <P> Goddard's beauty was as domestic, as thoroughly American, as Garbo's was  foreign and exotic. Goddard was perky and pretty, sexy and saucy. Hers was the  vitality that suggested (if you were casting the part) that she was not  destined to stay anonymous in the chorus line very long.  </P> <P> It's another instance of the richness that Hollywood lured to citrusland that  Goddard and Lucille Ball were both handmaidens to Eddie Cantor at the start of  their film careers -- Goddard in a small role in "The Kid from Spain," Ball in  "Roman Scandals."  </P> <P> Goddard's great break was catching the eye of Charlie Chaplin, and her poignant  performance in "Modern Times" was, in a sense, a Valentine opportunity from a  lover, which she made the most of.  </P> <P> Otherwise, her filmography for the most part reveals as much about the  Hollywood studio system as it does about her acting ability, and she lent her  vivacious glamour to quite a list of unmemorable works. Yet her best vehicles,  like "The Cat and the Canary," which Elliott Nugent directed and in which she  co-starred with Bob Hope in his first major role, are still fun to see.  </P> <P> It remains true that those we anoint as stars are, one way or another,  projections of our fantasies, people we would like to know if not to be. Stars,  like fingerprints and snowflakes, are each unique, however much they may share  a starry glamour. Paulette Goddard was her own blend of beauty, a lively  intelligence and what the viewer could perceive as an independent spirit.  </P> <P> Like the great progression of stars from Chaplin and Pickford forward, she was  part of our lives and our dreams, and whether she was a favorite or simply one  of the pantheon, it's impossible not to feel a sense of loss and a nudging  reminder of our own mortality.  </P></p>

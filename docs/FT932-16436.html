			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Appointment to silk cuts no ice with barristers - Legal Briefs THE BAR in England and Wales is calling for radical changes in the way Queen's Counsel are appointed. An article in the Bar's magazine, Counsel, says that barristers must be prepared to take a firm stand in court on behalf of their clients even in the face of judicial disapproval. Yet it is predominately judges who advise the lord chancellor on appointments to silk. Some applicants have been refused because of the animosity of a particular judge, it says. A similar article entitled A very English form of Corruption by an unnamed barrister in New Law Journal cites several examples of barristers whose appointments have been delayed or blocked by a single judge. In one well-known case a candidate had his appointment blocked by a judge because he shared the judge's mistress. The Bar calls for the setting up of a panel of senior members of the practising profession who would advise the prime minister, not the lord chancellor, on suitable applicants.</p>

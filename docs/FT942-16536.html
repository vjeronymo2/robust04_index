			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Markets Report: Yen stays firm The yen traded steadily on foreign exchanges yesterday after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, announced his resignation, writes Philip Gawith. The Japanese currency was initially sold heavily, falling to a low of Y105.85 against the dollar. It later recovered to Y104.68, before slipping back to close at Y105.210, down from Thursday's close of Y104.825. Analysts were not surprised by the yen's relative stability, saying the resignation sent an ambiguous signal to the market. Political instability is normally bad for a currency, but in the case of the yen this deduction cannot be so easily made. Elsewhere markets were fairly quiet. 'There was more attention to Moorcroft Boy than Dollar/Mark,' one dealer told Reuters, referring to a horse running in today's Grand National, Britain's leading racing event. Japan is not expected to be without a prime minister for long. With no party wanting an early election, the odds seem to favour the appointment of Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister and former finance minister, as a successor. The change is also not expected to herald any major changes in policy. In a research note the Industrial Bank of Japan predicted that Japan's markets will only react adversely if the crisis becomes drawn out or an election is called. Two other issues are likely to have a bearing on the yen: the passage of the budget and the US-Japan trade dispute. Until the budget is passed - the opposition LDP blocked its passage to put pressure on Mr Hosokawa - the Y15.25trn fiscal stimulus package can not be implemented. If the package, seen as necessary to boost the flagging economy, is not passed, this could exert downward pressure on the Nikkei index and the yen. More important will be the resolution of the trade dispute. Mr Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, said the priority of the Clinton administration would probably be progress in the framework trade talks aimed at curbing Japan's trade surplus with the US. 'If there are no great initiatives put on the table quickly to restart the framework talks, we believe the Clinton people will start talking the dollar cheaper as soon as next week,' he said. The dollar was little changed against the D-Mark, closing at Dollars 1.7134 from Dollars 1.7181 on Thursday. The D-Mark had a mixed day in Europe, trading in fairly narrow ranges in the absence of new developments. Against the French franc, it closed in London at FFr3.427 from FFr3.426 on Saturday. The main movement came again from the lira which continues to prosper on post-election optimism. It closed at L950.9 from L954 on Thursday. The recent rally of the peseta ended as it fell back to Pta80.85 from Pta80.75 against the D-Mark. The escudo, under pressure recently, finished at Es101.7 from Es101.5. Sterling maintained its firmer tone, finishing higher against the D-Mark at DM2.5265 from DM2.5204. It was slightly up against the dollar, at Dollars 1.4745 from Dollars 1.467. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 650m shortage in the discount market by providing a similar injection of liquidity.</p>

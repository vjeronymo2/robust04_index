			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed column] </F>   [Text] The United States and the EC have agreed on the  need to hold a quadrilateral ministerial meeting. In this  connection, the Japanese Government stated that it "has not been  informed of it officially. However, if such a request is made,  the government intends to refuse it. While the United States  and the EC have demanded that contents of the agreement on  market access issues under GATT's multilateral trade  negotiations (Uruguay Round), which was concluded at the end of  last year, be improved, Japan has stated that it is "impossible  to bring up things on which an agreement was already reached for  negotiations once again" (according to the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI]). However, the  situation remains fluid because, with the Japan-U.S. summit  talks near at hand, the United States is expected to strongly  demand that a quadrilateral meeting be held.    The issue of holding a quadrilateral meeting cropped up when  President Clinton, who is now visiting Europe, met with EC  Commission President Delors and other officials. During  discussion on trade issues, the two leaders agreed that the  United States and the EC should cooperate in urging Japan to  further open its markets. In response, U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor and EC Commissioner Leon Brittan (in charge of  external economic affairs) have agreed that consultations should  be held at the quadrilateral meeting in an effort to further  improve market access conditions on which an agreement was  reached under the Uruguay Round talks.    It is expected that the United States and the EC will demand  that Japan further lower or abolish its tariffs on timber,  copper, distilled liquor, and other products. The tariff issue  concerning these products was concluded at a quadrilateral  meeting held in Geneva at the end of last year, and the final  agreement was reached under the Uruguay Round. In the  negotiating process under the Uruguay Round, while the United  States and the EC demanded the withdrawal of tariffs on such  products as timber, Japan refused their demand. It is said  that, "even after the Uruguay Round conclusion, "the U.S. and  European industrial circles are exerting pressure on their  governments, (according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  [MFA]).    Japan has stressed its view that "because negotiating  countries, including the United States, have reached an  agreement on the Uruguay Round in a package, it is inappropriate  to renegotiate on a part of the agreement," (as stated by the  MFA). Some government officials have pointed out that "since  Japan also wants to make some demands such as that the United  States and the EC abolish tariffs on electronics products, no  conclusion will be reached if a quadrilateral meeting is held,"  (according to a senior MITI official). However, because it  seems that the United States and the EC are trying to encircle  Japan with the two leaders playing a leading role, this is a  source of concern for the Japanese Government officials.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Fashion: Back to the future - Grecian style / In search of ancient trinkets The glitter of modern jewellery, yours for a king's ransom, may have magpie appeal but it is easy to tire of its insistent brand of glamour. As even relatively worthless costume jewellery from a fashionable couture house can run into hundreds - sometimes thousands - of pounds, why not consider jewellery from the classical world? Its appeal lies not only in the soft, matt colouring of the gold, the simple design, the modest use of cabochon rather than facetted stones, but also in the fact that it is relatively undervalued. For a few hundred pounds you can buy an ancient Roman ring, inset with a cornelian intaglio or, for a few thousand, a simple gold torque. Anna Somers Cocks, editor of The Art Newspaper and former jewellery expert at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, says that, historically, male collectors were interested in sculpture, pots and intaglio - jewellery lay forgotten and uncollected. But ancient jewellery excites the imagination. Would the Roman senator who wore an amethyst intaglio ring have been living when the news arrived of the crucifixion of a prophet called Jesus Christ? Perhaps I have found the very ring to which Ovid penned these thoughts before he sent it to his beloved: 'May she receive thee with glad heart, and straightaway slip thee on her finger; mayst thou fit her as well as she fits me and press her finger with aptly adjusted circle]' The pretty lemon-yellow hue of early Greek gold is explained by the fact that it was only about 75 per cent pure. In the classical period, stones were seldom used, enamel work was preferred, a feature put down to taste rather than lack of supply, according to Doctor Dyfri Williams of the British Museum. Once Alexander the Great opened up trade with the east, the Middle Eastern preference for coloured gems such as emeralds, garnets and amethysts, resulted in more flamboyant, attention-seeking jewellery being made. Regional tastes, it seems, do not change much down the ages. In spite of the bold size of some pieces, early Greek jewellery tends to be remarkably light (and therefore brittle) because it is made from hammered out sheets of gold, not cast or solid metal. The eye is struck by the complexity of the handwork. Minuscule round-section wires, made by hammering and burnishing a thin rod of gold, were twisted and then rolled between two flat surfaces of wood or metal and then used to create ornate and delicate filigree work. Tiny grains of gold were heated, melted and rolled into spheres and then placed in clusters on a piece of beaten gold. Many can hardly be seen with the naked eye; only a microscope can reveal the exacting nature of such a craft. On Wednesday, Christie's will be auctioning a private collection of ancient gold jewellery as part of its fine antiquities sale in London. The sale includes necklaces, earrings, finger rings and pendants from the 8th century BC to the 12th century AD. The following day, Sotheby's is offering a smaller array of ancient jewellery. For inspiration, the reader may wish to visit the spectacular exhibition of Greek gold at the British Museum (until October 23), sponsored by Cartier. There, brought together for the first time, are nearly 200 pieces of the finest classical Greek jewellery from all parts of the Mediterranean. If you do decide to buy from other than reputable dealers, be warned - some collectors believe that up to 50 per cent of the 'ancient' jewellery on the market is fake. Beginners should be prepared to make mistakes. Dr Jack Ogden, who authenticated the forthcoming Christie's sale and is a well- regarded expert who runs the Cambridge Centre for Precious Metal Research, is the man to verify any serious investment. 'You must ask the right questions because fakes are harder and harder to detect,' he warns. Clearly, experience counts but, as a rule, he would suggest that 'there are few fakes produced before 1970 that are really going to fool someone who takes it seriously'. Forgery aside, many academics detest the trading of antiquities, arguing that it encourages grave-robbing and the destruction of archaeological sites. However, Dr Ogden argues: 'Whenever there's a market in anything it encourages theft, whether it's a house robbery for an old master, a bike shed raid for an old bike in Cambridge or a grave for antiquities. The pieces on the market are not going to be re-buried. I see my job as trying to record as much information as possible.' While he admits to wearing a gold bracelet dating back to 700 BC, Dr Ogden is gradually changing his opinion about whether these ancient pieces should be worn. 'Wearing a piece does damage it and it also makes it much harder to authenticate because a lot of the evidence is on the surface; the tool marks, the deposits and so on. And gold does change slightly with time when worn. And that rich matt colour begins to dissipate.' However, he sees little wrong in wearing unimportant pieces and even encourages the knowing purchase of acknowledged fakes. 'A couple of years ago there was a gorgeous pair of fake Greek earrings on the market for about Pounds 2,000. They were absolutely stunning. Even a great piece of fakery, if you know it's fake, can be a bargain.' Alessandro Castellani's Victorian fakes, for instance, are highly sought-after and very collectable. In this growing market, Dr Ogden's research centre is consulted by costume jewellery dealers. Recently, the centre was asked to authenticate 1940s Chanel brooches. 'At Dollars 500 or Dollars 600 a piece, people are bound to try and fake them. It's a joke really,' says Ogden. One is left with the view that unless investing serious money (in which case extensive and costly tests of verification can be sought), then enjoy these pieces for their refined style and the possibility, however remote, that Caesar's concubine may have worn your brooch. Sources of ancient jewellery (071 code unless indicated) include: Christie's, London. (Tel: 839 9060 - Sarah Hornsby). Sotheby's, London. (493 8080 - Felicity Nicholson). Susan Hadida, Faustus Fine Art. (930 1864). Rupert Wace, 107 Jermyn Street, London SW1. (495 1623). Robin Symes, 94 Jermyn Street, London SW1. (930 9856). Allegra Donn. (381 1568). For expert verification - Jack Ogden. Tel: Cambridge 0223-67232. Susan Hadida, Rupert Wace and Robin Symes, although operating in the same street, deal with different areas of the market. Hadida's prices range from Pounds 50 for a thin bronze Byzantine bracelet to Pounds 15,000 for an early Byzantine gold, glass and mother of pearl bracelet. The atmosphere at her premises is informal. Hadida wants to dispel the illusion that 'these things can't be touched or worn and only belong in museums'. Rupert Wace can offer a Romano-British bronze and enamel brooch for between Pounds 50 and Pounds 1,000 or a wearable Roman intaglio ring for about Pounds 1,000. The pride of his collection, which he sold to Durham Museum for Pounds 5,000, was an Egyptian amethyst and gold necklace (800 BC) which, in the early 19th century, had belonged to the Duke of Northumberland. Robin Symes has been dealing in antiquities since the early 1970s and has, particularly, interested academic collectors. You may be able to buy Roman earrings for Pounds 200 but, more typically, a fine Greek gold chain for Pounds 40,000.</p>

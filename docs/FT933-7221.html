			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: Milan market defies gloom from Rome Amid booming international bourses, Milan, once a sluggard, has been up with the pace setters. Shares in Italy have risen by 35 per cent this year, one of the sharpest increases of any of the main markets. Yet unlike the rises in London and New York, the boom in Italian stocks seems remote from economic fundamentals. Share prices have moved in almost inverse proportion to the gloominess of recent economic news from Rome, and if current business data guided the indices, stocks would be sliding, not soaring. Industrial output and employment have both fallen sharply this year. Jobless totals have hit almost 3m - a national average of 12 per cent. But that masks an unemployment rate of 21.3 per cent in the depressed south - nearly three times the 7.9 per cent prevailing in the centre and the north. Industrial production dropped by 1.3 per cent in June compared with the previous month. After stabilising in the first quarter, output for the second quarter was 1.2 per cent below that in the first three months of the year, while the first half was 4.2 per cent down on the same period of 1992. The figures have prompted dire warnings about lengthening dole queues when Italy's big factories reopen at the end of the August holidays. The number of workers in government-backed short-time working or redundancy schemes has already soared 35 per cent in the first five months of this year against the same period of 1992. 'The surge in unemployment suggests that consumers are unlikely to step up spending soon,' says the US bank J P Morgan in Milan. The downturn has been most acute in the motor industry. Car sales have slumped by about 26 per cent this year - one of the sharpest falls on record. The plunge, steeper than that in either France or Germany, makes depressing reading for Fiat executives, putting the final touches to next month's press launch of the new Punto small car. While one set of spokesmen prepares for the huge beanfeast in Fiat's home town of Turin, others are having to explain why up to 38,000 workers will be on short-time working in September. The theory is that the lower lira should promote an export boom to compensate for the domestic turndown. On paper, the argument looks convincing. The lira closed on Friday about 23 per cent below last September's pre-flotation parity against the D-Mark. At its weakest earlier this year, when one D-Mark was worth almost L1,000, the devaluation was more than 30 per cent. The flaw in the argument is the recession abroad. 'The lira may be weak, but what's the point when your neighbours don't want to spend any money,' says one bank economist. While exports have risen, they have hardly boomed. The overall customs trade surplus in the first five months of the year was L5,700bn (Pounds 2.37bn), against a L2,800bn deficit in the same period of last year. However, analysis of this year's figures is complicated by changes in the European Community's methods of collecting data because of the single market. According to J P Morgan, imports in the first quarter appear to have been understated while the surge in exports is expected to have moderated in the second. The gloomy economic climate has hit Italy's banks, which have warned of much higher provisions this year after the already substantial allowances made last year. The problems at Ferruzzi, Italy's second biggest private company, staggering under total borrowings of L28,838bn, have captured the limelight. But the Ferruzzi crisis is just the most acute in a string of corporate rescues. Recent figures from the Bank of Italy show that problem loans by commercial banks rose to L42,016bn at the end of May from L37,428bn last December and L32,613bn at the end of 1991. Special credit institutions, which concentrate on medium and long-term industrial lending, have also suffered, with a 21 per cent rise in problem loans to L17,835bn at the end of May compared with December 1991. There has been a trickle of brighter news. Inflation, though edging upwards recently, remained at an acceptable 4.4 per cent in July. Meanwhile, real wage costs have dropped appreciably. The process began with last year's landmark union-employer agreement to abolish the scala mobile wage indexation system. An additional accord last month created a new wage bargaining system, designed to prevent the recurrence of inflationary wage settlements. However, it will be some time before the benefits come through in terms of more jobs. Moderate inflation and falling wage costs have encouraged the Bank of Italy to cut interest rates, along with parliamentary progress in passing the government's latest budget plans. The central bank slashed the discount rate by 1 percentage point to 9 per cent in July, the lowest level since 1976. However, it is the government, rather than business, which has been the main beneficiary of lower interest rates so far. While yields on treasury bills have virtually halved since last September, business people are still complaining that bank lending rates have not fallen so far or so fast. Facing big provisions, the banks seem determined to widen their margins. The drop in interest rates has come as a tonic for the budget deficit. Combined with a 9.3 per cent rise in tax receipts in the first half, lower rates on government bonds should help the government meet its deficit-reduction plans. Its target is to stabilise the ratio between debt and gross domestic product - rising inevitably because of the recession - at 123 per cent by 1996, compared with 109 per cent last year. The deficit is expected to be around L150,000bn this year. In time, action to prune the deficit and reduce interest charges should rub off on business confidence. Already the booming bourse suggests that investors are focusing more on the government budgetary outlook than on gloomier corporate news.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: Major eschewed a safety net Sir, The blizzard of criticism of John Major over sterling misses one important point. Mr Major knew he could have defended the currency by raising interest rates, either by two or three points, when the pound first started to come under pressure, or by swingeing amounts at the last moment (as Sweden and Eire did). Not only did he choose not to inflict this burden on the economy; without the benefit of this safety net he deliberately raised his own profile in the psychological war against the speculators. He could hardly have been unaware that his credibility and standing would suffer even more damage if his tactic failed. Should we not admire this? Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, 18 Holly Walk, London NW3 6RA</p>

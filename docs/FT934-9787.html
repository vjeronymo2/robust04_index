			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wardle Storeys declines to Pounds 8.04m WARDLE Storeys, the plastics and safety equipment company which has more than Pounds 30m cash, showed full year pre-tax profits down, mainly because of lower interest earnings and an accounting change. The company had flagged difficult conditions in its last report and accounts, but shares fell 17p to close at 431p. The company said interest rates are likely to fall further, while trading conditions in the UK showed no sign of recovery and continental European markets were in 'disarray'. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 9.81m to Pounds 8.04m in the year to August 31 on sales of Pounds 53.2m (Pounds 50.6m). Under FRS 3, Wardle re-classified a Pounds 563,000 extraordinary gain as an exceptional, which raised the comparative figure. Mr Brian Taylor, chief executive, said: 'We have been trying like hell to make an acquisition. No-one, least of all me because I own 13 per cent of the company, is unaware that we ought to transfer that cash into operational assets. 'It is easy to make an acquisition but difficult to make a good one.' Mr Taylor said profits over the past three years had been a function of introducing new products as much as efficiency measures. Cost cutting could not go on indefinitely but he said the company had proven its ability to increase the yield from raw materials and to make all kinds of economies on a continuing basis. Operating profits slipped to Pounds 5.84m (Pounds 5.93m) and net cash fell slightly with interest income down at Pounds 2.21m (Pounds 3.32m). Earnings per share dropped to 21.7p (25p) and the board is recommending a final dividend of 12.25p (12p) giving a total for the year of 17.25p (16p). COMMENT Wardle's reliably good yield should provide some support for its shares. However, the market is unhappy about continuing poor trading conditions and disappointed by these results notwithstanding Wardle's early warnings. The figures include the benefit of a roughly 10 per cent drop in the price of PVC, a significant raw material for the company's largest division, technical products. This drop reversed in October. Meanwhile both the City and the company know the key is putting the company's cash to better use by acquisition. On forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.5m earnings rise to 23.1p giving a multiple of 20 times which is unlikely to find many buyers.</p>

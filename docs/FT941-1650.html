			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Let's be the 51st state This memo was discovered wrapped around a Motorola mobile telephone, on the pavement outside a Japanese government ministry. To: The Cabinet Office. From: Interministerial Sub-committee on Economic Relations. Title: Adhesion to the US. Dear Sirs, You asked for advice on Japan's strategy in the trade dispute with the US. We present a modest proposal for inclusion in the package of measures to open Japan to imports, due to be unveiled by the end of the month. The government should present an application for Japan to be accepted as a state of the United States of America. Constitutional experts tell us that Japan might, in some important areas, expect less intervention than now from Washington in the exercise of its sovereign rights if it became a US state. We make this suggestion both in the spirit of responding to US criticisms of the Japanese bureaucracy's alleged lack of imagination, and on national (or state) interest grounds. US membership could bring the following benefits. Economic: Japan's current account surplus would vanish and reappear where Washington appears to want it, as a US surplus. There would be little practical difference to Japanese economic policy. The Tokyo government is already used to importing the US example, on monetary policy in the late 1980s and on fiscal matters, if incompletely this year. Currency union between the yen and the dollar would be the opportunity we need for correcting the Japanese currency's over-valuation and the dollar's under-valuation. The fact that Congress's constitutional right to fix the value of money would mean it had the power to set the dollar-yen alignment parity need not be a problem. Japan's 124m people would carry a certain political weight in the new US with its enlarged population of 374m. In theory, that should allow the new state of Japan to lay claim to around a third of the seats in the House of Representatives. We recommend Y360 to the dollar, the rate prevailing before the 1971 abandonment of the gold link, as the starting point for negotiations on the alignment parity. Japanese purchasers of US government bonds would be able to pick up more, free of exchange rate risk, while US institutions, strong buyers of Tokyo stocks recently, could sweep the market. Japanese banks, meanwhile, would be happy to hand monetary policy to Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, given his experience in defending US banks in trouble. Trade: The guarantee of free trade between US states, as laid down in the US constitution, would remove the basis for dispute with Washington. No more arguing over the definition of a foreign made semiconductor chip, nor haggling over mobile telephone technology. No more anti-dumping suits. This would unleash a flow of cheap imports, from food to cosmetics, to the new state of Japan, supporting the existing policies of new governor Morihiro Hosokawa promoting deregulation and lower consumer prices. The consequences would be spread through the larger US economy to both sides' benefit. Japan would get an economic boost and the US a dose of deflation. The increased size of the US single market would help both sides get richer and provide a counterbalance to the European Union, another power bloc taking on new members. Our constitutional advisers, at the same time, note that US states do have a certain latitude to impose state tariff barriers to trade, on health and safety grounds. This opens the appealing prospect of reimposing the ban on non-Japanese rice, in the same spirit as the Californian ban on many kinds of imported citrus fruit. We believe, however, that there should be no inter-state trade barriers for the car industry. It would be a positive benefit for the new Japanese state to switch from driving on the left, to driving to the right, as in the rest of the US. This would be welcome to the car industries of our new state neighbours, but pose no practical problem for Japanese car producers, long accustomed to adjusting models to local markets. Nor should this pose a problem for Japanese drivers, since the residents of Okinawa island switched from right to left in the mid-1960s without mishap. Foreign policy: Our government has often been criticised for its lack of one. Like it or not, we think this is close to the truth. But as a US state, it would be unconstitutional to run our own foreign policy, so we could all sigh with relief. We could even disband the military. That would please Prime Minister Hosokawa since it would keep the Socialists on his side in the coalition. Power structure: There need be no change of Japanese government. Nor need Japan reverse its recent electoral reforms, since states are entitled to establish their own systems for state elections. Mr Hosokawa's eight years as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture should equip him well to be a state governor. Who knows, he might even succeed former governor Bill Clinton, if the Japanese lobby takes root in Washington. The emperor: As far as we know, no US state has one, though the territory of Hawaii used to have a king until 1898. However, we believe that the freedom of religion clause in the first amendment assures Japan's right to keep its emperor, on the grounds that his father was - for some of his life - a god.</p>

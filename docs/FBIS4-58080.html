			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray', head of the PLO's Economic </F> Department, by Kamal Tarabayh, in Paris on 29 April; from the  "The Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Tarabayh] We appreciate your taking time off to  speak on "The Event" program to mark the signing in Paris of an  agreement setting out future economic relations between the  Palestinians and Israel. You have been involved from the start  in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, first about self-rule  and later about economic issues. Are you comfortable with the  results?    [Quray'] I cannot contain my relief over the agreement  reached about the issues that we dealt with -- what we have  called the Paris Economic Relations Pact. The interim stage and  the self-rule laws restrict our ambition to start a completely  independent institution. However, the results we have attained  from these negotiations lay the foundations and sow the strong  seeds of an independent Palestinian state. Let me give you an  example. Take currency and banks...    [Tarabayh, interrupting] So, from your perspective this is a  general agreement that lays the foundations for the economic  ties between Israel and the Palestinians.    [Quray'] That's correct. It is also a contractual agreement  for the interim stage, not a final agreement. It is not an  agreement whereby tariffs are nonexistent, as some have said.  It is not a free trade agreement, as has been rumored. It is a  contractual agreement for a transition period during which  relations will be regulated and the Israeli and Palestinian  economies will be disengaged...    [Tarabayh, interrupting] With the understanding that the  agreement be reviewed later?    [Quray'] Yes, periodically. And, in the final stage, it  will be reviewed radically and completely.    [Tarabayh] How does the agreement address the banking and  monetary system?    [Quray'] Right from the start of the occupation, the  Israelis have sought to shut down the banks and take control of  monetary institutions and replace any Arab or foreign banks with  Israeli banks. Whoever has control of the money secures control  over the economic lifeline. That has been the policy of the  occupation authorities from the first day of occupation in 1967.  The agreement breathes new life into Palestinian financial  institutions. It also expressly provides for the establishment  of a multi-purpose Palestinian monetary institution as the  official point of reference for the National Palestinian  Authority and the public sector. It will act as an advisory  body and hold the reserves of the National Palestinian  Authority. There will be a special administration that will be  responsible for licensing commercial banks and specialized banks  and exchange services and money markets. It will monitor their  performance and transactions.    [Tarabayh] Under what sort of monetary authority, a central  bank, or what?    [Quray'] It will be not be called a central bank, but will  handle all the responsibilities of one, except issue Palestinian  currency. The institution that was established is a Palestinian  central bank minus the function of issuing currency. You know  that in some Arab states there is what they call the monetary  agency, as in Saudi Arabia. It enjoys the full powers of  issuing and protecting currency, among other functions. Thus,  the establishment of the Palesinian Monetary Authority is one of  the important seeds of Palestinian sovereignty and national  independence. It is the only and fundamental means of  reinjecting the Palestinian economy's veins with blood that has  dried up over the years of occupation.    [Tarabayh] But, in this context, you have registered a  retreat with regard to the Palestinian currency. What was the  alternative?    [Quray'] As a matter of fact, the issue has nothing to do  with either a retreat or progress on our part. We never thought  the issue of launching a Palestinian currency would be  accomplished without difficulties. We do have the right to  issue a Palestinian currency. This right has remained intact.  The agreement has underscored the Palestinians' right to issue  their own currency. Hence, the agreement stipulated that the  talks will continue, through the Joint Palestinian-Israeli  Committee, in the immediate aftermath of the signing of this  agreement to examine and consider the issuance of Palestinian  currency. They have made offers that we have categorically  rejected.    [Tarabayh] What are the offers they have made?    [Quray'] For instance, they have offered the issuance of a  currency similar to the Scottish currency. We have  categorically rejected this. This Palestinian currency was  meant to be guaranteed by the Central Bank of Israel. We  rejected this. We are speaking of an independent Palestinian  currency to be issued by the Palestinian National Authority. If  not possible today, let it be issued six months, or one year,  from now.    [Tarabayh] Pending the materialization of this, what  currency  will be used? Will it be the Israeli shekel?    [Quray'] First, there is the Jordanian dinar, which is a  basic and major currency in circulation. Moreover, there is  also the shekel, which is also in circulation. They wanted the  shekel to be legal tender [preceding two words in English]. We  rejected this. We eventually agreed that the shekel will be a  circulated currency. It goes without saying that we cannot do  without the shekel as a circulated currency. This issue must be  clear. For what is important is not to stick to slogans, but  rather to be aware of the practices on the ground. The shekel  is circulated on the ground. There are 2 billion shekels in  circulation among the people. The workers' revenues and wages,  which exceed $500-700 million per year, are paid in shekels.  The trade exchange is also a factor to be taken into account.  You cannot forget about these three factors at will, or just to  vindicate a slogan. But, you can streamline, examine, and  control these factors until you reach the desired situation.  Hence, during the interim period, this interim contractual  economic agreement will determine our moves with regard to the  Israeli, Jordanian, or Palestinian currencies.    [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-'Ala': One of the outstanding issues  concerned customs tariffs. There were Israeli concerns about  this issue. By contrast, there was Palestinian determination  regarding uncontrolled imports to the occupied territories. The  Palestinians have eventually triumphed.    [Quray'] As a matter of fact, I can say we have achieved a  significant part of what we sought in this area. We have not  achieved all that we wanted. It is impossible for us to achieve  all that we want.    [Tarabayh] How then have you dispelled Israeli concerns?    [Quray'] Let me tell you how. First, during the interim  period, there are no demarcated borders. Consequently, the  movement of commodities will continue to be free. The free  movement of commodities from one market to another will cause  one market to lose considerably if the customs tariffs are not  close to one another. This was one of the major arguments they  have advanced in this regard. I also believe that there were  political considerations at play here. For, since the  occupation of 1967, they have erected a high and extremely  stringent wall of customs tariffs around the occupied  territories. They incorporated the exports and imports of the  occupied territories into the exports and imports of Israel.  This all became part and parcel of the Israeli trade balance.  Hence, there was no regional or international trade status for  the occupied Palestinian territories. This status lost its  distinct identity, and became part of the Israeli economy. This  is how they planned. Now, what has this agreement produced?  This agreement has put forth three, or four highly significant  basic principles.    The first principle is that imports reflect the nature of  the  trade situation. There were no Arab ties at all with the  occupied territories. Trade ties between the Arab countries and  the occupied territories were one-sided. It is true that Arab  countries received imports from the occupied territories.  However, these countries have not exported commodities to these  territories. Moreover, Palestinian merchants, businessmen, or  lay men were unable to import commodities from Arab countries.    The other issue is that there were no ties at all with the  Islamic world. Such ties were banned and prohibited.    The third issue is that the entire trade transactions, as  well as the export and import operations with the outside world  were part of the Israeli trade, as I have just mentioned.  Therefore, this customs wall requires a shake, some  disturbance, and a loophole if the new Palestinian baby is to be  catapulted onto its strategic Arab stage, further onto its  Islamic stage, and then onto the international stage. This has  been achieved. Imports have been streamlined. There are four  lists, in addition to a fifth one. The first list of  commodities, on which we have agreed, concerns Arab products  that will be procured by the occupied territories, particularly  products coming from Egypt and Jordan. With regard to this  list, it is the Palestinian authority that will make all customs  and import policies regarding this list of commodities.  Furthermore, it is the agency that will decide on the proper  customs tariffs and fees in complete independence.    There is another list called A2. This is also a completely  independent list of commodities including the commodities that  will be imported from Arab and Islamic states. It is the first  time Islamic states are being dealt with. It is the Palestinian  authority that will determine the policies and customs tariffs  and fees regarding this list of commodities in total freedom.    The third list concerns international aid, in development  requirements, humanitarian aid, or construction equipment, etc.  Once again, it is the Palestinian authority alone that will, by  itself, decide on the customs fees of this list of commodities,  the rates of these fees, and how these commodities enter the  territories. This authority will make the overall policy  regarding this list of commodities.    [Tarabayh] How is the Israeli authority then involved in  this?    [Quray'] These lists are a Palestinian decision. The fourth  list, which we called List B, is a very big one. The  Palestinian authority decides all fees, custom tariffs, purchase  tax, and others. However, imports, licenses, standards, and  measurements will follow a joint policy. Luxury goods will also  be subjected to joint tariffs and duties. This customs system,  or customs wall, which was standing like steel around the  occupied territory, has been shaken and the Palestinians emerged  from it with a small customs book, which will undoubtedly grow  and get bigger. For the sake of truth, it should be said that  we were joined with brothers from Jordan on a very high level of  knowledge, experience, expertise, and responsibility. They came  from the high levels of power. They were with us for one and  one-half months or more. We cooperated with each other, reached  understanding, and discussed the overall proposed topics on a  daily basis. We were also in constant and almost daily contact  with our brothers in Egypt and a large number of experts and  officials. We discussed things and exchanged views with them  because we need expertise and experience in such matters.    [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-'Ala', there are many points in the  agreement, particularly on tourism, agriculture, industry,  energy, insurance, and so forth. In you opinion and without  delving into the details of these points, what was the most  prominent Palestinian accomplishment among these sectors?    [Quray'] I can say all these sectors. However, if I speak or  someone addresses me on the basis of complete 100 percent  independence, I will tell him no. I do not want to exaggerate  or downplay the importance of what happened. What happened is  something important. It is a seed, as I have said, to build a  Palestinian entity, a Palestinian authority, an independent  Palestinian state, but it is not complete. Had this been  independence, I would not have negotiated anything with the  Israelis. But I negotiated because it is a transitional phase.  In all the mentioned sectors, we took the main seeds that  prepare for the establishment of the independent institution.  Industry is now our decision and the standards we decide will  be the ones which will govern the industrial process. We are  the ones who license industry and run its products.  Accordingly, there is an independent Palestinian economic  decision in the process of developing the industrial sector.  The same applies to agriculture. There was a totally closed  market in favor of the Israeli products. Only Israel had access  to the Palestinian market without allowing the Palestinian  products to enter the Israeli market. This new agreement opens  the Israeli market for the first time to Palestinian  agricultural products. The market has become open to both  sides. Experience proves that Palestinian agricultural products  are competitive. The simple Palestinian peasant managed to  prove his very high competitive efficiency and capability in  terms of quality and price. Now the Israeli market is open for  him and competition is also open for him. I have great  confidence that this Palestinian farmer will triumph in the  process of competition. What we should not ignore, and what all  our brothers the economists and others should know, is that they  must exactly know the suffering and problems of all people,  peasants, farmers, or workers before passing judgment.    [Tarabayh] What about tourism in the transitional phase?    [Quray'] A tourism authority has also been established. It  enjoys all jurisdictions enjoyed by any ministry or tourism  institution in any independent state. It is true that the  jurisdiction of this tourism authority will come gradually, as  stated in the Declaration of Principles. It will begin in Gaza  and Jericho and then extend to the rest of the West Bank. This  authority will be in charge of licensing the tourism  institutions and guides and defining the historical, cultural,  and religious sites. It can send its tourist buses to Israel or  abroad and receive buses from the opposite direction. It can  strike contracts with the tourism delegations.    [Tarabayh] Have tourism relations with Israel been defined?    [Quray'] They have not yet taken detailed form, but in  general there is an exchange of tourists between us. The  tourist who comes to them can come to areas of the Palestinian  authority and vice versa.    [Tarabayh] What about the tourism development projects in  Gaza and the Gaza beaches, for example?    [Quray'] This is a Palestinian decision by the Palestinian  authority. Israel has not played any role in this and such  cases have not even been discussed. Issues of joint work have  not been discussed whether in the tourism or other sectors. We  are in the stage of charting the framework laws, regulations,  and bases of the Palestinian economic work and its organization.    [Tarabayh] Brother Abu-al-'Ala', when we interviewed you a  month ago, the issue of the Palestinian manpower was one of the  strongest issues on the agenda. In particular, there were  statements by Israeli officials calling for replacing the  Palestinian workers by foreign workers, particularly Asian  workers. What was decided on this issue?    [Quray'] In fact, they wanted, and this is no longer a  secret, to exploit this issue as a blackmail card. They use it  from time to time. I do not mean during the negotiations, but  in general. I mean when an operation is carried out, there will  be collective and comprehensive punishment, and 70,000 or  100,000 workers are blocked. This is a collective punishment.  It was used. Even at the negotiations, there was an attempt to  use the workers issue as a blackmail card. We have refused to  submit to this blackmail. Concerning the workers paper, we were  interested in the following issues: First, there must be  ordinary and normal movement of workers. At the beginning, we  sought for this to be a free movement. They said we control the  size of this manpower. We said that we also control its size.  So, the process has become a mutual one. I mean that if they  have the right to determine this from time to time, we also  should have the right to decide on this from time to time. This  is one issue. Another issue is that we were very concerned that  since we seek to organize future labor relations, then all  workers' rights must be the responsibility of the Palestinian  authority, and that we should establish the necessary funds of  social security and insurance to guarantee the workers' rights.  This was met with positive response. The basic and important  issue, which took a large part of the discussion and dialogue,  is that we were very concerned about the fact that since this  agreement regulates future relations, then it must not be unfair  to or undermine acquired rights. Consequently, in this  agreement, we have stressed that it regulates future relations,  but it does not close the file on any issue related to the  acquired rights of workers. On the contrary, it opens this file  at the appropriate time. It has also confirmed that there are  acquired rights.    [Tarabayh] This means that it guarantees the rights of the  Palestinian manpower in Israel as they were before autonomy.  Brother Abu-al-'Ala', finally, there is a question posing  itself: Is there any contradiction between your economic  agreement with Israel and that of the economic agreement with  Jordan?    [Quray'] In order to be accurate, I would like to say that  our main relationship is with the Arabs in general, and with  Jordan and Egypt in particular. This is our natural  relationship, which can be relationship of cooperation,  brotherhood, unity, solidarity, integration. This is the  relationship which has a strategic depth. Our relationship with  Israel can be a relationship of cooperation or relationship  which may or may not involve joint interests. However, with the  Arab side, this relationship must be based on brotherhood,  unity, and integration, etc. The nature of the interim period  does not give the Palestinian side one hundred percent freedom  to organize this relationship as we really want it to be. Our  brothers in Jordan and Egypt understand this very accurately.  This is why we say that they have contributed to forming the  results of these negotiations.    [Tarabayh] For example, what about banking relations with  Jordan?    [Quray'] The truth is that our relations go beyond this.  This issue has its own philosophy in order to be able to cross  from the interim period into a situation whose features we draw,  and whose results are not imposed on us. This relationship with  Jordan includes everything. It includes money, economy, trade,  borders, customs, security, etc. This is especially true,  taking into consideration that half of the Palestinians, or  less, live in Jordan, as well as the nature of the fraternal,  historical, and social relations. This issue cannot be evaded  or ignored.    In the matter of the banks, there is no doubt there will be  a relationship. We have now taken from the Israelis the  Palestinian monetary authority -- banks, licensing, and so on.  We must be liberal and indulgent with our brothers in Jordan,  more than anything else in the interest of building Palestinian  institutions, availing ourselves of Jordanian expertise, and  organizing the operation, performance, and monitoring of the  banks during the interim stage, or for a duration to be agreed  upon. The agreement reached with Jordan addressed these points  and the commercial and economic links, in addition to the  banking system and the movement of money.    [Tarabayh] My last question, brother Abu-al-'Ala'. What is  your reaction to a remark made by Israel's Finance Minister  Avraham Shohat following the signing of the agreement. He said  the agreement should make it possible for the Palestinian and  Israeli people to start and share a new life.    [Quray'] Let me put it like this: The agreement shifts the  Palestinians from a state of dependency to one of a free  decision whether to extend or withhold cooperation. We should  also be able to determine the shape of that cooperation. As I  have said at the beginning, we were in a state of total  dependency where the Palestinians had no say. Now, they have a  say; there is a transition period that calls for some measure of  cooperation on a number of issues. We have now moved from a  state of dependency where the Palestinians had no say to a  certain form of cooperation necessitated by the nature of the  transition period. The Palestinians will make their own  decisions.    [Tarabayh] Thank you Abu-al-'Ala', Mr. Ahmad Quray', the  PLO's Economic Department chief. One last word about the  self-rule agreement, expected to be signed next Wednesday [4  May] in Cairo?    [Quray'] I think that, barring unforeseen, last-minute  snags, the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be signed in Cairo and  then the Declaration of Principles agreement launched on the  ground. When that happens, I think the agreement itself will be  seen in a better light, and, at the same time, it will advance  Palestinian interests. If the agreement is not put into practice  it will be seen in a bad light and set back Palestinian  interests. We, therefore, should, from the beginning, be keen  to render the agreement a success.    [Tarabayh] Thank you, brother Abu-al-'Ala'.    [Quray'] Thank you.</p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT GOES ON: NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Fullerton College troupe that will stage "Tracers" at the Edinburgh  Festival in Scotland, one of Europe's major international arts gatherings, has  raised $21,000 so far toward the cost of the trip. A benefit performance of the  Vietnam War drama last week added $2,000 to their fund-raising goal of $28,000,  theater department chairman Bob Jensen said. Local and national corporations  have contributed only $250, he said, despite a vigorous campaign seeing their  help. "A number of companies wrote saying, 'Thanks, but no thanks," Jensen  noted. "I was told informally that some of them thought the play was too  controversial to support." Jensen said there is "no chance" the troupe will not  go to Edinburgh for its scheduled performances (Aug. 16 to Sept. 3). The cast  and crew of 18 people have agreed to ante up $7,000 if more donations can't be  raised, he said.  </P></p>

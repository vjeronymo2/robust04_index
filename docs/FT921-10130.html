			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Management: Chameleons in their true colours How times change. To be branded as either a 'chameleon' or a 'collaborator' always used to be an insult. The first epithet meant you were unreliable, trying to be all things to all people. The second meant you were consorting with the enemy. But both words have suddenly become compliments, in the corporate world, at least. They indicate not only that your organisation has an above average chance of surviving the intense competitive battles of coming decades, but also that it is a rewarding place for people to work. So says a stimulating new study on strategies and structures for fast-moving markets, which attempts to synthesize and demystify leading-edge theory and practice in virtually every walk of management. Under the straightforward title of 'Building Flexible Companies'*, it condenses into admirably simple English its discussion of some of the most jargon-ridden fashions and practices of the day: 'customer focus'; total quality management (TQM); flat hierarchies and 'value-driven' networks; teamwork; time-based competition; and strategic alliances. The competitive environment of the 1990s and beyond requires companies to become two things above all, argues the report. First, they must be 'change-based and adaptive' - hence the 'chameleon' image. Second, they must be alliance- rather than fortress-minded, both externally towards other companies, and internally between different departments and disciplines - hence the emphasis on collaboration. Both images are more approachable formulations of management styles advocated by various academics and gurus. The collaborator notion is close to the Harvard concept of the 'boundary-less' company, while the chameleon approximates to 'living with ambiguity and paradox', or just 'reconciling opposites'. Thus the chameleon company must shift from being product-driven to customer-led, but without going too far, as Ford of Europe did with the design of its latest Escort car which was based over-literally on the apparent desires of mid-1980s customers, and has proved too bland for today's. Likewise, the chameleon company must dismantle much of the corporate hierarchy in order to be flat and fast, yet it must not abandon all co-ordination and strategic control. One company that did so, a Swedish information technolended up confused, undisciplined and directionless. It has since had to install various central functions, while retaining much of its decentralisation. This theme of Yin and Yang runs through most of the report - except, oddly enough, in the sections on collaboration with other companies. Here, the authors are so intent on persuading corporations out of their traditional fortress mentalities, and into the new world of shifting alliances on almost every front, that they go in for overkill. They are right that the traditional model of a company is of an autonomous citadel full of knowledge, capital and skills in a stable world where such attributes are at a premium. In today's world, however, knowledge (including technology) and capital are widely available, as are most skills. In addition, markets are becoming ephemeral and liable to sudden change. So, as the study says, it is not merely uneconomic, but dangerous, for a company to try to do everything itself. Instead, the report argues that companies must themselves learn to become ephemeral, and to exploit ad hoc alliances of knowledge, skills and capacity. Contrary to what the authors claim, however, this does not mean that companies must 'abandon fixed emplacements' and 'leave behind their skills of defence'. If they did so entirely, they would have nothing left to bargain and collaborate with. They would be empty shells. Instead of going over the top in this way, the authors should have devoted more space to discussing how to balance collaboration with the fashionable and important idea of 'core competencies' - to which they pay scant attention. As expounded particularly by C. K. Prahalad of Michigan University and Gary Hamel of the London Business School, this argues that companies should first redefine what really makes them tick - Honda's engine technology, for instance, or 3M's adhesives, coatings and substrates. They should then build, leverage and defend them for all they are worth. The core competence concept is having a powerful effect on the corporate world. In both Europe and the US, companies are redefining and focusing their cores, investing more heavily in them, and exploiting them more. They sometimes use temporary alliances to help them do this but such collaboration is of a different character from that involved in sharing or contracting-out activities about which the company no longer feels proprietorial. The chameleon company is all very well - but it must stand for something more positive, and more motivating to its managers and other employees, than merely constant change. Otherwise, like many real chameleons in the natural world, it risks being squashed underfoot. *Business International, Pounds 295 in Europe, Africa and Middle East; Dollars 495 in Americas and Asia Pacific.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Dawrah Refinery teams have succeeded in producing  several local alternative products by relying on their resources  and capabilities in defiance of the unfair blockade on Iraq.    The director general of the General Oil Refining  Establishment in the central region explained that engineering  teams in the Research and Development and Light Crude Sections  of the refinery have produced two local solvents to help bolster  the national industry. These solvents, he said, go into the  production of tyres. A production unit has been modified to  produce sufficient quantities of these solvents to meet the  needs of the tyre factory in al-Najaf.</p>

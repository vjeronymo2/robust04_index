			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Petr Zhuravlev: "Ministry of Foreign Affairs and </F> Ministry of Defense Are Hurrying To Destroy Chemical Weapons:  Vil Mirzayanov Believes, as Before, That This Is Impossible"]    [Text]  <H5>  Disarmament </H5>   Parliamentary hearings took place yesterday in the State  Duma  on the question of Russia's ratification of the Convention on  the Prohibition and Destruction of Chemical Weapons. Oleg  Sokolov, head of the arms control department of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, reported that of the  154 countries that signed the convention, only four have already  ratified it at present. But the convention can go into effect  only when, at a minimum, 65 countries do this. Mr. Sokolov said  that everyone is waiting now for the document to be ratified by  the major owners of OV [toxic agents], and "the Russian  potential is the biggest in the world." Thus, "ratification of  the convention by Russia among the first 65 would be in keeping  with our national interests." In the event of delays in putting  the convention into effect, Mr. Sokolov emphasized, "it will be  necessary to consider the possibility of renewal of chemical  programs by states," and "very serious responsibility for the  disruption of the efforts of the world community" will fall on  Russia.    Gen. Yuriy Tarasevich, deputy chief of Chemical Troops of  the  Russian Federation, reported in a clear and brisk military way  that the problem of destroying the 40,000 tonnes of toxic agents  announced by Russia revolves basically around money. The amount  requirement is 2 trillion in rubles [R] (in last year's prices)  and 535 million in dollars, and a third of these resources will  be expended on the construction of "destruction facilities,"  whose site selection (there will be seven) is being worked on by  a governmental commission headed by Oleg Soskovets. In the first  phase, blister agents will be processed in Udmurtia (Kambarka  settlement) and Saratov Oblast (Gornyy settlement). The other  side of the problem, according to General Tarasevich, is the  lack of an official concept for the destruction of KhO [chemical  weapons]. However, he emphasized, the defense department is  coping successfully with this obstacle, and a draft document  developed in the Ministry of Defense has already been submitted  to the government. Mr. Tarasevich reassured those in attendance  that there have been no accidents and leakages in the storage of  toxic agents from the moment their production was stopped in  1982, and that there should be none in the foreseeable future.    The statement of Academician Anatoliy Kuntsevich, head of  the  committee on convention questions under the president of the  Russian Federation, was also presented with restrained optimism.  "Just what kind of a raw material problem does the processing of  40,000 tonnes present?!"--he asked. "The Novocheboksarsk  Chemical Combine (in one of whose shops domestic toxic agents  were produced) processes 500,000 tonnes of raw materials per  year. And here it is 40,000, over the course of 10 years  (according to the terms of the convention), and at seven  facilities..." The FRG and the United States are prepared to  assist materially and technically. In a word, Mr. Kuntsevich  declared, "the technical and technological capabilities exist,  but they have to be supported financially." Without going into  further detail, it can be said that almost all the members of  the hearings talked about the necessity for "strict financing"  as a main problem.    However, it is also necessary to mention the dissonance that  could be heard in the words of Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who has  fallen out of favor, who asserted that "during the years of  Soviet power we produced 400,000 tonnes of toxic agents." He  declared that, first, the convention "looks to the past,"  inasmuch as the newest toxic agents, which are extremely  difficult to monitor, do not fall under it. Second, Mr.  Mirzayanov emphasized, "we are not ready" for the destruction of  old toxic agents, since "we are unable to control" the  ecological situation and the state of health of the people  around the "facilities," and on the whole there are no reliable  technological processes, and also the period of 10 years is  unrealistic (25-30 years are needed). Third, "we cannot afford  this in this century." And although "this is no longer a weapon,  but old trash," in Mirzayanov's opinion, it is better to store  it for the time being than, without safe technology, to expose  people to danger.    Similar hearings were conducted in the Supreme Soviet of the  Russian Federation almost a year ago. The same people spoke  then, with the very same arguments. It only remains to be seen  whether it is for better or worse that nothing has changed  since. Except that Vil Mirzayanov has spent time in prison...</p>

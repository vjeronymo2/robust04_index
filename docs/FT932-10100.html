			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Chevening sale raises Pounds 1/2 m THE CLEAR-OUT of contents from the attics, basements and out-houses of the foreign secretary's official residence, Chevening House near Sevenoaks in Kent, yesterday raised in excess of Pounds 500,000, more than twice the estimate. Sotheby's had estimated that the 800 lots of run-of-the- mill late 18th and 19th century furniture, ceramics, pictures and silver, plus the flotsam and jetsam from the kitchen, and a Brougham carriage from the stables, might bring in Pounds 250,000. The top price was Pounds 20,700 paid by the dealer Christopher Gibbs for a large carved oak lantern stand of about 1890, which had been fitted for gas lighting. It had been estimated to sell for about Pounds 2,500. Another dealer, William Buck, paid Pounds 13,225 for a rare Worcester blue and white 'scratch cross' porringer of about 1745, estimated at Pounds 2,500. The proceeds of the auction will be used to shore up the house and the estate. The government provides no money for the upkeep of Chevening, which was given to a trust by the late Lord Stanhope, who died in 1967. Under the terms of the trust the Prime Minister can nominate the occupier of Chevening, who can either be himself (or herself), another cabinet minister, or a lineal descendant of King George VI. Mr Douglas Hurd has been the nominated person since 1989. Lord Cornwallis, chairman of the Chevening Trust finance committee, said that a doubling of expenditure and a flat income from the estate over the past 10 years might force the trustees to consider selling some of the more important items of house furniture.</p>

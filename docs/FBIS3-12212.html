A statement issued by the general secretariat of the council  today condemned the criminal aggression, and stressed that it  expressed Israeli extremism and bigotry, and carelessness for  the lives of Palestinian citizens. The statement urged the  international community to bear its responsibilities in  providing protection for the Palestinians in the occupied  Palestinian territories, stopping the crime and bloody slaughter  committed against them, and blaming the Israeli Government alone  for any results of this criminal aggression.    For its part, the General Secretariat of the organization of  the Arab Red Crescent and Red Cross societies has condemned the  regrettable incidents that took place yesterday in the  al-Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil, and stressed that these  criminal acts perpetrated by the Jewish settlers violated the  freedom of the sacred places and of innocent citizens.    In a statement issued today, the general secretariat called  for the disarming of the settlers so that such hideous crimes  may not be repeated against the innocent sons of the Palestinian  people, which is struggling to gain its legitimate rights.</p>

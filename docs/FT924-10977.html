			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Meanwhile, to the north . . . MR BRIAN Mulroney, Canada's long-suffering prime minister, has just joined the growing band of western leaders rendered impotent by popular disaffection. The decisive No pronounced by six of the country's 10 provinces in Monday's referendum on a new constitution represents a humiliating blow not just to his government but to Canada's ruling elite. It may also bring closer a prospect which politicians have been wrangling for years to fend off: the slow disintegration of Canada as a unitary state. At best, Canadians now face years of political uncertainty; at worst, they could be drifting towards a divorce - or divorces - that will be messy and acrimonious in the extreme. That may seem unduly apocalyptic. Canada remains one of the world's most prosperous countries with traditions of tolerance and moderation; its imminent break-up has been frequently predicted in the past without tangible results - most recently after the collapse of a previous, less far-reaching attempt at constitutional reform, the Meech Lake accord of 1987. Nor should Monday's result be read as a rejection of Canada by a majority of Canadians. As with Europe's Maastricht treaty, voters were considering a tortuous and flawed document - the Charlottetown accord - that sought to bridge or fudge serious conflicts of interest between provinces, and in particular to accommodate francophone Quebec's desire for special status within the federation. And as in Europe's referenda on Maastricht, those who voted No did so for a variety of reasons, ranging from disenchantment with a lacklustre ruling class to dismay at a sluggish economy. Serious setback But that does not make Monday's verdict any less serious a setback. With federal elections looming within the next 12 months, Canada will not now be able to reopen serious discussion of a constitutional settlement for years. In the meantime, it will be open season for populist politicians in the provinces who advocate greater autonomy, or separatism, without caring to spell out the consequences. This is most obviously the case in Quebec, where separatist parties hope to win the next provincial elections and would then press for another referendum on independence. But the voices of the Quebecois have echoes elsewhere - notably in the resource-rich western provinces which are tiring of providing fiscal transfers to a federation that often seems remote from their concerns, and among the aboriginal peoples seeking self-rule. Such sectional interests have been aroused by the concessions promised under Charlottetown and will not lightly retire from the fray. Since many of their demands could ultimately conflict, Canada will not be able to escape the task of negotiating to reconcile them. Separate identity Canadians may have rejected their leaders' latest proposal on Monday, but none of the issues which prompted the need for a new constitutional settlement has gone away. The centripetal pull of a country 10 times as populous to the south remains as strong as ever. Indeed, Canada will feel the force of the US market all the more strongly with the arrival of the North American Free Trade Area. Conversely, Canadians' desire to preserve a distinct political and cultural identity vis a vis their southern neighbours does not seem to have diminished. The question now is whether that is possible within one country, or can only be accomplished via separation. A divorce between Quebec and the rest of Canada would not necessarily be a disaster. There is no reason in principle why a small and compact country should find it more difficult to make its way alongside the US than a large but thinly-populated one. What matters above all is the manner of the separation, and here there are ample grounds for conflict - between the federation and the provinces over assets, between the west and the east over budgets, between the provinces and the aboriginals over land, or all of them simultaneously. Canadians will need large reserves of patience and flexibility if these pressures are not to result in damage to their country's economy and social fabric.</p>

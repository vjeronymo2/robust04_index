			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Sidlaw on target with 33% rise - Full contribution from former Courtaulds business swells profits Sidlaw Group yesterday rev-ealed a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, boosted by a full 12-month contribution from the flexible packaging businesses acquired from Courtaulds in late summer 1993. The profits for the year to September 30 were in line with estimates at the time of its Pounds 24m rights issue in October. The Courtaulds acquisition cost Pounds 78m, partially financed by a Pounds 53m cash call; the recent rights - from which the Scotland-based packaging, oil services and textiles company will have access to about Pounds 32m - was to fund a two-year reorganisation and capital expenditure programme for the packaging side. Group turnover swelled to Pounds 289.4m (Pounds 172.9m). Operating profits grew 50 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 12.5m), but sharply increased interest charges of Pounds 4.18m (Pounds 1.54m) led to a more modest pre-tax rise to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 11.1m). Mr Ian Bodie, finance director, said that accounting rules stipulated the inclusion of discounted bills in the balance sheet. This meant gearing climbed to 82 (79) per cent; otherwise it would have fallen to 64 (73) per cent. Pro forma post-rights gearing will be about 30 per cent. The packaging side made operating profits of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 4.72m) on turnover of Pounds 161.2m (Pounds 54.1m). Raw material prices for the division continue to rise with basic resin up 70 per cent over the year and polypropylene up 40 per cent. Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said shortages were being experienced but he was unsure if price peaks had yet been reached. Profits from oil services fell to Pounds 6.93m (Pounds 7.25m) on turnover of Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 94.5m) after increased losses of Pounds 472,000 (Pounds 342,000) from the Supplylink joint venture. Textiles lifted profits to Pounds 713,000 (Pounds 564,000), after the recovery of a bad debt previously written off. Turnover was 25.4m (Pounds 24.3m) and the division remains up for sale. Earnings edged ahead to 20.6p (20.3p) per share and the final dividend of 6.5p lifts the total to 11p (10.5p). COMMENT While the oil services side is a good business giving steady growth - albeit at the mercy of the oil price - the packaging side is a much riskier proposition with potentially greater rewards. Analysts now believe too much was spent on the Courtaulds businesses and their reorganisation, but that is history and there is no doubt the packaging side had to expand or wither. The capital expenditure will not show benefits for about 18 months and the 10 per cent margin target for the division by 1997 is ambitious. If achieved, however, that would give earnings of about 30p, giving the shares considerable room for improvement. The jury is out on whether Sidlaw can follow its script, but more are optimistic than not. Flat profits of Pounds 16m (after an interest fall) are forecast for earnings of about 18p and a p/e of 11, well below the market.</p>

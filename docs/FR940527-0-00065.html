For the purposes of this provision, a full academic year of study is the number of credit hours determined by each university at which Fellows are studying as constituting a full year of study at that university. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to determine Fellows' total teaching obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2400.4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

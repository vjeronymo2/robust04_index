			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Electron House doubles as semiconductors side grows Strong demand for electronic components, particularly semiconductors, together with significant productivity gains helped Electron House, the electronic components distributor, report doubled profits in the year to May 31. Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 1.98m to Pounds 4.04m on sales of Pounds 104.8m, against Pounds 89m including Pounds 10.6m from discontinued activities. Continuing activities showed growth of 34 per cent. Earnings per share jumped from a restated 4.34p to 9.66p and an increased final divided of 2p is recommended making a total up from 2.6p to 3.2p. The shares, which have risen from about 30p over the past two years, closed 2p higher yesterday at 159p. The profits were struck after redundancy payments and property write-downs of Pounds 361,000. Excluding exceptional costs, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 4.4m and earnings per share 10.6p. Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, described the results as 'most satisfactory'. He said they reflected the continuing strength of the group's key markets combined with further productivity gains generated internally which resulted in operating expenses falling from 17.8 per cent of sales to 15.8 per cent. Operating profits from continuing operations increased to Pounds 4.64m (Pounds 3.27m) while the group's strong cash flow of Pounds 5m helped reduce net interest costs to Pounds 599,000 (Pounds 1.18m) and removed net debt. Mr Leigh said that demand for electronic components, the group's core business had remained strong. The semiconductor market, which accounted for 60 per cent of group sales, was the main driving force. The UK-based components business boosted profits from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds 3.09m on sales of Pounds 59m (Pounds 37.8m) while the operations in Australia and New Zealand also showed strong gains.</p>

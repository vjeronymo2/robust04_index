			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher to cut 400 jobs at Comet after sales fall Kingfisher is planning to cut the equivalent of 400 full-time jobs from the workforce of its Comet electrical retailing chain following the introduction of new technology and a reduction in opening hours. Comet staff were told yesterday of the plans to cut total working hours by 10 per cent and to move the weekday opening time from 9am to 10am. The changes, which follow a six-month review of Comet's store operations, come against a background of difficult trading conditions. Comet's sales fell by 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, although gross margins improved. Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher's corporate affairs director, said: 'The object of the changes is to enhance service and therefore sales and to reduce costs so that we can operate profitably and successfully in a very competitive market.' Of the time freed by the shorter opening hours about 15 per cent will be used for additional staff training to improve product knowledge. Comet is investing Pounds 10m on the latest generation of electronic point of sale equipment which is currently installed in 50 stores and will be in all 233 outlets by the end of the year. This should reduce the time staff spend on stock taking, processing credit agreements and reading reports from head office. Comet is also adopting some techniques developed at Darty, Kingfisher's French electricals chain, including the focus on 'key performance indicators' such as sales per full-time equivalent and customer conversion rates. It is thought that the changes will cost Kingfisher less than Pounds 3m, of which the bulk are one-off redundancy costs. But the moves could save an estimated Pounds 4m a year. The total number of jobs lost will depend on how many full-time posts are involved and how many staff are redeployed elsewhere in the group. Last week Dixons announced plans to sell off 100 of Currys' remaining high street shops to concentrate on superstores. Comet has already completed this shift.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Guido Jose Mario Di Tella, Argentine minister of  foreign affairs, international trade, and protocol, ended his  official visit to our country on 3 February. At a news  conference he held at the airport before leaving Tunisia, he  said that President Zine El Abidine had a unique personality and  that his analyses were very clear. He also stressed the need to  intensify exchanges between the two countries, indicating that  the current export of Tunisian phosphate symbolized the new  relations that the two countries intended to establish. In the  same context, he said that he hoped President Ben Ali would pay  a visit to Argentina, adding that such a visit would offer new  opportunities to deepen bilateral relations on the one hand and  to deepen Argentina's relations with the Arab world on the other  hand.    The Argentine minister also talked about the importance of  strengthening bilateral relations as a necessary phase for the  building of relations between regional groupings, such as the  Arab Maghreb Union and the Organization of Cooperation and Trade  for Latin American countries [as heard]. He then touched on the  subject of South-South cooperation, saying that he had discussed  this matter with President Ben Ali and that strengthening  bilateral relations between developing countries was the only  way to improve the level of cooperation between the countries of  the southern hemisphere. Finally, he announced that the  Argentine economy minister would visit Tunisia next April and  said he hoped this visit would open important prospects for a  fruitful exchange between businessmen in the two countries.    The Argentine minister handed President Ben Ali a written  message from President Carlos Menem yesterday. The minister  also told President Ben Ali that his country was looking forward  to his forthcoming visit, saying he hoped that it would take  place as soon as possible because it would contribute to the  intensification of the good relations of cooperation between the  two countries.</p>

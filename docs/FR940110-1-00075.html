			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism that permits it to recover these funds from the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or owner; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor or owner and the applicant that permits the Bank to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover these funds from the sponsor or owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.16(a)(4) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board in its discretion may grant a waiver of any required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedial actions under this paragraph (a) upon written request by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank, applicant, sponsor or owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Other Types of Non-Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Non-compliance by a party with the AHP requirements, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to inadvertent errors by such party or changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances that are outside such party's control, does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warrant imposition of the most severe remedial actions since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party lacked the intent to violate such requirements. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, in many such cases, the non-compliance can be rectified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within a reasonable period of time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, &sect;960.16(b) of the proposed rule provides that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event of inadvertent non-compliance by an applicant, sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or owner, the Bank shall provide such party with a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time in which to take reasonable efforts, pursuant to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance plan approved by the Bank, to remedy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance. The Bank in its discretion may exclude such party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from participation in the AHP while it is under a compliance plan,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or in its discretion may require the applicant to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> long-term period committed to in its AHP application for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project by the amount of time the project has been in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.16(b) of the proposed rule further provides that if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant, sponsor or owner takes no reasonable efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the compliance plan, then such party is in willful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance with the requirements of this part and is subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the remedial actions contained in paragraph (a) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. If the applicant, sponsor or owner takes reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts pursuant to the compliance plan to remedy the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance under paragraph (b) and such efforts are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsuccessful, the applicant, sponsor or owner would be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remedial actions for fraud or willful non-compliance, but may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply to the Bank for a waiver of any such required remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. The Bank shall report to the Board in writing on any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waivers approved pursuant to paragraph (b) within 30 calendar days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

Recapture requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.16(c) of the proposed rule provides generally that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event that a household sells its AHP-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing unit to a household whose income exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the level committed to in the AHP application prior to the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the required long-term period, then:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the Bank shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the seller to repay a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share, except for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> amounts, of the grant received by such seller.

The proposed rule provides, however, that the Bank in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretion may waive such requirement if the imposition of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement will cause undue hardship on the seller, as defined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Bank in its AHP implementation plan; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the applicant provided a below market rate loan to the seller,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then the applicant shall either repay to the Bank that portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the advance used to make the loan to the seller or the Bank shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convert that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seller to a market rate advance with an interest rate equal to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market rate of interest at the time the advance was made, and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unused AHP subsidy which had been set aside by the Bank to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidize that portion of the advance used to make the loan to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seller shall be made available by the Bank for additional AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception to recapture requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.16(c)(3) of the proposed rule provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recapture requirements described above shall not apply provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sponsor, pursuant to a legally binding agreement with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank, assists another household with an income at or below the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level committed to in the AHP application in the manner originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

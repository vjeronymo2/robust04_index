			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / 1,300 jobs go as Asda closes food factory ASDA, the UK's fourth-biggest food retailer, said yesterday it was closing its Lofthouse food factory in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Workers had believed the business would be sold by Asda, but were told instead they were being made compulsorily redundant. The factory, which supplies all its output of sausages, bacon and meat products to the Asda chain, will close at the end of July. Lofthouse, which is Asda's only interest in food manufacturing, reported losses of Pounds 2.5m at the last half-year results in December, and is expected to report a loss of about Pounds 4m for the full year. The company said there was little prospect of the factory moving into profit, adding that Lofthouse was operating in a declining market with considerable over-capacity. 'It's a sad but inevitable decision. We had to bite the bullet some time,' said Mr Paul Dowling, Asda's corporate affairs director. 'It makes good quality products but the costs are too high.' Asda tried to sell the 50-year-old factory but was unable to find a buyer. Closure costs, including redundancies, fixed asset write-offs and losses between now and closure are estimated at Pounds 20m, to be classed as an extraordinary charge when Asda reports its full-year results in July. That will be offset against the Pounds 69m extraordinary gain Asda announced at the half-year following the disposal of its interest in furniture retailer MFI. Mr David Williams, national secretary of the GMB general union's food and leisure section, said the closure was a 'hammer blow for the people of West Yorkshire, which will lead to the devastation of the whole community. 'Only yesterday John Major was jumping up and down triumphantly over the employment figures. Meanwhile, in the real world, jobs are still being lost and Asda workers are paying the price of John Major's complacency.' Pirelli, the tyre manufacturer, is to cut 700 car tyre production jobs at its Burton-on-Trent plant and relocate production to other plants, primarily Carlisle, the company's other UK manufacturing site. The company said the redundancies were in response to the 'considerable deterioration in demand in the European tyre market'. Lex, Page 22</p>

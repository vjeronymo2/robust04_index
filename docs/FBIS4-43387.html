			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "P.K.": "High-Speed Train: A Decisive </F> Technology Transfer to Korea"]    [Text] After signing, in Seoul yesterday, an agreement to  supply a number of high-speed trains to South Korea, the  Franco-British group GEC-Alsthom would not comment much more on  one aspect of the deal, namely the comprehensive technology  transfer it entails.    Korea has ordered 12 billion francs worth of rolling stock  and equipment.    However, only half this amount will flow to GEC-Alsthom, as  the deal provides for 34 out of the 46 trains to be built by  Korean manufacturers.    In other words, there is a significant technology transfer  component which, by the end of the decade, will allow Korea to  build and export a high-speed train similar to the "TGV  Atlantique" developed in the early eighties and operated in  France since 1988.    For Korea, this is a decisive first step toward becoming a  manufacturer of high-speed trains. Nevertheless, GEC-Alsthom is  trying to reassure those who fear that Korea might have obtained  what it needs to surpass the Europeans within 20 or 30 years in  this high-tech field, as has been the case for shipbuilding.  <H5>  Heavy Investment </H5>   Beside its technological lead, which it is vowing to  maintain, the group indicated that it expects this transfer of  technology, which is being paid for through license fees, to  lead to cooperation, not competition, beyond 2000.    "We hope to be able to establish mutually beneficial ties,"  GEC-Alsthom says, "as has already been the case with other  license holders, for instance Canada's Bombardier, which is now  a partner."    Unlike car manufacturing, or even shipbuilding, the world  market for high-speed trains is very limited: In 13 years,  GEC-Alsthom has prevailed in all calls for bids, but those were  not all that numerous: Spain, Texas, Northern Europe, and the  Paris-London link via the Chunnel.    Of late, only two countries have been considering building a  high-speed link: Canada and Taiwan.    Whatever the future of train transport may be, one can  reasonably consider that demand will remain modest at the  beginning of the next century.    In such a context, says GEC-Alsthom, one cannot see another  country joining the already bloated club of manufacturers, all  the more since doing so would require investing very heavily  with no guarantee of future profitability.    It seems more likely that Korea insisted on technology  transfer because it saw it as a way to improve its own  techniques, such as welding, in order to apply them to other  industrial sectors.    Let us wish for GEC-Alsthom's sake that it is so.</p>

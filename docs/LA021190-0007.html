			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TASTEMAKER FOR THE MASSES;  </P> <P> SHE KNOWS WE WANT SHRIMP BEFORE WE KNOW WE WANT SHRIMP. AND SHE KNOWS WE WANT  SHRIMP.  </P> <P> THESE ARE TREACHEROUS times. The men and women who attend the brainstorming  session have taken a vow of secrecy. The printed agenda is for their eyes only.  The results of the research project they've just completed will not be divulged  outside this anonymous conference room, in one of the faceless office buildings  that line Jefferson Boulevard in West Los Angeles.  </P> <P> At stake? The loyalty of the midscale American diner -- the customer who dines  out but not up, who often reads the menu from right to left. Thanks to a weak  economy and strong competitors, it's a pitched battle; there are not enough  customers to go around. The nine people in this room work either for the  Sizzler chain or for its advertising agency, BBDO. Their mission is to protect  Sizzler's position as the most profitable player in the "casual dining room"  segment of the market.  </P> <P> With more than $845 million in sales in fiscal 1989, the 646-unit Sizzler chain  is where middle America eats most of its restaurant meals: As many as 7,000  people visit each one of the chain's 135 California outlets in any given week.  But Sizzler's sales over the past eight months, along with the rest of the  industry's, have eroded a bit as its core customers -- working singles and  families in their 20s and early 30s -- have chosen to ease the economic pinch  by eating cheaper or eating at home.  </P> <P> Mike Minchin, executive vice president of Collins Foods (which runs Sizzler as  well as 209 Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises on the West Coast), says that  Sizzler's most formidable enemy in the past year was the adjustable-rate  mortgage. When rates go up, people cut back. The weekday business-lunch crowd  saves by eating at McDonald's or Jack in the Box, and the families who come in  as a treat on the weekends opt for home cooking. As for the sudden  proliferation of Souplantations and Soup Expresses, Minchin is used to a  crowded field that includes Bob's Big Boy and Marie Callender's. "Anyone who  puts food in somebody's stomach is keeping us from putting food in somebody's  stomach," he says.  </P> <P> To maintain its place at the head of the pack, Sizzler must make its food  irresistible. The purpose of the meeting, one of the two major strategy  sessions held each year, is to decide how best to tempt the American palate.  Secrecy is essential: Today's good idea, seasoned with indiscretion, can become  tomorrow's success for the competition.  </P> <P> The gustatory conscience of the chain, 36-year-old Stacey James, sits at the  head of the table. Her formal title is director of menu development, but,  practically speaking, she is Sizzler's premier taste bud. A dish has to satisfy  James to get out of the test kitchen, and she is not an easy mark.  </P> <P> In a year's time, maybe 400 dishes will be suggested in a series of menu idea  meetings. Most never get any further: Either they don't sound good, are too  hard to prepare in volume or don't conform to the received wisdom, supported by  extensive market research, that Sizzler should offer what BBDO account  supervisor Jim Ward calls "good, substantial American food, similar to what you  could do at home but with a twist that makes you want to go out and get it."  </P> <P> James and Jim Scharf, director of field marketing, present the candidates that  survive this meeting to Minchin, who decides which ones will run the gantlet of  the product development process. Those that make it through James' in-house  tastings, the focus groups and the test-market trial runs may win a place on  the Sizzler menu, from which they can be unceremoniously yanked if they don't  perform up to expectations. Only two or three of the year's candidates will  make it onto the regular rotation of about 80 items.  </P> <P> "It's the myth of Sisyphus," says James. "You push these rocks up the hill inch  by inch, and a dish that makes it is one that rolled up to the top and stayed  there instead of rolling back down."  </P> <P> THE PROCESS BEGINS with the basic question: What do diners want?  </P> <P> James' response is authoritative and enigmatic, as befits a woman who has spent  the last five years attempting to define and satisfy desires. "It's this line,"  she says: "It's got to be new but familiar. It's got to be interesting but not  off the wall."  </P> <P> Huh?  </P> <P> The experts she has called together -- Sizzler representatives from purchasing,  advertising, marketing and the test kitchen, along with the three BBDO  executives -- understand the challenge. The typically schizophrenic Sizzler  customer talks cholesterol out of one side of his mouth while he pops a fried  shrimp into the other. Minchin loves to tell the story of the Encino doctor --  "a heart specialist," he crows -- who explained that it was OK to eat a platter  of fried food because he'd taken a run that morning. James may be the creator  of Sizzler's lemon herb chicken, a good-for-you skinless number flavored with  herbs, but she also knows her way around a corn fritter.  </P> <P> Eighty percent of Sizzler's sales come from its all-you-can-eat dishes -- the  wildly successful salad bar and America's favorite crustaceous vice, the fried  shrimp -- and steak. Twenty rcent of the customers are less addicted and more  selective, which means they might get bored and choose another restaurant. No  one, in either camp, is what you'd call daring. The goal is to keep the  faithful shrimpers happy while finding new items to interest, but not  intimidate, the pickier eaters.  </P> <P> Essentially, Sizzler customers want food that tastes good but may not be good  for them, prepared in ways that will surprise but not shock them. In the  geopolitics of food service, it's all a question of whether a dish is  "pre-Melrose," "Melrose courant," or "post-Melrose." Pre-Melrose is so boring  it doesn't even deserve to be discovered; Melrose of the moment is too  avant-garde, and post-Melrose runs the risk of being passe even to people  who've never ventured onto the street. The trick is to grab a recipe just as a  newer food phenom nudges it aside, but before it becomes the bell-bottom blue  jeans of popular cuisine.  </P> <P> Take a particular beef dish, one of the first items on the afternoon's agenda,  which must go unnamed in the interest of national Sizzler security. Is it still  hip?  </P> <P> "I had it last night," Jim Scharf says. "That makes it hip."  </P> <P> "I think, in terms of Melrose, it's no longer hip," says BBDO's Ward, who  dutifully lunched at the Marina del Rey Sizzler on his way over and has alerted  James to a "bad bun-to-tuna ratio" on his grilled sandwich.  </P> <P> "I was on La Brea, not Melrose," Scharf says.  </P> <P> "But La Brea is the new Melrose," says Robin Adams, who runs the Sizzler test  kitchen.  </P> <P> "Hey," persists Ward, "we're pushing Southwestern, and that was over last  year."  </P> <P> But James thinks the dish is a trifle old, recommends rejecting it, and moves  on to a complicated steak preparation she likes even less.  </P> <P> The dish might work at what she calls a "white-tablecloth restaurant," but an  assembly-line kitchen would mangle it. Her much-beloved "Sizzkabobs," skewers  of steak, chicken and fish, met an untimely death three years ago because  kitchen workers groused about how long it took to impale those chunks of  protein. She gazes down the table, almost daring anyone to contradict her. No  one does.  </P> <P> Chicken with pesto sauce dies undefended. "Nice, but I remind you that it would  be green," James says in a tone of voice that might be used to describe mildew.  "Do Sizzler customers want to see something green?" Apparently not. The dish  gets a B-minus. It will not be mentioned again.  </P> <P> MOST MENU DEVELOPMENT executives (and all of Sizzler's competitors have them)  are food technicians -- home economists or number crunchers. But Stacey James  is the sensual exception, a "hands-on cook" who talks about food the way Erica  Jong writes about sex.  </P> <P> James' idea of a good time is to turn out a turkey dinner, complete with side  dishes, for no reason except that she, her husband and son have to eat  something for dinner. In this era of the quick culinary fix, she is one of the  few people who can utter the words "I cooked for days" with a beatific smile.  </P> <P> Like the heroine of E. M. Forster's "A Room With a View," James discovered the  meaning of life during a sojourn in Florence, Italy. After studying art history  at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in the early 1970s, she moved to  Los Angeles and worked at Sotheby's auction house and a rare book dealer's. She  was dabbling in cooking on the side when a friend told her his mother needed a  cook at her villa outside Florence.  </P> <P> "She hired me," recalls James, "because she had lots of guests all the time  from other parts of Europe, and museum people, so she wanted someone who could  cook these nice little dinner parties and impress people.  </P> <P> "Meanwhile, during the day there was this old peasant woman who was the  housekeeper who did all the cooking for the midday meal. She was 80 years old  and had worked in that house for 50 years." James' saucer eyes grow to  salad-plate size at the memory. "She was cooking very old-style stuff. It  really changed the way I started thinking about food. When I came back, I  pursued it. It just seemed like the way to eat."  </P> <P> To eat, but not necessarily the way to live. James made pastries at Il Fornaio  for a year, then spent another year as a sous-chef at Prego in Beverly Hills  before the premium placed on uniformity started to get to her. "I was stuck in  that restaurant mode where the goal is to make food taste exactly the way it  tasted the night before," she says, "and I was in danger of burning out." She  applied at a private club for a job that never materialized. A month later, she  got a phone message asking her to send her resume to Sizzler headquarters.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a friend playing a joke," she recalls. It turned out to be  Minchin, who belonged to the club where James had applied and had heard about  her from the chef there. It wasn't the job she'd been looking for, but it did  promise creative freedom.  </P> <P> Sizzler, although a formula restaurant, was known for its flexibility. (The  chain's profitability can be traced, James believes, to a "repositioning" in  the early 1980s that recast Sizzler the Family Steak House as Sizzler -- Steak,  Salad, Seafood.) There was a certain corporate devotion to inventive ideas, and  uniformity would be somebody else's worry.  </P> <P> James decided to find out if her notion of good food would trickle down to the  mass market.  </P> <P> IT WASN'T LONG before she started having shrimp nightmares.  </P> <P> Shrimp is coin of the realm for the mainstream dining public because it is a  food that has the magical effect of making people feel special. It has an  upscale gestalt. "Shrimp is extremely popular," James says. "I am called upon  to develop shrimp endlessly."  </P> <P> She has constant shrimp anxiety. Can she come up with a recipe? Is there any  ethnicity that Sizzler has yet to exploit?  </P> <P> Given the volume she's dealing with, a mistake can be devastating. A single  four-week special promotion of a three-shrimp platter -- planned for March and  limited to Southern California -- will require 280,000 pounds of tiny cocktail  shrimp.  </P> <P> And there's never any guarantee, even on what would seem to be a low-risk  venture. The American Sampler introduced last year looked like a shoo-in, since  it combined fried shrimp, Cajun popcorn shrimp and New England-style boiled  shrimp.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, no one considered the gap between East Coast work ethic and West  Coast pleasure principle. The boiled shrimp were served in the shell, as is  traditional in the land where people are used to overcoming nature's hardships.  But sybaritic Californians, whose greatest climatic challenge is to remember  how to turn on the car windshield wipers, let it be known that they preferred  their shrimp undressed.  </P> <P> "People here do not like to have to peel their own shrimp," James says glumly.  "They just said: 'Phooey. We don't want to have to do this.' " The dish didn't  last two weeks.  </P> <P> Usually, though, the development process ensures the success of the end  product, and disappointments can be salvaged. James recently introduced her  latest sea baby, a grilled barbecued shrimp with a sauce she invented that was  "very smoky and mesquite-y with bacon in it and everything."  </P> <P> The pre-release response was a dream, James says. "Everybody -- unanimously --  in all three focus groups, said, 'We love this; where can we buy it?' "  </P> <P> The post-release response was deadly. "It didn't do anything," says James. "The  name just wasn't describing what it was. Pacific-Style Barbecued Shrimp. What's  that?" James pressed for a new marketing plan. The dish was renamed Mesquite  Shrimp, slapped on a Southwestern Grill platter with steak and Santa Fe chicken  and turned into a hit.  </P> <P> THE BALDWIN HILLS SIZZLER, a new 226-seat pastel prototype for Sizzlers to  come, is one of James' laboratories, an outlet she uses to try out new  products. This Sizzler features a grand experiment -- the Buffet Court, a maze  of all-you-can-eat offerings designed to keep the chain's more fickle customers  coming back. The salad and tostada bar is still the centerpiece, but it's  surrounded by a dessert bar, a hot appetizer bar and a pizza and pasta bar.  </P> <P> James is particularly proud of the pizza. She couldn't serve "what in Italy is  considered a nighttime pizza" -- a delicate, thin-crusted version -- because  "it would be limp after five minutes on the steam table." She wanted to serve  "an Italian daytime pizza, the kind with the thick crust that people in Italy  buy at room temperature," but she knew Americans wouldn't pay good money for  cold pizza. With a supplier, she worked up "a homemade-looking product" with a  chewy crust that can stand up to sitting around, and the response in Baldwin  Hills has been "terrific."  </P> <P> She knows firsthand: Focus groups are nice, and sales figures are the bible,  but James regularly visits Sizzlers around the country to make sure a dish  isn't dying of sloppy execution. She and her co-workers can launch a grilled  tuna sandwich with confidence at a few select Sizzlers. But let one employee  start serving broiled tuna that lacks those attractive grill marks, and the  dish can fail, unless someone who knows right from wrong sees the goof in time.  And James can't afford to let a good idea succumb.  </P> <P> "I always keep thinking that it's going to get easier next month," she says.  "But it doesn't. I can show you a list of new products I've come up with, but  OK, after those are out, then what are we going to do? What about next year?  You always have to be thinking way out there. It never ends."  </P> <P> AS THE MEETING drags on, and the M &amp; Ms James supplies to jump-start the  collective imagination disappear, as a debate about a stuffed chicken breast  deteriorates into jokes about topless chicken, James reaches beyond Sizzler's  standard vocabulary for an idea. The group has already rejected duck, served  any way at all, as too weird. But how about turkey?  </P> <P> "The turkey people have been knocking down my door," she ventures, hope in her  voice, perhaps thinking about the nice job she did on that turkey at home the  week before. The news is greeted with a collective groan.  </P> <P> She perseveres. How about smoked turkey, which has everything going for it?  It's new, it's fashionable but not cutting-edge, and it's healthful.  </P> <P> The groans only get louder.  </P> <P> "If blackened food is post-Melrose, then turkey is still pre-Melrose," says Jim  Ward. "I think we've got to wait until it gets over that hill."  </P> <P> The group settles on a less controversial topic. Perhaps there's something they  haven't tried with -- you know -- a shrimp.  </P></p>

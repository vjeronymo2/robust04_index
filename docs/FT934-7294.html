			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Howard yields on Sunday trading THE GOVERNMENT yesterday moved to rescue its Sunday Trading bill by bowing to pressure to extend employee protection against being forced to work on Sundays. The extension of protection to future shopworkers, as well as those already in employment, was a significant climbdown  - Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, had repeatedly refused demands for protection to be extended. It also increases the chance that confusion surrounding Sunday opening in England and Wales will be resolved this year. Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office minister, said MPs would be given a free vote 'well before Christmas' on the bill's three options for reform. The options, in the order they appear in the bill, are: Total deregulation. Strict regulation, prohibiting large shops from opening except four Sundays before Christmas, but allowing DIY shops and garden centres and some small shops to open. Partial de-regulation, allowing small shops to open at will, but restricting large shops to six hours. Campaign groups and MPs had warned that the government's previous stance on worker protection threatened to derail the bill by ensuring that none of the options would attract enough support from MPs to gain an overall majority. Mr Lloyd said: 'It became clear that for a great many people an essential ingredient of an acceptable and satisfactory resolution of this matter involved a degree of protection not just for existing workers but for future workers.' The bill would not allow shopworkers in England and Wales from being dismissed or unfairly treated  - for example by refusal of training or promotion  - for refusing to work on Sundays. It would also extend protection from shop-floor workers to 'all workers in or about a shop'. The government's move came two days after the Keep Sunday Special Campaign and Retailers for Shops Act Reform  - which support strict regulation of Sunday trading  - combined forces. The change may benefit the government's de-regulation options the most. Many Labour and backbench Conservative MPs are thought to have been swayed by constituents' support for Sunday opening but were not prepared to vote for de-regulation without protection for new workers. Campaign groups welcomed the decision, but the Keep Sunday Special Campaign said it would continue to call for statutory double-time payments for Sunday working. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, which recently switched allegiance from KSSC to the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which supports partial de-regulation, is also pressing for double-time pay. Mr Lloyd warned that the government would 'certainly whip against' any amendment proposing premium payments, which it believed would discriminate unfairly against small shops. The date tipped for the bill's second reading, when MPs will vote on the principle of reforming the 1950 Shops Act, is November 29. The vote on the options is expected on December 8 or 13.

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 70% OF TUNNELING FOR SUBWAY SYSTEM FINISHED  </P> <P> More than 70% of the tunneling needed to finish the Rapid Transit District's  4.4-mile subway system in Los Angeles has been completed, RTD officials  announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> After five months of work on the system, contractors completed the tunnel  segment between the Pershing Square Station and the 7th Street/Metro Center  Station, RTD General Manager Alan Pegg said.  </P> <P> The project has been running "a couple of months behind schedule because of  unforeseen delays, including larger than usual rocks and contaminated soil,"  said Greg Davy, an RTD spokesman. Excavations will be completed in early 1990,  he said.  </P> <P> The 7th Street/Metro Center Station will serve both subway and light rail lines  that are under construction. RTD is scheduled to begin operating the Los  Angeles to Long Beach Light Rail Line in July, 1990. The Light Rail will use  only a small portion of tunneled area, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Opening of the twin-tunnel subway system, which will stretch from Union Station  to a terminal at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street,  was originally slated for April, 1992. It is now scheduled for September, 1993,  Davy said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by David Hunt, UK secretary of state for employment, </F> to the Institute for Directors in London on 15 February: "The  Challenge of Competitiveness"]    [Text] I am very pleased to be here today, and to have the  chance to offer you a few thoughts on the challenge facing the  British economy and you as employers.    There is every indication that our economy is now poised to  make positive strides towards a more competitive and successful  era. But we must not sit back; it is vital to build a  competitive economy not only for the 1990's but for the 21st  century.    As you all know we face tough competition in overseas  markets  - not just from our European neighbours, but from the Far East  and the rapidly developing economies of the Pacific Rim.    I want to highlight for you a number of initiatives which  will help to build our economy where it counts, at the most  local level. Integration of Government programmes at Regional  and local level    First our decision to combine the existing Regional Offices  of the Departments of the Environment, Employment, Trade and  Industry, and Transport.    In the past there has been criticism of the inefficient way  in which Government programmes and services can operate. They  have been described as `a patchwork quilt of complexity and  idiosyncracy'.    I and my Government colleagues take these concerns  seriously.  Four years ago we announced the introduction of Training and  Enterprise Councils [TEC] - the TECS organisations designed to  make Government training and enterprise programmes more  responsive and relevant to local business needs. Now we have  gone much further with the announcement in November of  Integrated Regional offices and the Single Regeneration Budget.    This is an exciting opportunity to bring together programmes  from different Government Departments into a more dynamic and  cohesive package, at regional level.    So from April this year a whole range of Government  decisions  about transport, housing, environmental improvement, support for  business, training and skills will be taken in the Integrated  Regional Offices.  <H5>  The Importance of Local Partnership </H5>   But Government is, of course, not the only player in all  this. Government can set a national framework for others to work  within, but we look to others locally to identify needs and  decide how to meet them.    Just as Government has recognised the importance of bringing  together its regional structures into a working partnership, so  must other local players, including business, do the same.  Partnership at local level will be critical to our future  economic success. In particular this will be true when the  Senior Directors of the new integrated offices are deciding  priorities for the Single Regeneration Budget which will bring  together twenty previously separate programmes worth 1.4 billion  pounds. Government is convinced that if we are to make the most  of this money it has to be spent on projects generated jointly  among the local community.    TECs will be key private sector partners for the  Government's  integrated regional offices, taking the lead alongside local  authorities in formulating plans for local economic development  and building the partnerships to achieve them. They must  mobilise the wide range of local players who contribute to local  regeneration and economic development. Where partnerships do not  already exist, they can take steps to pull people together, to  create a local vision and purpose.  <H3>  The Contribution of Training and Skills To a Competitive  Economy </H3>   My second theme is about my Department's central  contribution  to making the UK economy more competitive. Without the right  skills our economic competitiveness will suffer; with them, we  can all enjoy greater and longer lasting prosperity.    Britain has moved a long way in last decade. Ten years ago  it  was said that UK employers were just not interested in training.  It wasn't true then and it's not true today. Today around 1,200  top business and community leaders are involved in running  Training and Enterprise Councils. 770 companies have their most  senior Directors on TEC Boards.    Many business people do now recognise training as a key  investment in their competitive strategy. Over 570 organisations  have now achieved Investors in People status, requiring them to  demonstrate that they have taken full account of the development  needs of every employee; and some 4,600 more are committed to  achieving it. Firms enjoy business benefits such as improved  business performance; enhanced financial results; and greater  job satisfaction for their people. That job satisfaction comes  from a better appreciation among individuals of the value of  effective training and development.    Each year the National Training Awards competition  identifies  winners who are living proof that training pays - that it  increases competitiveness. You can't win unless you can show a  direct link between the training you did and the impact on your  business or your career.    It is not uncommon to find savings or increased profits  measured in the millions, or businesses completely turned round  and saved from bankruptcy because they did the right training at  the right time in the right way.    I am very pleased to launch the 1994 National Training  Awards  [NTA] competition here today. I hope that the Institute of  Directors will continue its support for the competition. Every  part of the country has its NTA champions and they are ready to  share with others how they achieved their success. Nothing is  more effective in persuading others that a real life story: it  says far more than Ministerial exhortations ever can.  <H5>  Prosperity Through Skills </H5>   Recently I set out my vision for vocational education and  training in a document called Prosperity through skills. This  sets out a strategy for everybody who has an interest in  increasing individual and national prosperity -- that means  employers and individuals as well as training organisations. I  hope you will all take the time to read it.    I offer four priorities for action:     -  Employers, the self  employed and individuals in the workforce must invest  effectively in the skills needed for business and individual  success.    -  People who are out of work or disadvantaged in the  labour market must be able to acquire and maintain skills  allowing them to compete better for work and contribute more  effectively to the economy.    -  Young people must be motivated to  gain the skills and qualifications needed for today's -- and  tomorrow's jobs.    -  We must ensure that education and training meet  the needs of business and individuals.    For the economy to flourish every sector, every industry,  and  every business in the country must perform at its best.  Effective investment in people is an essential ingredient of  business success, helping to maximise the benefit of all other  forms of investment.  <H5>  Modern Apprenticeships </H5>   Finally, it gave me a lot of pleasure to announce recently  my  plans for Modern Apprenticeships which will produce a new route  to recognised qualifications at `A' level equivalent, and jobs,  for about 40,000 young people each year, compared with around  12,000 at present.    Modern apprenticeships represent a step change in the  government's approach to training. This is a supply-side  revolution, led by industry, to give the country the skills it  needs and improve our economic competitiveness. They will be for  young people who leave school at 16 or 17 and want to train to  higher level vocational skills. They will offer high quality  training to technician and supervisor levels - NVQ Level 3 (or  `A' level equivalent).    Modern apprenticeships will instigate a real skills  revolution by combining modern qualifications and learning  methods with the best of our apprenticeship traditions. I want  to see them in all sectors from information technology to  engineering. I want employers in each sector to decide detailed  arrangements. And I want to see employers and apprentices  signing a pledge to agree the training to be provided and  entering a mutual commitment to see it through.    We shall run modern apprenticeships using the successful  arrangements for Youth Credits. The Government recognises that  high quality training is not cheap, and is quite willing to play  and -- pay -- its part. We will invest 1.25 billion pounds in  Youth Credits and modern apprenticeships over the next three  years.    But modern apprenticeships can only succeed if employers  working with TECs and others respond and provide the necessary  places. If they do we envisage there could be about 150,000  young apprentices training in England at any one time. We expect  to run pilots in 1994, and TECs and Industry Training  organisations will have a pivotal role in preparing a full range  of modern apprenticeships for young people to start in 1995.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   I have spoken about the importance of partnerships and the  contribution of training to our economic success. The goal we  seek is of immense value - it is no less than the future  well-being of our nation. I ask you to support us in our efforts  to meet that goal. Without you we cannot but fail.

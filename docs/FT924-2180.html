			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Bribery charges against Tory MP dropped BRIBERY charges against Mr Harry Greenway, the Tory MP, were dropped yesterday by the Crown Prosecution Service after the collapse last week of the trial of three other men charged with corruption over attempts to win rail maintenance contracts from British Rail. Mr Greenway had been due to stand trial at the Old Bailey next October. The charges against him alleged he had corruptly accepted gifts including air tickets from Plasser Railway Machinery GB, a long-time supplier of track maintenance equipment to BR. The Austrian-owned company was based in Mr Greenway's Ealing North constituency. It was alleged that the gifts from Plasser GB included flights to Switzerland, Germany and Austria and tickets to an exhibition of the Spanish Riding School at Wembley. It was claimed in return that Mr Greenway had used his position as an MP to try to influence the appointment of a BR chairman and in trying to obtain British nationality for a Plasser director. Mr Greenway always denied the charges The CPS's decision to drop the charges against Mr Greenway follows the acquittals of Plasser GB, Mr Norbert Jurasek, its managing director, Mr Michael Brooks, its company secretary and Mr David Currie, a former head of British Rail's civil engineering division. The trial judge had ruled there was insufficient evidence for their cases to go to a jury. The CPS said that after the collapse of the first trial, Mrs Barbara Mills, the Director of Public Prosecutions, had decided there was no longer a realistic prospect of Mr Greenway being convicted. Mr Greenway said after the announcement of the decision: 'This has been an extraordinarily long ordeal but I always knew I would be vindicated.' Mr Greenway is thought to have been the first member of parliament to face trial charged with corruption. He tried unsuccessfully to argue that a criminal trial was the wrong forum for such alleged behaviour to be judged, insisting that a committee of MPs should be the correct jury in his case. The argument failed when the judge ruled that the charges referred to Mr Greenway having violated his duties as an MP. However, Mr Greenway was able to win a separate trial, unconnected with that of the three other defendants. Yesterday's decision marks the failure of the largest case brought for many years by the British Transport Police, a body that remains part of British Rail, but which acts independently. A lengthy investigation by the BTP, before the case was handed over to the Fraud Investigation Group within the CPS, resulted in the arrests in September 1988 of Mr Jurasek, Mr Brooks and Mr Currie. Mr Greenway was arrested in September 1990. In the first trial, the prosecution claimed that Plasser's hospitality, including air tickets, trips to Continental nightclubs, complimentary tickets to watch the rugby at Twickenham and gifts of champagne and wine, was on such a scale it amounted to a corrupt attempt over a 10-year period to win business from BR. The scale of the alleged corruption was widespread, it argued. The charges the men faced were mere samples. If there were a charge for every transaction that took place, the courtroom would be full of defendants, it was alleged. However, the judge later ruled there was no evidence of the alleged bribes having worked. The transactions complained of totalled only Pounds 11,000 over 10 years. Prosecution allegations that Mr Currie had received so much hospitality that he had led the life of a rich man had not been supported by evidence, he said. He also strongly criticised BR for not having taken firmer steps to reduce the hospitality offered by Plasser although it was on a scale that breached BR's own guidelines. In spite of an internal BR inquiry held in 1983, no attempt had been made to correct the situation, the judge said. In spite of its failure, the prosecution has focused attention on the practices of corporate hospitality, widely accepted as a normal part of business and commercial life, and the differences between the public and private sectors in its application. As one lawyer involved in the case commented, had BR been in the private sector, where generous corporate hospitality is accepted to a greater degree, it is unlikely the case would ever have come to court. Reporting restrictions preventing any linkage of Mr Greenway with the first Plasser trial were lifted before the CPS's announcement yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WILL SCHOOLS' NEW SYSTEM PASS OR FAIL?;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: THE COMMON-CORE CURRICULUM THAT PUSHES ALL SAN DIEGO STUDENTS TO  ACHIEVE AT HIGH LEVELS CONTINUES AS A TOPIC OF VIGOROUS DEBATE.  </P> <P> At Mira Mesa High School, veteran biology teacher Naida Groff says that new  graduation standards requiring all students -- even those with little or no  academic ambition -- to take tougher courses have caused an unprecedented 50%  failure rate in her classes.  </P> <P> Her math colleague Jerry Sandlin says that while he loves teaching geometry, "a  lot of technical and service jobs will never require that sort of thing and  it's a mistake trying to make everyone learn it."  </P> <P> But at Kearny High, math teacher David Watson believes that the requirement for  all students to take algebra and biology is a good idea because in past years  too many students were allowed to "skate" through easy classes such as "career  math" and "business math" that are now being eliminated.  </P> <P> And in experiments at Bell and Kroc middle schools, students who normally would  have repeated a grade because of poor performance have been promoted to the  next grade but given more individual attention from teachers to help them  succeed in more difficult classes.  </P> <P> From secondary school to secondary school, across the sprawling San Diego city  schools district, an intense debate over the wisdom of the "common-core"  curriculum continues apace, more than 3 1/2 years after it was first proposed  and well into its second year of full-scale implementation.  </P> <P> Its value occupied much of the give-and-take between school board candidates in  this fall's election for two open seats on the five-member board of trustees,  and it remains a topic of high interest at educational gatherings across the  nation.  </P> <P> Retired teacher John de Beck, the winner in District C, openly questions the  philosophy of trying to educate all students at a rigorous academic level. The  District B winner, Sue Braun, supports the idea but criticizes the lack of  preparation afforded teachers who are suddenly faced with students less  motivated than the typical student taking college-prep classes.  </P> <P> Proponents, led by a majority of trustees and Supt. Tom Payzant, argue that all  students need a minimum level of math, science, English and social studies in  order to survive in an increasingly complex world -- whether they go on to  college immediately or enter the work force.  </P> <P> Payzant, who originally labeled common core the "college-prep" curriculum, now  prefers to call it a "minimum" graduation program. He cites new research from  employers nationally -- from corporations to small businesses -- that shows an  increasing demand for the same scholastic preparation from high school  graduates required by college-admissions officers. In particular, Payzant  believes that expectations for black and Latino students must be raised if the  district is to improve those students chances of becoming successfully employed  adults.  </P> <P> Trustee Jim Roache, who first proposed the new curriculum along with Dorothy  Smith in May, 1987, said no one "ever believed it was going to convert a  failing student automatically or be a quick fix to turn the whole educational  system around.  </P> <P> "Yet it is a fair idea, and it has and will continue to improve the quality of  education for all kids by ensuring that they receive the bedrock academic  foundation everyone is entitled to," said Roache, who was elected county  Sheriff this month and will be replaced on the board by Braun.  </P> <P> But strong skeptics remain throughout the district, the nation's eighth-largest  urban system with an enrollment of 122,000 students, 63% of them black, Latino  or Asian.  </P> <P> "We're implementing it, we have cut out all of the (low-level) classes we were  told to do, and we've got every kid taking algebra, geometry and biology with  the result that our failure rate has increased tremendously, our kids are  floundering and our teachers are frustrated," Jim Vlassis, principal at Mira  Mesa High, the city's largest high school with 2,400 students, said.  </P> <P> "We've got after-school tutoring, but you can't force the students to come;  we've got programs to pull students out of class (for extra help) but too many  kids are just unprepared for these harder classes; we have no money for smaller  class sizes which might help; and you can't expect miracles when they have no  study or reading skills."  </P> <P> Vlassis reflected the views of many teachers in saying that the program should  have been implemented first at the elementary level so that a greater number of  students will be reading at grade level by the time they reach common-core  subject courses in junior high or middle school.  </P> <P> In addition, teachers in vocational and fine arts areas continue to complain  that the additional "hard academic" requirements have eliminated chances for  many students to take courses in those areas.  </P> <P> Even at Kearny High, which features the district's high-powered industrial arts  magnet program, an experiment to combine common core with vocational classes,  such as putting English and media technology together, has been implemented  only in the ninth grade.  </P> <P> An evaluation of common core from last school year reveals no clear pattern as  to whether student achievement is being helped or hurt, according to a district  report being circulated among secondary school principals but not yet sent to  trustees.  </P> <P> While evaluation department administrators found all schools putting the common  core into practice, "the achievement and grade indicators of students  participating are too inconsistent (as yet) to allow judgement," the report  says.  </P> <P> In taking a middle ground in the debate, outgoing board president Kay Davis  said "the verdict is still out" on the idea.  </P> <P> "On paper it sounds great, that philosophically all kids need to be stretched  intellectually to take hard courses, even if they are going to be gas station  attendants, but on a practical sense, I still wonder whether it is doable"  given teacher attitudes, she said.  </P> <P> But Kermeen Fristrom, who oversees the common core as district director of  basic education, takes heart because fewer teachers tell him today that the  idea "can't work" but instead ask, "How can it be made to work?"  </P> <P> Fristrom bemoans the lack of money available to train teachers in new ways of  presenting their material to "reach" more students, a point made by many people  throughout the district.  </P> <P> "Look, I think that many veteran teachers can learn that they haven't lost all  of their professional skills, that they can get results out of some youngsters  (the type of which) some years ago they could not get any work out of,"  Fristrom said. "But we are still a long way from getting all of them the help  they need."  </P> <P> Vlassis agreed that not enough secondary teachers have changed their methods to  deal with having three or four levels of student preparation in a single class.  </P> <P> "But after 20 years of teaching, it's not enough for a teacher to go to a  workshop or two and hear somebody speak on a new idea, and then be able to go  back to the class and implement it," he said. "It just doesn't work that  quickly."  </P> <P> Mission Bay High principal Maruta Gardner, new at the school after six years at  Mann Middle School, finds that many students are struggling with the tougher  classes. But she says that the students can't be blamed totally for the  situation.  </P> <P> "A lot of high school teachers pride themselves by saying they teach subject  matter, not kids, and that's terrible," she said. "They have to adopt more of  the middle-level school philosophy of showing that they care for children" and  understand their problems, social as well as academic. "They haven't been  trained for it."  </P> <P> Gardner said that she told a teacher who had given 78% of his students failing  grades "that he couldn't just tell me that it's all the fault of the kids . . .  there's something wrong with the teaching at that point."  </P> <P> At Kroc Middle School, principal Isabelle Skidmore took two of her best  teachers this fall and paired them with an experimental class of 15  eighth-graders who normally would have been held back in seventh grade because  of poor achievement. Skidmore said that past experience has shown that such  students fail to improve significantly after repeating a grade, so she decided  that less-traditional teachers might be able to have better results, even with  a higher-level curriculum.  </P> <P> "It's difficult, it's frustrating so far, but there are some small successes,"  said David Pelton, who is teaching science and math to the students while  colleague Barbara Rejebian tackles history and English.  </P> <P> "We've been trying a lot of different ways to reach these kids, playing it  day-by-day," said Pelton. Rejebian spent much of the summer thinking of new  ideas to make history and English more exciting to the class, yet threw out  much of her initial preparation the first week when she realized it wasn't  working.  </P> <P> "Some of these kids have never been taught how to study," Pelton said. "They  don't do the homework, they just sit in class with no participation, and since  they've seen themselves as F students for so long, they are easily satisfied  with improvement to a D minus while I want them to get a C or higher.  </P> <P> "Yet I realize that when the entire class walks in with no homework, I've blown  it as a teacher and have to find another approach.  </P> <P> "One parent told me that she thought her child is happier about being in school  this year, yet I worry that next year, they'll go on to high school and go back  into a larger class when the teacher will have no time for them as an  individual."  </P> <P> While Payzant concedes that more money for retraining and smaller classes would  help spur the willingness of more teachers to change, he argues that teachers  must change "regardless of the curriculum.  </P> <P> He hopes that the district's on-going restructuring effort to give teachers and  principals more responsibility to design and carry out their own ideas will win  over more people to the common-core philosophy.  </P> <P> "But I know the dollars to do this are insufficient and that makes it more  difficult to get people to alter their styles, to more easily accept the  common-core (idea)."  </P></p>

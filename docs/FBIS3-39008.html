			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "C.G.": "Air Strikes Possible and </F> Necessary?"]    [Text] Bonn, 8 Feb -- In contrast to the government's  cautious approach to military missions against the Serb  attackers of Sarajevo by NATO, commissioned by the United  Nations, the state minister in the Chancellor's office, Bernd  Schmidbauer, speaking on television on Tuesday [8 February],  called for Western air strikes. Commenting on the mortar attack  on Sarajevo market, Schmidbauer said: "Anybody who saw the  latest events must realize that we have to operate using air  strikes as well; the West's own position must back this, not  verbal gymnastics; we will have to increase pressure on all  those concerned enormously." In addition, humanitarian aid for  Bosnia-Herzegovina should be stepped up: "The human suffering  must come to an end." Allegedly, Schmidbauer said on television  that he agrees with Chancellor Kohl in this matter.    But the Chancellor's Office told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE that  Kohl had never made a statement to this effect. Schmidbauer  expressed his personal opinion. Schmidbauer has clarified this  in the meantime. His office says Kohl referred to NATO  decisions and he does not exclude action: "Germany will not  restrain anybody within NATO taking action at the United  Nations' wish, but we will give them moral support." Yet, Bonn  could not take on a role of its own, "because Germany cannot  participate militarily."    Foreign policy experts in the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group seem to  share Schmidbauer's view, which goes beyond the government's  cautious comments. The Bundestag group foreign policy  spokesman, Lamers, said: "After the criminal attack on  Sarajevo, Germany must take a decision on how long it wants to  maintain its ambivalent attitude, expressing dismay, but not  contributing anything to eradicating the root of the evil." The  international community can only choose between action and  withdrawal. "While the international community and its  institutions, which are also ours, lose their credibility,  exposing themselves to contempt and ridicule, and while the  killing goes on, the Germans cautiously recommend moderation."  Lamers went on to say that any German participation must take  account of the historic burdens. "In concrete terms" Germany's  action must take a different form, but "legally" it must  correspond to its partners missions. "Our credibility and  capability to act are at stake."    Lamers called upon the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] "to come to an agreement allowing Germany to participate  in the necessary actions in former Yugoslavia in a way that  takes account of the historic burdens." This is the only way  Germany can influence the partners' decisions and win the right  to call upon others to act. Lamers said the hope that the  Federal Constitutional Court would take the decision off  politicians is a "sign of shrinking from responsibility and of  inability to make a decision." He said an initiative is required  "now."    The foreign policy spokesman of the SPD Bundestag group,  Voigt, on the other hand, called on the government to be careful  with recommending the allies take military action in Bosnia.  Due to memories of World War II, the Germans could not take  part in such actions anyway. Air strikes would cause a great  number of civilian losses. In the event of such attacks, there  might be demands to liberate Tuzla, which is besieged by the  Serbs; the town of Vitez, besieged by Muslims; and the old town  of Mostar, surrounded by the Croats. Voigt recommended a  precautionary stationing of UN units in Macedonia. Once the  constitutional questions are clarified, Bundeswehr troops could  take part in blue helmet missions in Macedonia.    SPD defense expert Opel warned of a NATO military strike in  Bosnia. This would only satisfy "military agitation," he said.  NATO must not become a "warring party." Former General  Schmueckle and former Admiral Schmaehling doubt the military  effects of air strikes. The "Society for Endangered Nations,"  however, advocated air strikes as the only way to end mass  expulsions and homicide.</p>

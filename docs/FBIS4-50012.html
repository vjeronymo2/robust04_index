			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  met here today with Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir  and they both agreed on seeking a peaceful solution to the issue  of the Nansha [Spratly] Islands based on friendly cooperation.    Li extended a welcome to his Malaysian counterpart on his  working visit to China and attendance of the 1994 China summit  meeting, a high-profile economic forum which ended here today.    During the meeting, both leaders expressed their willingness  to further bilateral relations, which have seen full and speedy  growth since the two countries established diplomatic ties 20  years ago.    The Chinese premier said that after the cold war, the world  has been developing in the direction of multi-polarization,  which he believes is a positive trend; but on the other hand,  there still remain many contradictions and problems to address.    Li said that world affairs should be jointly managed by all  countries and that there is no room for power politics on the  earth.    He said that all countries, big or small, rich or poor,  strong or weak, should be treated equally, and disputes between  nations should be settled through peaceful consultations and  dialogues.    A just and rational world political and economic order  should  be set up, Li said, and the United Nations should do more for  developing countries.    On the remarks made by former Japanese Minister of Justice  Shigeta Nagano, in which Nagano distorted the history of Japan's  aggression against China, Li said, the facts show that there is  a force in Japan which attempts to distort and even beautify its  aggression in history, which will surely be condemned by its  Asian victims.    He said that the Hata government has taken a series of  measures and delivered various speeches following Nagano's  remarks.    A message from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was later  conveyed  to Chinese Premier Li Peng promising that history shall be  treated correctly and the younger generation shall be educated  from a correct historical perspective.    The Chinese premier said he appreciated the profound  introspection expressed by Prime Minister Hata over Japan's  aggression and colonial rule.    On the Nansha Islands issue, Li said China will discuss the  matter with Malaysia based on the principle of putting aside  disputes and seeking joint exploration as proposed by Chinese  leader Deng Xiaoping.    Mahathir said Malaysia very much appreciates China's stand  of  peaceful settlement of the Nansha issue and opposed an  internationalization of the Nansha issue.    Both China and Malaysia are developing countries, he said,  so  they share many common points in dealing with both regional and  international affairs.    On democracy, the Malaysian prime minister said, the  concrete  situation in different countries should be respected when  talking about the issue of democracy, and it is not agreeable to  apply the same concept of democracy to all countries in  different stages of development.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Ex-oil chief denies BCCI fraud The financial health of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International was fraudulently exaggerated by the former head of an international oil company, who signed bogus documents to help inflate the bank's profits by Dollars 90m, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. The allegation was made on the opening day of the first criminal prosecution over the collapse of BCCI to go before a UK jury. Mr Mohammed Baqi, the former managing director of Attock Oil, denies 16 charges relating to the furnishing of false information about the bank's finances. Opening the prosecution on behalf of the Serious Fraud Office, Mr Brian Barker QC said the main perpetrator of the fraud had been Mr Basheer Chowdry, a former manager of BCCI's UK division. Mr Chowdry had left for Pakistan after the collapse of the bank in June 1991 and was now out of reach of the British authorities, he said. 'If we could have had him in the dock we would have done,' he continued. Mr Chowdry, along with other BCCI staff, created a series of accounts in the name of Attock Oil which falsely stated that it owed Dollars 90m to BCCI. They enabled Mr Chowdry and others to successfully 'pull the wool over the eyes' of Price Waterhouse, the bank's auditors, who endorsed the bank's accounts, complete with over-stated profits, Mr Barker said. The accounts falsified the financial positions of BCCI and Attock in four areas - management fees charged to Attock, service charges and transactions with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the Paris-based International Arab Investment Bank. Mr Baqi took part in this exercise between September 1986 and April 1990 by writing letters to Price Waterhouse that confirmed Attock Oil owed the money to the bank. 'Mr Baqi signed and wrote a series of letters to the auditors confirming that various large amounts were genuine when they were nothing of the sort. They were a sham and a fake,' Mr Barker said. 'The letters from Mr Baqi deflected any further challenge from the auditors. That meant for some considerable time that this fraud remained undetected,' he continued. Price Waterhouse had understood Attock Oil to be a company that was completely separate from BCCI. The reality was that it was 'inter-meshed' with BCCI, Mr Barker said. Both had offices in the Cayman Islands which were used to put through transactions. After the bank's collapse in 1991, Mr Baqi left the country. When he returned in February 1992 he was arrested and questioned by police. He told them BCCI had effectively owned Attock Oil and that he 'did what he was told' when given documents to sign. The fraud enabled the bank to retain existing deposits and perhaps attract new ones. Mr Baqi might have benefited by keeping his well-paid job with Attock Oil, Mr Barker said. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow (DPA) -- Upon his departure for a three-day  official visit to Germany, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said  that the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany should be  followed by a "phase of national reconciliation." Yeltsin told  journalists at Vnukovo Airport that he expected difficult talks  with Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Russia's debt problem and  the issue of the farewell ceremony for the Russian armed forces  in Germany.    Yeltsin confirmed that Germany is meeting all its social  obligations, including the construction of housing for the  troops returning from Germany. "Germany is the only country  that is strictly fulfilling its obligations," the president  said. "They (the Germans) have even made available an  additional sum of 550 million German marks to step up the  construction of soldiers' housing."    According to Yeltsin, Germany as an economic power ranks  third in the world. That is why Russia must above all put its  stakes in Europe on cooperation with Germany, Yeltsin said.  Yeltsin does not intend to discuss in Bonn the return of  artistic items that were taken during World War II. He said  that this was a matter to be dealt with by "the specialists."  "They will find a solution, and the politicians will listen to  them."</p>

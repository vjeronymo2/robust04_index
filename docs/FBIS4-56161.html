			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- Yesterday, Brazilian Social Democracy  Party candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso officially asked  Deputy Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, PFL [Liberal Front Party] leader  in the Chamber of Deputies, to join his ticket as candidate for  vice president. Cardoso told Luis Eduardo that he would be vice  presidential candidate in these elections only if he so desires,  thus leaving the decision entirely in the hands of Luis Eduardo,  who did not give a definite answer.    Although he did not clearly reject the invitation, Luis  Eduardo expressed his reticence to Cardoso. The two talked for  an hour and a half, analyzed an alliance between the two parties  in the states, and settled the last details of an alliance that  will be officially announced on 2 May.    Former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, father of  Luis Eduardo, will meet with Cardoso in Rio de Janeiro tomorrow,  but will not attend the ceremony on 2 May. Luis Eduardo  admitted he has spoken with Cardoso about the vice presidency  for the first time, but he did not want to give any details.  "It would not be polite," he said.    Luis Eduardo said the PFL decision will probably be  announced  next weekend, depending on the date chosen for the party  convention.</p>

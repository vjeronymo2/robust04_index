			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Laurence Peter] </F>   [Text] Sanaa, June 10 (AFP) -- Yemen's northern President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Friday called for a new ceasefire in the  five-week civil war and proposed ways to make it stick this  time, an official spokesman said here.    His government presented the United Nations with a proposal  for the ceasefire to take effect at midnight on Friday (2100  GMT) in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 924  adopted last week, he said.    Salih told members of a special military committee to  "supervise the ceasefire by holding the first meeting at a place  called Gool," between Sabir and Dayr al-Sayyid villages at 11  a.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday, the spokesman said.    Sabir is along the front line about 25 kilometers (15 miles)  north of the southern stronghold of Aden.    The military committee of southern and northern officers was  formed under a February accord reached in Jordan and aimed at  ending a political crisis between the north and south. But the  crisis erupted into civil war on May 5.    The new proposal came after Salih agreed to a ceasefire  during talks Thursday with UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, but which  collapsed around three hours later. A ceasefire for midnight on  Monday also broke down hours later.    Both sides have accused the other of failing to honor the  pledge to stop fighting.    There was no immediate word from the south on the "new  initiative."    Sanaa has "put forward a new initiative confirming its  keenness to maintain a ceasefire based on UN resolution 924,  despite successive ceasefire violations by the dissidents since  6 p.m. Thursday," the spokesman said in the statement.    Salih describes as dissidents the forces loyal to his  southern rival and former vice president 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who  declared a separate state with Aden as its capital on May 21.    "These violations are still continuing up to this moment,"  the spokesman charged.    "Although the government forces have abided by orders of  President Salih not to return fire, the dissident forces have  continued their violations by launching heavy air and sea  attacks on government forces in Aden and Abyan, inflicting heavy  casualties and damage," he said.    "The Yemeni government told its permanent representative at  the United Nations to keep the UN Secretary General (Butrus  Butrus- Ghali) well informed about all these violations," he  said.    It also told its representative to "submit new ceasefire  initiatives provided the dissidents abide by it with effect from  12 midnight on Friday in order not to give the dissidents a  chance to continue shedding Yemeni blood and executing their  criminal plans," he said.    Brahimi left the northern capital Sanaa earlier on Friday,  saying he was "disappointed" that Thursday's ceasefire had  collapsed but that he had still made a good start.    He was due in Saudi Arabia for talks with Saudi officials  about the conflict. Southern sources said he will meet with  al-Bid and other officials in the southeastern port of Mukalla.</p>

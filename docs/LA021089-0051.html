			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> NBC program chief Brandon Tartikoff, addressing an industry lunch Thursday in  New York, had a complaint similar to that of Rodney Dangerfield -- no respect.  Asked to assess the worst part of this season for NBC, he said it's the  "sometimes exaggerated" knocks NBC has taken for airing some shows critics  found tasteless or even sleazy. "I'd just like to see a little respect out  there from the critical community. I think the only person who's had worse  press than me has been (executed serial murderder) Ted Bundy."

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Tasty dish to set before the City: Michael Skapinker examines the recent recovery in London's restaurant scene Wandering through London in the early hours recently, Mr Roy Ackerman, a well-known restaurateur and food publisher, was accosted by a waiter from a Greek taverna. The waiter had saved Pounds 100,000. A friend had accumulated a similar amount. They wanted to open their own restaurant. Did Mr Ackerman think the time was right? Mr Ackerman, president of the Restaurateurs Association of Great Britain, says a growing number of people have decided it is the right time to open a London restaurant. In the past two months, 30 new establishments have opened. During the same period last year, fewer than 10 opened. Two London-based restaurant groups have been floated on the stock exchange in recent months: Chez Gerard, which includes Bertorelli's in Covent Garden and Cafe Fish off the Haymarket; and My Kinda Town, which runs the Chicago Pizza Pie Factory and Henry J. Bean's. Several chains plan to expand. Chez Gerard wants to increase its restaurants from seven to 14 over the next three years. Corney &amp; Barrow began this year with seven City establishments. By the end of the year, it expects to have double that number. Mr Joel Kissin, managing director of Conran Restaurants, which includes Le Pont de la Tour near Tower Bridge and Quaglino's in the West End, says he first noticed a substantial improvement in business last November. The company was not sure whether this heralded the end of the recession or was the result of an American Express advertisement featuring Sir Terence Conran, Mr Kissin's partner. However, staff turnover at the restaurants began to rise and Mr Kissin noticed it was becoming more difficult to hire waiters, suggesting business had improved elsewhere. Other restaurants have noticed greater employee movement too. Mr Neville Abraham, chairman of Chez Gerard, says this is one sign of a return to normality. 'At that age, 24 or 25, people are very mobile and will go off to Australia with a girlfriend at the drop of a hat,' he says. 'But in a recession, people are afraid. They don't want to leave a secure job.' Mr Christopher Brown, managing director of Corney &amp; Barrow, says business began to pick up last October. When staff at SG Warburg received their bonuses in April, Corney &amp; Barrow in Broadgate had its second best day ever (the best was the Conservatives' election victory in 1992). The recovery in City restaurant business is more noticeable than in the West End. Mr Mark de Wesselow, publisher of Square Meal, a guide to City restaurants, says City employees are eating out more than staff at West End businesses, such as advertising agencies. There are, nevertheless, signs of increasing business throughout London. Mr Ackerman's list of new restaurants includes suburban establishments north and south of the river. One of the factors encouraging new entrants is the property downturn, which has resulted in lower rents. Even in the City, however, restaurateurs have had to make adaptions to benefit from the upturn. Corney &amp; Barrow is converting its establishments into wine bars, largely because this enables it to attract evening trade. Mr Brown says it is difficult to get a decent return from a City restaurant which is open only for lunch, and not on weekends. When you take bank holidays into account, City lunchtime restaurants are open on average 4.7 times a week. People will not stay in the City for an evening meal, Mr Brown says. But they will stay for a drink and a little food. At lunch times, his customers have a light meal and non-alcoholic drinks. In the evenings, they drink alcohol. Several of the new London restaurants offer an attraction in addition to food, such as live music, Mr Ackerman says. Outside the city centre, restaurants are attracting a younger clientele, looking for entertainment as well as a meal. He says the most successful establishments are in the cheap or mid-price range, appealing both to diners who were too young to go to restaurants when the recession began and to older customers looking for less expensive places to eat. Mr Abraham wonders, however, whether the recovery is strong enough to sustain the new restaurants. He says: 'I'm still quite nervous about the economy. My instinct is to be very cautious. I don't think we'll go back to the way it was at the end of the 1980s.' He also questions whether the new restaurants have the business skills to succeed. In the 15 years he has been in the restaurant trade, he says, the quality of London chefs and of the capital's food have improved out of all recognition. He says he has noticed little improvement in the quality of restaurant management. 'It never ceases to amaze me, the optimism with which people open restaurants,' he says. 'It's often because they've always wanted to cook rather than because they've looked at their potential as businesses.'</p>

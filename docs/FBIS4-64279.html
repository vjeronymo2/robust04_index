			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yves Mamou: "CSA Calls For Further Reform in </F> Audiovisual Sector"]    [Text] The proposed reforms to the audiovisual regulatory  code which CSA [High Audiovisual Council] recently presented to  the deputies and senators in compliance with Article 1 of the 1  February 1994 law will very likely prove embarrassing to the  government. Anxious in wake of the Rousselet "affair" not to  stir up more controversy on the high-visibility media scene, the  government had almost decided against introducing a new  legislative package to complement the one promulgated 2 months  ago after much debate.    One of CSA's recommendations is to reestablish for M6--and  only for M6--the right to two commercial interruptions during  the screening of fictional presentations. And it is likely to  set off another uproar in the public and private television  sector. "The little station on the move" reacted quickly:  Nicolas de Tavernost, general manager of M6, said he was happy  with this "unequivocal position," adding that he planned to  "collar the communications minister on Friday 8 April to ask him  to prepare implementing legislation as quickly as possible."  Although CSA believes that the financial impact of such a  measure--130 million French francs [Fr]--will not "greatly  distort the structure" of the advertising market, TF1 surely  will not accept the risk of losing market share without trying  to do something about it.    With regard to public television service, CSA thinks a  decree  should be issued to clarify once and for all the "structures" of  France-Television's common presidency. CSA also deems it  "indispensable for the state to assign specific missions" to  each station and clearly specify authorized areas of  cooperation. Which is one way of saying it is high time for the  government to make public the terms and conditions of the France  2 and France 3 charters.  <H5>  Juridical Vacuums </H5>   Concerning advertising, the council reiterated its desire to  see advertising authorized on local television stations for the  distribution sector. This is a step it will be difficult for the  government to take, so long as newspaper publishers (and  especially the daily regional press) are so intensely fearful of  it. Regarding broadcasting quotas, the CSA says they have  "proved themselves" even though further improvements could be  made on production obligations, to support European  coproductions. CSA even goes so far as to opine that the French  regulatory code could "constitute a model for the European law."    On the subject of cable television, CSA notes the code does  not specify procedures for withdrawing an operator's  authorization once issued, even though the council has received  "several" requests from communes that want to change operators.  Also, it points out that the absence of decrees on the subject  means there is no certification procedure for stations that  broadcast via telecommunications satellites. Lacking too is any  "administrative sanctions regime" for cable stations or cable  operators parallel to the "contractual penalties" currently in  force. CSA would not be unhappy to see "criminal sanctions"  instituted either.    Finally, the council submitted a long list of draft decrees  "not yet issued" by the government whose "rapid promulgation  would put an end to the current juridical vacuums"; included are  decrees covering advertising on local radio stations, minimum  service in event of a public-sector strike, sports event  exclusives, and obligations of stations that broadcase via  telecommunications satellites.    CSA notes that other measures still on hold include the new  charter for Radio-France-Outremer (RFO), the decree on the 52  additional motion pictures authorized for television, and even  the new decrees establishing the obligations of cable stations,  which are needed "urgently" though "the government has not even  submitted drafts."</p>

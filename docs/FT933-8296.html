			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Aircraft workers fear big job losses WORKERS AT British Aerospace's Jetstream subsidiary yesterday expressed concern that the company might be considering large redundancies, after it warned employees of the difficulties it faced. Mr Allan MacDonald, managing director of Jetstream, which is based at Prestwick, Ayrshire, told the workforce that the company would have to realign 'production programmes with market demand and reduce significantly our operating costs'. He said Jetstream would be undermining its long-term viability if it failed to take 'prompt action to stem cash haemorrhaging and minimise production of aircraft for which we have no confirmed customers'. Mr MacDonald said he would meet senior executives to review the business. An announcement is expected in the next two weeks. The company, which employs 2,500 at Prestwick, manufactures 19-seat Jetstream 31 and 29-seat Jetstream 41 turbo-prop airliners. The Prestwick plant is building its first 64-seat Jetstream ATP (advance turbopropeller) aircraft after production of this model was transferred from Woodford near Manchester. Shop stewards said that though although sales of the Jetstream 31 and 41 were holding up, orders for next year were 'thin on the ground'. Mr George Bell, the union convener for the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said he hoped there would be no redundancies. The unions had sought a meeting with management but did not expect it until later this week. Mr MacDonald told employees: 'Our competitors are engaged in savage price discounting in desperation to secure any available orders, and we too have been compelled to offer our products for sale at prices well below their real value.' He said that between 1990 and 1992 worldwide orders for regional aircraft fell from 451 to 22 aircraft. Only 62 orders have been placed to date and the majority of orders carried over from previous years have been cancelled. There was a glut of used aircraft which could come back on to the market at rock bottom prices, he said. Mr MacDonald said that large-scale redundancies were either being implemented or had been announced by aircraft manufacturers including Short Brothers in Belfast, Fokker in the Netherlands, Deutsche Aerospace in Germany and Embraer in Brazil. Westland Aerospace on the Isle of Wight, which makes civil aircraft parts, yesterday announced 81 job losses. The company said airlines had reduced or delayed delivery of new aircraft, resulting in a fall in production by manufacturers. Continental cuts jobs, Page 20</p>

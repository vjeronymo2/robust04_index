			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code, section 21000  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) requires full disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary authority or jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency and is responsible for conducting a review of the project and for consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. CEQA documentation is often inadequate or incomplete, and compliance with CEQA is not monitored. Section 15065 of the CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' However, even if significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option to require mitigation through changes in the project or to decide that ``overriding social and economic considerations'' make mitigation infeasible (California Public Resources Code, Guidelines, section 15093). In the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant environmental damage, such as destruction of endangered plant species. Protection of listed plant species under CEQA is therefore dependent upon the discretion of the lead agency, hence, this is not adequate to ensure the survival of a species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District is the lead agency that is empowered to uphold and enforce CEQA regulations at Cuyamaca Lake reservoir. However, unresolved conflicts exist regarding the use of this area for recreation and habitat protection for state endangered species. The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District receives funding from CDFG, State Bonds, California Division of Parks and Recreation, U.S. National Park Service Land and Water Grants, and other sources, which have been used to stock the reservoir with fish, build duck blinds, a boat ramp, picnic facilities and a fishing trail around the western portion of the reservoir between the dam and the dike. Projects that use state money must comply with CEQA on each project or funding can be withdrawn. Impacts to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limnanthes gracilis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ssp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> parishii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Downingia concolor  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> var.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> brevior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occur during implementation of these projects and may continue to occur as a result of maintenance and use of these facilities. The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District, acting as the state lead agency, has issued negative declarations for its improvement and maintenance activities, which exempts them from the requirement for a full environmental analysis. Other signatory state agencies have not monitored CEQA compliance by the Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District (Jack Shu, California State Parks Department, pers. comm., 1993). These factors have resulted in removal of plants and habitat loss as discussed in factor A above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While CEQA pertains to projects on non-Federal land, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 to 4347) requires disclosure of the environmental effects of projects within Federal jurisdiction. Species that are listed by the State, but not proposed or listed as threatened or endangered by the Federal government, are not protected when a proposed Federal action meets the criterion for a ``categorical exclusion''. NEPA requires that each of the project alternatives recommend ways to ``protect, restore and enhance the environment'' and ``avoid and minimize any possible adverse effects'' when implementation poses significant adverse impacts. However, it does not require that the lead agency select an alternative with the least significant impacts to the environment (40 CFR 1500  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Federal actions that may affect Federal threatened or endangered species require consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and must avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of a listed plant species and destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District is also subject to NEPA because projects for recreational improvements may be funded through the Federal Land and Water Grant program that is administered by the National Park Service through the California Department of Parks and Recreation. These projects would require NEPA review. Land-use planning decisions at the local level are made on the basis of environmental review documents prepared in accordance with CEQA or NEPA that often do not adequately address ``cumulative'' impacts to non-listed species and their habitat. State listed species that are candidates for Federal listing receive no special consideration under NEPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1603 of the California Fish and Game Code authorizes the Department of Fish and Game to regulate streambed alteration. The Department must be notified and approve any work that diverts, alters, or obstructs the natural flow or changes the bed, channel, or banks of any river, stream, or lake. If the Department does not respond within 30 days of the notification, the applicant may proceed with the work. All waterways of the State, including streams, intermittent streams, rivers, and lakes are subject to the Department's jurisdiction. However, the Department of Fish and Game does not consider the creation of wetlands for duck habitat to be regulated under section 1603. Thus, a Streambed Alteration Agreement was not required for flooding the streambed above Cuyamaca Lake reservoir for that purpose. Because the dam has been used continuously since its construction in 1886, justification of its continued use for recreation has been grandfathered into law (William D. Smith, Lake Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993).

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Confusion over candidates in Devon and East Plymouth A Literal Democrat candidate polled 10,000 votes in the Devon and East Plymouth constituency, which the Liberal Democrats had hoped to win. The Liberal Democrats had regarded the Literal Democrat candidature as a spoiling action. The party protested and went to the High Court, but was told that a challenge would result in a delayed election. The party decided that could be counter-productive. On polling day, the Liberal Democrat HQ received many telephone calls from confused voters. Candidates are listed on the ballot paper in alphabetical order and the party's candidate, Mr Adrian Sanders, came at the bottom. Above him on the ballot paper were the Literal Democrat candidate and a Liberal candidate. Some callers said they realised they had voted for the wrong candidate by mistake.</p>

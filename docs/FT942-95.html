			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Charter welds on fourth leg: Andrew Bolger reports on the offer for Esab, a long-awaited deal It was with obvious relief that Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive of Charter, was able yesterday to unveil the kind of large acquisition which the market has been waiting for him to make. The offer for Esab, the Swedish welding company, will more than double the size of the UK group, which in recent years had been focused into three areas - building materials, coal and rail track equipment. Unscrambling Charter's links with Johnson Matthey and Minorco gave the group its independence - but also the problem of how best to utilise the Pounds 156m in cash left after ending the South African connection. Mr Herbert said that Charter's market share in its existing niche businesses was high, so it was difficult to invest more in them - hence the need to acquire a fourth leg. The Swedish group fitted perfectly his oft-rehearsed acquisition criteria - being international, with market leadership and industrial customers in mature markets, which offer scope for growth and adding value. According to Charter, Esab is the world market leader in welding products, and is either number one or two in five of the G7 countries. Growth prospects partly come from the economic cycle. The level of welding activity closely tracks GDP growth, and the chart illustrates the forecast upturn in the market. Weakened competitors are also a factor. Mr Herbert said US rivals had expanded rapidly in Europe in the late 1980s 'just the wrong time' and had withdrawn 'having had their fingers badly burned'. Charter claims that Lincoln, the US company which is number two to Esab in world market share, incurred losses of Dollars 134m (Pounds 88.1m) in Europe from 1990-93 and now has a heavily geared balance sheet. Esab also suffered in the recession. Operating profits have collapsed from Pounds 40m in 1989 to Pounds 7m last year. However, the company forecasts operating profits of Pounds 27m in the current year, and analysts expect at least Pounds 40m next year. Mr Herbert said Esab was not any kind of basket case, and he did not see this as a turnround. Welding consumables, such as rods and fluxes, which comprise 55 per cent of turnover, remained profitable throughout the recent downturn. The welding equipment division, which accounts for 28 per cent of sales, had been losing money but was 'now turning'. Esab has spent Pounds 20m over the last three years in restructuring. It has reduced its western European workforce by 35 per cent and embarked on a product rationalisation programme. Charter believes this process can be pushed further. Mr Herbert said Esab's management was very competent 'but we focus on cash and margin management - they're not so good on that'. The UK group runs a lean organisation, with only 30 people in its London head office. Charter said a direct comparison with the 300 who work at Esab's head office in Gothenburg would be unfair, since they carried out a wider range of tasks, but there will clearly be scope for reductions. Mr Herbert is a firm believer in functional, vertical management on the Anglo-Saxon model, with executives taking direct responsibility for defined operations. The Swedish company's matrix management system seems unlikely to survive for long in the enlarged group. However, Mr Lars Westerberg, who has been Esab's chief executive since 1990, would remain with the group. Charter is also keen to discover how transportable Esab products are. The Swedish group has 16 production units located in Europe, North and South America and south-east Asia. Mr Herbert will examine the scope to utilise excess production capacity in low-cost areas, such as eastern Europe, where Esab has a dominant position. The quality of output from the eastern European plants was high, he said, so it might be possible to use some of it in more high-cost economies. Charter would also want to develop Esab's activities in new markets, such as Latin America and east Asia, particularly China. The group has a strong position in Brazil, but so far no presence in China, where it is likely to go for joint ventures. Mr Herbert said: 'We've had the time and access for extensive research and due diligence. As a result I'm convinced this is a business we can grip.'</p>

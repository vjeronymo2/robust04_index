			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MCGILLIS TO APPEAR IN GARDEN GROVE EVENT  </P> <P> Kelly McGillis, recently appointed to the board of the Grove Shakespeare  Festival, will participate in a "readers' theater" fund-raising event on July  30 at the Festival Amphitheatre in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> McGillis and others from the troupe will read excerpts of speeches by their  favorite Shakespearean characters, said Grove executive vice president Barbara  Hammerman. The evening's format will be decided next week, Hammerman said.  </P> <P> Hammerman noted that McGillis, who also will be honorary chairperson for the  event, may invite other actors from the Hollywood community to participate but  that prospects remain vague. "We would love to have one or two other artists of  note," said Hammerman.  </P> <P> The Grove, which launches its 12th season this weekend with Moliere's "The  Miser," has projected a $717,000 budget for 1990. The theater troupe already  has encountered a cash-flow shortage, Hammerman said, chiefly because there has  been no box-office income for more than three months. The final show of last  season, "Twelfth Night," closed on Feb. 3.  </P> <P> "We've basically had a cash shortage since the summer of 1988," said artistic  director Thomas F. Bradac, who heads a salaried staff of only five full-time  employees, including himself and Hammerman. "We've been in a 'fallout mode'  ever since we lost our financial support from our partnership with Rancho  Santiago College and from the city."  </P> <P> The college had provided $105,000 in goods and services, such as scene shop  facilities, salaries for designers, and program printing, Bradac said. The  Garden Grove City Council had provided $87,000 in an annual cash subsidy, but  that has been phased down to less than $30,000.  </P> <P> Hammerman emphasized, however, that the Grove is not in any deep fiscal  trouble. She said its current subscription drive has kept pace with last  season's, drawing more than 1,700 season ticket holders so far. The goal is  2,500, about 300 more than last year's record high of 2,200.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the Grove has begun negotiations with the City Council to  obtain a five-year lease of both the indoor, 172-seat Gem and the outdoor,  550-seat amphitheater. Currently, the city leases the facilities to the Grove  on an annual basis. Hammerman said an extended lease would not only provide the  theater troupe with greater security but also help other fund-raising efforts  by assuring potential contributors that the troupe has the long-term support of  its community.  </P></p>

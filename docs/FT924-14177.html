			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Baghdad returns US bomb expert US bomb disposal expert Chad Hall, arrested by Iraqi security forces on the disputed Kuwaiti border, returned to Kuwait yesterday under UN escort, Reuter reports from Kuwait. UN officials handed Mr Hall to US ambassador Edward Gnehm at Kuwait City airport and he was driven to the US embassy. Mr Hall earlier arrived under UN escort at Umm Qasr, near the frontier, where he was given medical checks. An official said: 'He looked pretty healthy to me.' Mr Hall, hired to clear ordnance left over from the 1991 Gulf War, was arrested by the Iraqis at gunpoint on Thursday as he was working with two Pakistani colleagues. The UN said he was arrested at least 1km inside Kuwait. Iraq freed Mr Hall to UN custody on Saturday. It was in marked contrast to the harsh treatment meted out to other foreigners detained on the Kuwaiti frontier or in northern Iraq since the Gulf War ended last February. Mr Hall, a retired US Army major, was taken at gunpoint by Iraqi security police after an argument over whether he and two Pakistani workers were working in Kuwait or Iraq. The territory had belonged to Iraq until May, when a UN commission redefined the border. Baghdad has refused to recognise the new boundary. Baghdad announced Mr Hall's release on Saturday, carefully worded to avoid an apology, but implicitly admitting a mistake over Mr Hall's detention. Under Iraqi law, anyone entering the country without a visa can be jailed for up to 20 years; several foreigners have been convicted after being arrested near Iraqi borders. Sweden is seeking retrials or pardons for three Swedish engineers jailed in Iraq for seven years. Two Britons have been jailed for trespassing on Iraqi territory.</p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Southern Life increases payout Southern Life, the South African life assurer, reports a 22.5 per cent increase to R240m (Dollars 65.8m) in distributable earnings for the year ended March. It is stepping up its dividend to a total of 94 cents, an increase of 21.3 per cent. Total income rose to R4.76bn from R3.5bn, of which premium income rose to R3.57bn from R2.48bn, a rise of 44 per cent. Investment income increased 15 per cent to R1.2bn. The increase was largely the result of new business, which rose 88 per cent to R2.24bn. Single premiums accounted for R1.84bn while recurring premiums accounted for R403m. Group total assets grew 29 per cent to R24.8bn. Mr Jan Calitz, managing director, said the good results had been greatly helped by successful cost containment. Operating costs had increased by just 13.7 per cent on the year while total income had risen 35 per cent. 'This is due to rapid expansion of new business, increased investment in systems development and higher marketing expenses, not to additional manpower,' Mr Calitz said. Southern's two largest shareholders, Anglo American corporation and First National Bank, plan to take their dividend in share form. The year's figures do not include African Life, the subsidiary that was last year spun off to a consortium of black investors. Southern will retain a 25 per cent stake in African Life and has invested R42m in Conslab Investments, a significant shareholder in the new holding company, Real Africa Investments, which controls African Life. Southern Life chairman Mr Neal Chapman said that he was confident about the company's future given the success of South Africa's recent elections and the improved economic outlook. 'We can face the future with confidence and with every hope that lasting peace and a strong economy lie ahead.' he said.</p>

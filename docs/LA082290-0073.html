			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RESERVES CALL-UP DECISION DELAYED;  </P> <P> MILITARY: OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PART OF THE REASON IS TO PREPARE THE  PUBLIC FOR THE IMPACT.  </P> <P> With the military pressing to call up reserves to support its massive Middle  East deployment, Bush Administration officials said Tuesday a final decision  has been delayed so that the Pentagon can match its vacancies with available  military specialists.  </P> <P> Officials acknowledged, however, that the delay also reflects a desire to  prepare for the expected public impact of a deployment expected to eventually  send tens of thousands of reservists to active duty in the Persian Gulf region  as well as within the United States.  </P> <P> President Bush's decision on the scope of the initial reserve call-up is  expected to come as early as today.  </P> <P> The Pentagon, meanwhile, reported that the United States has moved the  equivalent of a small Midwestern city to the Middle East in the last 19 days --  complete with all of the necessary foodstuffs, vehicles and belongings.  </P> <P> Air Force Gen. H.T. Johnson, commander of the U.S. Transportation Command and  Military Airlift Command, said the massive movement of military personnel and  equipment in less than three weeks is the largest operation of its kind in U.S.  history.  </P> <P> Even in the absence of a formal reserve call-up, he said, about 4,200 military  reservists have volunteered to fly the 89 C-5s and 195 C-141s that are being  used in the airlift. In addition, 17 commercial airliners and 21 civilian cargo  planes have been pressed into service.  </P> <P> Despite the significant volunteer effort, Johnson said the President would have  to mobilize military reserve units because most volunteers could not be away  from their jobs in private industry for more than 45 days.  </P> <P> Administration officials acknowledged that yanking neighborhood doctors and  grocery clerks from their communities and sending them to war can be a  wrenching experience, not just for the individuals and their communities but  for the nation as a whole.  </P> <P> As part-time reservists are called up to become full-time soldiers, small towns  and big cities alike will come to grips with the human dimensions of the crisis  and the impact it can have across the continent, they noted.  </P> <P> The postponement of the President's final decision has provided a welcome  breathing space to allow the nation to become accustomed to the idea that the  escalating crisis in the Middle East will involve a certain amount of personal  disruption.  </P> <P> Bush's assistants have said the President was nearly certain as of last Friday  that he would call up reserve units. Officials said the paper work to activate  the reserves lacks only a presidential signature.  </P> <P> But they said the Administration decided to delay the final step while complex  preparations are still under way. The goal was to try to avoid confusion and  minimize further delays once the decision is announced.  </P> <P> "There's just a lot of detail," one senior White House official said. "When it  is signed, all these people are going to be told what is expected of them. You  want them to be able to get a definite word one way or the other. You're  dealing with people's lives and their employment."  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, are set to meet with Bush today in Kennebunkport, Me. Among  other things, they are expected to discuss the reserve call-up, White House  Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.  </P> <P> White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said the White House wants to make  sure that the activation order is able to match the right military personnel  with the vacancies that need to be filled.  </P> <P> Officials have said that as many as 150,000 reservists eventually could be  called into active duty. Many would represent specialties, such as medicine and  cargo handling, that are in short supply among active-duty forces.  </P> <P> At the Pentagon, Gen. Johnson told a news briefing that the military, with help  from reserve volunteers and the private sector, has transported the equivalent  of Fayette, Ind., population 27,500, or Jefferson City, Mo., population 36,000,  to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "We're fortunate we didn't have to fight our way in," Johnson said. "We've had  no major surprises."  </P> <P> He said the airlift initially strained the military's capacity as the United  States hurried combat units to the Persian Gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait. But in recent days the operation has relied more on ship, which have  spare capacity, Johnson said.  </P> <P> Most tanks and military vehicles have been rushed overseas aboard eight "fast  sealift" ships capable of speeds up to 33 knots. The operation also involved  unloading 12 Navy vessels pre-positioned in the Indian Ocean and stocked with  ammunition, fuel, food and medical supplies.  </P> <P> The Pentagon also has activated 38 ships from its "ready reserve fleet" and  chartered 8 ships from commercial lines, Johnson said.  </P> <P> The 1 billion pounds of material transported or still en route to the region is  equal to all the cars, trucks, foodstuff, stocks, household goods and water  supply of a small city, he told reporters.  </P> <P> Johnson declined to divulge the specific number of troops or military vehicles  that have been put into place in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> But he said 99% of all U.S. troops have been flown to the gulf in C-5 Galaxy  and C-141 Starlifter transports. The trip takes 15 hours from the East Coast  and about 20 hours from West Coast embarkation points.  </P> <P> Participation by commercial air carriers began last Friday when Johnson  activated a program known as the Civil Reserve Air Fleet for the first time  since its inception in 1951, at the time of the Korean war.  </P> <P> Gerstenzang reported from Kennebunkport and Jackson from Washington.  </P></p>

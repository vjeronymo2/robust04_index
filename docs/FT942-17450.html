			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Bank branch opens as Palestinian self-rule nears The Bank of Jordan yesterday became the first commercial bank to begin operations in the Israeli-occupied territories since the signing of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. The bank opened a branch in the West Bank town of Ramallah. Mr Tawfik Fakhouri, chairman of the bank, said in Amman that the branch would have a staff of 42 and 'offer all normal banking services, including interest-bearing deposits, loans and letters of credit to the Palestinians'. It will deal in both the Jordanian dinar and Israeli shekel, along with other currencies. Further branches are planned soon in Hebron, Jericho, Jenin, Bethlehem, Qalkilya and Gaza. The green light for Jordanian banks to reopen branches in the occupied territories, which were closed after the 1967 war, was given in a memorandum signed by Jordan and Israel last December. A further agreement by Jordan and the PLO was finalised earlier this year and gave the Central Bank of Jordan the job of supervising and monitoring the new branches. The Jordanian-Palestinian deal stipulates that banks in the occupied territories operate solely under Jordanian law, but banks must also comply with the Israeli monetary authorities which issue the licence. 'We will be reporting directly to the Central Bank of Jordan but also submitting monthly balance sheets and the like to the Bank of Israel,' explained Mr Fayez Abulien, general manager of the Bank of Jordan. Some bankers in Amman have reservations about operating in the West Bank. 'Since the intifada (Palestinian uprising) began, a culture of non-repayment has grown up and bad debts will certainly be a problem,' said one banker.</p>

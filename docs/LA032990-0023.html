			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: OLYMPICS ISSUES NOT WORTH MUCH  </P> <P> Question: I have several souvenir sheets of commemorative stamps from the 1936  Olympics in Berlin. Do these have any value? -- F.K.  </P> <P> Answer: Maybe $15 apiece if in mint condition, $25 each if legitimately  cancelled (retail prices); this is an example of how certain stamps are more  valuable cancelled than mint.  </P> <P> Your sheets are listed in the Scott catalogue under German semi-postals, with  catalogue numbers B91 and B92. They had a first day of issue Aug. 1, 1936, just  in time for the Olympic festivities.  </P> <P> Germany then, as always, had many enthusiastic stamp collectors, who purchased  enough of these souvenir sheets so that their market value is only moderate  today. These sheets sold for 1 Mark each in Berlin, with a substantial part of  the stamp revenue earmarked for the German Olympic effort.  </P> <P> Q: I have a U.S. Government Thrift Card, containing seven 25-cent Thrift  Stamps. While in grammar school during World War I, I bought these weekly. Are  they worth anything now? -- G.M.  </P> <P> A: The current catalogue value for this stamp, listed in the Scott catalogue  under War Savings Stamps (catalogue number WS1), is $10. Issued by the U.S.  Treasury Department on Dec. 1, 1917, these stamps were redeemable in U.S.  Treasury War Certificates. If you had a mint margin block of six stamps with  the plate number on it, you would have a $500 item. As it is, your Thrift  stamps affixed to their savings card lose a little of their collector appeal in  the eyes of some philatelists, and maybe your whole card is worth about $20 or  $25 retail price.  </P> <P> Q: I would like to order British stamps directly from the British government at  face value. Is this possible? -- P.M.  </P> <P> A: Yes. Write to: British Philatelic Bureau, 20 Brandon St., Edinburgh EH3 5TT,  Scotland, Great Britain. They accept personal checks and international money  orders, and they have a procedure for a "standing account" whereby you send  them a deposit and automatically receive new issues of British stamps. Mint  stamps, first-day covers and special postmarks are available.  </P> <P> Of course, if you need only a mint single of each British new issue for your  collection, it might be cheaper to get it from a local stamp shop to avoid  paying the postage and check fees connected with ordering from the British  Philatelic Bureau.  </P></p>

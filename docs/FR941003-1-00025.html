			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;1.633, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to specify that a claim shall be construed in light of the specification of the application or patent in which it appears. This amendment would administratively set aside the judicially created rule of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In re Spina,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 975 F.2d 854, 856, 24 USPQ2d 1142, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to the extent it held that the interference rules require that an ambiguous claim copied from a patent for interference purposes be construed in light of the disclosure of the patent. A claim that has been added to a pending application for any purpose, including to provoke an interference, would be given the broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the disclosure of the application to which it is added, as are claims which are added during  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> prosecution. As explained  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In re Zletz,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [D]uring patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as broadly as their terms reasonably allow. When the applicant states the meaning that the claim terms are intended to have, the claims are examined with that meaning, in order to achieve a complete exploration of the applicant's invention and its relation to the prior art.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> See In re Prater,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 415 F.2d 1393, 1404&hyph;05, 162 USPQ 541, 550&hyph;51 (CCPA 1969) (before the application is granted, there is no reason to read into the claim the limitations of the specification). The reason is simply that during patent prosecution when claims can be amended, ambiguities should be recognized, scope and breadth of language explored, and clarification imposed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Quigg,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 822 F.2d 1581, 1583, 3 USPQ2d 1436, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1987);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> In re Yamamoto,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ 934, 936 (Fed. Cir. 1984). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> If a party believes an opponent's claim corresponding to the count is ambiguous when construed in light of the opponent's disclosure, the party should move under &sect;1.633(a) for judgment against the claim on the ground of unpatentability under the second paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112. In paragraph (a), it is also proposed to delete ``by reference to the prior art of record'' as unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;1.633 are proposed to be amended by deleting some unnecessary language from each paragraph and by changing ``derivation'' to ``Derivation'' in paragraph (a)(2). Paragraph (b), which concerns motions for judgment on the ground of no interference-in-fact, is proposed to be amended by stating that it is possible for claims of opponents presented in ``means plus function'' format to define separate patentable inventions even though the claims of the opponents contain the same literal wording. The reason is that the sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112, which is applicable to ``means plus function'' limitations in application claims and patent claims, provides that such limitations are to be construed as covering the corresponding structure disclosed in the associated application or patent and equivalents thereof.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In re Donaldson Co.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16 F.3d 1189, 29 USPQ2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (i) of &sect;1.633 in its current form authorizes a party who opposes a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633 (a), (b) or (g) to file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633 (c) or (d). It is proposed to amend paragraph (i) to additionally authorize a party-patentee to file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(h) to add to the interference an application for reissue of the party's involved patent. Because a reissue application can include an amended or new claim to be designated as corresponding to a count, the proposed amendment would give a patentee an option similar to that afforded in the same situation to a party-applicant, who can file a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(2) to amend a claim in, or add a claim to, its involved application to be designated as corresponding to a count. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;1.637, it is proposed to amend paragraph (a) to incorporate the substance of the Notice of the Chairman of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of August 10, 1990, published as ``Interferences_Preliminary Motions for Judgment,'' 1118 Off. Gaz. Pat. Office 19 (Sept. 11, 1990). Paragraph (a) as proposed to be amended would state that where a party files a preliminary motion for judgment against an opponent under &sect;1.633(a) based on unpatentability over prior art having a date that appears to make the prior art equally applicable to the moving party, it will be presumed, without regard to the dates alleged in the preliminary statement of the party, that the cited prior art is also applicable to the party unless there is included with the motion an explanation, and evidence if appropriate, as to why the prior art does not apply to the party. The proposed amendment differs from the notice by providing that if the motion fails to include a sufficient explanation or evidence, the party will not be permitted to rely on any such explanation or evidence in response to or in any subsequent action in the interference. The notice had directed the administrative party, a procedure which results in delaying a decision on the preliminary motion. Paragraph (a) is further proposed to be clarified by changing ``Every'' in the second sentence to ``Each.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;1.637 sets forth the requirements for a preliminary motion to add or substitute a proposed count. It is proposed to amend paragraph (c)(1)(v) in two respects. The first is to require a moving party to show that the proposed count is patentable over the prior art. The second is to specify that a proposed substitute count need only be shown to be patentably distinct from the other counts proposed to remain in the interference, since a proposed substitute count need not be patentably distinct from the count it is to replace. Paragraph (c)(1)(vi) is proposed to be amended to clarify that a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(c)(1) need not be accompanied by a preliminary motion for benefit under &sect;1.633(f) unless the moving party seeks benefit with respect to the proposed count. It is also proposed to add a new paragraph (c)(1)(vii) specifying that where an opponent is accorded the benefit of the filing date of an earlier filed application in the notice of declaration of the interference, the moving party must show why the opponent is not also entitled to benefit of the filing date of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed count. Otherwise, the opponent will be presumed to be entitled to the benefit of the earlier filed application with respect to the proposed count. The amendment would eliminate the need for an opponent to respond to a &sect;1.633(c)(1) motion with a preliminary motion under &sect;1.633(f) claiming benefit, which has the effect of delaying a decision on the &sect;1.633(c)(1) motion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

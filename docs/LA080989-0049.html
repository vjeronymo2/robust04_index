			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENTS' CALL MAY BRING NEW SALVADOR PEACE TALKS  </P> <P> On its face, the call by the presidents of five Central American countries for  "a constructive dialogue" to end El Salvador's civil war does little to advance  a settlement of the nine-year conflict, but some officials and diplomats say it  provides both sides with a face-saving way to open new peace talks.  </P> <P> "Now I think we can expect both the government and the FMLN (the Farabundo  Marti National Liberation Front, the Marxist guerrilla organization) to come up  with some new proposals, using Tela as the excuse," one Latin American diplomat  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Firm Conviction  </P> <P> He referred to a statement issued Monday in Tela, Honduras, by the presidents  of Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, in which they  "reiterate their firm conviction about the need for an immediate and effective  cessation of hostilities" in El Salvador.  </P> <P> The section of the statement dealing with the war here, part of a larger  agreement to close Nicaraguan rebel camps in Honduras, went on to say that the  presidents "vehemently urge the FMLN to carry out a constructive dialogue to  achieve a just and lasting peace (and) . . . urge the government of El Salvador  to arrange, with full guarantees . . . the incorporation of the members of the  FMLN into peaceful life."  </P> <P> Although El Salvador and the United States say this means that the five  presidents endorsed a demand for rebel disarmament, the accord does not call  for the rebels' demobilization and their integration into the system until "the  FMLN agrees through dialogue to abandon the armed struggle."  </P> <P> This effectively divorced the Salvadoran conflict from the solution worked out  to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel camps by early December. That solution was  based on the more advanced negotiating process and the establishment of an  international mechanism to oversee the disarming and relocation of the  Nicaraguan Contras.  </P> <P> Despite Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's claims that the Tela agreement  supports his position for immediate FMLN disarmament, officials here said  Cristiani is working on a plan to rejuvenate a "dialogue commission" empowered  to talk with the rebels.  </P> <P> He called for formation of such a group "to hold immediate talks" with the  rebels when he took office June 1. But it was never formed, and the rebels said  there was no basis for negotiations.  </P> <P> The FMLN, in a statement issued Tuesday over its clandestine radio, said it  "reaffirms its will to contribute to the work of the political parties, the  (Roman Catholic) archbishop and other social forces to arrange a dialogue and  begin negotiations with the government."  </P> <P> In line with that call, FMLN leaders are said by supporters here and in other  countries to be preparing what one source called "a truly serious" plan to  negotiate an end to the fighting, which has killed an estimated 70,000 people.  </P> <P> "It will be the FMLN's first meaningful offer, without the conditions that made  their plan last year unworkable," one source said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Proposals  </P> <P> In the weeks before the country's presidential elections last March 19, the  FMLN made several proposals that in essence called for the rebels to end the  war and participate in the elections.  </P> <P> However, the government would not agree to postpone the voting for the six  months demanded by the FMLN, nor would the rebels accept counterdemands that  they disarm before the balloting and agree to a cease-fire.  </P> <P> The sources would not disclose any details of the new plan. But they said its  overall scope has been approved in principle by Nicaraguan President Daniel  Ortega, who reportedly has urged the FMLN to reopen negotiations with  Cristiani.  </P> <P> FMLN leaders met July 29-30 in Mexico City with officials of El Salvador's  major opposition party, the Christian Democrats, who agreed the rebel approach  was serious.  </P></p>

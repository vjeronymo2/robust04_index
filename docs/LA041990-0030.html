			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Police are searching for a man posing as a Federal Express employee who has  tricked several San Diego businesses out of hundreds of dollars.  </P> <P> Police spokesman Bill Robinson said that, since Feb. 1, police have received  about 25 calls from small businesses that have paid the man $18.50 per  delivery.  </P> <P> The thief, wearing either a brown or blue Federal Express uniform bearing the  company's emblem, delivers envelopes stuffed with blank Internal Revenue  Service forms. He also leaves receipts with return addresses from nonexistent  state agencies.  </P> <P> At noon Wednesday, the thief entered a barber shop in the 6100 block of  University Avenue with a delivery from the state Board of Barbers, Robinson  said. When the shop's employee became suspicious and refused to pay, the thief  told him he had other deliveries to make and would return later.  </P> <P> The man is described as white, in his 40s, about 6-foot-3 and weighing 160 to  170 pounds. He had brown, collar-length hair and was wearing clear, wire-rimmed  glasses.  </P> <P> Robinson said similar operations have been reported in Sacramento, Fresno,  Orange County and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Anyone with information on the scam should call police at 696-1655.  </P></p>

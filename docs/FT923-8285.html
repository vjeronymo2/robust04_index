			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Observer: That's life Three enormous Jiffy bags were delivered by express courier to FT journalists yesterday. What was inside? A T-shirt? An annual report? No. All that each contained was a large manila envelope. And inside that envelope - a single sheet of paper. Still, hope springs eternal. Perhaps the piece of paper would reveal vital news. Not a bit of it. It was Standard Life's investment view, which contained such gems as 'housing market remains depressed'. It would seem that such 1990s concepts as cost-cutting and saving the environment have yet to reach one of Britain's largest life insurers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F> Democratic Party of Russia, by Srdjan Djuric in Moscow; date not  given: "Support for our Christian Orthodox Brothers"]    [Text] The problem of former Yugoslavia and the agreement  on civil reconciliation were topics that dominated the Russian  political scene last week, judging at least from debates in the  state Duma and media. On Friday, 22 April, in the Kremlin,  President Boris Yeltsin summoned the leaders of the  parliamentary factions, the representatives of the church, and  government officials. At the meeting, where the draft of an  agreement that, as has been envisaged by economists, would  soothe political disagreements, and prompt a harmonized Russia  peacefully to develop further, Yeltsin's most vociferous  opponent, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, took part.    Three months have passed since our last conversation on the  premises of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], a  dilapidated old house on Stepenkiy Square. He arrived at the  party's new headquarters in the Mir Hotel, next to the building  of the former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], the  current Duma, visibly exhausted by lengthy assembly debates and  talks in the Kremlin. Beside the new LDPR headquarters, many  things have changed since January. Among his closest aides, who  are making a much more civilized impression now, there are  almost no old faces. Although his attitudes remain the same,  Zhirinovskiy appears to be more composed than before. He is  lacking the severity that used to emanate from each movement,  word, or look of his. It seems that he is even trying to wash  his hands of some of his earlier uncontrolled statements.    "Our attitude has always been against any military  intervention on any Serbian territory in the former Yugoslavia,  particularly against any involvement by NATO," Zhirinovskiy says  about the NATO air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions.  "We are explicitly against it, and we have been saying this for  four months now. I have said even today to our president that  we ought to take a clear stance regarding the protection of our  Christian Orthodox brothers in the Balkans and Yugoslavia," he  says.    [Djuric] You said that if it came to air strikes against the  Serb positions, cities of NATO member countries would have to  pay the price. Recently it did come to air strikes against the  Serbs....    [Zhirinovskiy] That is my personal position. We shall be  urging our government to take the appropriate measures. When  our delegations come back from Serbia, we shall propose that the  Duma lifts the economic sanctions against Serbia. We are ready  to exert further pressure on our government to take a firmer  stance, to forbid any bombing of Serbian towns. We are sticking  to that stance. However, we are an opposition party, rather  than the executive body, so we shall be pursuing our policy in  the future as well, and we shall not give up.    [Djuric] You were a vehement critic of the official Russian  policy on the problem of former Yugoslavia. How do you assess  the roles of the president and the foreign minister today?    [Zhirinovskiy] Their policy has started to change in the  last two months. They have taken a stance closer to the Serbs,  as much toward the United Nations as toward the Muslims and  other participants in the Yugoslav conflict. However, we still  consider their stance to be weak, and they should take a firmer  one. We have demanded many times that the foreign minister be  replaced. I also demanded this in the Duma last week, and  yesterday as well, while today I said in the Kremlin that we  ought to have a different foreign policy, particularly with  regard to the former Yugoslavia. I think that the wrong attitude  of our diplomats is best illustrated by Kozyrev's completely  unprofessional attitude. The role given to Churkin does not  correspond to reality at all. And now the minister's deputy  [Churkin] is behaving like an offended little girl.    The best and the only way is to lift the economic blockade  against Serbia and Montenegro. One should start commercial  exchanges, conclude military-political agreements, our army  should be sent to Serbia, and only then will the final score be  positive for Serbs. There is little use in the negotiations and  conferences that Yeltsin is interceding for. So far all the  conferences and all the negotiations have eventually collapsed,  and the war has continued. Today I proposed to Yeltsin that we  could accomplish peace in the Balkans by sending our troops in  the region. We have considerable troops in Germany -- 300,000  soldiers and officers. We could send them to the Balkans,  rather than back to Russia. In that way the issue would be  solved, provided, of course, that the Serbian republics  consented to this.    [Djuric] Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov have been  released from prison thanks to your party's votes. Have there  been any changes on the Russian political stage caused by their  release?    [Zhirinovskiy] No, their release has not influenced the  political situation in Russia at all. However, I think that,  from the psychological point of view, the situation is much  better if you do not have political prisoners. Khasbulatov has  completely abandoned politics, and will not be engaged in it, or  involved in any political activities. As for Rutskoy, he is  resting. He is at home, and is not influencing political life  in any way.    [Djuric] Your visits to Serbia and Montenegro have caused  many controversies. It has been noticed that no officials  received you....    [Zhirinovskiy] We went there on invitations by certain  parties, associations, and movements. That was not a part of  the program and was not necessary.... We simply visited our  Serbian friends, and followed the program that they prepared.  The basic intention was to visit different regions, and to make  contacts with the local population. That was our first visit,  and was highlighted by our participation at several big rallies  -- in Vukovar, Montenegro, and Herzegovina. We did what the  program anticipated by our friends expected us to do. I see  nothing peculiar in this.    If parliament invites us (our second delegation went to  Serbia following an invitation from parliament, whereas even now  our delegation is visiting parliament), we shall also go there.  On 8 May we shall be there again, and everything depends on  what sort of program is anticipated by those who invite us.    [Djuric] In Serbia much attention has been paid to your  cooperation with the party led by Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan, as  well as to the so-called secret Elipton weapon that you gave  him. Why did you decide to cooperate with that particular man,  and why did you give that mysterious weapon to him, rather than  to somebody else?    [Zhirinovskiy] It is our military experts, our supporters,  who were also there with us, who gave him the weapon. We just  connected them with Arkan, and we have nothing against their  exchange of experience or assistance aimed at improving the  defense ability of Serbian territories. We have several naval  officers, submarine commanders, who are ready even to deploy  their submarines in the Adriatic Sea, and carry out attacks  against the NATO air bases from which planes assigned to bomb  Serb positions take off. That was the officers' personal  initiative. We are a political party, and we do not take part  in such activities. However, those officers are so eager to  help, that, as far as I know, they already have a plan to carry  out counterattacks against NATO bases.    [Djuric] Your visit to Zagreb had been announced for a long  time. Why did you cancel it, and when will it eventually come  about?    [Zhirinovskiy] In Zagreb, there is a dispute in the  leadership. Some people want me to visit them, others are  hesitant. Besides, I am waiting for public opinion to mature.  As far as I know, for the time being there is no acceptable  solution between the Serbs and Croats, and I would not like the  Serbs to think that I want to make some agreements with the  Croats. I have plenty of time. If it is their good will and  desire, I shall visit them, but my policy remains unchanged --  giving support to our Serbian Orthodox brothers.    [Djuric] The state Duma has been discussing the problem of  former Yugoslavia for several days. What can be expected after  the return of the delegation of the Duma that is now touring the  former Yugoslav republics?    [Zhirinovskiy] The basic goal of our party is that our  activities in parliament result in a decision to lift the  sanctions, and in the government's undertaking concrete steps  aimed at the improvement of the situation in the Balkans. We  shall do anything that we are required to. We were told: If  there had not been these latest events in Gorazde, in two weeks  the sanctions would be lifted. That is what they are saying  now. The fact is that even if there had not been those clashes,  the sanctions would probably not have been lifted anyway. It is  hard to judge how realistic the option was. But the tendency to  speed up the possible lifting of the sanctions does exist.    [Djuric] You are saying that you were told that the  sanctions might have been lifted. Do you think that the Serbs  made a mistake by attacking Gorazde?    [Zhirinovskiy] I do not think so, and I cannot accuse  anybody here. That is a matter for the Serbs. Still, our  experts at the Foreign Ministry believe that if the events in  Gorazde had not happened, the question of sanctions would have  been settled in the shortest possible time. That is what they  are saying now, but, perhaps, they are simply deceiving us.    [Djuric] In addition to Arkan's party, which other Serbian  political parties do you cooperate with? What sorts of  cooperation do you exercise, if there is any cooperation?    [Zhirinovskiy] Our relations are the same with all the other  parties. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of Serbia.  When some parties invite us, we go there, and make contacts....  And whether we have any particular preferences -- no, we do  not! Those are internal affairs of Serbia. We have the same  attitude toward each of Serbia's political parties.</p>

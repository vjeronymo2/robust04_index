			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> ARSON IS PROBABLE CAUSE OF APARTMENT FIRE  </P> <P> Arson was the probable cause of a fire that forced seven families to flee their  apartments early Sunday morning, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> The blaze, which started about 1:18 a.m., caused an estimated $40,000 damage to  six carports and cars at the apartment complex in the 1100 block of North East  Street.  </P> <P> Authorities were continuing their investigation and had no suspects, Anaheim  city spokeswoman Barbara Burke said.  </P> <P> The apartment complex was also the site of a Dec. 7 fire that was caused by a  short circuit in a stereo system, fire officials said. No one was injured in  either blaze.  </P> <P> The Sunday fire caused power outages in many apartments at the complex, so  officials of the county chapter of the American Red Cross relocated all 33  residents there to motels in Anaheim. Red Cross officials said residents  probably would be able to return to their apartments today.  </P></p>

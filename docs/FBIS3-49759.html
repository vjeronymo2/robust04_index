			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Defense Minister Hamdo </F> Hadzihasanovic by Gordana Knezevic and Rasim Cerimagic; place  and date not given: "We Have the Strength for a Just Peace"]    [Text] "There have been a lot of rumors about the kind of  state we are creating. One of the reasons for this war is that  we will no longer let others determine what our state will be  like. It will be as our soldiers dream it should be --  democratic -- and all its citizens will live a dignified life.  Whether a person is a Bosniak-Muslim, a Serb, a Croat, a  Gypsy... and a person's religious and political affiliation will  be a private matter. This will be a free country in which  foreigners will also be able to come, make investments and stay.  I would like to see the Japanese, Indonesians, Swedes, Dutch,  Iranians... and all other people of good will settle here," said  Hamdo Hadzihasanovic, defense minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in  an interview for OSLOBODJENJE.    [OSLOBODJENJE] For a year this country did not have a  defense minister. That speaks not only of the force of the  aggression from outside but also of internal blockades and  treason in order to thwart the defense of Bosnia.    [Hadzihasanovic] Let me remind you that, in the stage of  preparing for the realization of the long-planned aggression,  Bosnia-Herzegovina was effectively deprived of a leader. All  those who understood what was going on here were, in various  ways, rendered powerless and eliminated from political life.  Immediately before the aggression, the entire leadership of  Bosnia-Herzegovina was destroyed through the "Agrokomerc"  affair, and then also through Neum. For a long time we had many  illusions and we still have some today. First of all, every one  of us must defend the integrity of his or her own person and  preserve his or her sanity. We must not allow our hate to  influence our decisionmaking. It is crucial, for strengthening  our defense, to rid ourselves of many illusions. First, was it  possible to avoid the war? Yes, if we had surrendered. The  process of our destruction would be milder and slower, but we  would definitely be destroyed.    Second, are national parties responsible for the war? I am  not a member of any party, but I claim they are not. The  aggression was conceived before those parties were created, and  they are just one of the means for making war.    Third, will there be an intervention and will they lift the  arms embargo? There will not be a military intervention. We  will have to do everything on our own. The embargo will get  weaker as we get stronger. The embargo is like a drug: you  become addicted, you must have weapons, but since they are  forbidden and not everyone can sell them -- they are very  expensive.    Fourth, is there a war against the Bosniaks-Muslims and  against Islam? Yes, this is also a crusade. But I do not want  to emphasize that dimension, for that would only stimulate  fascism, even in our own midst.    This is an imperialistic war for "greater Serbia." How else  can we explain the killing of the Slovenes, Croats, the exile of  the Hungarians...? After the aggression, according to the  theory of closed systems, disintegration was increased here, to  simplify -- disorder and every conflict, from piling up garbage  to criminal reprisals between the Croats and the Muslims, and  among brothers. Those who need that created evidence that this  is a religious and civil war.    However, I am sure that there is a Ram ["framework" --  Belgrade plan to arm the Bosnian Serbs] for Milosevic's "ram."  I think that the United States has a Ram both for Serbia,  Russia, and Europe. Milosevic's chetniks have gone mad and are  killing us, but as soon as they come to their senses, they will  kill him too. Therefore, we must dispel our illusions, but that  will not be painless. The fact that this country was, for so  long, without a defense minister, is also a consequence of  illusions. However, all the while, the deputy minister and his  associates were working. People worked as much as they could in  the circumstances. It is not up to me to evaluate their work.  I look ahead and do everything to move forward.   <H5>    Stronger by the Day </H5>   [OSLOBODJENJE] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army was formed and  became stronger in dramatic circumstances when they were  defending their lives. Would you comment on its organization  and strength today, almost two year after the aggression?    [Hadzihasanovic] The army, Ministry of the Interior, and  other components of Bosnia-Herzegovina armed forces, were formed  and became stronger in the most dramatic circumstances known to  history. Wise and brave individuals and groups ("Patriotic  Alliance," "Green Berets," and others) saw through the  aggressor's intentions and offered organized resistance.  Wherever there was organized resistance, the aggressor did not  realize its intentions. This is a valuable experience and  provides the foundation for the development of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.    Today it is a great force. Educated, experienced, and with  disciplined officers, a command headquarters and units. New  officers are being educated as they fight. We have young  soldiers coming to us. They use modern, sophisticated computer  technology. The world, lead by the United States and West  Europe, is afraid of the former Yugoslav National Army, and our  army, whose hands are tied by the arms embargo, counters that  force on its own and is successful in destroying it. It is high  time we told the world that, although they interfere with us, we  are helping them to destroy the fascist monster with the flesh  and blood of our most outstanding sons....    [OSLOBODJENJE] Of course, demilitarization will soon make no  sense?    [Hadzihasanovic] One of the illusions imposed on us that I  failed to mention in answer to your first question is  demilitarization. Is there anything more stupid and lethal than  saying to our only real defense force, to the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army, in the middle of the war, that we will disband it as soon  as we sign an agreement on peace. Fortunately, we have not  dispelled that illusion. There will be no demilitarization as  long as Serbia and Croatia have weapons.    That was just another deceit from the arsenal of special  war,  which was supposed to shake our faith in our own strength. The  public often say that our soldiers are confused, that our goals  are not clear, that the Platform of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency has been surpassed.... I do not think that is true.  Our soldiers know they are fighting for freedom and justice for  their people and for a STRONG BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA. We learned  that, just as an illness attacks a body when its immune system  is weakened, a war attacks a country when it gets weak, when its  leadership is incomplete, and when its people are naive.  <H5>  Prepared for the Worst </H5>   [OSLOBODJENJE] In the field, there are some individuals and  groups that are not under a banner of Bosnia-Herzegovina, under  the insignia and command of the army.    [Hadzihasanovic] We will energetically finish the process we  began. They will either be placed under command of the army or  they will be disarmed. Further development of our armed forces  is based on a determinant that foresees the simultaneous  occurrence of the worst possible factors for us: joint  aggressors, withdrawal of the UNHCR [United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees] and UNPROFOR [United Nations  Protection Forces], the embargo, and the winter. We benefit when  any of those factors are missing.    All our soldiers know that the war will not end until we  provide a minimum area for our survival and development. Until,  in addition to access to the Sava, we establish a territorial  link with eastern Bosnia, until we retrieve our territory in  western Bosnia in which the Bosniak-Muslims form the majority,  and until we gain access to the part of our coast at Neum --  there will be no peace. If the aggressors do not sign to verify  our intentions, we will have to use force to push them to those  borders. Use only our force.    [OSLOBODJENJE] How do the government and your ministry  intend to solve the problem of finances and logistic support to  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army?    [Hadzihasanovic] The government and the Ministry of Defense  are realizing many projects that will upgrade the system of  financing, equipping, and supplying the armed forces. All  sources of financing and goods are gradually being placed in the  function of the state and defense. All republic funds have been  abolished. The government finances the armed forces through the  Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Finance. The flow of  information, money, and goods for corps and districts are  clearly defined. We have recently issued instructions  regulating that matter. We have also activated the inspectorate  of the Ministry of Defense. Financing the armed forces from  local sources must be abolished as soon as possible. That means  we must do away with self-proclaimed home guard units and, at  the same time, leave less room for autonomism. There are still  some hidden stocks of goods. Our primary goal is to introduce  stimulative measures to make businessmen sell those goods and  start ordering and producing more goods. But we will also  combine that with some repressive measures. All firms and other  legal persons who will not accept concrete specifications for  the scope and deadline of deliveries of goods, or who do not  meet contractual obligations, will be shut down. At the same  time, we are carrying out a revision of formations in army  units. By activating businessmen we will create conditions for  reducing the number of logistics personnel, and especially for  those who pretend to be that. By increasing production we will  also stimulate money transactions, reduce municipality borders  (customs duty), cut prices, destroy the black market, and  eliminate criminals and the mafia, both domestic and  international, often hiding behind humanitarian missions. Those  are the prerequisites for breaking the chetnik and ustasha  encirclements once and for all.    Until we upgrade money transfers, the families of dead  Muslim  heroes, soldiers and fighters, instead of worthless salaries,  will get basic food products, firewood....</p>

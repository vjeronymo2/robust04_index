			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Indirect Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EDA encourages applicants to waive indirect costs for this program. No more than 20 percent of the Federal grant and nonfederal share may be allocated for indirect costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Application Forms and Kit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program uses Standard Form (SF) 424 (4/92), Application for Federal Assistance; SF&hyph;424A (4/92), Budget Information_Non-Construction Programs; and SF&hyph;424B (4/92), Assurances_Non-Construction Programs.

However, applicants should note that EDA will not award University Center Technical Assistance program funds to provide general business assistance (e.g., preparing business plans) in areas served by Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs), Minority Business Development Centers (MDBCs), or Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers (TAACs). Most successful proposals funded in the recent past have emphasized providing technical assistance to public sector and nonprofit organizations related to economic development planning and projects or helping private sector firms use technology to solve manufacturing or processing problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For existing University Centers, EDA will primarily consider past performance in determining whether to continue the award and the amount of funding to be offered. In judging a proposal for new University Center funding, EDA will consider whether it:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Addresses the economic development needs of the service area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Complements the activities of other organizations in the proposed service area that are engaged in economic development;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Has the commitment of the highest management levels of the sponsoring institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Provides evidence of adequate nonfederal financial support, either from the sponsoring institution or other sources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Outlines activities consistent with the expertise of the proposed University Center staff and the academic programs and other available resources within the sponsoring institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Complements and supports the local, regional or state economic development strategies in the service area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Presents a reasonable budget, including both the Federal and nonfederal shares;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Documents past experience of the sponsoring institutions in operating technical assistance programs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Adds to the geographic distribution of University Centers across the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Evaluation criteria are not assigned weights, as all factors are equally important and contribute to the overall quality of the proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All proposals must include a work program organized under the following categories: (1) Providing technical assistance; (2) conducting applied research; and (3) disseminating results of the University Center activities. For this program, technical assistance is defined as an activity carried out by the University Center in response to a direct request from a client outside the sponsoring educational institution. Applied research is defined as an economic development activity undertaken by the University Center at its own initiative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All proposals must include quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria for each activity listed under the three categories of the work program. These criteria, when accepted by EDA, will be the primary guide used in judging the performance of the University Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All proposals must include a program budget that, at a minimum, indicates the Federal and nonfederal funds allocated to each of the three work program categories. At least 70 percent of the direct costs of the project budget must be allocated to the first category of the work program, providing technical assistance to clients outside the sponsoring institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Selection Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EDA regional offices (or the Technical Assistance and Research Division in Washington for National University  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Centers), reviews the proposals and makes recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for funding to the Assistant Secretary for Economic Development, who makes the final decisions based on the relative merits of the applications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Refer to the Notice published on March 30, 1994, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 14996) for information on EDA's general policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

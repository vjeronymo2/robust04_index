			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES  </P> <P> Scientology's Guide to the IRS  </P> <P> Got a problem with the Internal Revenue Service? The Church of Scientology  wants to help.  </P> <P> With a near 20-year history of disputes with federal tax authorities to guide  it, the Los Angeles-based church has put out its latest guide, called "How to  Protect Your Rights as a Taxpayer."  </P> <P> The 20-page booklet takes individuals through the basics, from getting help in  preparing a return to taking the IRS to court. It is also filled with tips,  such as suggestions that taxpayers tape record IRS interviews, request IRS  files through the Freedom of Information Act and get any IRS tax advice in  writing.  </P> <P> Still, the handbook is not exactly impartial, and that's pretty clear from the  outset. The introduction's initial sentence reads: "The individual American  taxpayer has for many years been under assault by an insensitive, over-zealous  and out-of-control Internal Revenue Service."  </P> <P> The Church of Scientology believes that with all its soul, too, particularly  since the government revoked one of its churches' tax-exempt status in 1964 and  imposed a $1.3-million tax bill on it after audits of its 1970-72 returns.  </P> <P> Lafayette, We Are Here Again  </P> <P> In an effort to quench its thirst for attention, Mendocino Beverage Co.  embarked on a self-proclaimed "mock mercy mission" in February, shipping  gallons of its California mineral water to parched Paris. The firm's message?  If there's no Perrier, let them drink Mendocino.  </P> <P> Perrier, the former king of the bottled-water shelf, was yanked from markets  worldwide Feb. 14 when bottles of the French refresher were found to be  contaminated with benzene.  </P> <P> "Expressing fears that the French populace may face widespread water shortages,  Georg Moller-Racke, president of Mendocino Beverage Co., launched a mercy  mission dubbed Thirst Aid to France," gushed a release from the company.  </P> <P> Mendocino officials, who call their product California's only naturally  carbonated bottled mineral water, are negotiating to export the bubbly beverage  to France. The results, so far, have not been good, but their enthusiasm is not  dampened. After all, they've just begun to get their feet wet.  </P> <P> Red, Green, Made All Over  </P> <P> The H. J. Heinz Co. was thumping a "green" tub last week.  </P> <P> On Monday, the food processing giant unveiled a new plan to allow full  recycling of its squeezable plastic ketchup bottles. In a fat packet  mass-mailed to news outlets, Heinz enclosed a sample of one of the "57  varieties" of uses for the recycled material: an 8-by-6-inch swatch of carpet  with a label proclaiming, "This pristine white carpet used to be a Heinz  Ketchup bottle."  </P> <P> Then on Thursday came Heinz's dramatic pledge not to market any tuna caught in  ways that are harmful to dolphins. The "dolphin-safe" announcement produced  another flurry of paper: fact sheets, backgrounders, graphics, profiles of  company executives -- nearly all of it bearing the environmentally correct  notation, "Printed on Recycled Paper."  </P></p>

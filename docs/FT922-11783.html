			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Wace pays Pounds 425,000 to Clegg WACE Group has paid Pounds 425,000 compensation to Mr John Michael Clegg, 33, who resigned as chief executive of the company he built into the world's largest specialist in pre-press printing. Mr Clegg resigned in February after market rumours linked Wace with the IRA. It emerged that a brief police investigation had dismissed such suspicions, but the Department of Trade and Industry is investigating share dealings in the names of several of Mr Clegg's relatives. Mr Clegg, who lives in Chicago, has said he never provided price-sensitive information to anyone and promised to co-operate with the DTI inquiry. Shares in Wace yesterday rose from 119p to 127p after the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.28m in the year to December 31. Although this was 31 per cent down on the previous year, the figures were at the top end of expectations and were coupled with a reassurance that shareholders would face no more unpleasant surprises. Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said: 'Although John Clegg's departure leaves a personal void, his departure has had little effect on the day-to-day running of the group's operations.' He added: 'Wace was a well-managed company which was not dependent on any one individual.' Mr ten Bos is acting as chief executive and said headhunters were looking for a new chief executive. The company said it welcomed the DTI inquiry 'because it will help repudiate recent speculative coment and because Wace has nothing to fear from its findings.' Details, Page 26</p>

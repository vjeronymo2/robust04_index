			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Weak halfway results at Statoil STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday revealed a drop in half-year net profit to NKr1.7bn (Dollars 291m) from NKr2.4bn last year, and warned that for the year as a whole net profit will be below the NKr4.196bn for 1991. Lower oil prices, weaker refinery margins and 'extremely' low prices for petrochemicals products contributed to the weaker six-month performance, Statoil said. 'We are clearly not satisfied with the result and are looking at measures to cut costs and reduce investments to adjust to a weaker market,' said Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive. Group operating profit at the half-year fell to NKr7.1bn from NKr7.6bn last time as operating revenue advanced by NKr2bn to NKr40bn. Second quarter net profit dipped by NKr47m to NKr861m while operating profit rose by NKr800m to NKr4.2bn. Operating revenue increased by NKr2bn to NKr40bn. Statoil also complained that a higher 1992 tax burden was unlikely to be offset by high oil production and cost reductions. For the individual business units, exploration and production saw half-year operating profit dip NKr1bn to NKr4.9bn due to low oil prices. The natural gas division's operating profit rose NKr200m to NKr2.1bn thanks to higher volumes of gas transported. Refining and marketing operating profit was slashed by NKr279m to NKr471m, hit by lower margins and weaker shipping operations in a depressed tanker market. Petrochemicals and plastics, the group's worst performer, plunged to an operating loss of NKr172m from a profit of NKr100m last year due to a 'deep' recession affecting the petrochemicals industry, Statoil said. Statoil warned that results for refining and petrochemicals would be lower this year.</p>

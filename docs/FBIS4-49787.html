			<p>BFN     [Text] Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng met with Indian  Human Resource Minister Arjun Singh in Beijing yesterday. Arjun  Singh is visiting Bejing in connection with the Festival of  India in China. Li Peng hoped that the Festival of India would  further enhance friendly exchanges and contribute toward  continuously promoting the ties of friendship and cooperation  between the two countries. Li Peng said China and India are  both countries with ancient civilizations as well as being close  neighbors; this therefore fully justified their living side by  side in a friendly manner. In recent years, the relations  between the two countries have been successfully developed due  to the common efforts of the two governments and people, and  positive progress has been achieved in many fields.    Arjun Singh hoped that the Festival of India would be as  successful as the Festival of China in India two years ago. He  said the Indian Government would continue its effort to further  enhance relations between the two countries.</p>

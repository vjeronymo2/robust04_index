			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Further Tube strikes less likely The threat of further industrial action on the London Underground subsided last night when the executive of the RMT transport union decided to contact Acas, the conciliation service, and pursue its pay claim through arbitration. London Underground said it was considering its response to the RMT proposal. The Underground appeared relieved that the union had not chosen new dates for industrial action to follow on from last Friday's strike.</p>

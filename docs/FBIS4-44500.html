			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shi Hua (2457 5478): "Why Invest in Hainan? What </F> Is the First Choice for Investment? An Interview With Xiao  Jixin, a Hong Kong Businessman Investing in Hainan"]    [Text] On 28 January, the author visited Hong Kong  businessman Xiao Jixin, who had just returned to Hong Kong from  Hainan. He spoke about the background of the tentative plan for  Taiwan and Singapore to cooperate in the development of Hainan,  the reaction related to news of the cooperative development, and  the current opportunities, advantages, and potential choices for  investment in Hainan.    Xiao is a native of Hainan, who more than 10 years ago  emigrated to Hong Kong, and has consistently been engaged with  Hainan and Guangzhou-related real estate businesses. At present  he is the Chairman of the Board of the Hong Kong Jinrong  Industrial Corporation, Ltd, and the Hainan Sanya Huaya  (Sino-foreign) Real Estate Development Corporation, Ltd.  <H5>  First Choice in Investment: Onshore Natural Gas </H5>   According to Xiao Jixin, for the Taiwan Singapore  cooperation  in developing Hainan, the first choice investment point will be  Sanya City. This is because Sanya is on Hainan's southern tip,  and nearby Nanshan is the onshore site for taping natural gas.  Because Taiwan and Singapore have put primacy on exploitation of  Hainan's petroleum resources, they must establish a base in  Sanya, and construct various types of service-oriented logistics  facilities. In addition, Sanya is a scenic tourist vacation  spot, with sunshine all year round, and winter temperatures that  do not get below 17 degrees C. The sea water around Sanya is not  polluted, and beaches have fine sand, all conditions that could  help it become a first-class tourist vacation spot.    Before Taiwan's Executive Yuan head Lien Chan visited  Singapore, on December 20 of 1993, Singapore senior advisor Lee  Kuan Yew took an airplane from the mainland making a special  trip to Sanya, touching down at a coastguard airfield near  Sanya. Lee's visit to Sanya was very possibly the background to  the subsequent Lien Chan proposal during his Singapore visit for  cooperative investment in Hainan.  <H5>  Ruan Chongwu Holds Meeting To Arrange Welcome for Taiwan </H5> Investment    Xiao Jixin also brought along from Hainan local reaction to  Lien Chan's proposed plan. According to Xiao, after he heard  that Taiwan and Singapore were inclined towards investing in  Hainan, the province's Governor Ruan Chongwu immediately  convened office level cadres and various specialized corporation  presidents, and held a meeting, to concretely give instructions  about how to properly prepare for welcoming Taiwan investment.    On 13 January, Ruan met with Taiwan reporters for an  interview, and pointed out that at present there are excellent  opportunities for investing in Hainan. Ruan's remarks were  carried on the front page of the 14 January edition of HAINAN  RIBAO.    In addition, it is reported that when introducing some  companies from China's hinterland to investment in Hainan, Ruan  afterwards personally recommended Sanya.    Why Sanya? In addition to the two factors described above  (natural gas deposits and a tourist vacation spot), looking at  the situation of Hainan as a whole, the northern city of Haikou  naturally is the locale with the most investment from Taiwan and  Hong Kong businessmen, but because it is already thriving, the  investment costs are also much higher. Take real estate, for  example: in Haikou City's most thriving area it costs 6000 yuan  per square meter; while because development is Sanya has not yet  gotten underway, real estate prices have been kept to 2500 to  3000 yuan per square meter.    As for the Yangpu Zone, to be developed by Hong Kong's  Xiongsu organization, because it is still in the planning stage,  and also has no tourism resources, it will probably be around  five years before development is likely to take off.  <H5>  Airport, Expressway Opening Mid-year </H5>   Why has Sanya not been developed before now? Xiao Jixin  points out that the major problem is transportation. Because  Sanya is situated on the southern tip of Hainan, it does not  have an airport (it only has a coast guard airport not open to  the public), and in addition there is not highway from Haikou to  Sanya. Many tour groups going from Haikou sit on a bus that  reveals fantastic scenery like, but five or six hours are  required to get to Sanya. Consequently, though there is a  wonderful tourism environment, it is very difficult to attract  tourists to struggle over long distances to come to Sanya.    Many years ago, Hong Kong businessman Huo Yingdong at one  point had a plan to invest in Sanya in the vicinity of Yalong  (Dragon's Tooth) Bay. Yalong Bay is a 22 kilometer length bay  with blue waves and fine sand, and the original plan could have  built a vacation area on this spot, but because of the  transportation problem, for several years no funds flowed in for  investment. Up until last year, the plan had been on hold.    This year in June an express highway from Haikou to Sanya  will be open for traffic, and at that time it will only take  over two hours to get to Sanya from Haikou. In addition, on 1  July of this year, the currently under construction Sanya  Fenghuang (Phoenix) International Airport will open, and on that  occasion, various Hong Kong and southeast Asian airlines will be  able to fly directly into Sanya. This will inevitably lead to  the thriving development of Sanya's tourist industry.  <H5>  Semi-Duty-Free Situation Will Foster Shopping Paradise </H5>   What advantages are there to investing in Hainan?    Since the CPC established Hainan as a province in 1988, the  prerequisite of "open the first line, properly manage the second  line" has been established. The so-called "opening the first  line" involves changing the whole of Hainan Island into a low  tariff "free island," and departing from Hainan and going to  China's hinterland then requires going through customs  procedures, and adopting so-called "proper handling" procedures.    Central authorities have allowed Hainan a number of special  policies. The most important of these includes: the importation  of machinery facilities is completely duty free, and importing  consumer goods (except tobacco and alcohol) is semi-duty-free.    This condition alone is sufficient to make Hainan become a  tourist and shopping paradise for mainlanders. Whichever  consumer goods are able to gain semi-duty free status,  mainlanders will come here and buy various types of things and  bring them back, and this will offset tourism expenses. For this  reason, after the issue of transportation has been solved, the  running of large scale markets here should have bright  prospects. In addition, the importation of facilities to produce  consumer goods also should be a good business.    When it comes to the aspect of taxing enterprise profits,  Hainan's special policy is to only collect 15 percent, half the  rate for enterprises on the mainland. This is one advantage.    The other special policies of Hainan Province include: it is  possible on Hainan to set up foreign invested banks; foreign  investment generated hard currency profits can be freely taken  remit abroad; land can be transferred with compensation, and can  be divided up by one person and contracted for development;  foreigners entering can get a "local visa" at Haikou or Sanya;  Hainan has aviation rights, and can permit foreign airline  corporations to open Hainan routes, and retain reciprocal flight  rights.  <H5>  Nightlife Varied </H5>   There is another advantage that is not explicitly spelled  out  in any regulations. This is the varied look and feel of Hainan's  nightlife. At present Taiwan businesses have invested in a  number of entertainment businesses in Haikou, including bars,  restaurants, discos, dance halls, nightclubs, karaoke bars, etc.    Allegedly, large bars are very strict about prostitutes, but  in discos and dance halls, there are often several hundred  good-looking women to choose from.    In the north there is a saying currently in fashion: "I went  to Beijing and realized my own position was low, I went to  Guangzhou and realized that my own wealth was small, I went to  Haikou and realized that my body was not in good shape." After  hearing this sentence, one can put one's finger on the situation  in Haikou.    During the development of Sanya, the future state of affairs  will be relatively the same as for Haikou, as control is  relatively lax.    What projects does Sanya have to invest in?    Xiao notes that the hotel business is developing, and at  present, there are more than 30 in business, more than 30 under  construction, and more than 30 that have requested permission to  build. Of course, some of these are small, and he does not know  of any that are genuine five star hotels.    Businesses related to tourism, such as vacation villages,  water amusement parks, and yacht clubs, in addition to bars,  eateries, and nightclubs, also should do very well.    At present, it is commonly reported that mainland tourists  coming to Sanya are not buying things. Those "loaded"  mainlanders come to Sanya and spend several hundred yuan, and  afterwards go to Guangzhou and buy things, spending several  thousands of yuan. In the wake of the development of the tourist  industry, the opening of markets is also a major investment area.  <H5>  Large Portion of Land Is in Corporate Hands </H5>   In coming to invest in Sanya, it is of course possible to go  by the official way, through the government foreign trade  channels to invest. However, the system on the mainland still  cannot avoid the trouble of bureaucratism, and examination and  approval of projects often requires a lot of time. For this  reason, seeking cooperation with Hong Kong companies well  acquainted with the situation on the mainland is one way to  approach the issue.    Whatever project one decides to invest in, one will run into  land problems. It is known that at present in Sanya City there  is a limited amount of land that is available for developing  businesses, and in addition to the fact that the government  strictly controls land, a major portion of the land is in the  hands of corporations. For this reason, seeking talks with  corporations holding land about transferring land is also a  possible shortcut.    The tourist industry has been established as Sanya's  mainstay  industry, the goal of which is to construct an international  coastal tourist city. The tourist industry will bring along the  development of other industries, which will greatly stimulate  real estate development.    At present, there is not much foreign investment in Sanya.  In  the wake of the construction of the express highway and the  airport, prospects for foreign investment in Sanya are looking  up.</p>

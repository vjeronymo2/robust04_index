			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Indian brokers braced as curb stays: Market faces difficult week after collapse of talks to end the forward trading ban Indian stockbrokers are bracing themselves for a difficult week following the collapse of talks on ending a two-month ban on forward trading. Officials of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the nation's largest, and representatives of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market watchdog, last week failed to agree terms for lifting the ban that Sebi imposed on March 12. The ban contributed to a sharp fall in shares, which were also pushed down by increases in US interest rates and profit-taking following an earlier rally. The Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks fell from a high in February of more than 4,200 to a low of 3,600 before recovering recently to around 3,800, partly on hopes of a settlement of the forward trading row. Volumes have also fallen sharply because the forward trading ban has greatly reduced the scope for speculative trading with borrowed funds. Sebi imposed the ban after failing to persuade stockbrokers to adopt transparent rules for the forward market - a long-established and informal market called Badla. Sebi believes Badla is easily abused by brokers for price manipulation at the expense of client investors. It also argues that Badla gives brokers opportunities for excessively risky leveraged forward trading. The brokers retort that some speculation is essential to provide liquidity to the market. They claim they are ready to propose new rules tn ensure greater fairness but these have been rejected by Sebi. While the brokers are angry at the failure of last week's talks, they are likely to try to make fresh proposals to Sebi, because forward trading is essential to their business. In a speech at the weekend, Mr A N Kolhatkar, the Bombay Stock Exchange executive director, said that discussions were in deadlock but new alternative solutions were likely to emerge in the next few months. Mr S S Nadkarni, the Sebi chairman, has said that he is ready to discuss details of proposed reforms but 'there is no going back on the principles which led to the ban'. To make matters worse for the brokers, the growth of foreign portfolio investment, which was soaring in the months to February, has tailed off. Net investments by foreign institutions fell from Dollars 398m in January and Dollars 245m in February to Dollars 180m in March and Dollars 163m in April. The main causes of the decline were the worldwide stock market correction and settlement difficulties in India, though the Badla ban may also have contributed.</p>

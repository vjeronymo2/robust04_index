			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Dollar struggles Renewed US inflation fears yesterday prompted a sharp fall in the dollar on foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith. A jump in the August capacity utilisation figures caused bonds to plummet, and the dollar followed suit. It closed in London at DM1.5376, down from DM1.55 earlier in the day, and at Y98.855, down from Y99.20. Sterling was a beneficiary of the dollar's weakness, touching a sixteen month high of Dollars 1.5870 before slipping back below Dollars 1.58 in late trade. It was also stronger against the D-Mark, spiking above DM2.44 in late trade, compared to Thursday's close of DM2.4183. The trade weighted index finished at 79.8, from 79.2. The D-Mark was generally weaker in Europe. It finished at L1,011 against the lira, from L1,012. Against the French franc it closed at FFr3.418, from FFr3.422. The Swiss franc also considered its upward progress, closing at SFr0.821 from SFr0.83. Although the dollar is only about one pfennig, and two yen, above its July lows, some analysts were impressed at its resilience. Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, commented: 'The dollar has performed rather well today considering the way the bond market has performed.' In recent weeks the market has been less keen to sell the dollar, leading some analysts to hint at a possible change in sentiment. The dollar, however, still faces some serious short-term obstacles. One is the markets' fear that the US Federal Reserve is 'behind the game' in combatting inflation. The dollar is unlikely to recover against this background. The other problem is politics. The Haiti issue, and the US-Japan trade talks, which reach an end of month deadline, both have the potential to cause dollar selling. Against an environment of generalised D-Mark weakness, the Swiss franc continued to strengthen. Two factors supporting it were the Haiti invasion talk - 'If you have a safe haven, it is the Swiss franc,' commented one analyst - and the traditional strength in the franc ahead of German elections. Sterling was also a notable beneficiary of the D-Mark's weakness, but analysts said there was also an element of independent strength. 'The psychology of the market was transformed by Mr Clarke's decision to raise interest rates. The prospects for sterling have improved dramatically,' said Mr Cocker. He said that rates had been raised two months ahead of market expectations. 'It is not known in the UK for chancellors to do that. It could be seen as a radical change in UK monetary management.' The larger than expected August PSBR figure, and the downturn in the gilts market hit short sterling. All the 1995/1996 contracts lost about 15 basis points. In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 270m late assistance. Earlier it had provided Pounds 100m assistance, at established rates, after forecasting a Pounds 500m shortage. Euromark contracts also lost ground, with rumours in the market that interest rate hawks on the Bundesbank council were beginning to flex their muscles.</p>

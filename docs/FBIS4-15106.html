			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 6 (SNARK) -- Both Georgia and Abkhazia  should be pleased with the results of the negotiations. At this  stage of the talks both sides were yielding to achieve desired  compromise, said in his exclusive interview to SNARK Sandro  Kavsadze, Shevardnadze's personal representative.    Kavsadze is of the opinion that the UN representatives'  participation in the negotiations and the Russia's positively  activizing her position can be considered as the guarantee of  the subsequent constructive dialog between the sides.</p>

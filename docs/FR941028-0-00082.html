			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(2) of final &sect;773.25 contains a further change from the proposed rule in that the regulation provides that the provisions of the rule apply to challenges of ``the status of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  violation covered by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice.'' (Emphasis added.) The comparable section of the proposed regulation provided that the regulation applied to the status of ``the violation covered by such notice.'' The purpose of the change is to recognize that there may be multiple violations, rather than a single violation, to which a person is linked through ownership or control. A person may wish to challenge the status of each of these violations, rather than only the violation contained in a single notice. If so, the provisions of final &sect;773.25 apply to such challenges. Consistent with this change, ``such notice'' is changed to ``a notice.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b) of final &sect;773.25 provides the basic allocation of responsibility among regulatory authorities to make decisions with respect to ownership or control and with respect to the status of violations. State regulatory authorities are expected to have procedures in place to address challenges made in accordance with these rules, including in situations where there are ongoing State proceedings in other jurisdictions on permit applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1)(i) if final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending has ``responsibility'' for making decisions with respect to the ``ownership or control relationships of the application.'' This represents a change of terminology from the comparable provision of the proposed rule which provided that the regulatory authority would have ``authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control of the applicant.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the use of the word ``responsibility,'' rather than ``authority,'' more accurately describes the regulatory authority's mandate under this regulation. ``Responsibility'' encompasses both authority, the power to act, and the obligation to act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, paragraph (b)(1)(i) of final &sect;773.25 speaks of ``ownership or control relationships of the application,'' rather than of the ``ownership or control of the applicant,'' as provided in the proposed rule. This change clarifies that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending will evaluate and make decisions with respect to the ownership and control issues with respect to an entire application, rather than just the particular applicant, consistent with this regulatory authority's primary responsibility for the application. This regulatory authority has responsibility for revising ownership or control information submitted as part of the permit application and other available information to ensure the complete identification of ownership or control relationships relevant to the decision to be made with respect to the application. The word ``relationships'' has been added to the regulation because it better explains the focus of this process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of final &sect;773.25 provides that the regulatory authority that issued a permit has responsibility for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permit. The regulatory authority which issued a permit would have done so based upon a complete review of ownership or control information as required by the regulations. In the event that the improvidently issued permit regulations of 30 CFR 773.20 and 773.21 are invoked, this regulatory authority will have to decide whether such permit has been improvidently issued and whether, if the basis for such improvident issuance was an ownership or control link to a violator, whether such improvident issuance has been remedied. Accordingly, that regulatory authority must make decisions with respect to ownership or control relationships incident to the permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Emap bids for Trans World Emap yesterday launched its expected 181p a share hostile bid for Trans World Communications, the local radio group where it owns or has agreement to buy 51.7 per cent of the shares. The bid, which values Trans World at Pounds 70.8m, follows the agreement by Mr Owen Oyston to sell his 22 per cent stake to Emap at the offer price. Mr Robin Miller, Emap's chief executive, said the final cash offer represented a 'generous' price for Trans World. It is pitched at 58 times last year's earnings and 5.3 times turnover, both higher than any previous deal in the sector. However, earlier this week the Trans World board declined to recommend such an offer, arguing that the price was too low and that the bid could face legal problems. This is because a full takeover would breach the legal limit on the number and size of commercial radio licences that can be held by one company. However, Emap plans to sell two of its licences to a joint venture with merchant bank Schroders, which the Radio Authority has said would comply with relevant legislation. The authority has reconfirmed its position following an announcement by the Guardian Media Group, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, that it intends to ask for a judicial review of the decision. Mr Miller said:'We have no idea whether they will get leave to proceed or what the timetable would be, but meanwhile the offer goes ahead.' Emap said the acquisition would ehance its earnings per share in the first full financial year of ownership. Trans World shares added 2p to 175p.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread's full measure It was only a matter of time before Whitbread's poison pill got in the way of its ambition. Enfranchising restricted voting shares and buying out the majority in the investment company leaves Whitbread as vulnerable to takeover as its peers. If institutional investors are more willing to hold the shares, though, it will enjoy easier access to the equity market. The offer for the investment company will add at most Pounds 250m debt to the balance sheet - and probably much less - so there is no immediate need for a rights issue. But there can be no doubting Whitbread's intention to use its new-found freedom should it spy a large acquisition through the glass in the bottom of its tankard. Buying the investment company opens a number of options, since Whitbread is acquiring stakes in companies ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Vaux. The large holdings in Boddington, Brakspear and Marston must anyway be reduced to comply with the beer orders. While the investment company was happy as a passive shareholder, it is less clear that Whitbread should maintain even its permitted 15 per cent stake in each. That points to either divestment over time or a full bid. The response of the regional brewers' shares suggests the market is more worried about an overhang of stock than excited by the prospect of a bid. That may prove premature. Whitbread might value either Boddington's estate or Marston's strong regional brand. Neither would represent a giant leap forward in retailing or leisure. But having missed out on Chef &amp; Brewer and set its face against overseas expansion, Whitbread may have to be content for now with progress in small steps.</p>

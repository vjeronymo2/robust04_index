			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Cardoso may have easy win Campaigning for Brazil's presidential elections closes today, with polls suggesting Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, former finance minister, will win Monday's first round and avoid a run off, writes Angus Foster in Sao Paulo. According to a Datafolha poll published yesterday, Mr Cardoso has 47 per cent of support, unchanged on a week ago. This compared to 23 per cent for his nearest rival, Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Other candidates had a combined vote of 16 per cent. Mr Cardoso will win outright if he polls more votes than his competitors combined. If not, there is a run off in November. Yesterday's poll also showed Mr Cardoso's support among poorer voters is continuing to grow. This largely stems from an anti-inflation plan he launched when finance minister, which brought monthly inflation rates of nearly 50 per cent down to 1.51 per cent for the four weeks to mid-September, according to the government's official index.

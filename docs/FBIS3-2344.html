Official statistics show that the province approved some  4,487 foreign-funded firms last year, involving a total  investment of more than 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. The figure  exceeded the total number for the previous 14 years.    Moreover, total value of foreign trade reached more than 6.1  billion U.S. dollars in the province last year, according to the  statistics.    To date, Zhejiang has set up eight state-level development  zone and some 37 zones listed at the provincial and city levels.  Their combined area accounts for nearly 50 percent of the total  area of the province.    Official sources said that nearly one third of the total  foreign funds invested in the province has flowed in those  development zones.    As part of the measures to open wider to the outside world  as  well as to adopt the international practice, the province has  implemented the share-holding system in most of its state-owned  foreign trade companies.    In addition, more management powers have been relegated to  foreign trade firms as well as manufacturers at all levels,  which has greatly promoted the development of the foreign trade  business.    At the same time, the provincial government encouraged its  large and medium-sized enterprises to open and expand overseas  businesses.    According to official statistics, more than 180 companies of  the province have invested or set up branches in nearly 40  countries and regions in the world.    Most of those firms set up abroad are engaged in such  industries as tourism, processing and building industries,  fishery and agriculture, official sources said.</p>

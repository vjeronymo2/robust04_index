			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Several articles in the French press  have noted new arrivals in the staffs of politicians and large  companies.  <H5>  New Faces in Le Pen's Staff </H5>   According to the 12 February Paris weekly LE POINT, the  extreme rightist National Front's (FN) lack of an executive  bureau is compensated by leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's close circle  of aides. In addition to "old comrade" Dominique Chaboche, Carl  Lang and Bruno Megret are still secretary general and general  delegate respectively. However, two new "consummate politicians"  have joined the circle. University professor Bruno Gollinisch,  44, is the better known of the two. A speaker of Japanese,  Malayan and Indonesian, he is FN vice president for  international affairs. A cultured man, he climbed up the FN  ladder in 10 years, and "astutely mixes vituperation and  political sense." Jean-Pierre Reveau is a long-time Le Pen  friend who "holds the FN purse strings." While the new arrivals  indicate that a "combat front" is being formed with a view to  the presidential elections, they also denote the concern to  achieve internal equilibrium, the article contends.  "Independent" Gollinisch and Reveau were selected to  counterbalance the increasing powers of Megret, many of whose  partisans entered the party's central committee following the  last FN congress which was characterized by "clan rivalries"  denounced by Le Pen.  <H5>  Privatized Phone-Poulenc's Staff </H5>   The privatization of the Rhone-Poulenc company last November  brought no changes in the firm's leadership, according to the 5  February LE POINT. Polytechnic graduate Jean-Rene Fourtou, 54,  remains president, with Jean-Marc Bruel, 57, as vice president  in charge of quality and environmental issues. Fifty-five-year  old Philippe Desmarescaux, director general, is responsible for  basic chemistry, research and development, as well as for the  group's activities in the United States. More important still is  Igor Landau, 49, director general in charge of the health  sector, which now represents 40 percent of the company's  business. Next to the above group are four "key" officials:  Jean-Pierre Trifoulet, 42, a graduate of the prestigious  National School of Administration (ENA), who has been promoted  rapidly; Brazilian engineer Edson Musa, 55, in charge of the  important South America branch; new arrival Robert Cawthorn, 58,  an Englishman responsible for Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer (RPR), the  U.S. affiliate; and Michel de Rosen, 42, "the real RPR boss,"  formerly director of Minister of Industrial Development Alain  Madelin's cabinet.  <H5>  Balladur's `Galaxy' </H5>   Writing in the 16 February Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE  PARIS,  Jean-Fancois Robert lists the "galaxy" of officials appointed by  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to ensure a smooth transition to  the new state of economic affairs, as well as the "faithfulness"  of the leaders of large groups and companies.  Jacques Friedmann, 61, ENA graduate, former aide to Union for  French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Rally  for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, has been appointed  president of the UAP insurance group that will soon be  privatized. Endowed with "common sense" and very influential,  Friedmann has also been put in charge of the Chinese market,  Robert remarks.    ENA graduate Philippe Jaffre, 48, was adviser to Minister of  Finance Rene Monory in 1979, then director of the Stern bank,  and finally director of the National Agricultural Fund in 1988.  Jaffre is now president of the soon-to-be privatized  Elf-Aquitaine, which occupies a major place in government policy.    Polytechnic and ENA graduate Michel Pebereau, 52, a Treasury  man, is seen by Robert as an "astute strategist" and "resolute  free-market advocate." A Balladur adviser during the first  cohabitation, Pebereau was put at the helm of the Credit  Commercial of France on the eve of its privatization. He was so  successful that he was also made head of the National Bank of  Paris, "the banker of all French companies."    Polytechnic graduate Pierre Suard, 59, a scientist with ties  to successive cabinets, is a "redoubtable strategist and  negotiator," Robert comments. Formerly Alcatel-Alsthom director,  he is now preparing to take over control of the Framatome  company, nationalized by the Socialists.    ENA graduate Marc Vienot, 65, a faithful Balladur follower,  spent the major part of his career at the Societe Generale bank.  Since the bank owns shares in numerous privatized or soon-to-be  privatized groups, Vienot's role is seen as "strategic," Robert  concludes.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Dos Santos holds out olive branch ANGOLAN President Jose Eduardo dos Santos last night urged his civil war foe Jonas Savimbi to put aside doubts about last week's elections and help rebuild the country. He said he was seeking a meeting with Mr Savimbi, who has retreated to a stronghold 500km from Luanda. The president's conciliatory remarks came as the US said it had assurances from the Unita rebel movement that Mr Savimbi, who alleged fraud in the elections, would abide by the result and not resume the war. In his first statement since the poll, Mr dos Santos said there was a lot of anxiety in the country and 'anybody returning to war would meet the condemnation of the international community and the Angolan people.' He said the sympathisers of Unita and other parties 'should know that they have an indispensable role to play in the reconstruction of the country.' In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen, said Mr Savimbi's aides had said he would concede defeat. 'I've had some private assurances from some senior associates of Mr Savimbi in the last days that they will abide by the results,' Mr Cohen said.</p>

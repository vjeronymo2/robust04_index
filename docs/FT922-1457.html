			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (27): Transfers move to the fast lane - Z-Modem TRANSFERRING files can be a nightmare. Consider this scenario: After a long night grappling with the regional sales figures you have just 10 minutes to get them on to the MD's desk in New York. You have agreed with a colleague in the New York office to transfer the file via a pair of modems and you each have a terminal emulator running on your PC. You dial and the telephone answers. The other end asks you how you would like to transfer the file. It offers a bewildering array of names such as X-MODEM, Y-MODEM-g, Compuserve Quick B+ and so on. You hit the 'PgUp' key and your terminal emulator displays a similar list but with totally different names. Sadly, you have no idea what goes with what or which is the best. In desperation you pick one but the program then indicates that it will take an hour to transfer the file. You gulp but decide to go ahead. After 45 minutes, the line drops and the transfer fails. You have to start all over again. Later, as you collect your P45, you wonder: 'Could I have done better?' File transfer between machines has a long and chequered history. The earliest attempts used a simple cable between the two PCs and simply squirted the data down. A simple checksum (usually just adding all the characters together) indicated whether the data had arrived successfully. If not, you started again. For a lot of applications, this was enough. However, problems arose when the receiving machine could not keep up with the sender. Developers then put in 'flow-control' so that the receiver could tell the sender to pause while it wrote the data away. This was expanded to incorporate the detection of errors and the receiver could then ask the sender to re-send a chunk of data that had not transferred correctly. These were the first file transfer protocols. In 1976 Ward Christensen, an American, published a simple file transfer protocol in a magazine. He called it X-MODEM and it allowed two machines from different manufacturers to transfer files. Because it was free, it was very widely taken up and is still in use today. It transferred data in blocks of 128 characters and the receiver sent back a single character to indicate whether it had received the data correctly. If not, the sender would re-send the data. X-MODEM was simple but it was relatively slow for large files. Various people then extended the X-MODEM specification to make blocks longer and dubbed them Y-MODEM. Unfortunately, there was a lot of divergence and there were several Y-MODEMS. Various vendors and services also introduced their own proprietary protocols with different characteristics and names. All addressed different areas of weakness. Being proprietary, the details were rarely if ever published, so take-up tended to be slight. Chuck Forsberg, another American, was commissioned to produce a new file protocol which would be published for the benefit of the computing community. He called it Z-MODEM and incorporated the ability to transfer files using X-MODEM and Y-MODEM as part of it. Z-MODEM had a number of advantages: it was very fast, it could re-start a transfer that had failed and it could take advantage of modern error-correcting modems. Z-MODEM had sophisticated error detection mechanisms and sensible recovery when an error was detected. Above all, it was free and fully published. While Z-MODEM may now be a standard in the PC world, the other computer communities such as Unix also developed their own protocols such as Kermit and UUCP. Many of these have implementations on the PC although the converse is not true. As a result, communications between different families of computers may still be difficult (especially with mainframes). Companies need to ensure that they all have a common communications standard. Some companies may choose to buy a single communications package, possibly with its own proprietary protocols. However, it is unlikely that this will cover all the permutations required in a typical set-up with a mix of mainframes, minis and PCs. The wise manager will ensure that any communications packages used have at least one protocol common to all of them. This is likely to be Kermit (developed by a US university), or X-MODEM. This gives a baseline, even if it is not the most efficient or robust. Where the communications links are heavily biased in a particular direction, such as PC-PC, a better communications protocol such as Z-MODEM should be used as well. As with any strategic decision, it needs to be communicated to all the staff involved. Sadly, there is no reliable error detection/correction system available for employees.</p>

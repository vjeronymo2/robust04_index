			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Tory disarray grows over Europe: Major under pressure for referendum on integration The Conservative party was in turmoil last night as Mr John Major fought a rearguard battle against intense pressure for a referendum on the next steps towards European integration. Amid a frantic round of factional meetings at Westminster, Downing Street insisted that the prime minister remained opposed to a referendum, but refused to rule out the idea. Officials said there had been 'huge exaggeration and tremendous hyperbole' in reports of divisions between cabinet ministers on the merits of a referendum. But senior ministers said Mr Major must end the impression of disarray by making the government's position clear at prime minister's question time today. The prime minister is expected to consult senior colleagues before deciding how to respond to the growing demands from backbenchers for a referendum. Leading members of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs said that the promise of a referendum in advance of any further integration was now the only way to unify the party. The idea was also being pressed energetically by leading Euro-sceptic MPs. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said a referendum was 'inevitable'. However, the Positive Europe group of Tory MPs decided not to support calls for a referendum. Mr Ray Whitney, a leading pro-European, said the European parliament elections on June 9 would be the 'real referendum'. Friends of the prime minister believe that a referendum would be fraught with political dangers for Mr Major because of his repeated insistence in the Maastricht debates that only parliament was competent to decide the issue. The Conservative party opposed the referendums called by Labour - on Europe in 1975 and on Scottish and Welsh parliaments in 1978 - on constitutional grounds. Senior cabinet ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, continue to argue that it would be wrong for the Conservative party to call for a referendum. Mr Major also has to judge whether the offer of a referendum would appease the Euro-sceptics sufficiently to paper over the split until the vote. One leading Euro-sceptic said that the offer of a referendum would immediately be followed by campaigning to ensure that the result 'tied the government's hands' in the European Union's intergovernmental conference negotiations. There was disagreement about the potential impact of a referendum announcement on the European elections campaign. Sir Rhodes Boyson, the right-wing MP for Brent North, said that a referendum would unite the Conservatives in the vital run-up to the European elections. But Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said there was no point in 'trying to take people's minds away from the critical European elections'. Mr Hunt's comments reflected deep unease about a pledge by Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, that his party would support a referendum on the outcome of the 1996 IGC. The announcement was seen as a significant blow to the Conservative campaign for the European elections because it will weaken the party's attempts to portray the Liberal Democrats as in thrall to Brussels. But Conservative strategists hope that Mr John Smith, Labour leader, will be unable to exploit the government's difficulties because of Labour's opposition to a referendum during last year's Maastricht debate on European Union. Mr Smith sought to avoid the issue yesterday by claiming that the outcome of the EU's 1996 IGC - the next review of the union's institutions - was too far ahead to require a decision now.

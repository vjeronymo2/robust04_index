			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Boumaza: "Strike in Guelma"] </F>   [Text] Interurban transportation in the Guelma Governorate  is being quite seriously disrupted, not to say paralyzed, by a  strike that was started on 25 March--the day before the  resumption of classes--by private carriers, who carry over 50  percent of the traffic.    In their strike notice dated 22 March, the 43 carriers  affiliated with or belonging to the UGCAA [General Union of  Algerian Merchants and Artisans] (32 out of a total of 68,  according to the governorate's Directorate of Transportation)  are demanding that individual fares be raised following the  recent increases in fuel prices.    In fact, several of them had been working since 16 March  with  a new fare schedule instituted by them. A copy of the new  schedule was submitted to the Directorate of Transportation, but  the latter did not give its approval. Result: about 10 of the  carriers had their operating permits revoked.    The Directorate of Transportation says, with proof to back  it  up, that "their demands have been sent to the supervising  ministry, so there is no reason to stop work and violate their  moral contract, especially in this period when we are  experiencing crises of all kinds."    By means of this "unlimited strike," the private carriers in  Guelma are reacting to the new increases in fuel prices, and  they have decided to keep their buses stopped until their  demands are met because "operating costs are becoming very  high," they explain. Last, and as always, it is the citizens,  most of them students, who are paying for the strike while  waiting to pay the price of a ticket, which is certainly going  to rise.</p>

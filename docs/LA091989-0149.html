			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW DIPS 0.19 IN LATE SELLING DESPITE REPORTS  </P> <P> A late bout of selling sent stock prices tumbling just before the closing bell  despite good news on the inflation front that had kept prices firmer during  much of the session.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 0.19 to 2,687.31.  </P> <P> Advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners on the New York Stock Exchange,  with 712 issues up, 709 down and 532 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 141.61 million shares, against 136.94 million in  Monday's session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.03 to 192.46.  </P> <P> At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.67 to 378.83.  </P> <P> The market opened higher after two new economic reports suggested that  inflationary pressures had eased further during August. But although blue-chip  stocks gained, the broader market lagged behind, traders said.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts said the data -- the Labor Department's report that the  consumer price index remained unchanged in August at 0.2% and the Commerce  Department report that housing construction fell 5% in August -- suggested an  easing of inflationary pressures and added to hopes that the Federal Reserve  would loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Junk Bond Rally  </P> <P> Although institutional trading was light, selling by institutions early in the  afternoon wiped out some of the market's earlier gains. The market showed some  confidence after a rally in the junk bond market on the heels of Canadian  retail giant Campeau Corp.'s announcement that it had secured a $250-million  loan to pay its creditors.  </P> <P> Junk bond prices had fallen sharply in recent sessions after word of Campeau's  financial troubles raised concern about the viability of the high-yield,  high-risk securities. Campeau had used junk bonds to finance recent  acquisitions.  </P> <P> But late in the day, stocks retreated under pressure of a late bout of  computer-driven program selling. Transportation and pharmaceutical stocks were  among the few standouts in an otherwise featureless session, traders said.  </P> <P> Bond prices rose slightly today on a new government report showing the best  performance in consumer inflation in more than three years.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up 1/8 point, or $1.25 for  every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which falls when its  price rises, had declined to 8.07% from 8.09% late Monday.  </P> <P> The market "had a good set of data this morning," said Mitchell Held, chief  financial economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "We should have  had a better reaction."  </P> <P> In today's trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of  short-term government issues were up 1/32 point, intermediate maturities had  risen 1/32 point to 3/16 point, and 20-year issues had gained 1/8 point,  according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information  service.  </P></p>

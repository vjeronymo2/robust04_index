			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Revenue gets tough over late payments - In a Nutshell Employers who are late in transferring PAYE and National Insurance contributions to the Inland Revenue face the prospect of automatic interest charges and a more stringent implementation of penalties under new Revenue rules, according to Touche Ross. On April 19, employers became liable to an automatic interest charge on all tax and NI contributions not paid over within 14 days of the end of the payment year. Although there has been no change in the penalty rules, they were not previously enforced with great rigour and the tougher interest rules may prompt a more stringent regime, Touche says. Penalties for late returns are up to Pounds 300 each with an additional Pounds 3,000 on each incorrect return. May and June 1994 may signal a concerted Revenue operation once the new rules have been in force for a year, Touche warns. Employers must gear up for the new regime in time and clarify any uncertainties with their tax office, the accountants urge.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Militant to seek leadership of CPSA A SUPPORTER of Militant Tendency is to seek the leadership of the CPSA, Britain's biggest Civil Service union, after Mr John Ellis, the current general secretary, yesterday secured a job with another organisation, Michael Smith writes. Mr John Macreadie, the deputy general secretary and a Militant supporter, is thought to stand a chance of success. The favourite, however, will be Mr Barry Reamsbottom, a candidate for the union's moderate faction. Six years ago Mr Macreadie beat Mr Ellis in an election for the top job but lost a second contest after voting irregularities were uncovered in the first. Militant's influence in the CPSA has declined since then but Mr Macreadie, aged 45, has a high profile as deputy general secretary. If elected he would be expected to seek a more confrontational stance in the 124,000-strong union's negotiations with the Treasury. Mr Ellis was yesterday chosen to succeed Mr Peter Jones, who is retiring in June as general secretary of the Council for Civil Service Unions, the representative body on certain common issues.</p>

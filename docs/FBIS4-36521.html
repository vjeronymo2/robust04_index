			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniyel Ben-Simon and Moti Bassok] </F>   [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Ra'anan Kohen, member of the  Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, claims that  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Jordan's King Husayn held a  secret meeting in London. According to Kohen, the two leaders  met on 2 June to wrap up the details of the negotiations between  the two countries.    MK Kohen yesterday queried Minister Peres: "I learned from  foreign sources," Kohen writes, "that the foreign minister met  King Husayn in London on Thursday, 2 June. I was told that  during the meeting, the directions of the negotiations between  us and Jordan were agreed on."    In his query to Peres, Kohen notes that "the efforts to  promote the negotiations with Jordan deserve praise and  encouragement. I would like to ask: Is this report true? If  it is, what can you tell us about the proceedings of the  meeting? Does the honorable minister believe that progress on  the Jordanian track is linked to progress in contacts with  Syria?"    Two days ago, Minister Yosi Sarid said he believes that the  negotiations with Syria are now in high gear. He believes that  Peres met central figures during his tour abroad in order to  promote the negotiations. Sarid noted that he does not know of  a meeting in London between Peres and Husayn. He stressed that  Prime Minister Rabin was the key figure in drafting the  understandings between Israel and Jordan. Sarid expressed his  certainty that the understandings with Jordan were made with  Syria's knowledge, and that the negotiations between Israel and  Syria are making satisfactory progress.    Moti Bassok reports that the Foreign Ministry determinately  refused to comment on the Peres-Husayn meeting. It is worth  noting that in the tripartite meeting with the Israeli and U.S.  delegations in Washington on 6 and 7 June, the Jordanian  delegation showed much openness and willingness to advance which  very much surprised its interlocutors.    A senior Israeli delegation source noted that there is no  doubt that the Jordanian delegation was given explicit  instructions from King Husayn to pull the cart of negotiations  with Israel out of the mud they have been stuck in since 14  September 1993, and to move forward on many areas, including the  sensitive issue of borders.    According to the source, Husayn fears that if he continues  his foot-dragging policy, the Palestinians and the Syrians would  leave him behind without an agreement with Israel and in a very  sensitive security and political situation. It appears that  Husayn was also given a go-ahead from the Syrians because it is  very important for President al-Asad to be portrayed as working  toward a comprehensive Middle East arrangement and as caring for  the entire Arab world.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg June 24 SAPA -- The economy is unlikely  to achieve a three per cent growth rate this year because of the  five per cent transition levy announced in the budget, Standard  Bank chief economist Nico Cyzpionka said Friday [24 June] in  Johannesburg.    "The levy is going to undermine private consumption  expenditure and will also have a negative impact on savings," he  told a SA Chamber of Business [SACOB] seminar on the budget.    Standard Bank was therefore downscaling its projection of  three per cent growth this year to a 2.5 per cent increase in  real gross domestic product.    However, the outlook for the agricultural sector remained  encouraging and due to the statistical calculation of GDP [Gross  Domestic Product] the non-agricultural sector only had to  increase by 0.5 per cent to achieve a three per cent growth rate.    Mr Cyzpionka said the budget, presented to Parliament on  Wednesday by Finance Minister Derek Keys, was a credible effort  to balance socio-economic development and fiscal discipline.    "It's not an add-on budget. They (the government) want to  cut  in order to spend elsewhere," he said. "Foreign investors were  looking for a budget like this, but they're going to see how the  domestic market reacts."    He said the raising of the R2.5-billion [rand] to fund the  Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP] was admirable but  warned the government could only perhaps squeeze departments on  one further occassion.    The government plans to spend R40-billion on the RDP over  the  next five years and Mr Cyzpionka expressed concern those funds  would be difficult to find. "You can snip-off from ordinary  expenditure once, maybe twice, but not beyond that," he said.  "The RDP expenditures are only feasible if economic activity  increases and consequently lifts government revenue."    However, the budget was inflation neutral, avoiding an  increase in value-added tax and easing manufacturing input costs  due to the scrapping of the import surcharge on capital and  intermediate goods.    Mr Cyzpionka said the budget may even push inflation down  and  once the Reserve Bank had likely shored up the reserve position  in october, the Central Bank could cut its key rate by one per  cent.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: Payout omitted as Thyssen incurs loss Thyssen, the German steel and engineering group, incurred a loss of DM994m (Dollars 391.3m) for the year ended September, against a profit of DM350m the previous year. As a result, it will not pay a dividend. In 1991-92, shareholders received DM6 a share. The company said all non-steel divisions experienced a decline in sales and profits, with the exception of the US Budd subsidiary, which makes automotive parts. The steel divisions suffered massive, undisclosed losses. Although operational results improved in the second half of the year, earnings were swallowed by extraordinary expenses for the restructuring of the steel divisions. Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, launched an attack against remaining state subsidies for European steelmakers, saying such hand-outs were threatening the survival of German private steel companies. 'We cannot afford a steel industry when politicians in Bonn and Brussels are unwilling to create fair competition,' he said. Sales at Thyssen Stahl, representing a third of group turnover, fell 15 per cent to DM10.6bn. The group spent DM400m this year on restructuring the business. Talks are also continuing between Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch, Germany's second-largest steelmaker, on the possibility of merging special steel activities.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Tug-of-love over shipyard: The implications for the UK defence industry of GEC's tussle with British Aerospace for VSEL The battle for VSEL is a game theory problem. 'As long as the yard remained independent both British Aerospace and GEC were happy. But once one of them tried to buy the yard, the other had to follow, because whoever owns VSEL has the prime position in the British naval defence industry. There is only one bid contract going for the Royal Navy in the next 10 years and that is for five Trafalgar submarines worth Pounds 2.5bn. Whoever owns VSEL will win that contract.' One defence executive's view of the tug-of-love battle which has developed for the Barrow-based submarine maker between Britain's two defence giants. It is a view which is supported by the history. Both British Aerospace and GEC have been sniffing around VSEL for almost a year. BAe almost bid for the company at the time it sold Rover in February, but decided not to confuse the two issues. John Cahill, BAe's chairman, then stood down and was replaced by Bob Bauman. It took the board several months to rehearse the issues once more before deciding to renew takeover talks in August. Once BAe's half-year financial results were declared in mid-September, the way was open for a bid. GEC meanwhile had crawled all over VSEL's accounts in May, but had decided not to bid. It viewed the company as too expensive to buy, and provided BAe did not bid, GEC was happy. Once BAe struck, however, the rules of the game changed. GEC could no longer assume that it stood a decent chance of winning the Trafalgar submarine order without owning VSEL. GEC immediately demanded access to the documents BAe had seen in its talks, as it is entitled to do under the takeover rules. After two weeks poring over them, GEC launched a Pounds 14 a share cash bid first thing yesterday morning - against BAe's all-share offer worth Pounds 13 a share on Thursday night - and bought 14 per cent of VSEL's shares in the market. The phoney war for VSEL was over, and the real fight was on. Yet while the future of the Pounds 2.5bn Trafalgar contract was the spark which ignited the war, there is plenty of powder beneath it. At its heart is the future of the entire British defence industry. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, has long harboured an ambition to merge BAe's defence interests with GEC: an ambition that has grown with the decline in defence spending since the end of the cold war. As BAe has recovered from the disasters which struck it in the early 1990s, however, it has become less enthusiastic about a merger with GEC. One executive says: 'All the experience suggests that the stronger BAe gets, the less likely it is to deal with GEC.' If BAe had bought VSEL unhindered, it would have strengthened its finances, as well as securing its position as the unchallenged defence prime contractor in the UK. Improved finances would have given BAe the financial headroom to rationalise its civil aircraft division - its one remaining running sore. Talks are well advanced on a deal which could solve BAe's commercial aircraft problems through merging BAe's turboprop aircraft business with the Franco-Italian group ATR. BAe could still do such a deal if it failed to buy VSEL, but it would be much more of a financial struggle. Concerns about the size of BAe's civil aircraft liabilities have prevented GEC from making a hostile bid for the company. GEC's tactics have been to encourage talks about a friendly merger of the low-risk defence operation, leaving BAe to handle its civil problems. By counter-attacking against BAe's bid for VSEL, Lord Weinstock hits two objectives at once; if he wins he effectively ties up the Trafalgar order, and leaves BAe weaker and therefore more pliable. However, the strategy could backfire. The BAe board recognises that there would be some benefits from a link to GEC; there were abortive talks between the two companies on the subject last year. The directors' preferred strategy, however, is to deepen their ties to European aerospace companies, something which would be more difficult if Dassault or Aerospatiale were faced with a monolithic GEC/BAe combination. Unfortunately, political constraints currently make European ties difficult, and BAe has thus been reluctant finally to close the door on GEC. But GEC's aggressive tactics over VSEL risk alienating some BAe board members who might have supported a merger. 'I begin to wonder whether you can do business with Lord Weinstock,' says one BAe board member. 'Everything seems to be on his terms or not at all.' Lord Weinstock's personality is important in another way. In July GEC announced that the company had asked Lord Weinstock to stay on for two years past the normal director's retirement date, until he is 72. The assumption is that his successor will be chosen before July 1996. That gives Lord Weinstock a very short time in which to realise his ambition of consolidating the UK defence industry. Hence perhaps his insistence on moving on VSEL now: if BAe secures the yard it may put the company out of his reach in the short term. The VSEL bid is a lower risk strategy than an aggressive bid for all of BAe. 'The fear for Lord Weinstock must be that the liabilities at BAe are bigger than he imagines.' says one City observer. 'If he mounted an aggressive bid which went wrong, the deal which was supposed to be his crowning achievement could end up as the huge blot at the very end of his copybook.' But the Pounds 14 a share offer is curiously pitched. It is not the knockout blow of over Pounds 15 which BAe could not hope to match, nor is it a nominal bid of Pounds 13.50 in line with the BAe offer. 'It may be that Lord Weinstock is exercising his usual caution and offering the minimum he thinks necessary to win,' muses one defence executive, 'but I think this suggests that GEC has not secured all of the competition clearances it needs from the ministry of defence. For that reason he has mounted a reasonable but not decisive attack, from which he could withdraw.' Because GEC's financial position is so much stronger than BAe's, GEC would win in a straight financial fight. BAe thus has to rely on arguments about competition in the defence industry to stop GEC. BAe has no shipyard and thus has little worry on competition grounds, but GEC owns Yarrow on the Clyde, the only other large warship yard left in the UK. The Office of Fair Trading will debate the competition concerns, though in practice, since the MoD is the only buyer, its submissions to the OFT will decide the issue. If the MoD does not want GEC to own Barrow, the deal will be blocked; if it is happy, the deal will go ahead. 'I detect a slippage in the MoD's robust position on competition' said one executive close to the deals. 'Three weeks ago the MoD was very opposed to both yards being owned by GEC, now it is equivocal. There is a danger that competition policy in defence procurement is being made on the hoof here. With the situation in the global defence industry evolving rapidly, that must be a bad thing. We need a proper review of what UK policy is and how the European industry can be rationalised effectively. As of now, none of us knows where we stand.'</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Kazakhs refuse Russia gas and oil equity stakes President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan yesterday said his country would not give Russia equity stakes in either the Tengiz oil project or the Karachaganak gas field being developed in Kazakhstan by western companies. Russia, which controls the export routes for the two developments, has been insisting on equity in the fields rather than being paid a tariff. 'Russia will not get an equity share in Tengiz or Karachaganak,' Mr Nazarbayev said yesterday. He said that on March 28 he was due to meet with Russian leaders in Moscow to discuss these issues and other economic disputes between the two republics. Mr Nazarbayev's statements contradict the views of western businessmen in Alma Ata who believe Kazakhstan is on the verge of conceding equity in the two fields to Russia. Tengiz, which is being developed by Chevron of the US, is producing oil for export. But Chevron has been plagued by disputes with Russia over the effect on pipelines of contaminants in the oil and the route of new pipelines. Karachaganak, which is some way from the export stage, is being developed by British Gas and Agip of Italy. They have been watching Chevron's troubles closely. Mr Nazarbayev yesterday said Kazakhstan was serious about plans to construct an export pipeline south through Turkey. But this pipeline would only be built after a joint Russian-Kazakh project to build a pipeline from the Caspian to a Russian port on the Black Sea. Together, Mr Nazarbayev's statements indicate an increasing determination on the part of the Kazakh leadership to lessen the ties which have permitted Russia to exert its economic domination. Kazakhstan has complained that many Russian refineries, upon which it is dependent, refused during the recent severe winter to ship back refined products to Kazakh suppliers of crude oil. Mr Nazarbayev, who, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was one of the most ardent backers of closer integration among former Soviet republics, is taking a more independent line now that 'co-operation' is taking the form of Russian domination. He was furious when the country was ejected from the rouble zone last autumn. Yesterday he rejected the notion of recreating the zone, describing it as 'a deluded dream'. Mr Nazarbayev also opposed deployment of Russian-only peacekeeping forces in other troubled former Soviet republics. He warned of hardline tendencies in Moscow and said the time had come for Russians to reconcile themselves to the existence of truely independent neighbours - a process he believes is only beginning.</p>

Schoenhuber's  "unscrupulousness" in choosing his words -- who called Ignatz  Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, an  "instigator of people," and after the attack on the synagogue in  Luebeck -- is "extremely alarming," Hoyer said in Bonn on Monday  [28 March]. What Schoenhuber says is the "intellectual breeding  ground for those who throw Molotov cocktails into synagogues and  tacitly accept the death of people as a result."    Hoyer and FRG Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) called on the democratic  forces in the FRG to categorically defend themselves against  Schoenhuber's words and deeds. Hoyer admonished that words such  as "instigator of people" addressed to "such an upright and  prudent man" as Bubis must "arouse all parties before they cause  irreparable damage."    "It has always been a speciality of the German rightists to  be the perpetrators and to support murders and then present  themselves as victims," Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, deputy chairwoman  of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, said in an interview  on Suedwestfunk radio in Baden-Baden. However, she hopes that  there will be a judge in Germany who will finally put "this  instigator" behind bars.</p>

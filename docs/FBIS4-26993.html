			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Connie Law and So Lai-fun] </F>   [Text] The United Democrats yesterday stepped up pressure  on other legislators to vote against the conservative political  model proposed by the Liberal Party. They lambasted the Liberal  Party for seeking China's blessing for its proposal, saying that  was an invitation for Beijing to interfere. "In the Liberal  Party's proposals we see the face of naked self-interest," said  Democrat chairman Martin Lee Chu-ming. Independents, whose  votes will decide today's debate, "will surely be held  accountable if Hong Kong's last efforts to have a modest measure  of democracy are never to be realised", he said.    The plea came on the eve of the marathon debate on the  second, and final, part of the political package proposed by  Governor Chris Patten. The debate will start at 9 am and is  expected to last until early tomorrow morning.    There was only a "very, very marginal" difference in the  number of supporters and opponents of the Liberal Party's  proposal, said member Henry Tang Ying-yen. He was"cautiously  optimistic" the blueprint, widely known as the 1994 package,  would be endorsed.    Sources said the party had secured 27 votes, while 26 would  vote against it. Martin Barrow was said to have changed his  position recently from supporting the 1994 package to  abstaining. Jimmy McGregor was also said to have decided to  abstain. Timothy Ha Wing-ho had made clear he would not support  the proposal. The Liberal Party was trying to persuade him to  abstain.    Hui Yin-fat was also said to be wavering between abstaining  or opposing the Liberal Party's proposal. But Philip Choi  Shing-kiu of the Hong Kong Social Workers' General Union last  night said he would be extremely disappointed if Mr Hui, the  social workers' representative, did anything other than oppose  the conservative model.    Democrat leader Mr Lee said: "(The Liberal Party's proposal)  would not be accepted even under former Governor Sir David  Wilson's government. They believe that if Patten's proposal is  carried into law, the liberals would sweep the elections and  would form a majority and would cause instability to Hong Kong,  which is of course a lie."    He called on six independents -- namely Roger Luk Koon-ho,  Simon Ip Sik-on, Mr Barrow, Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen, Mr Ha and  Marvin Cheung Kin-tung -- to think twice before voting for the  Liberal Party. They had indicated support for the Government's  proposal in three debates. "They owe it to the people of Hong  Kong, they owe it to history to explain (their change of  position) on such a critical matter if they do so," Mr Lee said.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: An exciting new trio - Concert There is a splendid new piano trio (in the classical sense: piano, violin, cello) to watch out for, which we heard in the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday. The 'Pires-Dumay-Hoffman' Trio pursues its musical goals with unanimous sympathy as well as sharp individual character and expertise - just what we needed, as the Beaux Arts Trio edges toward retirement. The senior member is the pianist Maria Joao Pires (50 next year), who has won the hearts of London audiences ever since she took up her long-interrupted career again. Recently she has formed a notable duo with Augustin Dumay, whom I would place among the strongest, most stylish, thoughtful and brilliantly equipped violinists of our day - though his reputation in Britain does not stretch far yet. Now the younger American cellist Gary Hoffman, who won the Rostropovich Competition seven years ago, has joined them. I slightly regretted the changes in their programme as originally advertised. Instead of Mozart's K564 trio in G (which they should have played beautifully) and the Schubert E-flat (where they might have been too fastidious to relish its earthy, gemutlich cheerfulness), we got an extra violin-and-piano exhibit - the K379 sonata in G, delivered with relaxed, graceful mock-simplicity - and an extra showpiece for Hoffman. That was Schubert's 'Arpeggione' Sonata, where he was scrupulous and subtle but ultra-polite, while Pires suppressed her accompaniment to a modest vanishing-point. He swung his shoulders in the dance-passages, and even tapped his foot, but if you closed your eyes the music danced only in the coolest, most decorous way. The one piece retained from the original bill was the third violin sonata of Brahms, in D minor. In that, Dumay and Pires made an inspired departure from the standard reading. By contrast with its vernal, just-earlier companions in A major and G (they are all 'late' works), this op. 108 is usually presented as a Sturm und Drang exercise. But the performers reserved 'storm and stress' for the Finale; the opening Allegro was rivettingly quiet and 'inward' - not stormy at all, but sober and searching to a great depth, wonderful to hear. The trio concluded with the Brahms C major, op. 87. The ingenious workings-out were rendered transparent, but rather temperate. It would have been satisfying to hear the real energy of Brahms's material displayed in franker, rumbustious life; Pires-Dumay-Hoffman spelled it out in scrupulous detail, but it never took fire until the lusty final coda. Nonetheless, after another year or two of mutual adjustment this trio might be the leading ensemble in its repertoire.</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / October incomes up in US PERSONAL INCOME in the US rose by one per cent in October over the previous month, the largest monthly gain since last December and further evidence of an economy that seems to be finally gathering steam. Special factors, including subsidy payments to farmers and other public and private sector bonuses, accounted for more than half the monthly advance. But wages and salaries in October also went up a healthy 0.6 per cent, after falling 0.1 per cent in September, as did disposable income. Personal consumption spending in the month went up by an adjusted 0.7 per cent, nearly as good as the upwardly revised 0.9 per cent advance of September. The new surge in consumer confidence, also reflected earlier this week by the revised 3.9 per cent annual growth in the third quarter gross national product, also suggests much improved Christmas sales, for which the big retailing push began yesterday, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Assorted surveys project sales 4-9 per cent higher than last year and even some warnings of a shortage of very popular goods just before Christmas itself.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round negotiators peer through the Tokyo fog - The 'breakthrough' at last week's G7 summit appears somewhat different back in Geneva FOR almost 18 months the fate of the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalisation has been in the hands of the US and the European Community. With the breakthrough in trade negotiations in Tokyo last week, talks have now reverted to Geneva and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. At last, others among the 116 countries involved in the round now have a say. But if Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, hoped when he briefed Uruguay Round trade negotiators in Geneva early this week that the Tokyo breakthrough shifted the onus for progress on to others, then he will need to think again. Negotiators who have been forced to sit on the sidelines in recent months are unanimous: 'We are cautiously optimistic about the outcome in Tokyo. But there is ambiguity, and a total absence of detail,' one said: 'Until we see the detail, we cannot move any further.' Another developing country negotiator added: 'The major problems have been left unsettled by Tokyo, and have been delivered back to Geneva in the same state they were in before.' This applies to disputes over the liberalisation of trade in textiles, to trade in services, to plans for liberalising maritime services, to international trade in films and television programmes, as well as many others. Demands from developing countries, and countries like Australia, for tariff cuts on trade in non-ferrous metals and in wood, paper and pulp products, also remain unresolved. This reality sits uncomfortably with Sir Leon's exhortations on Monday to Gatt negotiators that, following the deal reached by the 'quad' countries (Japan, Canada, the US and the EC) in Tokyo, the time had come for other countries to do their bit - to improve offers made over the past year on tariff cuts. The call was disingenuous at least. Many developing countries note that the US and the EC have yet to make even a first tariff-cutting offer in many areas of critical interest to them. Even Community officials now admit that the Tokyo deal was more an agreement over a formula by which to achieve a deal, rather than a specific set of tariff cuts. They say they are doing the sums now, and will have no offer to present to trading partners until July 23. Even then, critical areas like market opening for farm products, or tariff cuts across the thousands of categories of traded textiles and garments, are unlikely to be on the table. 'While I am cautiously optimistic, I don't think much will get done before the autumn,' said Mr Balkrishan Zutchi, India's veteran Gatt ambassador. This confirms comments from an EC official that the two weeks now remaining before Geneva winds down for the August holidays will provide 'a clarification stage rather than a negotiating stage'. If non-quad countries are to be coaxed forward to improve market access and tariff cutting offers, then the US and the EC will need to address specifically a number of their concerns. These are: Farm trade: farm exporters from Cairns group countries like Australia, Argentina and Thailand are adamant that the EC in particular must make a significant market access offer. If they are to open their markets further to manufactured exports from the US or the EC, then greater opportunities to sell farm products to Europe must be made available. Textiles: Mr Jesus Seade, Mexico's Gatt ambassador, describes this as a 'highly unstable dossier'. Many developing countries - prominently India - need better export opportunities to the US and the Community if they are to bow to pressure to open their markets to services, and tighten enforcement of intellectual property protection. Special and differential treatment: many developing countries have been alarmed by western demands that they make marketing opening offers comparable to those made by the quad countries in Tokyo. They emphasise that the Gatt has always asserted the right of countries to make commitments that match their financial and economic capacities. Tariffication without exception: this is the demand that importers remove all non-tariff barriers, and replace them with tariffs which are more transparent, and more easily reduced over time. It is a demand particularly precious to farm exporters. It has been resisted fiercely by countries like Japan and South Korea, which block all imports of rice on food security grounds, and Canada, which has for decades maintained a supply management system in dairy products which limits imports. Amendments to the draft final act: this draft Uruguay Round agreement, completed in December 1991, may not be carved in stone, but most countries insist that the minimum of changes should be allowed, for fear that the entire balanced package of commitments embodied by it will crumble. Washington caused consternation late last year by calling for extensive changes, linked with concern to protect its sovereign discretion to apply unilateral trade sanctions where it deemed them necessary.</p>

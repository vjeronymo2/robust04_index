			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / The Danish Referendum: Commission looks for a key to unlock the Community - David Gardner describes how previous Danish vote has hamstrung Brussels EVEN with the vote by the Danes in favour of Maastricht, the European Community faces a struggle to break free from the sort of Euro-gridlock in which it has been trapped since Denmark first rejected the treaty last June. So, at least, conclude surprising numbers of top officials in Brussels, who fear that little will be achieved by the new, two-year Commission which started work this January. Speaking before the Danish referendum result was known, one senior Commission official remarked: 'We are in the doldrums.' He was harking back to the fabled 'Euro-pessimism' of the 1970s and early 1980s, when the EC was becalmed - until the integrationist winds of the single market programme, the reform of EC finances, and German unification, sped the Community towards the Maastricht treaty on monetary and political union. The delays in Denmark and Britain in ratifying Maastricht, plus the constitutional challenge to the treaty in the German courts, sent the EC into limbo. 'We are simply blocked,' a top trouble-shooter at the Commission complained recently. 'We can make no statement or proposal which might in any way affect ratification.' He and his colleagues hope the Danish Yes will revive confidence and activity. Brussels has been operating under a self-denying ordinance since last June. But the second half of last year was no less frenetic for that, dominated by crisis management as the exchange rate mechanism linking EC currencies was sundered by speculators betting against the feasibility of the economic and monetary union plan at the heart of Maastricht. December's Edinburgh summit, against heavy odds, secured: a deal on an expanded EC budget; a truce in the power struggle between Brussels and the larger member states; and, after all manner of legal pirouettes, a formula allowing the Danes to put Maastricht in a new wrapping for yesterday's referendum. Shortly afterwards, a Commission with seven new faces among its 17 members was named for this year and next - half the normal term. But since then it has all but gone underground. After the marathon of 282 measures needed to create the single market, a fall-off in legislative output was expected. But so far this year Brussels has produced only 'communications' - something between a White Paper and a wish-list - and tinkered with regulations. Bold ambitions to fill acknowledged gaps in the single market, like the liberalisation of telecommunications, energy and postal services, have been watered down and/or pushed into the future. The Commission is the legislative engine of the EC, with sole right to propose laws, which then only the council of ministers can decide, sometimes with amendments from the European parliament. When the Commission is hamstrung, so is the Community. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was lambasted for the anaemia of the Brussels programme for 1993-94, when he presented it to the parliament in February. This year's legislative programme is dominated by 194 'pending' measures, long stranded in Council after sharp encounters with intractable national interests. The current Danish presidency of the EC, precisely because of the trouble it has had persuading its voters that the EC can meet their social and environmental concerns, has been trying to prise free two measures. It is pushing for agreement by next month on: the European Works Councils directive, blocked by the UK, which would oblige supranational companies to consult their workers on jobs changes, new technology and investment, and relocation decisions; and the carbon/energy tax. The Commission and half the member states regard the tax (which would rise to Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2000) as indispensable if the EC is to meet its commitment under the Rio Climate Change Convention. This requires it to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. Five more states have grudgingly accepted the principle of a tax, but Britain remains strongly opposed. Both these measures are Commission flagships, but Brussels has been able to do little more than urge them along, and await the outcome. But there are still other obstacles tightening the Euro-gridlock, and blocking any quick movement out of it. This Commission was appointed for two years, in part to synchronise it with elections to the European parliament in June next year. The latter will have the right under Maastricht to screen appointed commissioners formally. The treaty also gives it near equal say with the council in shaping those EC laws which are passed by majority vote among the member states. The parliament is unwilling to supply its 'opinion' - mandatory for all legislation under the consultation procedures for non-single market measures  -because once Maastricht is ratified its legislative clout will increase. At March's council of transport ministers, for instance, measures on air traffic control, transport infrastructure and trans-European networks all lacked the Strasbourg avis needed for them to go forward. 'Why should we play ball now when we can play with a bigger ball later,' said one parliament official. However, if the ratification hold-up keeps the Commission inert until the end of the year, it will only be a few months after that, probably in April, that MEPs will take to the election hustings, leaving but a brief window of legislative opportunity. For by June 1994 at the latest, the Twelve will appoint a successor to Mr Delors, moving an already transitional Commission into the lame duck stage, with some officials predicting the replacement of about two-thirds of its members. Is there a way out of this gridlock? The Commission's recently announced plan for an EC-wide programme to address structural unemployment may be one way forward. One senior Commission official predicts a leap ahead by Germany, France and the Benelux countries to lock the parities of their currencies soon after ratification. This, he argues, would create a 'hard core' for Emu, which the remaining member states wanting to join it could aim at. On one thing he is certain: 'We need, we must have, a rebound, something solid.'</p>

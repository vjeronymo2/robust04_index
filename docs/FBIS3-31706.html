Pejak: "The General Laughs at Rumors About </F> Resignation"]    [Text] Jahorina, Feb -- General Ratko Mladic, commander of  the general staff of the army of the Srpska republic, has not  appeared in public for some time. This has caused all sorts of  speculation. Along the right bank of the Drina, "the well  informed" were even saying that Mladic had resigned. In a  conversation with our correspondent on Mt. Jahorina [near  Sarajevo] recently, the general first laughed at that and then  explained the reasons for his absence:    "I was not there because I was busy with obligations at the  front. In this situation, I do not want to be very much present  in public, because in this way, people get used to individuals.  And there are some personalities who possess more authority, so  let us rather have them in the public eye. I am doing my job as  well as my knowledge, capabilities, abilities allow, together  with my associates. What matters is that there are some evident  results of this," Mladic said.    Replying to the observation that the term "withdrawal" is  very much present in this war, Mladic said the following:    "Withdrawal has never brought luck to anybody. We have to  free ourselves from the Serb syndrome that by withdrawing in  1915 and 1916, we achieved our aims. I am not saying that this  was right or wrong. However, in that war there were some sort  of tactics and `stop-go' strategies. They experienced a  disaster. One should only compare a withdrawal with this  `stop-go' strategy and draw a conclusion. It is clear what  should be done: One should only look straight ahead and walk  straight on and up. I do not know what withdrawal means.  Withdrawal can take place in a way at a moment when the war  chaos in the regions of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  former Yugoslavia is settled by political means, when the  hatchets are buried by those people who have dug them out and  have set off to attack the Serbian people, when they withdraw  their declaration of war on the Serbian people, when they  express a real wish for peace and put their signature to it.  Only then can we return our weapons to our barracks and get  ready in case a new holocaust befalls the Serbian people."</p>

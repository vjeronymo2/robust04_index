			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hicking Pentecost boosted by sharp cut in interest charges HICKING Pentecost, the industrial products and textiles company, reported a 44 per cent increase to Pounds 1.65m in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 on the back of substantially reduced interest charges. Mr David Lister, chairman, said he was confident the strong performance would continue in the second half. The interim dividend is raised 12.5 per cent to 1.35p, while earnings per share rose to 7.73p (7.19p). Mr Tudor Davies, managing director, said knitwear exports increased by 30 per cent in the first half. The group was likely to benefit further from the fall in sterling. Knitwear represents some 75 per cent of group sales, though it has been gradually diversifying away from textiles since 1989 when Messrs Lister and Davies were appointed. Acquisitions, such as Nicholson Plastics, the water tank maker included for a full six months this time, helped sales rise from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds 13.6m. Operating profits advanced from Pounds 1.36m to Pounds 1.67m. Mr Davies said the underlying performance of the industrial products division remained roughly level with last year. Interest payments were cut from from Pounds 220,000 to Pounds 24,000. This was partly due to strong cash generation and also to the Pounds 4.5m rights issue in June 1991, launched to pay for Nicholson. Debt, however, was slightly higher at the interim stage at Pounds 1m, against Pounds 700,000.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Elsevier sees increased growth in 1992 ELSEVIER, the Dutch publisher, said yesterday that earnings growth will improve from 1992 after slowing to a projected 10 per cent in 1991 because of the company's plans to acquire Pergamon Press, the UK scientific publisher. In 1990, Elsevier posted a 17 per cent increase in after-tax earnings per share, which the company regards as the best measure of its performance. As reported, net profit soared by 60 per cent to Fl 507m (Dollars 268m). Mr Pierre Vinken, the company chairman, said growth in net profit would slow substantially in 1991 because 1990's net result had been boosted by non-recurring items, mainly the book profits from Elsevier's sale of a 33 per cent stake in Wolters Kluwer, a fellow Dutch publisher. This month, Elsevier also sold its 8.9 per cent stake in Pearson, the UK publishing and banking group which owns the Financial Times. The proceeds of both these divestments will enable Elsevier to finance most of its Pounds 440m (Dollars 787m) purchase of Pergamon, but the Dutch company will also draw on a bridging loan of around Pounds 50m. The loan will be paid back by the end of 1991, enabling profit growth to resume its higher trend, Elsevier said. Elsevier was already the world's biggest scientific publisher before it announced plans to acquire Pergamon. Oce van der Grinten, the Dutch copier and office systems group, said net profit in the first quarter of 1991 rose by 5 per cent to Fl 19.1m on sales up 3 per cent at Fl 585.2m. The first-quarter result marks a slight improvement from the full year 1990, when net profit was barely changed at Fl 85.7m compared with Fl 84.7m in 1989 because of a rise in financial charges. However, operating profit, which had showed an 8 per cent rise in 1990, fell to Fl 36.1m in the 1991 first quarter from Fl 37.1m in the same period of 1990.</p>

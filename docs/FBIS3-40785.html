			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, December 21 (PTI)--The joint  parliamentary committee (JPC) today held the top management of  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the finance ministry equally  responsible for the multi-crore rupee securities scam saying  "deregulation without effective checks and balances would be an  unmitigated disaster."    In its Volume I report tabled in Parliament today, the  committee said if RBI had not turned "a blind eye to the massive  irregularities in the banking transactions between the period of  July 1991 to April 1992, when thousands of crores of bank funds  were diverted to the stock market, it would not have been  possible for some brokers to play havoc with the system."    It said Mr S. Venkitaramanan as the governor of RBI during  this crucial period must be held no less responsible.    Referring to the finance ministry's role in the scam, the  committee said it failed to anticipate the problem, respond to  it purposefully when it first surfaced, manage adequately  thereafter the consequences of it, apply the needed correctives  with promptness and punish the guilty in time and resolutely.    On the role of top RBI officials in the scam, the committee  said the suggestion to treat the foreign banks differently, the  delay in the issue of the circular of July, 1991, failure to  incorporate all the deficiencies in this circular and the  absence of any follow-up action subsequently, the delay in the  issue of the bill discounting circular for 22 months,  recommendation to appoint people in top positions which proved  to be a liability and display of unusual interest in the account  of Harshad Mehta were all acts of "omission and commission" on  the part of the former governor of RBI, Mr S. Venkitaramanan,  which could not be "overlooked in any of their ramifications."    Similarly, the large number of SGL (security general ledger)  bouncings, the deficiencies in the functioning of the public  debt office (PDO) and the goings-on in both State Bank of India  [SBI] and the National Housing Bank [NHB] of which Mr R.  Janakiraman was a director, clearly indicates "there was  dereliction in performing his duties" as deputy governor, the  report observed.    The committee noted that Mr Amitava Ghosh, who was the  deputy  governor in charge of department of banking operations and  development [DBOD] for ten years, must be held primarily  responsible for the continuing irregularities in the banking  sector, ignoring the various inspection reports prepared by the  terms of RBI inspectors over the years like the Augustine Kurias  report, the Ranganathan report and for being `casual' in his  approach to his duties.    Mr N.D. Parameshwaran, the chief officer of DBOD should also  be held responsible for the lapses of the department. The JPC  said, he need not have played any role concerning the account of  Harshad Mehta.    It also urged review of the penal clauses in the BR  (bankers'  receipt) Act and other relevant Acts to enable RBI to impose  graded penalties and other types of punishments commensurate  with the seriousness of the abuse.    Referring to the functioning of public sector banks and  appointments of top posts in these banks, the committee asked  the finance ministry to set up a board on the lines of the  public enterprises selection board for appointment of chief  executives and executive directors of nationalised banks.    The committee noted as many as ten top former executives of  the 20 nationalised banks had, during the past few years, been  found involved in serious irregularities. This was "a telling  commentary on the process of selection and appointments by the  government," it said.    Irregularities committed by top management not only  adversely  hit the functioning of their respective banks but also led to  the malaise spreading over the entire banking system, JPC said.    It said this hoax of flotation of funds by PSUs [public  sector undertakings] was perpetrated and the funds so released  became a principal source of finance for all varieties of  speculative and illegal transactions in the securities market,  as well as the stock market. The placement of PSU funds became  the single great contributor to the scam, it said.    "What the committee finds as condemnable is that all this  was  public money and all who were playing with it were public  servants," it observed caustically.    The committee favoured replacing the government nominee  directors from the boards of public sector banks, who are at  present from the civil services.    It strongly felt, in view of their conduct and activities in  the scam, the working of foreign banks had to be strictly  supervised as in a way, they were the initiators of the scam as  well as the major players.    In the light of these mistakes, the committee felt, the  responsibility and accountability of the finance minister to  Parliament could not be `denied'.    Though the finance minister tried to disown direct  responsibility for administrative failures or management  deficiencies in the case of individual banks and other financial  bodies, the committee said such a distinction could not be  sustained by the constitutional jurisprudence under which the  parliamentary system worked.    In the light of developments that had supervened, the  committee said the relevance of continuing in its present form  the banking division and the stock division by the finance  ministry needed to be examined.    The committee came down heavily on what it termed the  "culture of non-accountability in all sections of government and  the banks."    Describing this culture as "the most unfortunate aspect" of  the scam, the report said. "The scam was a result of failure to  check irregularities in the banking system and also  liberalisation without adequate safeguards."    "While the mood of the government is upbeat on  liberalisation, their orientation towards strict enforcement  has yet to manifest itself. Deorientation without effective  checks and balances would in the view of the committee be an  unmitigated disaster," it said.</p>

Ankara was disturbed, because  it has now become clear that Kazakhstan's oil will be  transported to the Black Sea through Russia. Now attention has  been riveted on the status of the Straits.    [Begin Fatih Yilmaz recording] Kazakhstan President  Nursultan  Nazarbayev's visit to the United States at the beginning of the  week produced an intriguing result for Turkey. Nazarbayev and  U.S. President Bill Clinton reached a consensus on transporting  Kazakhstan's oil to the Black Sea through Russia. This created  unease in Ankara, which was hoping that Kazakhstan's oil would  be transported to Ceyhan through Baku. Kazakhstan's pro-Russian  stance was the primary cause of the unease. The issue of  transporting oil through the Black Sea was the other cause for  the unease. This question raises the status of the Straits.  The U.S. oil companies favor transporting Kazakhstan's oil to  the Black Sea through the Straits. But now tension persists  between Turkey and Russia over the issue of the Straits. Turkey  is not positively inclined toward the use of the Straits for oil  transportation. Russia is insisting on it. The status of the  Straits will be taken up during the talks to be held between  Turkey and Russia next week in Ankara. Ankara is getting ready  to present an alternate proposal to transport the oil reaching  the Black Sea and the Mediterranean through the Samsun-Ceyhan  pipeline. [end recording]</p>

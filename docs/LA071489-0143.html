			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLAMMING UP;  </P> <P> NATIVE NEW ENGLANDER TESTS THE CHOWDER IN RED, WHITE AND SAN CLEMENTE STYLE  </P> <P> Sunday last was a glorious, sun-drenched day on the San Clemente Pier, and one  that I will not soon forget. That was the day, you see, I was asked to judge  the second annual Fiesta Chowder cook-off in conjunction with the San Clemente  Ocean Festival.  </P> <P> Now, I am a native New Englander, and we native New Englanders are plenty  particular when it comes to our chowders. To most of us, the ideal chowder has  plenty of cream, fresh clams, diced potato, sweet butter, salt, pepper, a  little cornstarch and maybe even some bacon if we are feeling radical. Few  Bostonians would even point their noses at the red chowders, and suffering the  indignities of pasty white pretenders at fish frys, church suppers and ersatz  seafood restaurants away from New England takes all the self-discipline and  good manners we can muster.  </P> <P> With all due respect to the good people of San Clemente, I must report that  despite the fun, Sunday was indeed a stern test of character. Because, as one  of the other judges so aptly noted midway through the tasting, "some of these  chowders are enough to gag a maggot."  </P> <P> So, after shuffling through the throngs on the pier, meeting King Neptune,  ogling a mermaid and observing hundreds of helium balloons, little boys with  fishing poles and apparently happy chowder tasters with their plastic tasting  cups, there we were at the judging stand ready to begin.  </P> <P> The sponsors handed us our white chefs hats and aprons, set out the numbered  containers, plastic spoons and the paper sheets we were to use for evaluation,  marked with numerical scales for color, texture, and aroma. Next to us were  some trophies ready to be handed out. The lids were lifted and we began.  </P> <P> I never knew chowders could come in so many varieties. Some had shrimp and  strands of celery. Others had Cajun spices and mussels. Some were creamy and  yellow. Others were oily and brown. Many of the red chowders were full of fiery  peppers and chunks of tomato. Even more of the white chowders had uncooked  potatoes floating on the surface. In the end I had to douse my mouth with  Perrier and oyster crackers to restore my palate. When the smoke cleared away,  these were the results:  </P> <P> Best restaurant New England-style chowder went to Rose and Crown in San  Clemente. Best restaurant Manhattan-style chowder went to Sonny's Pizza in San  Clemente. Best individual (non-restaurant) New England-style chowder went to  the Lusk Co. in San Clemente. Best individual Manhattan-style chowder went to  Ann Raymond in San Clemente.  </P> <P> There was no award for sportsmanlike conduct, but maybe they will put that one  in next year. For judges.  </P></p>

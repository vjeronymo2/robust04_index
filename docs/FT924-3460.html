			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Lessons in new language of VAT With less than a month to go until the launch of the European single market, companies are still attempting to modify their value added tax accounting procedures, writes Charles Batchelor. From January 1 border controls and customs posts will be replaced by a system whereby companies record their own VAT information and compile their own trading records. A range of manuals and guidebooks has been produced to help companies understand and implement the changes. They include: Guide to the Single European Market*, a booklet from Tetra, a software company. This provides a brief introduction to the new system and explains the terminology that is being adopted. A Guide to UK VAT &amp; Customs Procedures for the Single Market* by N Mohr and I Wardleworth provides a full account of trading procedures, VAT, trade statistics and excise questions. It describes existing systems of customs clearance, the changes which will occur and includes a glossary of terms and extensive lists of useful addresses. The VAT Accounting Compliance Manual** from ITMP Business Information Services and the London Chamber of Commerce, is intended more for information technology and financial managers than for general management. It takes a 'system audit' approach, leading users through a series of questions on areas such as sales order processing, sales ledger reporting and inventory-work in progress. Appendices list VAT rates throughout the EC, European VAT numbers and reporting thresholds. *Tetra Ltd, Pre-Sales Department, The Cynosure Centre, Vanwall Business Park, Maidenhead, Berks SL6 4UB.

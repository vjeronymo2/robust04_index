Addressing a reception in the Great Hall of the People, Hu,  on behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council,  extended Spring Festival greetings to retired officials  throughout the country.    Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of  the party Central Committee, said that 1994 is a year "crucial"  to the success of China's reform, opening up and modernization  drive.    To accomplish this year's reforms and economic construction  tasks, it is imperative to follow the party's ideological line  of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and the  party's work line of relying on the masses, Hu told the 2,000 in  attendance.    The reception was sponsored jointly by the Propaganda  Department of the party Central Committee, the General Political  Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the  Beijing Municipal Party Committee.    Hu, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the party  Central Committee, said that by relying on and forging close  ties with the people, and mobilizing all positive factors in  society, "we will certainly be able to surmount all difficulties  on our road forward."    The leader praised retired officials for their historic  contributions toward victory in the new democratic revolution,  the establishment of the socialist system, the development of  socialism, and the promotion of reform, opening up,  modernization and China's prosperity.    He also called on them to continue supporting various  undertakings of the reform and construction and helping younger  officials to assume positions of greater responsibility.    According to Hu, China now has more than seven million  retired party and government officials. Party committees and  government bodies at all levels must strengthen their leadership  of work among these officials, he noted.    He pledged to establish and perfect a social insurance  system  for retired officials in the course of instituting new reform  measures.    He also stressed the importance of taking proper measures to  help these officials overcome the difficulties in their  livelihood, so that they will be able to enjoy their later years.</p>

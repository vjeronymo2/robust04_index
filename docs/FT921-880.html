			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally breathes life into equities IT WAS difficult to decide which caused the loudest groans of disappointment around the City of London's dealing rooms yesterday; the results of the latest batch of opinion polls or England's defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the world cup cricket final in Australia. But dealers quickly forgot the cricket, turning instead to financial matters. By the end of the day they had become positively enthusiastic about the chances of yet another turnround in the polls, with the market alive to stories that Gallup, in this morning's Daily Telegraph, will reveal the Tories catching up on Labour. There was also a late charge of excitement as French bonds ran up amid suggestions of a cut in French interest rates, along with stories that the French prime minister could be facing her removal from office. The flurry of late support prompted an abrupt about turn by the FT-SE 100-share Index, which rallied strongly after an uncertain start to close a net 6.2 higher at 2,464.9. There were also more than a few crumbs of comfort for the market from a series of encouraging company news statements, notably from Reckitt &amp; Colman, the health and household group, Hepworth, the building products group, and particularly from Barratt Developments, one of the UK's leading housebuilders. The latest general election campaigning and opinion poll results set the tone for the day's session in the market. The three most recent polls overturned the Conservatives' five-point lead indicated on Tuesday by Harris in the Daily Express, giving Labour a lead over the ruling Conservatives by one, three and four points. There was no real panic in the market at the outset, with marketmakers chopping opening dealing levels to deter any potential big sellers. The opening gambit proved moderately successful, with light selling sending the Footsie down to the day's low of 2,448.0 within an hour of the opening. Thereafter, the index clawed its way back, eventually moving into positive territory towards the close of trading, responding to the opinion poll optimism, the French rate cut story and a rally on Wall Street. Although happy with the market's late improvement, senior traders pointed to the pitiful level of turnover in the equity market. Yesterday saw turnover of 425.3m shares recorded, well down on Tuesday's 493.2m. Activity is expected to remain very thin until the election. Equity strategists said the market had mostly factored in the increased chances of either a straight Labour win or a Labour-dominated hung parliament. This was the view adopted by Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker, whose strategist Mr Ian Harnett maintained that the market's potential upside was still slightly more than its downside. The best individual performances among the Footsie stocks included two of the world's big drug companies, Glaxo and Wellcome, with the latter strongly supported ahead of today's preliminary figures and the former boosted by US support. Guinness responded to official confirmation that the Warren Buffett-run Berkshire Hathaway had bought a near two per cent stake.</p>

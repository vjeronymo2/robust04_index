			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andrew Marr: "Making a Prime Minister of the </F> President"]    [Text] The balance of probability is that Michael  Heseltine will be Prime Minister by the end of this year. This  startling view is spreading on the Tory benches and was  reinforced by a day in which John Major failed to reassure his  parliamentary party about either his tactics or his personal  style. Mr Major is not "finished": he is a resilient and  determined man. But from today he is fighting against, rather  than with the parliamentary odds: if he survives the year as  Prime Minister, it will be as Britain's Comeback Kid.    Yesterday was one of those days which gives the lie to the  argument that the House of Commons no longer matters. Its  significance was a sniff in the air, a change of mood. As the  Prime Minister tried, perfectly reasonably and perfectly coolly,  and showing his usual command of the detail, to respond to a  series of sceptical questions about the European voting  compromise, there was an ominous silence, a grim, folded-arms  passivity on the Tory benches behind him.    Then Tony Marlow, regarded by mainstream Conservatives as  being beyond the pale, openly told Mr Major he was no good and  should go. There was the predictable noise of offence being  taken on the Conservative side of the House. But it was low and  muted, a mild susurration in the backwoods rather than an  outraged gust of anger. Nor, when Mr Major quite sharply jabbed  back at a man he detests, was there much relief Nobody follows  Mr Marlow, though he was among the first publicly to demand that  Margaret Thatcher go. But the social standing of the person who  says the emperor is nude is hardly the point.    One eminent backbencher said afterwards: "It was terribly  embarrassing. What Marlow said was embarrassing. The Prime  Minister's reply was embarrassing. And the reaction was  embarrassing." Another said: "Tomorrow's headline must be `Naked  Emperor to Soldier On.'"    Of the middle-roader Tory MPs I spoke to during the evening,  the majority felt that Mr Major's position was slipping beyond  the point where it could be retrieved. Gruff and genuinely sad  expressions like "not up to it" and "I'm sorry -- I voted for  the guy" were abundant. Earlier, in the chamber, the party had  looked as if it had had the stuffing knocked out of it by the  latest twists of rhetoric and compromise. At one point it  seemed as though the government side was going to run out of  questions to ask during Prime Minister's Question Time -- an  unheard-of thing. One senior MP who had witnessed the Suez  debates compared the mood with that.    Discussions have been going on among different factions of  Conservative MPs about potential replacements and about the  mechanism for a change of leader. The assumption is that Mr  Major will not, under any circumstances, stand down willingly  and that a contest would have to be forced. Unlike Margaret  Thatcher he would probably fight on beyond a poor first-ballot  result and force cabinet colleagues to stand against him. That  would take some nerve. It is very early days. We still have  months of manoeuvring, elections and unpredictable events to  come. But these details of a challenge are being openly talked  about already. And in those discussions, ministers have been  involved, though not cabinet ministers.    Kenneth Clarke, who only a few months ago seemed  unchallengeable as the crown prince, has been losing ground fast  to Mr Heseltine. A series of influential figures on the right  of the party have been quietly canvassing their friends on Mr  Heseltine's behalf, and partisans of Michael Portillo, the  darling of the right are already peeling off into the Heseltine  camp.    The President of the Board of Trade has been impeccably,  even  flauntingly, loyal -- which is precisely the right attitude for  someone in his position. But his case is being made for him  across the spectrum of Tory politics. One argument is that the  centre of gravity in the party is moving on the European issue  to embrace a policy that could be described as British Gaullism.  But for that, you require a British de Gaulle. And there is  only one contender for that job. More generally,  middle-of-the-road MPs are saying that after 15 years of power,  the Conservative movement is tired, demoralised and ragged, and  requires a giant shot of adrenalin if it is to win a fifth  victory. A Heseltine premiership carries the prospect of an  exhilarating, dangerous cavalry charge that could transform the  mood. The Labour leadership views the possibility with  trepidation.    Those are the arguments flowing round the corridors and  parliamentary offices. The Clarke camp, which had attracted the  strong interest of right-wing dissidents last summer when Mr  Heseltine was out of action after his heart attack, has kept  quiet. But if the Chancellor assumes that Mr Heseltine is  damaging his standing by showing his hand too openly, he may be  making a serious tactical mistake: there is a yearning for hope  in the party that precludes worry about the niceties. One  former cabinet minister once criticised Mr Heseltine as "rather  too much the thwack of crop upon leather." To many Tories these  days it seems an appealing thought.    What, finally, about the loyalist Major camp? There are  people still ready to work hard for him and there are various  wheezes to make life easier. The appointment of a tough press  officer, Christopher Meyer, has helped a little. The latest  suggestion is that the equally tough and respected Health  Minister, Brian Mawhinney, should be made Downing Street's  boot-boy in chief, a partisan fighting for Mr Major on the  rebellious back benches. Then there is the dilemma of the  summer reshuffle. Should Mr Major ruthlessly kick out half a  dozen cabinet ministers who have failed to live up to  expectations, and try to remodel his government that way -- or  would that merely create another rebellious group on the back  benches and increase the likelihood of a putsch in the autumn?  Betting is a fools' game. But if you are that kind of fool, lay  a spare tenner on the President.</p>

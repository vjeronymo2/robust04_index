			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: First half profits warning at Leigh Shares in Leigh Interests, the waste management group, fell 51p to 175p yesterday after a warning that profits for the first half to September 30 would be significantly below the corresponding Pounds 7.1m. Mr Malcolm Wood, chairman, said that turnover had been held back by depressed activity in the nationwide market for contaminated land reclamation contracts and there had been delays in completing the commissioning of the new facilities at Four Ashes, Wolverhampton. However, he expected that during the second half Four Ashes would be profitable and results for the period would be 'significantly in excess of the first half'.</p>

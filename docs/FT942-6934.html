			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Shoprite shares tumble 54p on results Shares in Shoprite fell 54p to 90p yesterday as the discount food retailer brought forward publication of its interim results from mid-June because profits for the period were substantially below market expectations. Although turnover for the six months to May 1 increased by 59 per cent, from Pounds 66m to Pounds 105m, operating profits fell by 17 per cent from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.02m. That was in spite of 20 new store openings, taking the chain to 83. The shortfall in operating profit was offset by a Pounds 1.95m surplus on the disposal of various assets - principally the sale and leaseback of property in Scotland - and at the pre-tax level profits advanced by 62 per cent from Pounds 1.69m to Pounds 2.74m. The results clearly demonstrated the pain caused in some sections of the grocery market by increasing price competition since late last year, when superstore chains Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway began to respond to the growth in the discount market and price initiatives from Asda and Gateway. Mr Charles Good, managing director, said Shoprite had been forced to cut gross margins to maintain its price advantage over competitors, which had hit the bottom line. Steps had been taken to reduce costs, and marketing initiatives had been implemented to promote the group's competitive position. 'We are confident that the second half will show some improvement,' he added. He said the price reductions were starting to produce higher volumes, and Shoprite was negotiating better deals with suppliers. It was pressing ahead with plans to open a further 30 stores in the second half. One food retailing analyst suggested the company may have over-reacted and cut gross margins too far. 'They may have shot themselves in the foot by investing too heavily in price,' he said. 'I think this is a probably a wobble rather than a structural thing. But it will take them some time to get their halo back after this.' Net interest payable increased from Pounds 949,000 to Pounds 1.24m, but by mid-July, when further property sales were expected to be completed, overall indebtedness should be reduced to about Pounds 18m, the company said. Earnings per share came out at 3.05p (1.91p) and the interim dividend is held at 0.6p. Shoprite is changing its year end to bring it into line with the calendar year, so the results for 1994 will be for a 14-month period.</p>

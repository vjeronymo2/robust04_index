			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> An early morning fire gutted rock 'n' roll pioneer Chuck Berry's recording  studio in Wentzville, Mo., on Saturday, injuring three firemen and destroying  the studio, "quite a bit" of recently recorded audiotapes and some old  nightclub furniture, officials said. The 7,500-square-foot, concrete-block  studio built in 1959 is one of several buildings on Berry's farm about 30 miles  west of St. Louis. The musician was not home at the time of the blaze.

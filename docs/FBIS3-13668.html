			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible source in the Lebanese Forces has  commented on the statement issued by the General Directorate of  the Internal Security Forces on the arrest of Faris Philip  al-Hajj and Nabil (Krikorian) as follows:    The Lebanese Forces would like to point out the following:    1. Around 150,000 personnel joined the Lebanese Forces  departments between 1977 and 1991, the year the militias were  disbanded. The Lebanese Forces have no proof that the two  suspects joined any of its administrative departments.    2. The Lebanese Forces started to keep records of its  personnel in 1981 but these two names have appeared in none of  the Forces' records. So the Lebanese Forces categorically deny  that the two suspects have been among its members at any time  since 1981.    The Forces strongly condemn the crimes committed by the two,  including plunder, robbery, and assault against a clergyman, and  calls on the Lebanese judiciary to hand down the maximum  punishment on them and on others who commit similar acts, even  Lebanese Forces members. The Lebanese Forces would like to draw  the public's attention to some malicious campaigns that seek to  serve political goals that are known to everybody.</p>

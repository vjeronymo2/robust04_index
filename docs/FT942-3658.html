			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Hume slashes Paisley majority The three sitting MEPs representing the three main strands of political opinion in Northern Ireland have all been returned. The Rev Ian Paisley of the hard-line Democratic Unionist party again topped the poll, taking 29 per cent, or 163,246 of the total vote of 559,864. However, his majority of about 14,000 in the 1989 election was reduced to only 1,250 over Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, who has taken the second of the seats in the three-seat Northern Ireland constituency. The third seat has been taken by Mr Jim Nicholson, of the Ulster Unionist party, with 133,459 votes, or 24 per cent. The province is unique in the UK's polling system in having the only multi-seat constituency and the only one to use proportional representation and the single transferable vote system. There was a 49.4 per cent turnout, half a percen-tage point higher than in 1989. Significantly, Mr Hume and Mr Nicholson, considered to represent moderate viewpoints of nationalism and unionism respectively, have both made modest but notable advances in the level of their support, while that of the extremes has remained static. Support for Mr Hume has gone up by 4 percentage points to 29 per cent of the vote, and that for Mr Nicholson has advanced by 2 percentage points to 24 per cent. Mr Paisley, who chose to run his campaign as a referendum on the Downing Street declaration, calling on unionist opponents of the declaration to vote for the Democratic Unionist party, has seen his overall share of the vote slip marginally - by 1 percentage point. Nonetheless, he claimed yesterday that he had achieved what he set out to do, and has requested an urgent meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has seen its support advance by 1 percentage point to 10 per cent, after a significant effort to get all its supporters out to vote. The result will give a measure of encouragement to ministers of the British and Irish governments, who are due to meet in Dublin this Friday to discuss their next steps in the Northern Ireland peace process, which had been put on hold until after the elections. The two governments say that work on a joint 'framework document', which will propose a series of new political structures for Northern Ireland, is well advanced. It is intended that this document will provide the focus for renewed round-table talks, although the Democratic Unionist party has emphasised it has no intention of returning to the table unless the Downing Street declaration is repudiated by the British government.</p>

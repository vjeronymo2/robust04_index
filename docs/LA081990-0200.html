			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALES FROM THE SCRIPT  </P> <P> There are 3 million stories in the naked city, and most of them are  screenplays. Since the explosion of the spec script market during the past  year, everyone, it seems, has an idea for the next high-concept blockbuster.  Working without a studio contract, veterans and newcomers alike are free to  tell their story their way. Some of them are even lucky enough to sell it.  </P> <P> After the sale of Joe Eszterhas' "Basic Instinct" for $3 million, the Hollywood  buzz virtually broke the sound barrier. Eszterhas, 46, a former reporter for  "Rolling Stone," had written 14 original screenplays, five of them on spec. He  sold them all, but never for anything approaching this record payoff.  </P> <P> "Basic Instinct," like Eszterhas' "Jagged Edge," is the kind of sexy thriller  with two starring roles (Michael Douglas has been cast and rumor has it  Michelle Pfeiffer will sign) that makes producers see dollar signs. The result  was an intense bidding war between two ex-partners, neither of whom were at all  put off by the mediocre box office returns for Eszterhas' previous two scripts  -- "Betrayed" and "Music Box."  </P> <P> Relative unknowns also have taken advantage of the industry's spec script  fever. Peter Filardi, 28, sold his screenplay for "Flatliners" early last year  for $400,000. Not as high as some, but considering that he previously had sold  only a script for an episode of the television series "MacGyver," it was not a  bad deal.  </P> <P> Filardi moved to Los Angeles in 1986, after studying English literature and  film at Boston University, to peddle two scripts he had written for  television's "Miami Vice." While waiting for his big break, he wrote, produced  and directed commercials for Security Shutters, a product hawked on late-night  TV. Without a track record, Filardi thought he had no choice but to write on  spec. Now he wants to keep it that way. "Flatliners," a dramatic thriller about  a group of medical students who experiment with near-death experiences, is the  first of the current barrage of spec scripts to reach the screen, and its box  office performance will be closely watched by industry executives.  </P> <P> Brian Helgeland and Manny Coto already knew how the spec game worked when they  hit paydirt this year. Helgeland had written the screenplay for "976-Evil" and  the fourth installment of "Nightmare on Elm Street." Coto is a graduate of the  American Film Institute and had directed two independent features. They were  both 29 and tired of working in obscurity. Talking on the phone one night, they  decided not to hang up until they had come up with an idea for a million dollar  screenplay. What if a nuclear weapon became sentient? asked Coto. They were  sure they had a can't-miss concept; and so was their agent.  </P> <P> A week before the script was ready to circulate, the agency sent out ticking  clocks to industry executives. "The Ticking Man" generated a bidding war and  was sold for $1 million. (Bruce Willis has been cast, and a spring start is  anticipated.) "With a spec script you can leap-frog up," Helgeland says.  "People know who you are and that's what the game is all about."  </P> <P> Not all spec scripts move as fast as "The Ticking Man." Laurence Dworet, 40,  and Robert Roy Poole, 36, wrote "Ultimatum" in 1980 when, in the shadow of the  Iran hostage crisis, the climate was not right for the tale of a presidential  adviser battling terrorists.  </P> <P> Poole and Dworet had met at UCLA film school and wrote two more scripts  together on assignment but neither was produced. In the meantime, Dworet kept  his job as an emergency room doctor, and Poole adapted a few novels for the  screen. "Ultimatum" was resurrected last year when Poole met a producer at a  poker game who asked if he had any scripts in the closet. Playing off the  interest stirred by "The Hunt for Red October," their agent sent the script out  and sold it for $500,000. Steven Spielberg reportedly is interested in  directing.  </P> <P> Jim Gorman, 29, and Michael Beckner, 26, knew they'd have a hard time pitching  "Texas Lead and Gold" but they wanted to write a western so badly that they  went ahead and did it anyway. Beckner, a fiction writing student at USC, did  most of the writing while Gorman, a graduate of USC's Peter Stark producing  program, became the film's producer. "Texas Lead and Gold," an adventure story  reminiscent of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre," went for $1 million to the first  bidder. "I don't enjoy the spec ride," Beckner says. "I'd rather be writing  than waiting for the phone to ring. We were flattered we got as much as we  did."  </P> <P> David Mickey Evans may have gotten more than he bargained for when he used his  "Radio Flyer" screenplay to leverage an assignment from Columbia Pictures to  direct the film. He was to be paid $600,000 for the script and $500,000 for  directing, but no one was surprised when the 27-year-old virtual unknown was  fired two weeks into the shoot. (Richard Donner has been asked to take over the  directorial reins.)  </P> <P> "Radio Flyer," the story of two young brothers who escape into a fantasy world,  was the first original script Evans had taken to the majors, but he has written  21 screenplays, supporting himself through college and graduate school at  Loyola Marymount University by writing low-budget horror pictures for the  foreign market. Undaunted by the directing debacle, Evans is hard at work on,  you guessed it, another spec script. J.G.  </P></p>

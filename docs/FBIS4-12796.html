			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Robert Fisk in Cairo and Annika </F> Savill in Tunis: "Revealed: Deals at The Heart of Mid East  Peace Plan"]    [Text] After a confidential meeting between United States  officials and Palestinian negotiators in Cairo last week, the  Americans have agreed to furnish the PLO's embryonic police  force with military trucks and heavy Jeep Blazers in an effort  to speed up the deployment of Palestinian security forces in  Gaza and Jericho.    But details of the secret agreements reached between the PLO  and the Israelis, disclosed to the INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY, make  it plain that the two sides have no hope of meeting Wednesday's  Israeli withdrawal deadline -- and that a mass of unresolved  details could still put back the PLO's takeover of Gaza City and  Jericho by weeks.    Israel and the PLO have now agreed that a PLO police force  comprising at least 6,500 men -- and up to a maximum of 9,000 --  will be deployed in the two cities armed with 9,000 Kalashnikov  rifles 100 machine guns, and equipped with Egyptian-made  armoured vehicles.    Between 30,000 and 35,000 family members will return to  Palestine along with the police -- the first substantial  "return" of Palestinians since 1948. A system of three new  "settlers' roads" is to be built in Gaza to allow joint  Israeli-Palestinian patrols to escort settlers to and from  Israel.    A "Joint Security Committee" -- perhaps the most  controversial aspect of the agreements reached so far -- will  hold weekly meetings attended by representatives of the Israeli  and the PLO's intelligence services, officially to prevent the  two sides' security forces shooting at each other.    However, the INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY has learned that, despite  this progress --which also includes provision for 800,000  Palestinians exiled in 1967 and their descendants to return to  Jericho and Gaza -- the Israelis and the PLO have been unable to  resolve a series of serious problems.    In an interview in Tunis this weekend, the PLO leader, Yasir  'Arafat, threatened to withdraw from the peace process  altogether if the Israelis did not stop what he called their  manoeuvring.    "I offered all the flexibility and effort but the other side  is not responding. I left my team in Cairo under orders to  continue but I do not know if the Israelis will come back to  finalise or to manoeuvre," he said of the talks that are to  begin again today.    The two sides have still not agreed on the legal  jurisdiction  each side will have over Palestinians and settlers in the  other's territory and the "safe passage" arrangements for  Palestinians travelling between Jericho and Gaza.    They have failed to devise a court system or agreed rules of  engagement that would allow Palestinian or Israeli security  forces to defend their own citizens. No Palestinians from Syria  or Lebanon are permitted to join the PLO's police, at least in  the first phase of the deployment, and even the exact size of  the PLO's area of control in Jericho -- at present about 57  square kilometres -- has not been settled.    Nor can the advance party of the PLO's police enter Gaza and  Jericho until seven days before Mr 'Arafat and the Israeli prime  minister Yitzhaq Rabin, sign the "interim phase" autonomy  agreement -- a date still so uncertain that Mr Arafat may have  to break his promise to enter his "capital", Jericho, in a  month's time.</p>

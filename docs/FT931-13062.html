			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: Prague Symphony plays Janacek - Concert Though not officially related to the BBC's recent Janacek festival at the Barbican, the Festival Hall performance of his glorious 'Glagolitic' Mass on Sunday came nicely in time. The visiting Prague Symphony brought it, or rather collaborated in it with the London Symphony Chorus (in excellent fettle, strong and precise). The solo singers, however, were all from Eastern Europe; and the solo violinist in the other work, the Brahms concerto, was the Russian Raphael Oleg, who won the Tchaikovsky competition in 1986. Martin Turnovsky, for many cruel years persona non grata with the old Czech regime, is now Chief Conductor of the orchestra. In Brahms, their special quality was immediately plain to hear. Unlike any Western band I can think of, they combine a notably soft-edged attack - not quite emollient, but never, ever pugnacious - with broad, serenely assured rhythm. Conspicuous virtuosity is not their style, but that easy, flexible pulse bespeaks a long tradition of collective musicianship. It was beautifully found in the concerto, which wore a steady pristine glow. The inner orchestral voices carolled sweetly. In this company Oleg's taut, elegant solo line sounded a bit cool and buttoned-up, cultivated player though he is. (I should like to know whose cadenza he used - it was not the standard Joachim one.) Similarly almost any Western performance of the 'Glagolitic', which has become a Western favourite in the last decade or so, would have had more violent fortissimos and more theatrical pianissimos than the Prague reading. Turnovsky secured its contrasts by attentive loyalty to Janacek's instrumental writing, which by 'normal' standards is strange - and for the strings dismayingly scratchy, though the Prague players made it sound natural enough. The trombone utterances were penetrating, not overbearing, and the trumpets never shrieked. Every dramatic point nevertheless registered, without lurid spotlights, and the breadth of the music resounded. Among the soloists, Magdalena Hajossyova wielded a bright individual soprano (a touch of glare toward the top helped her to cut through the band), and the Bulgarian Verdi-tenor Kaludi Kaludov made a smooth fist of his high-lying part without one strangulated squeak: a rare feat. In their briefer roles, the larger-voiced mezzo Marta Benackova and bass Peter Mikulas carried the needed weight with aplomb. It was left to the organist Jan Hora, a Janacek performer of long experience, to disclose the composer's wildest vein in his two solo interludes, which he did with hell-for-leather courage. Old Janacek himself had been an organist; the penultimate number in his secular-pantheist-nationalist 'Mass', a frenetic eruption after the voices have fallen silent, must represent his personal, unassuaged last word. It sounded like that here, sealing the impression of a raw document - beyond conventional piety or solace, but urgently addressed to his modern fellow Czechs: 'What are we here for, what should we do?' The question itself was put too poignantly for any answer to be sufficient.</p>

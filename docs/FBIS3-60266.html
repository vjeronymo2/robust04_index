Bulgaria was granted GEF funds under two regional programmes  for management of the Danubian and Black Sea environment. The  facility helped Bulgaria launch a programme for bio-diversity  conservation and improvement of the protected areas control  system. Bulgaria's joining the GEF will allow for a more active  participation in the facility's management, Minister of  Environment Valentin Bosevski said, commenting on the cabinet's  decision. It was clearly stated that it spells no direct  financial commitments for this country.    In the 1993-94 period, the GEF extended a total of 150,000  U.S. dollars. This figure is expected to reach 4 million U.S.  dollars in 1995-97, which will help implement environmental  projects.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / People: Poole quits policy unit for Sturge chairmanship Lord Poole, 49, a City corporate financier who had been seconded to the prime minister's Downing Street policy unit, has been appointed group chief executive of Sturge Holdings, one of the biggest managers of Lloyd's underwriting agencies. David Poole, who inherited his title last year on the death of his father, Oliver Poole, comes from a family whose City roots go back many generations through the family firm of Thomas Stephens Poole, Lloyd's brokers. The first Lord Poole was a well-known City figure and a leading light in the Conservative party. He was a former chairman of the Conservatives, Lazard Brothers and the Financial Times. Poole's appointment is part of a management reshuffle caused by the planned retirement of David Coleridge, 62, a former chairman of Lloyd's, who has headed Sturge since 1978, and been with the firm for 37 years. Coleridge plans to retire as chairman after next year's annual meeting in February and the board is currently seeking a successor. Sturge has never had a chief executive before and Coleridge said yesterday that he thought it was a mistake to 'hang around as a non-executive chairman' when a new man had been brought in. As one of the biggest underwriting agents at Lloyd's Sturge has been hard hit by the problems of the London insurance market and its profits have collapsed from Pounds 31.5m in 1990 to Pounds 1.2m last year. However, Coleridge is optimistic that the new management could return the firm to its old levels of profitability provided that the insurance market continues to recover. Poole, who was educated at Gordonstoun, Oxford and Insead, has worked at a variety of City firms ranging from Samuel Montagu and Bland Payne to Capel-Cure Myers and James Capel where he had been head of corporate finance. He starts his new job on September 1.</p>

MPs supported the government and agreed  that Hungary should not be affected in any military action, even  indirectly.    "The demonstrative absence mainly serves to reassure  Belgrade, indicating that Hungary wants to avoid even the  semblance of participating in military action," Kovacs said.    He recalled that no parliamentary approval is necessary to  let AWACS patrol in Hungarian airspace, or to ban them: The  government decides on this alone. But parliamentary  authorisation would be needed for NATO to ask that these  aircraft take part in military actions. Kovacs said no such  request has arrived from NATO.    He admitted there was a dilemma in Hungary holding back from  the conflict yet at the same time protecting relations with NATO.</p>

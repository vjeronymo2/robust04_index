			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Rhone-Poulenc dispute over works council representatives RHONE-Poulenc, the French multi-national, is in dispute with its UK unions over selection of representatives for the company's European works council, the consultative body established in 1990. The row, in which the UK unions are being supported by unions in other European Community countries, caused the postponement of the November council meeting. The dispute is being watched carefully by other multi-nationals which are considering introducing European consultative arrangements. The UK unions say the company is insisting on the right to nominate the four UK representatives and is thereby reneging on an agreement with the European Federation of Chemical and General Workers. The company says it is not trying to squeeze out the unions - three out of four of the representatives in 1990 were union officials from UK plants - but wants the right to take its own 'soundings' about who to send. It also wants the more important right to decide from which of its UK plants the representatives should come each year. Mr Fred Higgs, a national secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'The culture in the UK would dictate that the people attending such a forum should be people appointed by the trade unions, otherwise we will have people who speak for no one.' The union believes it has made some concession by agreeing that representatives should be Rhone-Poulenc employees and not full-time union officials. Mr Higgs also says that the union has satisfactory agreements on representation with other French multi-nationals, such as Elf Aquitaine. Mr Bill Morris, the next leader of the TGWU, said last week: 'The rather chequered history of works councils in Britain has left a legacy of suspicion. Works councils have usually been inspired as anti-union manoeuvres in the same way as sweetheart staff associations.' However, he said that such suspicions were being allayed thanks to the positive experience of workers with the new generation of European works councils.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Bullfight star's costly gesture Official proceedings have been started against one of Spain's most successful and glamorous bullfighters - over a bull he did not kill. Jesuln de Ubrique could be fined up to Pta10m (Pounds 50,000) and banned for six months for refusing to deliver the death-blow during a corrida last month in the southeastern town of Albacete. And that, in the strange world of bullfighting, is definitely against the rules. Occasionally a bull that has fought particularly bravely may be spared, at the discretion of the president of the fight. But Jesulin de Ubrique broke all the codes by taking the decision himself. It was his 122nd meeting of the season, breaking a record set by the flamboyant Manuel Benitez, El Cordobes. By allowing his first bull of the afternoon to leave the ring alive, he wanted to make a gesture to his famous predecessor. The bull in question, ironically, was called Executioner. The president of the event, a police official as often happens, took the matter seriously and reported it. The case is now in the hands of the civil governor's office.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mechyslaw </F> Hryb by Aleh Hruzdzilovich; place and date not given:  "Mechyslaw Hryb: `We Should Not Lose Face, Sovereignty'"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Hruzdzilovich] You are one  of the supporters and initiators of introducing a strong  presidential system of power in Belarus. From where do you  derive your confidence? Is it from your disappointment with the  current power system, or from its disability to organize things?  Or, perhaps, as some people state, we are heading toward  dictatorship, and the introduction of the Presidency is the  first, legal step in that direction? Or, perhaps, there are no  reasons to dramatize the situation -- this is simply an option  for the most effective model of government?    [Hryb] I do not know anything about those striving toward  dictatorship; in my opinion, the Presidency will allow us to  create a system of government from the top to the bottom. The  new Constitution is only a foundation for this -- we need a law  on local self-governments as well. By now, nobody is  subordinated to anybody in Belarus. Local soviets are following  their own paths, city soviets -- their own, and so on and so  forth. Their powers must be determined, including their  vertical responsibilities to the president. Without the  controllability of the system, it is impossible to even  establish order, not to mention any movement forward. At one  time, I had a clash with Shushkevich over this very issue. My  attitude toward Stanislaw Shushkevich is good, but I disagree  with him on this issue. In a democratic society, resolutions  are adopted by the majority -- I mean, the parliament. If you do  not want to carry out a resolution by the majority, just make a  statement about your disagreement and retire. What has become  of the issue of collective security? Even though the parliament  adopted a resolution, the speaker did not stop attacking it.  You cannot do this. The system of government cannot work this  way. However, the point is not only in specific people, but  also in the ineffectiveness of the government system, in which  every disputable question, more or less, must be submitted to a  referendum -- on the republican, oblast, rayon, or village  soviet level. This way, we will only be quarreling with each  other, while issues are left unresolved.    [Hruzdzilovich] Regarding the issue of neutrality. In  general, this term is still being used, but it reminds me of  that communism which was to come about... Has neutrality, as a  matter of fact, ceased to be a goal and transformed itself into  a card of the political game?    [Hryb] We do not deny neutrality, but, for the time being,  we do not have it; it is rather doubtful whether we will have it  before the year 2000. Can we have neutrality with 30,000  Russian troops armed with nuclear weapons on Belarusian  territory? We have agreed on the withdrawal of these troops,  and they will be withdrawn; they are already being withdrawn.  By now, however, I think that leaving our Army without the  support of other CIS countries would just disrupt operations and  break it into pieces. The Army will simply cease to exist. We  will be incapable of feeding, dressing, and equipping the Army  with good firearms.    [Hruzdzilovich] Do we need the Army at all, if nobody is  going to attack us?    [Hryb] One must always think of tomorrow. Nobody is going  to attack us today, but you never know what will happen  tomorrow, do you? Yes, we have adopted a military doctrine  which does not envision any specific country as a potential  enemy. However, does that mean that the Army should be  disbanded? No, it does not. Even neutral countries have  armies. Moreover, the concept of neutrality is subject to  change over the course of time. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia  actually do not have their own Armed Forces; these forces will  appear in about 20 years, not earlier... But if the world  shakes, what will we do? How will we defend our sovereignty?  Are we going to be entrapped again by this side or that?  [passage omitted]</p>

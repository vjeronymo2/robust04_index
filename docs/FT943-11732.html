			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS copper heads for West About 60,000 tonnes of copper has built up in stocks in the Commonwealth of Independent States and is now available for export to the west, analysts suggest. However, they say the market should absorb the extra copper relatively easily. Also, as western merchants have been competitively bidding for the metal for some weeks, the present price is probably taking account of the CIS stock overhang. 'Remember the western copper market was in deficit by 200,000 to 250,000 tonnes in the first half of this year. So we should not get too carried away with the bearishness of this issue,' says Mr Peter Hollands of the London-based Bloomsbury Minerals Economics consultancy organisation. A late spring, transport difficulties, and bureaucratic delays in export licensing all contributed to the CIS stock build-up. Mr Hollands suggests that 10,000 to 25,000 tonnes from CIS stock will arrive in the west in August and the monthly total will then settle at about 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes for the rest of 1994. This compares with 15,000 tonnes a month in the first half. Mr Hollands says that the impact on the copper price will depend on how sales of the CIS metal are handled. 'I think that it will be done carefully and will simply slow the rate at which prices rise, or cause them to stabilise for some months. But if too much copper comes too quickly, it could have a severe impact for a month or two.' Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, points out that falls in London Metal Exchange copper stocks have slowed markedly and 'if they start to rise again (because of the CIS shipments) the hot money backing copper will start to look for another home.' He suggests: 'People are begining to recognise that copper's charmed days are nearing their end.' The market will have to cope with a steady and substantial rise in supply until the year 2,000. Demand would have to grow by 5 per cent a year to balance the market whereas a 2.5 per cent growth was more realistic. Mr Moore is forecasting that copper's price will average 95 cents a pound (Dollars 2,094 a tonne) this year and 92 cents (Dollars 2,028) in 1995. That price would not not be low enough to deter planned increases in capacity. Selling by US funds drove copper for delivery in three months on the LME down another Dollars 86 a tonne yesterday to Dollars 2,408.50 (Dollars 1.09 a pound) by the close.</p>

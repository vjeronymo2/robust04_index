			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Kuwait denies Gulf war payments KUWAIT last night dismissed as a fabrication a report that it had paid for political support from western and Arab countries during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, Reuter reports from Kuwait. Finance Minister Nasser Abdulla al-Rodhan said in a statement that an allegation in a report in yesterday's Financial Times was devoid of all truth. 'Kuwait has never resorted to these means at any time, either in the past or at present,' he said. The statement carried by the official Kuwait News Agency said the charge was aimed at tarnishing the country's image and its right to restore its sovereignty following the 1990 Iraqi invasion. 'He (Mr Rodhan) accused parties deeply implicated in financial irregularities of spreading such malicious reports in a futile attempt to clear themselves from the crimes they have committed,' the agency reported. The Financial Times report said former officials of the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) had said Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) missing from the KIO's Spanish operation was used to buy western and Arab support to free Kuwait after Iraq invaded. The report said large sums were alleged to have been used at the United Nations to buy votes which later provided the legal basis for Kuwait's liberation by a multinational force. A coalition of western, Arab and Asian armies drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait in February 1991. Mr Rodhan said the allegations aimed 'at insulting the international will which was unanimous in denouncing the Iraqi invasion and occupation based on respect for international legitimacy and the United Nations charter'.</p>

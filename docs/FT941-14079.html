			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Europeans disappointed as Bundesbank leaves rates unchanged The Bundesbank left its discount and Lombard interest rates unchanged at yesterday's council meeting, disappointing Europe's government bond markets, most of which ended lower on the day. However, Sweden's Riksbank announced a long-awaited quarter-point reduction in its marginal rate, to 7.50 per cent from 7.75 per cent, prompting some profit-taking in the government bond market. The reduction followed the release of favourable inflation figures - the consumer prices index dropped to an annual rate of 4.1 per cent in December from 4.9 per cent in November - and was aided by the strength of the krone. Three-year yields climbed 17 basis points to 6.39 per cent while nine-year yields rose 6 basis points to 6.80 per cent. The Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged - with the discount rate at 5.75 per cent and the Lombard at 6.75 per cent - pushed prices down by about a quarter of a point. 'In theory (the cut) should have been good news for the long end of the bund market, as it shows the Bundesbank is firm about inflation, but that wasn't the actual effect,' said Mr Ifty Islam, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch. While the news on interest rates proved disappointing, reports that the central bank plans to reduce its reserve requirements caused a flurry of excitement in the market. The proposed changes, which take effect from March 1, were at first seen as likely to increase liquidity. However, the Bundesbank added it would compensate for the liquidity effects of the reserve reduction by a reduction in the amount of money available through securities repurchase agreements - a qualification which dampened the bund market's enthusiasm. Hopes of an imminent cut in UK interest rates received a further setback, causing the UK government bond market to lose its recent momentum and short-dated gilts to close lower on the day. The market opened on a firm note, continuing the previous day's strong rally in response to the latest retail sales and inflation figures. However, expectations of a rate cut were dampened by comments from the chancellor of the exchequer and moves by the Bank of England yesterday. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the recovery in the UK economy was strong enough to withstand the tax rises which will take effect in April. He stressed the importance of preserving a steady recovery and keeping inflation down. Meanwhile, the Bank of England sent a clear signal aimed at calming rate cut speculation in its money market operations. Short-dated gilts slipped on the news, but long-dated gilts remained firm on the good inflation background. Japanese government bonds rallied in the wake of recent losses, but the main gains were made by the benchmark 10-year No. 157 bond, rather than in the other maturities, according to dealers. The rally was sparked by rumours that the Bank of Japan would conduct its regular bond buy-back operations more frequently, dealers said. US Treasuries gained ground across the maturity range yesterday after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported that economic activity in the region was moderating. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  13/32 higher at 99 25/32 , with the yield slipping to 6.261 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/8 ahead at 100 3/8 , to yield 4.029 per cent. Before the advance, the market weathered a short-lived bout of selling after the announcement that US housing starts had climbed 6.2 per cent last month, to an annualised rate of 1.54m units, well ahead of a consensus forecast of 1.42m. However, jitters over the pace of economic expansion were quelled later in the morning when the Philadelphia Fed reported that its January index of business activity had fallen to 34.2, compared with 42.4 the previous month. After December's spurt, the market welcomed the suggestion that the economy was now growing at a rate that was less likely to trigger higher inflation and undermine the value of fixed-rate securities. Traders also decided that the Los Angeles earthquake and the severe cold snap gripping the east and mid-west of the country would put a further drag on the economy.</p>

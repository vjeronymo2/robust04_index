			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / GKN defence contract will secure 500 jobs GKN, the UK engineering group, has been awarded one of its biggest export contracts in a deal to supply more than 200 Warrior armoured fighting vehicles to Kuwait. Negotiations are continuing between the UK and Kuwaiti governments for GKN to supply more than 100 Piranha light armoured vehicles. The final combined value of the two contracts would be more than Pounds 500m. The Warrior tracked combat vehicles were battle-tested during the Gulf war and are now deployed by British Army units serving with United Nations forces in Bosnia. The vehicles will be assembled by GKN Defence at its plant at Telford, Shropshire,and are expected to begin production late next year. GKN shares rose yesterday by 4p to 502 1/2 p. The company said the Kuwaiti contract would secure about 500 jobs at Telford for the next four to five years. It will follow completion of the present Ministry of Defence contract for 789 Warrior vehicles. Deliveries of those began in late 1987 and are due to be completed towards the end of next year. For the Kuwaiti contract, GKN has developed the Desert Warrior as a variant of the British Army Warrior used in the Gulf War. The Desert Warrior, demonstrated in trials in Kuwait last year, has a US Delco turret in preference to the gun provided by Royal Ordnance, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, for the British Army vehicle, along with a 25mm Bushmaster cannon and optional Hughes Aircraft TOW anti-tank missile launchers. GKN said yesterday the 'great majority' of components for the Kuwaiti contract would be sourced in the UK. The Warrior vehicle is designed to allow the infantry to keep pace with the main battle tanks and can carry supplies and weapons for a 48-hour battle in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare conditions. GKN said its contract with the UK Ministry of Defence would be signed 'in the very near future'. The deal follows the signing of an initial memorandum of understanding between London and Kuwait on the provision of defence equipment and related services as part of Kuwait's plans to rebuild its armed forces following the Gulf war. The Ministry of Defence said that it hoped the Warrior contract would be 'the first of a number of significant' arms purchases' by Kuwait from the UK. The Piranha wheeled armoured vehicle, the purchase of which is still under negotiation, is assembled by GKN under licence from MOWAG of Switzerland, for which GKN Defence act as system prime contractor for variant design, production and marketing. Kuwait is proposing to spend more than Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) on arms procurement by the end of the decade. But faced with other spending needs, it wants 30 per cent of the value of any defence contract to be reinvested in the country. The MoD said yesterday that 'any such offset deals are a matter for GKN'. The announcement of the contract was a boost for the UK defence industry after a series of disappointments. In February, France beat the US and Britain to supply almost 400 battle tanks to the United Arab Emirates in a deal worth about Dollars 3.5bn. Although it has won an order for about 40 tanks from Oman, Vickers is still fighting to secure a much larger order from Saudi Arabia, which is considering a further purchase of 235 tanks in addition to the 465 M1A2s it is due to receive from General Dynamics. VSEL, which is trying to follow GKN into the Kuwaiti market with its AS90 howitzer, said yesterday that progress towards an order was 'slow'.</p>

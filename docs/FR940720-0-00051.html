Subsequent to the filing of this petition, FDA affirmed, in response to a separate petition (GRASP 6G0077), that lactase enzyme from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> K <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> lactis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  is GRAS for this use (21 CFR 184.1388) (49 FR 47384 at 47387, December 4, 1984). Therefore, this document deals only with the use of cellulose triacetate as an immobilizing agent and with any potential contaminants that might be introduced into food from this use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the information submitted in GRASP 7G0088 allows the agency to conclude that the use of cellulose triacetate as an immobilizing agent is safe, the petition did not establish that the critical data are generally available as required by 21 CFR 170.30(b). Consequently, the agency has evaluated those portions of the petition that relate to cellulose triacetate as a food additive (rather than as a GRAS affirmation) petition and is issuing this decision in accordance with 21 CFR 170.38(c)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Determination of Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause,'' a food additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the evidence establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Delaney anticancer provision of the general safety clause of the act (section 409(c)(3)(A)) further provides that no food additive shall be deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Scott <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FDA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Evaluation of Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requested use of cellulose triacetate is as an immobilizing agent for the enzyme lactase in the production of reduced lactose milk. Cellulose triacetate containing physically entrapped lactase enzyme is added to milk that is to be treated; enzymatic digestion of lactose is allowed to occur; and the immobilizing agent and entrapped enzyme are then quantitatively removed from the treated milk. Data submitted by the petitioner demonstrate that when cellulose triacetate is used as an immobilizing agent, it does not affect the milk in which it is used in any way. The data in the petition also demonstrate that no detectable cellulose triacetate is present in the final product intended for human consumption. Based on these factors, FDA concludes that the ingredient itself is safe under these conditions of use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, has reviewed not only the safety of the additive itself but also the safety of the chemical impurities that may be present in the additive from the manufacturing process. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methylene chloride is used as a solvent in the initial stages of manufacture of cellulose triacetate-immobilized lactase. Subsequent to the use of methylene chloride, the resultant fibers are completely dried to eliminate any remaining volatile contaminants (such as residual methylene chloride). Furthermore, before it is used in food, the product is washed several times to ensure removal of any such residual contaminants. Data submitted by the petitioner demonstrate that methylene chloride could not be detected in the final product immediately prior to its use in food at a detection limit of 0.5 parts per million (ppm). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the agency has used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound risk presented by methylene chloride, a carcinogenic chemical, that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the hypothetical worst-case exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive; and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of hypothetical worst-case human exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to methylene chloride from the proposed use to be 6.0 nanograms per person per day (ng/p/day) (Ref. 1). This estimate is based on the assumption that methylene chloride is present in the additive at its detection limit, although it was not actually detected in any of the samples tested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using risk assessment procedures, FDA used data from the National Toxicology Program report (Ref. 2) of a bioassay on methylene chloride to calculate the potency, or unit risk, from exposure to this chemical (Ref. 3). The results of the bioassay on methylene chloride demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for mice under the conditions of the study. The test material induced benign and malignant neoplasms in both the liver and lung of both sexes when administered by the inhalation route.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also evaluated data from a second study in mice of the same strain as used in the inhalation study. In this study, methylene chloride was administered in the drinking water of the mice (Ref. 4). In this second study, there was no significant increase in the incidence of neoplasms at any site examined. However, assuming that methylene chloride would induce neoplasia at a dose just above the highest level tested in the drinking water study, a maximum potency can be estimated. This estimate is approximately the same as the potency calculated from the data of the inhalation study, providing confidence that using the inhalation study for upper bound risk assessment is not likely to underestimate any potential risk due to ingested methylene chloride (Ref. 3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on a calculated hypothetical worst-case potential exposure of 6.0 ng/p/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from the potential exposure to methylene chloride resulting from the use of cellulose triacetate as an immobilizing agent in the production of reduced lactose milk to be 4.4x10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> -11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , or approximately 4 in 100 billion (Ref. 5). Because there is no evidence to suggest, or any reason to believe, that methylene chloride will be present in the final product at the assumed level, the calculated estimate of the upper-bound limit of risk is likely to be substantially higher than any actual risk. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to methylene chloride that might result from the proposed use of cellulose triacetate as an immobilizing agent in the production of reduced lactose milk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion on Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Having evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material, the agency concludes that the proposed use of the food additive is safe, and that the regulations in &sect;173.357 (21 CFR 173.357) should be amended as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of methylene chloride in the food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) The steps utilized in the manufacture of cellulose triacetate that are intended to remove contaminants such as methylene chloride (drying to completion and washing of the resin to remove volatile and nonvolatile components, respectively, either of which could interfere with the intended enzymatic reaction) are a necessary part of the manufacturing process. Therefore, the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; (2) when the additive is manufactured under these conditions, methylene chloride could not be demonstrated to be present in the additive at a level of detection of 0.5 ppm; and (3) the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity, even when calculated by using several worst-case assumptions, is extremely low, less than 4.4 in 100 billion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Environmental Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  V.

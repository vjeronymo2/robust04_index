			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROBBEN FORD PROVES HE'S UP TO CHALLENGE OF TRIO FORMAT  </P> <P> His reputation as a blues guitarist got him into the Miles Davis band.  Wednesday at the Coach House, Robben Ford showed that despite his jazz  associations -- he also was one of the original Yellowjackets -- he intends to  build his solo career on his blues ability as well.  </P> <P> His last album, 1988's "Talk to Your Daughter" (Warner Bros.), utilized  keyboards and saxophones to add a glossy, more pop-oriented sound to his music,  but Ford has trimmed his performing band down to a trio. The smaller group puts  the focus squarely on the guitarist, and Wednesday night Ford was easily up to  the challenge.  </P> <P> Backed by bassist Roscoe Beck and drummer Tom Brechtlein (who recently has been  heard with Lee Konitz and Charlie Haden as well as in Chick Corea's Akoustic  Band), Ford seemed relaxed and confident during a set of mostly original music  pulled from the album.  </P> <P> The guitarist was clean (apart from a few tuning problems), crisp and  imaginative, constructing coherent solos with narrative qualities rather than  depending on an endless string of hot, impressive licks.  </P> <P> Not that Ford isn't capable of making heated statements. His solo on "Born  Under a Bad Sign" began quietly but terminated in blistering runs and strong,  assertive chording. The wide variety of sounds Ford pulls from his guitar  rivals those of an experienced alley cat: howling, snarling and spitting before  breaking into a warm purr.  </P> <P> Ford's use of shifting dynamics -- something he probably learned from his  former boss, Miles -- was particularly impressive. Loud, assertive themes gave  way to solos that were played at a whisper's pitch. Volume would increase as  improvisation progressed, sometimes returning to quiet understatement, other  times swelling to a roof-raising climax.  </P> <P> Ford sings with the pleasant tones of a choir boy, and his voice succeeds best  during slower, relaxed numbers. He communicates well within a rather narrow  range. But his sound could use some toughness, some sign of the disappointment  and hard times associated with the blues. Not as emphatic with a lyric as  someone like Robert Cray, he makes up for his vocal limitations with those  convincing, hard-edged guitar lines.  </P> <P> He doesn't limit himself to the blues. His own "Help the Poor," a soulful,  steady rocker, featured the Spanish-tinged chords played over a bass line that  recalled Michael Jackson's "Billy Jean." And Ford frequently made reference to  tunes with jazz associations during the performance, moving in and out of  "Surrey With the Fringe on Top" while soloing on "Nothin' but the Blues," and  dropping hints of "Summertime" and Davis' "So What" during his closing  instrumental number.  </P> <P> Brechtlein and Beck provided solid support throughout, the drummer's  on-the-beat toms and driving bass pedal pushing the entire performance. Beck  stuck to the lower ranges of his instrument, adding only an occasional  embellishment and not taking a solo of his own. Both were alert to Ford's  shifts in volume, matching hushed tones with diminished responses, challenging  loud passages with furies of their own.  </P> <P> Even more basic was Juke Logan and Bill Lynch's opening set of classic blues  and rock 'n' roll. Logan's harmonica work (that's him playing on the opening  theme to "Roseanne") is reminiscent at times of Paul Butterfield's, and Lynch  is a capable barroom guitarist.  </P> <P> What the two lack in vocal skills was overcome by their enthusiasm, and their  rough-and-ready style seemed to fit perfectly in the room's roadhouse decor.  </P> <P> Lynch's guitar soloing was especially passionate during "God Bless the Child"  and Logan played melodica during one number, getting a funky squeeze box sound.  Search these two out when you're looking for a good musical time.  </P></p>

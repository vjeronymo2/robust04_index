			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Management: Goose that lays the golden egg - Do you keep your head when all around are losing theirs? Michael Cassell takes a trip to the pantomime Take a thigh-smacking principal boy who happens to be a girl, a balloon-bosomed matron who turns out to be a man, a stage-trained spaniel and a string of sausages and what have you got? - a traditional British pantomime. The challenge of mounting one of the dozens of pantos now showing daily the length and breadth of the country may appear no different from putting on a conventional stage production. But the seasonal task of whipping up a slapstick mix of old chestnuts and oven-fresh farce would certainly test the organisational skills - not to mention the patience - of any corporate manager. Given a sales team (cast) usually entirely unknown to each other, a product (storyline) which changes shape by the hour and an immovable launch deadline (first night), putting on Puss in Boots can be anything but a pantomime. Not surprisingly, some pantophiles insist that, to do the job well, the producer requires an extra-special characteristic. 'I call it certifiable lunacy,' says Sheron French, a part-time teacher who has organised amateur pantos in Birmingham for so long she claims she gave Dan Leno, the famous 19th century dame, his (or was it her?) first break. 'If you can keep your cool, control a mob of budding prima donnas and still please the customers, then I suppose you could run ICI,' she cheerily volunteers. Amateur or professional, the same panto production hurdles have to be jumped and everyone has to complete the course simultaneously. 'We actually had only half a horse one opening night. The caretaker stepped in and didn't put a foot wrong,' French recalls. Impressive logistical skills are required to co-ordinate the roles of performers, technicians and support staff, while the theatrical excesses which threaten to blow a raspberry at the budget have to be curbed. The roll-call of producers' nightmares have included an outbreak of chicken pox on first night, a high-wire act involving a dangerously heavy Peter Pan and any number of incontinent animal acts. Although she has no panto this year - 'don't blame the recession, its because too many people are going away on holiday' - French ridicules the idea that panto is as washed up as Widow Twanky. Its detractors, however, claim that panto is dying on its feet, the victim of three-foot high sophisticates who spurn Basil Brush in favour of Sonic the Hedgehog. Not that pantomime is just for children, with many an adult using youngsters as an alibi for a seat. Pantomime began to emerge as an art form in the early 18th century. Serious theatre was then often mixed with mimed scenes and dances played by characters from the Italian tradition of masked comedy, commedia dell'arte. This developed into full-length harlequinades and, finally, into pantomime, offering hours of knock-about fun and weeks of employment for popular music hall artistes. While many of the elements of British pantomime were originally imported from Europe, it has today become an almost exclusively British affair. No-one knows why it has survived so long, though writers like John Morley - a master of the art with 200 panto scripts under his belt  - attribute its appeal to an ever-changing blend of traditional storylines and contemporary characters capable of remaining relevant in an age of television and pop celebrity. Amateur panto appears to be in rude good health. Audiences can run into several thousand for the most ambitious productions, which might cost several thousand pounds to put on. Charities are usually the beneficiaries of any profits. The total absence this Christmas of panto in London's West End is being cited as supporting evidence by those who say its days are numbered. But within booing and hissing distance of theatreland, avid panto fans can find Dick Whittington, Aladdin, Peter Pan, Cinderella and Jack and the Beanstalk. This season, promoter Paul Elliott reckons that up to 1m children will watch the 20 pantomimes he is staging around the country, like Aladdin at the Birmingham Hippodrome. Commercial pantomime is no laughing matter. It can offer its stars (nowadays heavily drawn from television and the world of sport) very high pay - maybe thousands of pounds a week  - for two shows a day, six days a week. A big show can cost well over Pounds 500,000 for an eight-week run, half meeting cast costs and the balance going on other production overheads. But can pantomime continue to survive in a world less readily entertained by awful puns and hammy one-liners? They will certainly have to compete increasingly with a new breed of family shows offering children and adults a more thoughtful evening out. Clarion Productions, formed by James Woods and Justin Savage and run from their homes in London, has already staged two successful West End productions offering a taste of what is to come. Their current show, 'The Witches' at the Duke of York's, attracted big opening advances and has a larger budget than the average West End show. Adapted from a Roald Dahl story, it is imaginative kids' stuff out of the non-panto stable. David Wood, the producer, believes that traditional pantomime is no longer in tune with what modern families want: 'It is essential that we recognise that children are our most important audience and deserve the best we can give them. 'If we bore, under-estimate or patronise them, we will have only ourselves to blame if, in the future, live theatre withers and dies.' So is pantomime all washed up or not? Altogether now: 'Oh yes it is]' - 'Oh no it isn't]'.</p>

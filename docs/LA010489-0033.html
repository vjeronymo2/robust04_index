			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTO INSURANCE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I quote Tenner's column:  </P> <P> " . . . The tort system under attack for some time, deserves meaningful  support. In a civilized society, persons and companies should be held  accountable for their conduct. If such conduct is negligent or otherwise  improper, the injured person should be made whole for all damages by the party  that caused the damage and injury."  </P> <P> Contrary to this statement, the injured person is paid by the insurance  company. Not the party that caused the damage and injury. And the insurance  company recovers its tort losses from you and me in the form of higher  premiums.  </P> <P> IRVING L.

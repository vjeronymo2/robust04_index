			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / Economic growth in Britain forecast for this year The economy will enjoy robust growth and low inflation this year and the government has no pressing need either to cut or raise interest rates, according to an independent panel of forecasters using the Treasury's computer model of the economy. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club said its latest 'central forecast' predicts both growth and inflation will average 2.75 per cent this year and that unemployment will continue to fall from 2.76m in February to 2.6m in the final quarter of 1994 and, ultimately, to 2.24m in mid-1997. The Item Club said fears on financial markets of an imminent rise in interest rates 'are unfounded'. It suggested the government might make a 'token cut' in bank base rates to 5 per cent from 5.25 per cent in response to the tax increases. Inflation has little upward momentum at present, the Item Club said. However, it forecasts a rise in the annual rate of retail price inflation to a peak of 4.7 per cent early in 1996, with underlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest payments, rising to 4.4 per cent at the same time. It expects short-term interest rates will rise to 5.5 per cent in the second half of next year as underlying inflation exceeds the government's 4 per cent target ceiling.</p>

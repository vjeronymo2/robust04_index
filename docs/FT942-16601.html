			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Israeli police seek to expel Palestinians Israeli police were yesterday searching for Palestinians in an effort to expel from the Jewish state workers from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip after threats by Arab extremists. Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, said his forces were carrying out an intensive campaign 'in what is called cleansing the area of residents of the territories who stay in Israel without permits'. His comments came after an emergency session of the inner security cabinet met in Tel Aviv to discuss security measures in the run up to independence day celebrations on Thursday, which Islamic guerrillas have vowed to turn into a 'day of hell'. Israel sealed off the territories last Thursday night after two attacks in 24 hours by Islamic extremists left eight Israelis dead. Palestinians are barred indefinitely from travelling from the territories to Israel proper and to Arab East Jerusalem. Mr Uri Dromi, a government spokesman, said the cabinet was taking threats by the Islamic Hamas movement seriously, particularly its pledge to attack Israelis on independence days when tens of thousands of Jews are on the roads. The cabinet also decided to increase the number of work permits available for foreign workers, continuing the process under which Israel has been substituting Palestinian workers for foreigners. Until the latest closure, up to 70,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza were working in Israel. Mr Hussein al-Sheikh, a Palestinian leader in the West Bank, criticised the Israel clampdown on all Palestinians. 'This is part of a collective punishment,' he said. In Hebron, which is still under military control since the February 25 massacre of 29 Palestinians by a Jewish settler, soldiers shot and wounded at least 25 Arabs during a private peace mission by the Rev Jesse Jackson, the US civil rights leader.</p>

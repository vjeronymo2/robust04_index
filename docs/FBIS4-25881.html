			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary on Hong Kong Affairs" column by Jiang Haizong </F> (3068 3189 1350): "Stability Is What the Young People Want"]    [Text] Hong Kong and mainland youth organizations recently  conducted sample surveys of Hong Kong, Beijing, and Guangdong  youths. The results of the surveys indicate that young people  in these three regions put "social stability" in first place and  a "perfect legal system" in second place. Young people are the  most lively factor in society. They regard "social stability"  as the first condition for their living environment. This fully  suggests that social stability has become the main trend in the  current mainland and Hong Kong societies. This general trend is  what the young people wish to have.  <H5>  Economic Prosperity Cannot Be Separated From Social Stability </H5>   A host of facts, ancient and modern, suggest that the  prosperity and development of a country or region are closely  related to its social stability. Without social stability, the  economy will not prosper. Everyone has deep feelings about the  positive and negative experiences in mainland reform and this is  the same with Hong Kong's situation. Since the end of the war,  Hong Kong has relied on its prolonged social stability in  becoming an international financial, economic, trade, shipping,  and tourist center, thus forming an effective operational  mechanism. Social stability is an important factor.    Deng Xiaoping repeatedly stressed that stability must  override everything else. During a recent meeting with  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, Jiang Zemin pointed out:  "Over the last five years, our persistent efforts in  maintaining stability and taking this as a matter of priority  importance have resulted in China's economic development, social  tranquility, and improvement in the people's lives. Facts have  proved that this practice is absolutely correct." Being a  country with 1.2 billion people, whether or not China remains  stable has a global bearing. If an unbridled turmoil occurs,  the country splits, war breaks out and spreads, and large  numbers of refugees swarm out of the country seriously affect  the tranquility of the countries and regions around China. In  such cases, Hong Kong would be the first to suffer and the  consequences would be disastrous. Therefore, China's stability  is not for the sake of China's development alone but also  benefits the stability and prosperity of Asia and the rest of  the world. Facts prove that China's stability and development  over the last 10 years have benefitted not only the Chinese  people but also world peace and development.    The Chinese Government takes into account much of the  mainland's stability and accounts for Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity. When China and Britain were holding talks on Hong  Kong's future, the Chinese Government proposed safeguarding and  preserving Hong Kong's social stability and economic prosperity  and regarded this as an important objective. It was included in  the Sino-British Joint Declaration. For this reason, the  Chinese Government formulated the policy of one country, two  systems, along with other basic principles, openly committing  itself to maintain Hong Kong's social and economic system in  such a way that it will remain unchanged for 50 years. All this  has been confirmed in the Basic Law in accordance with the  policy of one country, two systems. In the 10- year  transitional period since China and Britain signed the Joint  Declaration, the Chinese side has always abided by this  principle stand in cooperating with the British side in handling  all Hong Kong affairs. We believe this is known to all Hong  Kong people and the international community. Although the  British side has not kept its promises and has ruined  Sino-British cooperation over the constitutional system, the  Chinese side is still willing to cooperate with the British side  on economic matters and the people's lives and materialize into  a steady transition. This is the most convincing proof.  <H5>  Hong Kong's Survival and Prosperity Are Closely Connected </H5> With the Mainland's Stability    In the past, some people described Hong Kong as the goose  which laid the "golden eggs". Since the mainland introduced  reform and opening up, Hong Kong has played a role in promoting  the mainland's economic development.    But, as former British Foreign Minister Howe said in the  British Parliament in December 1984: "In the greater part of  the previous months, Hong Kong's survival has relied on  cooperation provided by the Chinese side". This is a fact. The  Chinese Government has for long kept a positive attitude on  affairs beneficial to Hong Kong's social stability, the people's  lives and economic development. Therefore, the Chinese  Government has always insisted that Hong Kong must not become a  base for sabotaging or undermining China, nor does it allow the  mainland to affect Hong Kong's stability. When a turmoil  occurred on the mainland during the "Great Cultural Revolution",  Premier Zhou Enlai personally prohibited the Red Guards from  entering Hong Kong. The mainland has always provided close  cooperation and support in curbing all crimes, stopping  smugglers, reducing the effects of stock crashes, delivering  consumer goods and nonstaple food, and resolving water shortages.    Frequent economic exchanges between the mainland and Hong  Kong constitutes a huge momentum for Hong Kong's sustained  prosperity and the mainland's stable development since the  introduction of reform and opening up serves as an important  guarantee for Hong Kong's sustained prosperity. It is exactly  because of this that economic prosperity has prevailed on the  mainland and in Hong Kong at a time when economic depression is  sweeping the entire Western world. Obviously, whether or not  the mainland remains stable has become an important factor  affecting Hong Kong's economy, social stability, and its  people's lives. The mainland's stability promoting Hong Kong's  prosperity has become the Hong Kong people's common  understanding.    The preservation of the mainland's stability and Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability correspond with each other. We  believe all people without prejudice understand that: Without  stability on the mainland, Hong Kong could not have achieved its  current prosperity and stability; any obstacle to the mainland's  stability could be as bad as ruining Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability.    The mainland's stability include the following two aspects:  "One is stability in the political situation and the other is  stability in policies". Deng Xiaoping pointed out: Apart from  maintaining the stability of the reform and opening up policy,  there must not be any change in adhering to the four cardinal  principles, in adhering to the socialist system, and in adhering  to the Communist Party leadership; these two "no changes"  constitute the main factors for the mainland's stability. The  mainland's socialist system is the main component of the policy  of one country, two systems; only with the existence of this  main component can other components exist. Without the skin,  where can the hair grow? "Just imagine, if the socialist system  changes in China, if the socialist system with Chinese  characteristics under the leadership of the CPC changes, what  will become of Hong Kong? Hong Kong's prosperity and stability  could fall through." (Deng Xiaoping's remarks)    Coincidentally, some foreign politicians hold similar views  to Deng Xiaoping. Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew  has always thought that Hong Kong's role lies in its economic  value and objects to Hong Kong's confrontation with the  mainland. Hong Kong is small and the mainland is powerful; in  politics, it absolutely cannot confront the mainland, he said  adding, "Should the CPC crumble, China would crumble; then there  could be 30 to 40 years of chaos in China". During a recent  visit to Hong Kong, Howe openly said, "Hong Kong must not be  turned into a bridgehead for changing China. To attempt this  would be extremely unwise. Hong Kong cannot change China and  must not think it can change China; any attempt could only  result in Hong Kong's devastation." During a debate in the  British House of Lords not long ago, two former Hong Kong  governors also mentioned issues concerning Hong Kong. MacLehose  said, "The prospects of Hong Kong and China's economies thriving  serve as the pillar supporting people's confidence. They are  actually going smoothly. I hope political factors will not  become interference in sight of this prosperity". David Wilson  pointed out, "At this moment, it is quite important to prevent a  human-made split in Hong Kong society because, whatever it may  be, it will finally involve the entire interests of Hong Kong  and Hong Kong people". They both sincerely advised Hong Kong  people not to confront the mainland or change the mainland's  system because they had looked wisely at the facts and fully  understood that any perverse move could have serious  consequences.    As a matter of fact, many Hong Kong people fully understand  this principle and that it will not do to change the mainland's  system. Several days ago, an editorial by Hong Kong's  CHING CHI JIH PAO [Economic Times] pointed out: "Hong  Kong should not and cannot become a bridgehead for changing the  mainland's system because it is not equipped with the necessary  conditions; this is beyond its ability, so to speak. Second,  this attempt could distort the policy of one country, two  systems, and Hong Kong would suffer a lot. Third, this would  deviate from Hong Kong's political reality and go against  popular will. In terms of its geographical location and  economic background, Hong Kong is closely related to changes in  China's situation; how the situation in China changes will  affect Hong Kong, but Hong Kong can only affect China  economically and is absolutely not in a position to change  China's politics". The editorial made these comments out of  profound knowledge about China's and Hong Kong's situations.    In preserving the mainland's stability, there is a need to  respect its socialist system and affairs. This is the meaning  of adhering to the policy of "one country, two systems". The  mainland's and Hong Kong's stability must be treasured, with  mutual noninterference in each other's internal affairs but by  maintaining good-neighborly relations, promoting each other, and  making common development. Sabotage activities against the  mainland must be opposed, the mainland's stability must be  preserved, dialogue and cooperation with the mainland must be  strengthened, mutual promotion must be upheld, and common  development must be encouraged. This is Hong Kong's best choice  for the present and future.  <H5>  The British Side Has Caused Unrest in Hong Kong Society </H5>   The purpose of the Chinese Government in formulating the  policy of "one country, two systems" in signing the Joint  Declaration, and in carrying out cooperation with the British  side is to ensure Hong Kong's steady transition and its  prolonged stability and prosperity. But the signing of the  Joint Declaration does not mean that we can relax our efforts in  maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Deng Xiaoping  pointed out in 1982 that some people would create confusion  during Hong Kong's transitional period and "these include not  only foreigners but also Chinese, but mainly Englishmen". Later  developments, particularly developments in the latter half of  the transitional period, have proved that what Deng Xiaoping  said was unfortunately, correct.    In the first half of the transitional period, there was  cooperation between China and Britain. In the latter half, the  British side has not strengthened cooperation with the Chinese  side, as required by the Joint Declaration; instead, it has  substituted confrontation for cooperation, completely reneged on  the Joint Declaration, in a brazen attempt to fish for what it  could not get at the negotiating table and at the expense of  Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.    On the  constitutional system, the British side has acted against the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Basic Law's convergence  principle, and the understandings and agreements reached between  the two countries; it has intentionally undermined the talks on  the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements, and unilaterally  proceeded with what it wishes to do, thus dismantling the rail  of the "through train" for a steady constitutional transition.  On the legal system, the British side has speeded up the  amendments of regulations and legislation and constantly put  obstacles in the way of implementing the Basic Law; it has  dished out a "Bill of Rights", which even Britain itself does  not have, to make the Basic Law impracticable; it has  disregarded judicial convergence, violated both sides'  agreements, repeatedly delayed the establishment of the court of  final appeal, and amended the New Territories Land Exemption  Bill under the pretext of fake "gender equality", all aimed at  casting aside the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration.    Recently it advocated the establishment of a so-called  "human  rights commission" in an attempt to form an adjudication  institution which overrides the independent judicial system and  destroys the future special administrative region's [SAR]  independent judiciary. In the economic field, it has refused to  carry out the overall financial arrangements which conform with  the Memorandum of Understanding on the new airport's  construction, real estate prices are soaring, and no one cares  about coordinating transportation between Hong Kong and  Shenzhen. All these are related to the British side's efforts  in accumulating wealth by unfair means, in leaving a financial  burden for the SAR, and in leaving unstable factors in Hong  Kong's economy. On the question of government functionaries,  the British side has refused to cooperate with the Chinese side  and does not allow Hong Kong Government functionaries to contact  the Preparatory Working Committee; in addition, it has  ceaselessly talked about its readiness to consult with the  Chinese side on the transition of Hong Kong senior public  servants and its willingness to expedite the arrangements for  the formation of public servants, in an attempt to deprive the  future SAR chief executive and the central authorities of their  powers.    The British side has spared no expense in undermining Hong  Kong's social stability and steady transition because, as a  British Parliamentary report acknowledged, Britain has changed  its policy toward China and Hong Kong. The basis of this change  is, obviously, its wish for the downfall of the Chinese  Government before 1997 and for Chinese local regimes' separation  from the central government. In the final analysis, it wishes  for disintegration and an unchangeable difficult situation in  China. By then, China will be too busy to consider Hong Kong  affairs and Britain will continue its administration of Hong  Kong. At the very least, it wants its colonial influence to  continue for a long time so that it can protect its colonialist  interests. It is now the 1990's but these people's minds still  remain in the previous century. So, it is correct to say that  it is easy to change mountains and rivers but hard to change a  person's character.  <H5>  Those Who Undermine Social Stability Must Not Be Tolerated </H5>   Apart from provoking trouble, causing confusion, and  undermining stability under the pretext of "democracy",  "freedom","equality" and "human rights" the British Hong Kong  Government has also encouraged some political forces to  constantly make trouble. Leaders of some organizations in Hong  Kong are trying to overthrow the Chinese Government and change  the mainland's socialist system. They constitute a force  undermining Hong Kong's stability. They have excluded  themselves from the Chinese people and are following foreign  anti-China forces, advocating sanctions against China, and  obstructing China's progress and development. They are opposed  to anything favorable to China and are creating farces under the  pretext of freedom of speech. If anything happens on the  mainland, they take advantage of this opportunity to lead the  citizens astray, instigate their sentiments against the  mainland, and sow dissension between Hong Kong and the mainland.    As time goes by, the mainland has become increasingly stable  and developed and the relations between Hong Kong and the  mainland have become more extensive and close. Their attempt to  undermine the mainland's stability and ruin Hong Kong's  prosperity is clearly seen through by more and more Hong Kong  people, their practice has enjoyed less popular support, and  they have landed themselves in isolation from others. The Hong  Kong people have gradually come to understand that if these  people succeed in their attempt, not only will the mainland's  stability and development be ruined, Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity will also be destroyed. What these people have done  does not enjoy popular support at all. They are trying by every  possible means to carry out one activity today and another  activity tomorrow but their efforts will come to naught.    To preserve Hong Kong's stability, the harmonious relations  between Hong Kong and the mainland and the mainland's stability,  Hong Kong citizens have reason to ask the British Hong Kong  Government to strictly fulfill its commitment to "not allow Hong  Kong to be turned into a base for hostile activities". If Hong  Kong's stability and the harmonious relations between Hong Kong  and the mainland are ruined because of the British Hong Kong  Government's tolerance and support for the abovementioned  activities, the British Hong Kong Government must be held  responsible for the consequences in history. Social stability  is what the people wish. All people who love the country and  Hong Kong and hope for the smooth implementation of the policy  of "one country, two systems" should favor the mainland's  stability and development and take preserving Hong Kong's  stability and prosperity as their glorious duty. As long as all  the descendants of Emperor Huangdi including the mainland and  Hong Kong people strive for the invigoration of the Chinese  nation while preserving the different social systems, the day is  not far off when China will stand in the ranks of the strong  nations of the world with its people working and living in peace  and contentment and becoming healthier and better off.</p>

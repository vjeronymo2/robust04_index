			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN, IRAN TO END PARTNERSHIP ON CHEMICAL PROJECT  </P> <P> Japan's giant trading company and Iran have reached a basic accord to end their  partnership for a long-stalled multibillion-dollar joint petrochemical project  in southern Iran, the Japanese partner reported Monday.  </P> <P> Mitsui &amp; Co. said the agreement was contained in a joint communique issued  Sunday in Tehran by Koichiro Ejiri, president of Mitsui, and Ahmad Rahgozar,  president of the Iranian National Petrochemical Co.  </P> <P> Ejiri estimated the amount of compensation to be paid by the Mitsui Group at  between $857 million (120 billion yen) and $929 million (130 billion yen), the  reports said.  </P> <P> Ejiri was in Tehran to negotiate with Rahgozar on terms for Mitsui to withdraw  from the project, which had been stalled by the protracted Iran-Iraq war. A  cease-fire was negotiated in August, 1988.  </P> <P> "The agreement confirmed both sides will dissolve the partnership," a spokesman  for the Japanese trading company said. "The agreement has yet to be signed  formally."  </P> <P> The official said the accord calls for the Mitsui Group to pay compensation for  its withdrawal from the project, but he declined to give any figures.  </P></p>

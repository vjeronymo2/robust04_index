			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / North Sea oil industry adapts to shifting tides: David Lascelles on how low prices and the Piper Alpha disaster have led companies to change strategy THE handsome granite homes of Aberdeen with their well-tended gardens suggest that Europe's oil capital remains prosperous. Yet there are signs of anxiety in the large industrial estates which house the UK's offshore oil industry. The combination of a weak oil price and plenty of spare capacity in drilling and contracting has led to belt-tightening and close questioning of the industry's prospects. In addition, changes recommended in the Cullen Report on North Sea safety, following the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster in which 167 workers died, will add substantially to the industry's costs. Mr Norman Chambers, chief executive of Rockwater, one of the leading underwater engineering contractors, predicts that demand in his sector of the North Sea services industry will begin to tail off next year, the exact rate depending on the oil price. 'The whole contracting and fabricating industry must downsize,' he warns. 'We're bullish for our own company, but we've got to be realistic about it.' His views are echoed by Mr Gavin Strachan, marketing and contracts manager of Atlantic Drilling, an independent drilling contractor. He points out that at present rigs are used to 78 per cent capacity, compared with more than 90 per cent needed to sustain a healthy market. This has caused daily charge rates to drop by half to about Pounds 12,000. 'Last year, for the first time, there were more rigs available in the North Sea than in the Gulf of Mexico,' he says. Operators blame the softening of the market - at the moment it is nothing more dramatic than that - on two things: the low oil price which is blunting incentive to explore, and the widespread feeling that all the big North Sea finds have been made. The fact that most current developments are much smaller than in the glory days of the 1970s and early 1980s also makes them much easier for operators to stop and start, adding uncertainty to the market. The industry had made improvements ahead of the Cullen recommendations, but the new rules, to be phased in from the end of this year, will add a further burden. The safety modifications might cost an average of Pounds 1m a rig, says Mr John Archibald, Atlantic's deputy general manager. The outlook is not totally gloomy, however. A fresh round of exploration licences has been announced, including 'frontier regions' - areas of the North Sea and its western approaches that have not yet been explored. The softening of the market has also encouraged the offshore contracting industry to think afresh about its long-term future. The oil and gas group of Scottish Enterprise, the state-funded development body, has decided that the time has come for 'a long-term reorientation of the industry from the diminishing home market to international markets'. Last month Mr Crawford Beveridge, SE's chief executive, announced plans for an export drive aimed at doubling overseas sales by 1996, equivalent to growth of about Pounds 100m in 1990 money. 'Expansion of our indigenous oil and gas companies will only ultimately be generated via internationalisation,' he says. One element of this drive will be the establishment of a sales office in Moscow, where SE sees opportunities for Scottish industry to help develop the oil and gas industry in the former Soviet republics. About Pounds 25m has been earmarked for the office, spread over several years. Aberdeen is also the home of a new International Drilling and Downhole Technology Centre where oil companies can test offshore equipment on a real-life rig, but in the safer and cheaper surroundings of dry land. Dr David Curry, managing director, says: 'We shall be developing technology which can be exported when the oil runs down.' However, individual companies will have to adjust to tougher conditions in the meantime. Mr Chambers of Rockwater predicts that contracting companies will have to share more of the risk with the oil companies in order to win business. In certain cases the company is prepared to forego the traditional client relationship in favour of forming partnerships with oil exploration companies. Rockwater will do contracting work at cost, and take its profit in the form of a share of the royalties. Last week two Glasgow companies, Kvaerner H&amp;G and UIE, entered into similar arrangements with British Petroleum to develop the Hyde gas field. BP said partnerships 'are certainly something we are looking at'. For companies like Atlantic, hope in the future is grounded partly in controlling costs and partly in the belief that oil companies will be forced to step up their search for oil. 'Why do we remain in the drilling business?', asks Mr Strachan. The answer lies in figures which show that available oil reserves are being run down, but that the exploration potential is still huge. 'The long-term strength of the business is that we're going to have to find lots more oil,' he says.</p>

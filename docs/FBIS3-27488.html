These targets include completely restructuring and  optimizing the overall layout of overseas investment by the end  of this century to establish an initial network of overseas  enterprises that cover the major markets of the six continents,  are based on complementary economies, are of a fairly large  scale, and have substantial strength and their own  characteristics; to gradually transform the existing overseas  enterprises into conglomerations or shareholding enterprises on  the premise of voluntary participation and mutual benefits and  turn them into modern enterprises developing diverse business  while emphasizing a major trade; and to continuously expand the  channels of foreign economic relations and trade, transmit, and  exchange the information on the markets at home and abroad; and  expand the economic strength and the scale to serve  Heilongjiang's development of an open economy.    Since 1984 when Heilongjiang established its first overseas  enterprise in Hong Kong, the province had established 450  various types of enterprises overseas by the end of 1993, thus  enabling its export commodities to enjoy a long and stable share  in the world market and to promote the implementation of the  strategy of diversifying the market. Due to a lack of  understanding and overall guidance, however, the overseas  enterprises have yet to fully develop their role. In view of  this, Wang Zongzhang pointed out: To attain the medium- and  long-term targets of overseas investment, the investment to be  made overseas in the near future should be rearranged and  distributed in a rational way and group companies or outlets  with substantial strength should be established. In the next  two to three years, about 10 large group companies should be  established to develop transnational business and gradually  achieve internationalization in business. The group companies  established in developed countries should focus on imports of  funds, technology, equipment, and modern managerial expertise  and mastery of the trends in the international market and the  world economy to provide favorable conditions for Heilongjiang  to optimize the mix and the quality of its export commodities  and achieve a larger share in the world market. The group  companies established in developing countries should focus on  the sectors that these countries and Heilongjiang can use to  supplement and suit each other to expand the channels for the  sales of Heilongjiang's export commodities. Enterprises  established overseas should be integrated with the international  practice and establish a managerial mechanism that meets the  need of the modern market economy. Shareholding companies  should be established on the basis of voluntary participation  and mutual benefits. They should not only encourage the  existing overseas enterprises to buy shares but also absorb the  domestic and foreign funds, as well as the funds from in and  outside the province. The enterprises established overseas  should diversify their business while emphasizing a major trade.  Guided by the demand of the international market and relying on  Heilongjiang's advantages in resources, industries, and  geographical position, they should develop production, trade,  banking, technology, and service businesses to gradually become  large multi-purpose industrial groups. Meanwhile, they should  build bonded warehouses in the key areas of international  transportation, as long as they are economical and convenient  and help promote sales.</p>

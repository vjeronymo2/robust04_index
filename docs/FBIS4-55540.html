			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Against Attacks on the Independence </F> of the Mass Media"]    [Text] The Association of Slovak Journalists [ZSN], which  represents 700 members, is alarmed at the current situation, in  which the democracy and plurality of the mass media in Slovakia  are endangered. Despite the constitutional guarantees of the  freedom of the press and speech and the law on the independence  and impartiality of Slovak Television [STV], the decision  adopted by the coalition deputies to recall the STV Council is a  gross violation of these legal guarantees. The ZSN points out  to our and the world public that the current parliamentary and  government practice of implementing the party principle is  threatening the independence of the mass media. The coalition  political parties, which have a majority in parliament, are, by  their conduct, ignoring the Charter on Human Rights and Freedoms  and the Council of Europe resolutions concerning the mass media,  especially Resolution No. 428/1970 on the mass media and human  rights, which emphasizes the media's independence of political  supervision, and Council of Europe Recommendation No. 1147/1993  concerning the responsibility of parliaments for the democratic  reform of radio and television broadcasting in the countries of  Central Europe. We are alarmed by the silence of the democratic  press in Western countries over the totalization of political  life in Slovakia, the practices of political purges, and the  regression to communist normalization by the former entities of  the communist party that are today operating within groupings  throughout the political spectrum of the coalition. The ZSN  appeals to the entire Slovak journalistic community and to  professional journalistic organizations at home and abroad for  professional solidarity in defending professional and civil  rights.  <H5>  From the Point of View of the Slovak National Party: Who </H5> Will Be Next?    The Slovak National Party [SNS] states that the recall of a  substantial part of the Slovak Television Council was carried  out on the basis of unconfirmed speculation and unverified  documents. It is more than certain that the main reason for the  recall is the feeling of a lack of control over STV on the part  of the provisional government coalition because the council had  been nominated by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the  SNS, although none of its members were members of any party or  movement. This was not a matter-of-fact issue, but a purely  political decision. This is also borne out by the fact that the  coalition's representative, when presenting the proposal for the  recall, used an argument that turned out to be erroneous in  relation to the materials the National Council of the Slovak  Republic [NR SR] deputies had at their disposal--that is, on the  issue of the STV Council's Statute. The ruling coalition did  not make even the slightest attempt to find a real reason for  recalling the STV Council; the vote was held immediately. The  SNS feels that what happened in the NR SR during the recall of  the STV Council can only be described as a display of arrogance  by the current ruling authority and the ruling coalition  grouping in parliament. It is necessary to ask once again what  or who will be next.</p>

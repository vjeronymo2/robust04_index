Garcia Laguardia called on the masterminds of the terrorist  attacks to refrain from such practices and to seek other means  of solving problems. He also indicated that actions such as  these endanger the lives of innocent people who are not  responsible for the problems.    The attorney general was referring specifically to the  explosion in front of Channel 7 this past Tuesday, the one  between 18th Street and 6th Avenue the day before yesterday, and  the one in front of the National Congress building early  yesterday morning. Garcia also stated that other explosive  devices had been deactivated throughout the city.    Garcia Laguardia said that those who intend to destabilize  the democratic system through terrorism and anarchy should  reconsider because their attitude is not good for Guatemalans;  on the contrary, it only endangers the lives of others.</p>

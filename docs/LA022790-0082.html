			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNOCAL WILL SPEND MORE OVERSEAS ON EXPLORATION  </P> <P> Unocal Corp. said Monday that this year, for the first time in company history,  it will spend more for expenses of foreign exploration for energy resources  than it does for exploration in the United States.  </P> <P> Expenses for foreign exploration of petroleum and geothermal energy will  increase to $111 million in 1990 from $76 million in 1989, the company said.  U.S. expenses will increase less dramatically, to $106 million from $92  million.  </P> <P> The reversal reflects an industrywide trend toward overseas exploration because  of lower costs and less stringent environmental regulations, said M. Craig  Schwerdt, an industry analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Unocal's foreign energy exploration and production will be concentrated in  Thailand, Indonesia, the Netherlands and Ecuador, the company said.  </P> <P> Overall, Los Angeles-based Unocal said it would boost capital and exploration  spending to $1.5 billion in 1990, a 22% increase over 1989's $1.2 billion.  </P> <P> "The increased investment level reflects the company's improved cash flow and  strategy of investing in projects which offer improved returns," said Unocal  Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier in a statement.  </P> <P> The capital budget in 1990 would be $1.27 billion, up from $1.05 billion in  1989. That would include domestic capital expenditures of $858 million and  foreign capital expenditures of $413 million in 1990.  </P> <P> Under that, capital spending for domestic petroleum exploration and production  will amount to $424 million in 1990. Capital spending for foreign petroleum  exploration and production, including Canada, will be $370 million.  </P> <P> In refining, marketing and transportation, Unocal plans capital expenditures of  $220 million in 1990, up from $143 million a year ago. The money will go to  build new equipment at its Los Angeles refinery and to improve its service  station and truck stop system.  </P></p>

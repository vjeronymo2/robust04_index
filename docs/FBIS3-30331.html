			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Georgi Asyov commentary: "The Best Physical Condition"] </F>   [Text] What the hell can the Union of Democratic Forces  [SDS] gain from its latest no-confidence motion, considering  that the cabinet might stumble over a negative vote on the  budget anyway?    The practice of putting forward "no-confidence votes" is by  no means the result of a long-term, well-considered strategy.  Regardless of the increasing "Bolshevization" within the SDS,  the Union has not yet reached the discipline of semi-democratic  centralism characteristic of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  [BSP]. Hence, the decisions of the SDS are usually the results  of momentary balances of forces within the coalition, of  opportunistic considerations, or even of mere coincidences.    The two gentlemen Filip Dimitrov and Edvin Sugarev are the  most influential SDS leaders today, and it is they who introduce  these no-confidence votes (not that this means that the cabinet  deserves any confidence, as a matter of fact). "Well, let us  move another no-confidence vote; perhaps we can overthrow the  government some day or other after all!" -- this is the  unexpressed motive behind their "strategy."    However, some of the SDS deputies are by no means eager for  new elections (which applies to Parliamentary Chairman Mr.  Yordanov, who is very concerned about his post, and also to  numerous undeclared rank and file members, who long for an  eternal parliament).    The "eternal" deputies do not dare openly to declare  themselves against a course that leads to new elections. Hence,  they are forced to support the series of no-confidence votes.  Should the cabinet fall, they too are ready to join the  "victors" who are driving the SDS toward an election defeat. If  the cabinet does not fall -- every unsuccessful no-confidence  vote is likely to prolong their existence as members of  parliament, which is the most pleasant physical condition for  them.</p>

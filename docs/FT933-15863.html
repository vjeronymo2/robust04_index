			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Prescott criticises City cordon MR JOHN Prescott, shadow transport secretary, yesterday strongly criticised the City's anti-terrorist cordon. He said the City authorities had not consulted other traffic authorities before implementing the controversial scheme, Gillian Tett writes. Echoing concern in some Whitehall departments, he said that neither the traffic director for London nor London Transport had been consulted by the police. Commander Hugh Moore of the City of London Police said: 'The consultation period had to be limited because of the security issues.' The Corporation of London said the new scheme had been a complete success and pointed out that the widely predicted traffic congestion had failed to materialise so far. However, Mr Prescott insisted the situation could rapidly deteriorate. He said: 'We are entering the summer holiday period when many people are not travelling to work. When everybody returns it will be a different story, and it will be traffic chaos.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il sent a birthday table to a Japanese woman Choe Sun  residing in the central district, Pyongyang Municipality, on her  70th birthday.    Choe Sun (Japanese name: Toshiko Motohasi) was born in May  1924 in Suminami Ward, Tokyo metropolis, as the eldest daughter  of a railway worker Eisuke Motohasi, her father, and Haru  Motohasi, her mother.    After graduating from a girls high school, she worked at a  farm machinery factory before she came to the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in January 1960 with her Korean  husband, Choe Sang-chol, who was chairman of the Suminami branch  of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongnyon).    After finishing the course of a university, she has taught  at  the Pyongyang University of foreign languages, writing many  books for teaching and training hundreds of foreign language  experts.    Comrade Kim Chong-il made her an assistant professor and  gave  her the noble political integrity as a member of the Workers'  Party of Korea, highly appreciating her services.    Receiving the birthday table imbued with loving care amid  the  blessings of all peoples on May 27, she said she owed it  entirely to the politics of grace and the politics of love and  trust in this land that she is enjoying such worth and happiness  of life today, she who once lived in a capitalist society where  the jungle law prevails.</p>

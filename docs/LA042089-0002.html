			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: LOW-SODIUM RECIPE  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: Please see if you can reduce the sodium in the following recipe. I  know the onion soup mix is loaded with sodium but wonder about the drained  mushrooms and onions.  </P> <P>  -- MRS. A. B., Bettendorf, Iowa  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEEF BOURGUIGNON  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, cut in 1 1/2-inch cubes  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cornstarch  </P> <P> 1 (1 1/2-ounce) package dry onion soup mix  </P> <P> 2/3 cup dry red wine, about  </P> <P> 1 cup canned mushrooms, drained  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, cut in 1-inch pieces  </P> <P> 1 (15-ounce) can whole onions, drained  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Brown steak in skillet. Combine salt, cornstarch, soup mix and 2/3 cup wine in  2-quart casserole. Stir in steak, mushrooms, green pepper and onions. Bake at  325 degrees 2 hours or until tender. Add wine during cooking if mixture seems  too dry. (Reserve liquid from onions and add if needed.) Serve with rice. Makes  4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. A. B.: By making your own soup mix and using fresh mushrooms and  onions instead of the canned varieties, you can easily reduce the amount of  sodium in this recipe. Even drained and rinsed canned vegetables may have  higher levels of sodium than fresh ones if the label on the can lists sodium as  an ingredient.  </P> <P> By covering the casserole for the first half of the baking time, you can  eliminate the problem of the mixture becoming too dry. With just a little more  effort on your part, I think you will agree that fresh is best when it comes to  controlling sodium and getting maximum flavor from the calories consumed.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEST BEEF BOURGUIGNON  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds sirloin steak, cut in 1 1/2-inch cubes  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped onion or 1/2 cup dehydrated onion  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon onion powder  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon cornstarch  </P> <P> 2/3 cup dry red wine  </P> <P> 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 1/2 pound green pepper, cut into 1-inch pieces  </P> <P> 3/4 pound boiling onions, peeled  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Brown steak in non-stick skillet.

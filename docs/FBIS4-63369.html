			<p>BFN     [Text] It looks as though someone planned an attempt on the  life of Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, when he visited St.  Petersburg between 16 and 19 May. On 16 May, security guards  discovered a plastic bag containing a time bomb between the  doors of a shop of the British firm Littlewoods in Tukhachevskiy  Avenue. The alarm hand connected with the firing device and  four kilograms of TNT pointed at eight o'clock. Had the  explosive device gone off, the shop would have been blown to  pieces. The Prince of Wales did visit Littlewoods, but at  another time.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus has  supported, by a majority of votes, the recalling of Stanislav  Shushkevich from the post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  the Republic of Belarus. The formal reason for this recall was  the parliamentary debate which intended to reveal the violations  of law in the activities of commercial structures at state and  local government bodies. According to the adopted resolution,  Shushkevich is blamed for failing to take measures against  corruption, a lack of control over the work of law enforcement  bodies, and manifested personal immodesty.    The same charges with regard to Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyacheslav Kebich were treated by the majority of the people's  deputies as insignificant; in secret balloting, they voted  against his dismissal. Half an hour ago, the Supreme Soviet  began its regular plenary session. People's deputies are  discussing the miscellaneous matters on the agenda.</p>

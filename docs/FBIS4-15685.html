			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the Radio and Television Council came to a  decision on the situation that has arisen with the relay of  Ostankino Television Company broadcasts on the territory of  Latvia. It is completely cleared up until 1 June this year, when  possibly the issue of the Russian state budget and the ability  of Ostankino to pay for the relay of its programs to the Latvian  Radio and Television Center will be solved. Until 1 June  Ostankino will be relayed at its present extent, on condition  that losses incurred by the relays not paid for will not be  covered from the Latvian state budget. Likewise, the Latvian  Radio and Television Council maintains the right to deploy free  broadcasting time to other programs. The Council resolved to  announce a competition for free air time on Latvian television  networks. It will decide separately on the terms of the  competition.</p>

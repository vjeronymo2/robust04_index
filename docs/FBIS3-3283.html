Costing 5.238 billion Macao patacas (680 million U.S.  dollars), the artificial island project was signed on January  18, 1992 and its construction started on March 18 the same year.    The 1.5 square kilometer island was built by erecting closed  dams in the sea and then filling them with sand and stones.    The runway of the Macao Airport will be built on the  artificial island, which was designed to be 3,500 meters long  and 60 meters wide, and to accommodate B747-400 passenger planes.    It was learned that the infrastructural construction in the  runway area will be started in may this year and is expected to  be completed in March next year.    The surface project of the runway is also expected to be  finished ahead of schedule to ensure the test flight in next  June.    The Macao International Airport is located at the sea area  to  the east of Macao's Taipa and Coloane Islands. With an  investment of 7.3 billion Macao patacas (940 million U.S.  dollars), the project was first started in December 1989. The  airport covers 192 hectares in area.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Konstantin </F> Pribytkov]    [Text] Geneva, April 27 (TASS) -- The Bosnian peace process  is the main subject of discussion at a current working meeting  between Andrey Kozyrev and Alain Juppe here on Wednesday. The  talks between the foreign ministers of Russia and France are  being held in the United Nations office in Europe.    Russian diplomats are of the opinion that the positions of  the two countries on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia are  close on a number of important points. Moscow and Paris favour  close cooperative action among Russia, the United States, the  European Union, and the United Nations in the quest for a  resolution of the crisis. It was in many respects due to this  policy line that the four-country contact group was set up.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: WOODBURY UNIVERSITY;  </P> <P> 7 STUDENTS WIN DESIGN COMPETITION  </P> <P> Seven Woodbury University architecture students won the top award at an  architectural design competition last weekend at California Polytechnic State  University at San Luis Obispo.  </P> <P> The Burbank students designed and built a 20-foot-tall, triangular tower with  free-floating platforms to win the "People's Choice" award in the Poly Royal  Design Village Competition April 26-29.  </P> <P> One of 63 entries, the unusual structure also won an honorable mention award in  the "Exploration of Form" category.  </P> <P> The students in the five-year architecture program who participated were  project designer Craig Rizzo, Eric Hamnerlund, Cole Butler, Perry Roumbos,  Spencer Knapp, Paul Simpson and Nick Rumanes.  </P> <P> They used chain-link fencing, sewer pipe, wire and wood to build the structure,  which consisted of platforms suspended from three columns by cables. It was  capable of sleeping six students.  </P> <P> Butler said the tricky part was that the students did not know where they would  be asked to set up their structure.  </P> <P> "We ended up having to carry all the materials 2,500 yards and then had to set  it up in a canyon where the ground was not completely flat," she said. "It took  us four hours to set up."  </P> <P> Hamnerlund said the structure turned out to be the tallest in the competition  by 6 to 8 feet.  </P> <P> "We wanted to make a monolithic impression in the minds of all who saw it," he  said.  </P> <P> The theme, "Exploration of Form," urged students to create a structure not  based upon accepted architectural concepts.  </P></p>

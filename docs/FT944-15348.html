			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / New car sales forecast to show 8% rise Ford and Vauxhall forecast yesterday that new car sales in the UK would total about 1.92m in 1994, an increase of nearly 8 per cent from 1.78m last year. The rate of growth has slowed significantly in the last four months, however  -with private sales particularly weak - forcing carmakers to lower forecasts for the year. The leading UK dealer organisation attacked the makers for overpricing cars. Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers' Association, said that 'prices of new cars could be cut by as much as Pounds 2,000 if manufacturers abandoned two-tier pricing and stopped adding expensive specification items purely to influence corporate buyers'. He added: 'It is not surprising that the retail customer has shown insufficient confidence to invest in today's overpriced product.' Prices could be reduced by 10 per cent, or about Pounds 1,000 on an average saloon car, if manufacturers stopped giving fleet buyers excessive discounts at the expense of the private buyer, Mr Pulham said. 'The price cut could be doubled if vehicle specifications were made more relevant to today's market,' he said. '1994 vehicles are grossly overspecified and as a consequence overpriced.' Mr Pulham has previously attacked carmakers for distorting the market by encouraging the pre-registering of cars by dealers in order to gain market share without the cars having a final buyer. Mr Charlie Golden, chief executive of Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors, said: 'We were disappointed by the market's activity in the past two months, but we see no reason to panic.' Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said that 'according to all the economic indicators' the recession was finished but 'the message has yet to get through to the general buying public'. He called on the UK government to follow France and Spain in introducing financial incentives to encourage the scrapping of old cars. About 10 per cent of vehicles - particularly unregulated diesel cars - caused 50 per cent of vehicle pollution, he said. 'It's time for the government to look at the actions taken in France and Spain to stimulate sales of new cars and, more importantly, to encourage the removal of the older vehicles that do most damage.' The scrapping incentives in France and Spain had had a marked impact on economic activity and had started to take older cars and vehicles off the road, Mr McAllister added.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Exploring additional alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and cumulative effects and connected actions). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The District has identified the following issues. These are internal issues the District has identified and would now like the public to review them and add anymore they feel worthy of note. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Soil Compaction_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Past activities have caused soil compaction. The Proposed Action could cause additional soil compaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Roadless Area_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Action could impact roadless area attributes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Old-Growth Fragmentation_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Action could increase timber stand fragmentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forest Health_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timber stand health is declining due to fire exclusion and drought. This has resulted in overstocked conditions, increased insect and disease infestations, heavy forest fuel levels, and an increase in dead and dying timber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Water Quality_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vegetation treatment and grazing in and adjacent to riparian zones may effect stream channel stability and water quality. Habitat for red band trout and Malheur mottled sculpin may be affected by vegetation treatment in and adjacent to riparian zones. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Big Game Cover_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timber harvest could adversely affect big game habitat and populations in the analysis area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Socioeconomic_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Timber harvesting could enhance local and regional economies by providing revenues and jobs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Livestock Grazing_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Action could have an effect on the number of livestock and the timing and location of where livestock graze. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public review by May 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies, organizations, and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft EIS in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Fedeal Register.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the notice of availability in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS's must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp v. NRDC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> City of Angoon v. Hodel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 803 f. 2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir, 1986) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the Proposed Action, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.13 in addressing these points). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by January 1996. In the final EIS, The Forest Service is required to respond to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding this proposal. Thomas A. Schmidt, Forest Supervisor, Ochoco National Forest, is the Responsible Official. As the responsible official he will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Board of Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under 36 CFR part 215. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Rodney D.

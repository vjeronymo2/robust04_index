			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business group seeks Dollars 2m amends British businesses which paid a total of Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.20m) in retainers to a US company in the hope of raising finance which they say never materialised have joined forces to press the US and UK authorities for compensation. The issue is expected to put further pressure on Britain to increase regulation of off-shore havens. The FBI has intensified its 18-month investigation of the US company, Bond Street Commercial. Law enforcement officers estimate up to Dollars 100m has been taken in 'retainers' by the company world-wide, or those connected with it, in return for help in raising finance. Almost 20 UK companies - from small boatyards to construction groups - have formed the Turnberry/Bond Street Pressure Group to highlight their plight. The companies each paid retainers of between Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 230,000 to Miami-based Bond Street Commercial, previously known as Turnberry Underwriters. In return, they were promised help to raise almost Dollars 100m, in the form of collateral to secure bank loans. In many cases, the loan was to have been repaid by a flotation arranged through a company run by the former president of Turnberry, Mr Les Mersky. Yet no company could meet the terms of the Bond Street contract in the time allowed. Several companies even paid further retainers for extensions but still could not complete. The arrangement appears to have broken down during bank to bank discussions. In one case, Turnberry's bank was discovered to be an offshore private institution, the Guardian Bank and Trust (Cayman) Ltd. Mr Gwyn Davies, of Cardiff-based solicitors Edward Lewis Bevan Ashford representing the group, said they wanted 'to draw attention to the authorities' failure to regulate Turnberry/Bond Street in the UK, US and Caymans.' Turnberry and the Guardian Bank were the focus of an article in the Financial Times last year. Other UK companies have been put in touch with Bond Street through national newspaper advertisements. The ads are often placed by US and UK agents. One such agent, based in New York and trading under the name EFG or EF Gibson, was involved in most of the pressure group cases.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. Gagik Arutyunyan, Armenian vice president, at a  meeting with Hasan Rowhani, deputy Majles speaker, this  afternoon praised the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  for its continual and earnest efforts to bring to an end the war  between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He expressed the hope that the  war would end soon, judging by certain visible signs.    Referring to the downing of the aircraft carrying families  of  Iranian diplomats in the Karabakh region, on behalf of the  government and people of Armenia, he expressed deep regret about  the incident. Stressing that the Armenian Government would stop  at nothing to discover the cause of the incident, he assured: If  the smallest evidence of negligence by the Armenian authorities  comes to light the culprits would be severely punished.    At the meeting Mr. Rowhani described Iran's fundamental  policy on stability and peace and prevention of any act which  would disrupt stability. He said the friendly ties between Iran  and Armenia were based on those principles. He stressed Iran's  support for a fair and honorable peace in the region.    He described as unconvincing the reasons given so far by the  Armenian Government regarding the downing of the Iranian plane.  He expressed the hope that with the continuation of the  investigation and the cooperation of the Armenian authorities  with the Iranian team of experts, the unclear aspects of the  incident would become clear to the Iranian nation.    He referred to the active presence of Armenian deputies in  the Majles. He said expansion of parliamentary ties between  Iran and Armenia should be considered within the framework of  the expansion of mutual relations.</p>

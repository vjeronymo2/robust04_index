			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Portugal's banks take their corners - The battle for market share is warming up The gloves are off in the normally sedate world of Portuguese banking. Banco Comercial Portugues's hostile bid for Banco Portugues do Atlantico is the opening bout of what is expected to be a fierce contest for market share. BCP's cash offer of Es132bn (Dollars 819m) for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of BPA, a rival almost twice its size, has important implications for a financial system where state control has long held aggressive instincts in check and most banks are just beginning to find their feet after privatisation. The takeover would make BCP so much bigger than its main competitors that other large acquisitions or mergers would almost certainly follow. If the bid is successful, BCP will move to second position, from fifth, in the ranking of Portuguese banks by total assets. Less than a decade after BCP was founded by a small group of Portuguese businessmen, it is bidding to become the country's largest private-sector banking group. The new group would be almost as big as Caixa Geral de Depositos, which dominates Portuguese banking with a 28 per cent market share. CGD is now the only state-owned institution among Portugal's top five banks. 'BCP's competitors will all be forced to rethink their strategies if the takeover goes ahead,' says Mr Alexandre Vaz Pinto, of Banco Espirito Santo. BES, for example, has an 11 per cent share of the market, compared with 9.5 per cent for BCP. But control of BPA would more than double BCP's share to 24 per cent. BCP's pugnacious move has taken Portugal by surprise. But concentrations of banking power had been forecast. 'Portuguese banks are too small to compete internationally and there is big potential for rationalisation,' says Mr Joao Rendeiro, a Lisbon fund manager. 'BCP is taking the first step in an inevitable reshaping of the sector.' On one level, the outcome of the bid depends on the solidarity of BPA's core shareholders. BCP is only likely to be successful if one of the Portuguese businesses that together own a controlling stake of 27 per cent of BPA - which they are now seeking to enlarge - abandons an agreement not to sell outside the group. The offer of Es3,000 a share is 14 times 1993 earnings. But BCP must also win the approval of the finance ministry, the stock exchange commission and the central bank. The government's commitment to liberalising the financial sector, which was almost totally nationalised after Portugal's left-wing revolution in 1974, would appear be in BCP's favour. Blocking the bid could be viewed as interference in the market. Analysts say BCP's offer, the equivalent of 2.3 times BPA's 1993 book value, also sets an attractive price level for future bank privatisations. The sale of sixth-ranked Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor and the state's remaining 25 per cent holding in BPA will virtually complete bank re-privatisations, which began in 1989. BCP's move would also seem to be towards creating a strong Portuguese group equipped to compete on a European level - a trend eagerly advocated by Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister. But although Portuguese businesses control BCP, the bank's largest single shareholder is Banco Central Hispano, the Spanish banking group. BCH owns 20 per cent but its voting rights are limited to 10 per cent. Official espousal of a traditional Portuguese aversion to economic dominance by Spanish companies is only thinly veiled. Banesto, another Spanish bank, is under pressure to reduce its direct and indirect holding of about 50 per cent in Banco Totta e Acores, Portugal's third-ranked banking group. On the surface, BCP control of BPA would increase Spanish influence in Portuguese banking. But some analysts see the takeover bid partly as a defensive move that would create a large group over which it would be much harder for BCH to gain control. Lisbon also has to consider whether BCP's proposed purchase would distort competition. The takeover would mean that two banking groups, BCP and CGD, dominated more than 50 per cent of the market. The government gives an indication of its current thinking in the privatisation terms for BPSM. These state that acquisition of BPSM should not give rise to a group whose size could lead to 'significant imbalances' in the financial market. The battle for control of BPA is unlikely to be resolved for three or four months. Whatever the outcome, the competitive climate in Portugal's newly-privatised banking sector will have been irrevocably changed.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        PORTUGAL'S TOP FIVE BANKS*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Market share                                  by total     Net assets    Own capital                                 assets (%)      (Es bn)       (Es bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Caixa Geral de Depositos          28.0          3,183.9        445.8 Banco Portugues do Atlantico      14.5          2,440.1        190.3 Banco Totta e Acores              14.0          2,650.4        165.2 Banco Espirito Santo              11.0          2,005.7        160.5 Banco Comercial Portugues          9.5          1,758.1        224.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Employees        Branches  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Caixa Geral de Depositos              9,357            501 Banco Portugues do Atlantico          5,303            329 Banco Totta e Acores                  4,384            255 Banco Espirito Santo                  6,944            230 Banco Comercial Portugues             4,066            266  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *End-1993 figures  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: annual reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

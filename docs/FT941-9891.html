			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Hata wants to heal trade rift with US Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, yesterday said that both Japan and the US were determined to settle their differences over trade. But both nations insisted privately that they could not compromise on US demands for measuring the progress of access to Japanese markets. Mr Hata's visit was an attempt to avert confrontation before last night's scheduled arrival of Mr Morihiro Hosokowa, Japanese prime minister. It injected into the trade talks the vital military and foreign policy relationship between the two economic superpowers. Ahead of Mr Hosokawa's summit with President Bill Clinton, Mr Hata is understood to have raised national security concerns to stress that trade problems were not the only important bilateral issue. Mr Hata had a two-hour breakfast with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. He was also scheduled to meet vice-president Al Gore; Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state; Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser; and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary. President Bill Clinton was scheduled to attend during one of the meetings. A Japanese embassy official said talks this week had produced satisfactory progress on three main areas of contention - medical equipment, telecommunications, and insurance - but in no sector is there agreement on numerical criteria. 'There is a difference of opinion on a matter of principle; there can be no compromise,' he said. An unnamed senior US official was quoted by Reuter last night as saying the odds were 'pretty high' against a deal in time for today's summit, describing them as at least 70-30 against. On Capitol Hill, where the administration is finding broad support for a tough stand, Senator Max Baucus suggested that compromise might be reached because the framework agreement on bilateral trade contained no enforcement provision if Japan failed to achieve the negotiated 'benchmarks'. However, he also suggested that a resurrected version of the Super 301 law, which carried severe penalties but which has expired, would provide a mechanism to ensure that Japan kept to agreements. Such threats have in the past prevented Japanese negotiators from agreeing to 'indicators'. Tough budget urged, Page 4 Unpredictable summit, Page 15</p>

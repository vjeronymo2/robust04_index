			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Hostility hits Senate debate on healthcare The US healthcare reform debate got off, late on Tuesday, to a reasonably civilised start in front of a relatively packed chamber, but hostility was still rampant on the margins of the floor and away from it. The US Senate has not for years been a forum of great oratory. Many senators only bother to turn up to vote, rather than to listen. Senator Jesse Helms, the right-wing Republican from North Carolina, tried to prevent any debate at all. Both of his parliamentary ruses aimed at halting the debate - amendments tagged on to unrelated issues  - were voted down. But threats of Republican filibusters of the healthcare bill itself remained in the air, most often voiced by Senator Gramm, of Texas, who was to be accused by Mrs Hillary Clinton, in an interview, of 'opportunism'. However, the cause of reform got an invaluable endorsement yesterday from the American Association of Retired Persons, representing 33m Americans. It backed both the House and Senate bills proposed by the Democrats and warned: 'If either bill is defeated, healthcare reform will be dead for years to come.' The bill sponsored by Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, received qualified approval from the Congressional Budget Office. It found that the impact would 'slightly reduce the federal budget deficit,' though expanded insurance coverage 'would add to national health expenditures'. The two principals Mr Mitchell and Senator Robert Dole, his Republican opposite number, had tried to start the debate on a higher plane. That is always easier for Mr Mitchell, from Maine, a man whose bland demeanour and comforting New England twang belies his political toughness. He has, after all, threatened to keep the Senate sitting throughout the summer to complete action on his bill. Mr Dole is more combative in public. He could not resist opening his speech by repeating three times the Republican mantra, 'America has the best healthcare system in the world'. But he, too, offered conciliation of a kind. 'We believe there is a lot in our bill, a lot in Senator Mitchell's bill, a lot in other bills. We could go in a back room and in two or three days get a bill that could pass 99 to one.' In her interview, Mrs Clinton accused Republicans like Mr Gramm of 'raving about socialised medicine,' much as they had once opposed the creation of social security and Medicare as exercises in doctrinaire left-wing experimentation.</p>

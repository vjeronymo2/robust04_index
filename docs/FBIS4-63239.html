			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 19 May -- "The Ukrainian leadership is  making attempts to destabilize the situation in the Crimea,  provoke a conflict, and use it as an excuse for disrupting the  presidential elections in Ukraine. By doing this, the present  leadership in Kiev is trying to stay in power," Crimean  President Yuriy Meshkov said in an exclusive interview with  ITAR-TASS this evening.    According to him, the Ukrainian leadership had made an  attempt to eliminate presidential power in the Crimea in the  past, and on 19 May, Leonid Kravchuk by his decrees reorganized  the Crimean power ministries. These moves by Kiev, Yuriy  Meshkov thinks, might seriously aggravate the situation in the  republic.    In his opinion, the redeployment and increased activity of  the Ukrainian Armed Forces units have been noted on the  peninsula's territory. Thus, on the night of 18 May, an  aircraft carrying Valentyn Nedryhaylo, the first deputy interior  minister, and a special purpose group, secretly arrived in  Simferopol where they attempted to seize the republic's Interior  Ministry.    Yuriy Meshkov said that on 19 May the Crimean Supreme  Council  approved the ministers of internal affairs, security service,  and justice and, in his opinion, this will make it possible to  guarantee peace and order in the republic. "If need be," he  said, "we have enough forces and equipment to prevent the  situation from getting out of control."    The Crimean president also said that, in order to guarantee  stability, he was prepared to accept compromise decisions but  not at the expense of Crimean statehood. In particular, Yuriy  Meshkov said, at his request the Supreme Council suspended the  discussion of restoring the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992.    Yuriy Meshkov also told ITAR-TASS that he had accepted the  proposal by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to send a  delegation of Crimean deputies to Kiev to discuss issues of  mutual interest.    In the opinion of Yuriy Meshkov, in the evolved situation  Russia should not allow Ukraine to resort to taking inadequate  measures against the Republic of Crimea.</p>

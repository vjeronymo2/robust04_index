			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Jobs agenda for Europe To focus attention on everything is to focus it on nothing. This, along with an unwillingness to confront grim choices, has been the biggest failure of the European Union's response to its employment problem. The white paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, discussed at the Brussels European Council last December, was one example. Another is a report last week from the House of Lords select committee on the European Communities. Few stones that might conceal an idea or a new programme have been left unturned. The result is not so much wrong, as unhelpful. European economic growth is not the burning issue: over the past 20 years, it has compared well with that of the US. Nor is it European competitiveness: in relation to an entire economy this concept lacks much meaning. Nor is it even European macroeconomic policy: misguided though it has recently been, this too shall pass. The issue is that, over the past 20 years, growth in employment has been exiguous, while the overall rate of unemployment in the European Union has risen, cycle by cycle, and now stands close to 12 per cent. This is the uniquely European disease, one that has deeply infected social and political life. The defect of the white paper was that it provided neither a focused discussion, nor clear analysis, nor strong policy recommendations. The House of Lords report fails to remedy these defects. It recognises that 'neither lack of growth nor loss of competitiveness on their own are sufficient to explain the comparatively high level of structural unemployment'. But it avoids the central question, which is whether and, if so, how greater job creation can be reconciled with Europe's much prized regulatory, tax and welfare regimes. Commendably blunt The latest World Economic Outlook from the IMF shows what is needed. It is commendably blunt. 'While some policies to increase the flexibility of labour markets have recently been adopted in Europe,' wrote the IMF, 'most of these measures attempt to correct distortions stemming from labour market regulations rather than to change the regulations themselves.' A close parallel to such tinkering can be found in the EU's approach to reform of its common agricultural policy, with its set asides and similar command and control mechanisms. Just as the CAP has created butter mountains, so labour market interventions have created mountains of surplus labour. Irrelevant remedies What then is to be done? First, attention must not be diverted to irrelevant remedies. French experience has, for example, demonstrated that training is insufficient to lower unemployment if minimum wages are too high. Similarly, Europe's investment rates have been above those in the US and, even so, its jobs record has been far worse. Second, overhaul of labour market regulations and tax and benefit systems must be given pride of place. The bulk of the long-term unemployed are to be found among the low skilled. There is no mystery about why this is so. These people are discouraged from seeking work by the generous benefits they receive when they do not work and by the high rate at which benefit is withdrawn when they do. Simultaneously, employers are discouraged from offering work by the cost of labour, partly determined by the taxes and charges they have to pay, not to mention the regulations that govern their ability to manage their labour forces flexibly. Analytically, the solution is clear. It is to reduce the wedges between what it costs an employer to employ someone and the benefit an employee derives from obtaining such employment. This can be done by radically reforming the subsidy regime, to promote employment. It need not necessitate the ending of benefits. Without radical action, European countries are accepting the persistence of high unemployment. That may be their least bad choice, given political constraints. If so, policy-makers should at least be honest about what they are doing. They must not be allowed to pretend that today's bloated policy agenda will do much to eradicate Europe's unemployment black spot.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde tunes in to 57% increase after Forth purchase RADIO CLYDE Holdings, which since its merger with Radio Forth last year broadcasts to all the main cities in Scotland, increased pre-tax profit by 57 per cent, from Pounds 707,000 to Pounds 1.11m, in the six months to March 31. Turnover at the USM-quoted group advanced to Pounds 6.62m, reflecting the all-share acquisition completed in April last year. Because of the extra equity, earnings per share rose only 1p to 8.3p. The interim dividend is held at 3.25p. Mr John Bowman, finance director, said the original Clyde group made operating profits of Pounds 798,000. Forth added Pounds 261,000, while Buzz FM, a Birmingham station aimed at a younger audience, lost Pounds 89,000. Clyde had only recently taken effective control of Buzz after spending about Pounds 750,000 over 18 months to buy 97 per cent of it. Interest received amounted to Pounds 143,000 and the group had Pounds 2.5m cash at the half-way stage, compared with Pounds 3m last year, with Buzz accounting for the difference. Mr James Gordon, chief executive, said local advertising revenue, which accounted for 70 per cent of the total, rose by 8 per cent year-on-year and had reached a record level. Growth in national advertising was 5 per cent and there had been some encouraging signs in April and May. The group, which has missed out in the bidding for the first two national commercial radio stations, said it would not bid for the third speech-based one. It was continuing to look for other areas in which to invest. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 270,000 rose from a change in accounting treatment for Satellite Media Services, in which it now has a 28.6 per cent stake. An anticipated sale had fallen through, leading to the accounting change. The business was close to breaking even and the sale of the stake was not being actively pursued.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ALL ABOARD: Anaheim's Snow House Moving Co. -- as its name indicates -- usually  moves houses and usually rolls them through the streets. . . . But next week  the company will move a 5,000-square-foot office building by water. . . .  Because the one-story, modular structure, now being used by the L.A. Harbor  Department in San Pedro, is too wide to move through the streets, it will be  dollied to wharfside and hoisted onto a barge for a 1.5-mile trip to another  waterfront site.

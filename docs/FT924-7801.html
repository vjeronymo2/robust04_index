			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Police examine Pounds 1.1m DTI fraud TWO SENIOR Department of Trade and Industry officials will be interviewed next month over an investigation into a possible Pounds 1.1m fraud on the DTI involving a Liverpool ice cream company, according to Merseyside Police. GS Gumbuir, which has operated an ice cream wholesaling business in Liverpool city centre for about 30 years, received development area grants during the late 1980s. Customs and Excise officers are understood to have contacted Merseyside Fraud Squad following VAT inquiries. The two officials who approved the grants - Mr Bob Anderson, now the DTI's East Midlands regional director, and Mr John McCann, a Liverpool-based executive - were suspended from duty on police bail after being arrested. Police said they also want to interview Mr Parjamit Singh Gumbuir, a senior executive of the company and a member of the family which owns it. He is in India but is expected back in Britain soon. Mr Anderson played a central role with the DTI in Liverpool for several years, working closely with the Merseyside Task Force, a group of senior civil servants led by the Department of the Environment. Mr McCann is the executive officer who, until his suspension, administered the government's regional selective assistance programme in the area. The task force, set up by Mr Michael Heseltine after the 1981 Toxteth riots, is the government's main link with industry, commerce, local authorities and development agencies.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Full-time side helps EW Fact advance 57% A continuing high level of demand for its full-time courses enabled EW Fact, the accountancy and banking tuition group, to show a 57 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from Pounds 862,000, restated for FRS 3, to Pounds 1.35m. Turnover was 6 per cent higher at Pounds 4.98m (Pounds 4.67m). The pre-tax figure was also helped by a one-off credit of Pounds 235,000 in settlement of property rights and lower interest charges of Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 101,000). Borrowings fell over the year from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 92,000. Mr Emile Woolf, chairman, said there had been a satisfactory start to the present year in both of the main businesses, Emile Woolf Colleges and ATL Group, which was acquired at the end of the year. Earnings per share were 13.19p (7.44p). A final dividend of 2.98p is recommended for a total 4.74p (4.31p).</p>

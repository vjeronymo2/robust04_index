			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi has  postponed the meeting originally scheduled for 6th of this month  to deliberate on possible ways of restoring lasting peace in  Rwanda. In a statement issued from State House, Nakuru,  President Moi said the postponement became necessary as  confirmation of attendance had not been received by today from  some invited heads of state. Those invited are President Yoweri  Museveni of Uganda, Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Mobutu Sese  Seko of Zaire and acting President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya of  Burundi.    He said the postponement would enable him and his colleagues  to consult a little more to ensure that all of them attend any  such meeting. The head of state reiterated that the problem of  Rwanda was complicated and therefore required concerted efforts  of all the neighboring of heads of state so that decisions  reached might stand a better chance of success.    At the same time President Moi appealed to all the  combatants  in Rwanda to start and observe a cease-fire to avoid any more  loss of life. He also observed that failure to take this course  of action would mean that the leaders have no value for the  lives of their people.</p>

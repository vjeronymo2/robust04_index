			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Technology: Advice on some burning issues When Mike Lyons speaks about the buildings he sets on fire, you could be excused for thinking that he is a pyromaniac. Fortunately, the buildings and the fire's victims only exist on a computer's virtual reality program. Lyons is general manager of Colt Virtual Reality, set up by the UK ventilation and environmental control group to provide advice for architects and builders. Colt uses VR to study the movement of people in and around buildings, ships and tunnels. Lyons says there is a tendency to make simple assumptions about people's behaviour. 'Suppose you have a store with 100 people in it, and exits at the front and back. If there's a fire, it is traditionally assumed that 50 will go out through the front and 50 through the back.' A better understanding can be obtained by using a VR database to create individuals based on the psychology and behaviour of real human beings. These are then in the building when the blaze starts. Allowance is made for the elderly moving more slowly, parents stopping to collect their children and individuals whose curiosity or bravery sends them against the flow to find the source of the blaze. With random elements included, the sequence is run up to 100 times and the evacuation time established. When changes are made to the building design, the process can be repeated. Such studies can show surprising results. In one minute, about 120 people can push through a doorway of the standard 74cm width. But if that is increased by 20cm, almost twice as many can leave in the same time. London's planned Pounds 2bn Crossrail project will be designed with the help of Colt VR, which has been brought in by British Rail and London Underground to help with station design for normal use and emergency evacuation.</p>

			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Green shoots appear at Royal Agricultural show - Thanks to the pound's devaluation, Britain's farm sector is faring better than was expected a year ago THIS YEAR'S Royal Agricultural Show at Stoneleigh in Warwickshire should, if everything had gone the way the politicians planned, have been a downbeat affair. The European Community's common agricultural policy has been reformed; EC commodity price guarantees have begun a three-year fall; and the hated set-aside is a reality. Farmers and those who trade with them were expecting the cuts to be biting hard by now. But there was an accident last September. Sterling slipped out of the EC's exchange rate mechanism and was devalued. As a result EC farm prices, instead of falling, have risen in sterling terms. The consequent radical devaluation of the 'green pound' has given most UK farmers a windfall. At its lowest value last February the decline in the value of sterling, which under EC law has to be made up to UK farmers, was equivalent to a bonus of about 23 per cent. In other words those UK farm products which enjoy EC price support have, at times, been that much more valuable than was expected. And even though the pound's recent rally has reduced that advantage most British farmers are still about 17 per cent better off than they feared a year ago. And when farmers have money they will spend it. UK tractors sales, for instance, are, according to the Agricultural Engineers Association, up 17 per cent at 8,052 units for the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 1992, which was, admittedly, a poor year. Nevertheless, it is a welcome and unexpected improvement for which manufacturers are truly thankful. On most of the farms to which they hoped to sell 15 per cent of the land had been compulsorily set-aside, so they had little expectation of such a lift in business. Indeed long before such sales began to take place the biggest British manufacturers had decided to pull out of the Royal Show because of the high cost of mounting and manning exhibits and none of them now has its own stand at the show. It has been left to JCB for instance with its new Fastrac range of tractors but modest production potential to take up some of the prestigious stand space once occupied by Ford. And even Massey Ferguson, whose factory is just down the road from the show ground, in Coventry, has declined to exhibit this year. This departure of major companies has left big holes across the 280 acre show ground. The organisers describe the spacious effect, with tongue in cheek perhaps, as 'more user friendly' for visitors. One theme of the show is 'producing for the market', in recognition of UK farmers continuing reputation for being bad at marketing their produce. The existence, for almost 50 years, of guaranteed marketing schemes and prices has left the industry short of marketing expertise or even incentive. But now that those props are being progressively removed a steep learning curve is needed for survival. The point was taken up by both Mrs Gillian Shephard, the minister of agriculture, and Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, during their visits. The agricultural industry, said Mr Naish, must get its marketing act together in anticipation of a deal being reached in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'If we do not we run the risk that the Dutch, the Danes and the French will grab even more of the British food market.' The minister, just a month into her new job, declared that taking initiatives to encourage better marketing and promotion of farm products, together with maintaining the consumers' confidence in quality and safety throughout the food chain were among her priorities for the next few years. She went on to say that as a result of her policies she hoped the country's food trade gap, at present about Pounds 6bn a year, would be reduced considerably by the end of the century. But there is a long way to go. Mrs Shephard's own boffins in the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, the ministry's advisory arm, recently concluded that there was a widespread inability among UK farmers to meet the needs of food industry buyers or to understand the business pressures they were facing; and an 'us against them' attitude among farmers and growers towards retailers and manufacturers. That must be corrected, the minister said. For the prosperity of agriculture was vital to Britain. Four fifths of the UK was farmland; while the farming and food industries together accounted for 9 per cent of GDP and 14 per cent of all jobs. The farmers' stock reply is that they have been losing out to the food trade over recent years. While the UK consumer spend on food has increased from Pounds 32bn to Pounds 70bn since 1982, the value of agricultural output has gone up only from Pounds 10.5bn to Pounds 12bn. The obvious implication is that the supermarkets have pocketed the difference. The truth is not quite that simple of course but such figures have added to the antipathy between some sectors of the food trade and their actual or potential suppliers. But at least the food giants are now making a move towards farmers, if their presence at the Royal Show is a fair indication. Safeway, which has been a regular exhibitor for some years, is at the show in strength on its own stand and sponsoring others; Marks &amp; Spencer has returned after an absence of several years with the declared objective of getting closer to its suppliers and customers; and both Tesco and Northern Foods are also exhibiting, although the latter is probably there mainly to try to persuade more dairy farmers to join the Northern Foods Partnership and supply it with milk after the imminent demise of the Milk Marketing Board. Nevertheless, their presence marks real progress towards the generally accepted goal of supplying more British food to British consumers.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORD IS OPA  </P> <P> We were very pleased by Sylvia Steinberg's Reader Recommendation ("Jerry  Hulse's Travel Tips," Feb. 18). However, the name of our company is OPA Tours  Greece, not OTA Tours. The word opa is Greek; it's what the Greek people say  when they are having a wonderful time.  </P> <P> JOYCE HELFAND  </P> <P> OPA TOURS GREECE  </P> <P> Tujunga  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe, 1 May--Militants of the Tajik opposition  confiscated today the cargo that had been delivered by an AN-26  aircraft [as received] of the military transport aviation corps  of Uzbekistan at the Khorog airport, the administrative center  of Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast.    The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from well-informed  sources in Tajikistan that the Defense Ministry of Uzbekistan  has confirmed that the cargo of "humanitarian aid" had indeed  been prepared to be sent to Gornyy Badakhshan  [Gorno-Badakhshan]. However, Tajikistan had not been informed  about the exact time the aircraft would cross the state border.    The aircraft landed at 1500 hours local time (1200 Moscow  time) at the Khorog airport. After the landing of the AN-26,  the landing strip and all access routes to the airport were  surrounded by militants of a unit belonging to the "Tajik  self-defense forces", under the command of Yedgor Mamadaslamov.  The cargo was seized and taken away.    In this connection, military sources in Dushanbe are not  ruling out that there might be some contacts between certain  forces in Uzbekistan and militants in Pamir, which are  influencing the situation in the region.    There has been no official reaction from the Tajikistan  Government.</p>

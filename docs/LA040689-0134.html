			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGEL LOSING STREAK FINALLY ENDS;  </P> <P> TEAM GETS FIRST WIN SINCE SEPT. 18 AS WHITE SOX FALL, 6-2  </P> <P> And on the 199th day, the Angels won again.  </P> <P> Sept. 18, 1988 may now be retired to the history book. So may the club-record  losing streak that stood at 12 after last October's season finale and was  extended to 13 with Tuesday's season-opening defeat by the Chicago White Sox.  </P> <P> With a long, cold winter sandwiched in between, it had been more than six  months since the Angels had won a game that counted.  </P> <P> Brian Downing hit a leadoff home run Wednesday night at Anaheim Stadium, Chili  Davis hit a three-run home run, Lance Parrish went four for four and Chuck  Finley threw a four-hitter for 6 1/3 innings as the Angels defeated the White  Sox, 6-2, before a crowd of 20,969.  </P> <P> The Angels (1-1) are at .500 for the first time since last Sept. 18, when their  record rested at 75-75. Twelve losses later, that mark was 75-87 and the  countdown to the streak-breaker began.  </P> <P> To reach such a milestone, the Angels used three managers. Cookie Rojas was  fired after the first four defeats, and interim manager Moose Stubing went 0-8.  Doug Rader was hired to alter the course in early April.  </P> <P> After beginning the 1989 season with a 9-2 drubbing by Chicago, the Angels  finally got it right on Day 2. Opening a 3-0 lead after two innings, the Angels  kept the White Sox at bay until Davis put them away with his home run in the  seventh inning.  </P> <P> Interesting timing, that. Davis had been benched on opening day, giving way to  Rader's hunches and rookie Dante Bichette. Returned to the starting lineup on  Wednesday night, Davis walked and scored in his first at-bat, singled in his  second and homered in his third, a three-run shot off Chicago's top relief  pitcher, Bobby Thigpen.  </P> <P> Before Davis, though, there had been Downing, who gave the Angels a lead as  quickly as possible -- sending Chicago starter Eric King's first pitch into the  left-field seats.  </P> <P> For Downing, a weight-lifter's leadoff man, it was the 18th leadoff home run of  his major league career.  </P> <P> It also gave the Angels a lead they would never relinquish, setting up Finley  for his first victory since last Sept. 2 and letting relief pitcher Greg Minton  re-experience the feeling of saving an Angel win.  </P> <P> "There's no significance (to the victory) outside of shutting you guys up,"  Downing told a reporter. "There was absolutely no carry-over from last year to  yesterday. But at least this takes all the negative talk away and we can get on  to something more positive."  </P> <P> The inning after Downing's homer, the Angels added two runs to increase their  lead to 3-0.  </P> <P> Finley, a luckless 9-15 in 1988, is 1-0 after limiting the White Sox to one run  before giving way to Minton.  </P> <P> The only run Finley allowed came in the fifth, when Greg Walker doubled off the  right-field fence, was singled to third by Carlton Fisk and came home on Dan  Pasqua's sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> That at-bat figures be the last in quite a while for Pasqua, Chicago's starting  left fielder. In the bottom of the sixth inning, while chasing a foul ball off  the bat of Jack Howell, Pasqua slammed into the fence along the left-field box  seats and broke a bone in his right wrist. Pasqua is scheduled to undergo a  bone scan today at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood.  </P> <P> Finley would face five more batters before Rader replaced him with one out and  one on in the seventh.  </P> <P> On came Minton, making his fifth appearance in seven days, including both  regular season and exhibition games. Minton worked the final 2 2/3 innings for  the save, allowing Chicago a final run in the ninth.  </P> <P> Both Finley and Rader credited a new pitch -- the forkball -- with an assist in  Wednesday's outcome.  </P> <P> "I worked with it all spring and I'm not going to give up on it," said Finley,  who estimated he threw one forkball out of every four pitches. "It's the pitch  that will get me over the hump."  </P> <P> Rader agreed.  </P> <P> So, too, will the home-run ball. A frequent victim of offensive non-support  last season, Finley was encouraged and excited by the two Angel homers struck  in this game, especially Davis', which he kind of called.  </P> <P> "I told Dr. (Lewis) Yocum (the Angels team physician) if they throw Chili a  fastball, he'll jump all over it," Finley said. "He'll unleash on it. He's a  big-play hitter."  </P> <P> And that big play gave the Angels a 6-1 lead.  </P> <P> "We've got the kind of offense now that's going to put some runs on the board,"  Finley said.  </P> <P> Put enough of them up there and you're going to win some games. After nearly  200 days, the Angels finally were able to relive the moment.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Vance (Lucky) Lovelace, the rookie pitcher who made the Angel roster despite a  9.00 spring earned-run average and a twisted intestine, is feeling no  after-effects from the ailment that hospitalized him for one day last week.  "All the major tests came back negative or normal," Angel Manager Doug Rader  reported. "If it happens again, he'll have to get a CAT-scan. The same thing  happened to him about a year ago." A twisted intestine can be a bothersome  thing, Rader said. "To call yourself an ambulance at 3:30 in the morning,  there's got to be a lot of pain involved." . . . Dan Petry, pitching in the  bullpen to work his right shoulder into shape, was available for duty Wednesday  night. "He's on the list," Rader said. "He's making some progress. He's coming  along good." . . . With his pinch-hit home run in Tuesday's season opener,  Claudell Washington became the seventh player in club history to homer in his  first Angel at-bat. The others: Bob Cerv (1961), Ted Kluszewski (1961), pitcher  Don Rose (1972), Frank Robinson (1973), Dave Machemer (1978) and Mark Ryal  (1986). Washington's home run matched his previous career total at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> Chicago's Carlton Fisk, who also homered Tuesday, has now hit 304 home runs as  a catcher (324 overall). That's within two of Yogi Berra and 23 of Johnny  Bench, the all-time leader among catchers with 327. . . . Smalltown Boy: The  press-notes bio White Sox starter Eric King lists the pitcher's residence as  Semi-Valley, Calif. . . . The Angels announced they had sold a total 18,001  season tickets for 1989. That's a slight dropoff from the 18,424 they sold last  year. . . . Bert Blyleven makes his Angel debut tonight on his 38th birthday.  It will be Blyleven's 606th career start and if he wins, it will mark his 255th  career victory. Ex-Dodger Shawn Hillegas will start for Chicago.  </P></p>

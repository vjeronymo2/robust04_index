			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Pounds 5.5m for Bristol warehouse project UNITED MOLASSES is to build a Pounds 5.5m warehouse at Bristol's Royal Portbury Dock which it says will be the biggest in Europe for handling animal feedstuffs and fertilisers. The warehouse is part of a Pounds 15m investment by the dock company to develop handling facilities for agricultural and related products. United Molasses expects the warehouse to be operating by July. It will initially handle soya and maize gluten and fertilisers. Mr Tim Holderness-Roddam, deputy managing director of United, said: 'This will be the biggest and most modern handling facility in Europe, capable of discharging vessels of up to 120,000 tonnes deadweight. 'Much of the non-grain feed entering the UK has been trans-shipped from the Continent. Our handling capability at Bristol will be potentially capable of dealing with the major part of over 3m tonnes of Britain's annual requirement of non-grain feed ingredients.' United, part of the Tate &amp; Lyle sugar group, sees the investment as a key part of its strategy to develop the dry bulk handling of by-products for the animal-feed industry. United and Royal Portbury have set up a joint company, Agricultural Bulk Services (Bristol) to operate the development.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Russian call on Serb sanctions Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's representative on the Bosnia 'contact group', said yesterday the group was intending to recommend that the United Nations Security Council discuss the gradual lifting of sanctions against Serbia. British officials, however, said they would consider 'a gradual lifting of sanctions' only if Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic accepted UN monitors on the border between Serbia and eastern Bosnia, a view shared by the French and Germans. Belgrade has so far refused. Speaking in Berlin after a meeting of the group, which comprises German, US, British, French and Russian diplomats, Mr Churkin said: 'The Serbs in Belgrade must not feel the world is against them. They must be treated as equal partners.' He also warned that countries supporting the lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia 'must be prepared to take responsibility for their actions'.</p>

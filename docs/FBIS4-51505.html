			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Agency Director General Atsushi </F> Kanda by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; date and  place not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI] Former Prime Minister Hosokawa set  "promotion of disarmament" as one of the political aims of his  government. But the position of the Japan Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP] to which you belong seems to be different. What is  your party's position?    [Kand a] In northeast Asia, there is a military threat  against Japan. But we should neither unnecessarily strengthen  our defense capability nor seek disarmament. I do not think  immediate disarmament is necessary because Japan is faced with a  difficult defense situation.    [YOMIURI] There is a view calling for the exercise of the  "right of collective self-defense" in the face of the issue of  North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. What is  your view?    [Kanda] I am rather a dove in the DSP. I want to respect the  spirit of the Constitution. At the same time, however, I have  to think of the situation surrounding Japan.    [YOMIURI] Do you mean the government's interpretation of the  collective self-defense right--which the government has said it  is constitutionally impossible to exercise--will change  depending on the situation?    [Kanda] I think (if the situation surrounding Japan changes)  various opinions will emerge on security and therefore the  government's position on ways to ensure security might possibly  change.    [YOMIURI] How do you respond to the U.S.-proposed Theater  Missile Defense (TMD) plan?    [Kanda] Although I want to positively consider the possible  participation in the plan, this project will cost a huge amount  of money. We have to give careful consideration to the plan  with possible efficiency of the plan in mind.    [YOMIURI] What is your view of Japan's participation in the  UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and the UN Peacekeeping Force  (PKF)?    [Kanda] We want to positively take part in the PKO. As for  the PKF, we have to consider the possibility of joining the PKF  in the future, but it has many problems. Therefore, a careful  study should be made of the possibility of taking part in the  PKF.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Anger greets Labour decision on selection A CHORUS of angry criticism followed a 13-8 vote by the Labour's national executive committee yesterday to postpone the introduction of a one-member, one-vote selection system for MPs. The NEC reversed an earlier decision to put the change to the party's conference and decided instead to include it in a general review of union links. The NEC thus in effect shelved a nine-year campaign by Mr Neil Kinnock, the party's outgoing leader, to exclude unions from the process. Critics of the decision said it had served only to highlight the timidity of the party when faced with the power of union bosses. Several singled out Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, as the main figure behind the reversal. Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North, commented ironically that it only remained for Mr Edmonds to be officially confirmed as party leader. Another high ranking party official described Mr Edmonds' behind-the-scenes activities as akin to 'a rogue elephant' on the loose. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union and an opponent of deep reforms, also let his deep displeasure with the decision be known yesterday. He said he had not been consulted on his inclusion in the review committee and that he may not participate. Defending the vote, Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, insisted that by including the plan in the review the NEC was avoiding making 'piecemeal' changes. He added that while NEC backing for the change on selection procedures was not in doubt, a full-scale 'divorce' between the party and the unions was also not on the cards. Other NEC members made clear that the move was taken to avoid embarrassing Mr John Smith, now certain to be elected leader on July 18. Amid growing union resentment at the public criticism of their influence, the proposal would almost certainly have been voted down had it gone to conference. That confrontation may, nonetheless, take place after the reform-minded AEEU engineering and electrical union yesterday tabled a conference motion backing a one-member, one-vote selection process. In an effort to calm tempers, Mr Kinnock used his last NEC meeting as party leader to argue the case for his proposal. But he then voted to put the issue to the review 'in the interests of party unity'. Others were not so easily mollified. Opponents pointed out that the NEC motion proposing that MP selection be part of the general review was moved by Mr Robin Cook, campaign manager for the shadow chancellor, who in turn was a GMB-sponsored MP.</p>

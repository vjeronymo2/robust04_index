			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ICY STORM WILL MAKE WEEKEND A WET ONE  </P> <P> A cold, wet storm that flooded streets in the Bay Area and dumped heavy snow in  the Sierra slipped into Southern California on Friday, producing prospects of  rain, cool temperatures and unsettled weather over the long holiday weekend.  </P> <P> The new storm, spawned in the Gulf of Alaska, trailed another Arctic-born  weather front that chilled Southern Californians with subnormal low  temperatures earlier this week and then moved on without producing much  moisture.  </P> <P> "It looks like it's setting up a breezy, cool and wet weekend for the  Southland," said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which  provides forecasts for The Times. "Rain is likely from Los Angeles to San Diego  on Saturday."  </P> <P> After that, Dittmann said, he expects more showers on Sunday and early Monday,  when he thinks clearing will begin.  </P> <P> Dittmann urged motorists driving to Sierra ski areas to be cautious.  </P> <P> "It looks like it's going to be snowing in the mountains through the weekend,"  he said.  </P> <P> Warnings of blizzard conditions were issued Friday for travelers heading for  the mountains in Northern California. Winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h. were  swirling "very heavy snow" in the Lake Tahoe area.  </P> <P> Snow fell as low as the 1,000-foot level in the Sierra foothills in northern  Sacramento County.  </P> <P> Even sled dog races scheduled this weekend in Truckee were postponed because of  the blinding snow.  </P> <P> Busy Interstate 80 was closed Friday from the Nevada state line west to Auburn,  Calif., after snowplow operators said they could not keep up with the rapid  accumulation of more than an inch an hour.  </P> <P> Most other Sierra highways were impassable, and chains or snow tires were  recommended just to navigate city streets in Reno and Sparks.  </P> <P> Rich Peacock, spokesman for the Reno Cannon International Airport, said about  half a dozen airplanes were able to land or depart from the facility early  Friday before visibility became too limited for operations to continue.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning in the Owens Valley  because of snow and wind.  </P> <P> As the storm moved through the Bay Area, the weather service reported flooded  streets in urban areas. Monterey was hit with heavy rain and winds up to 65  m.p.h. Residents were warned of possible mud slides.  </P> <P> The state Department of Water Resources, which estimates that California now  has about a 50-50 chance of having another "critical" year of subnormal  precipitation, welcomed the rain and snow.  </P> <P> "We're getting a lot of snow in the mountains," spokesman Don Yoeman said.  "It's a good storm. It's hard to get a handle on it right now . . . but it's  not going to cure our drought situation."  </P> <P> Orange County agriculture officials welcomed the forecast for rain, which in  addition to alleviating drought conditions would prevent freezes like the one  that occurred earlier in the week.  </P> <P> "We need every drop of rain we can get," said Howard Garrett, the county's  deputy agriculture commissioner.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, only 4.19 inches of rain have fallen so far this rainy season,  compared to 7.46 inches last year and the normal rainfall of 8.48 inches,  according to WeatherData's statistics.  </P> <P> The California Farm Bureau said strawberries in Orange County are turning brown  because of the cold. Growers have tried to protect their crops of avocados and  oranges with wind machines and water, the bureau said.  </P> <P> Bill Edwards, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission,  estimated that about one-third of the county's strawberry crop has been lost to  frost. He also said that growers of ornamental nursery plants may lose most of  their stock.  </P> <P> Industry officials estimated that a two-night freeze in Ventura County caused  about $24 million in crop damage.  </P> <P> About 5% to 10% of the county's nearly $400-million-a-year citrus, avocado and  strawberry industries was ruined by temperatures that dropped into the 20s on  Wednesday and Thursday nights, according to preliminary estimates by the  Ventura County agricultural commissioner's office.  </P> <P> Chief Deputy Agricultural Commissioner David Buettner characterized the  estimated losses as moderate compared to more than $51 million in damage caused  by a severe December, 1987, freeze.  </P> <P> In Northern California, Sierra Pacific Power Co. said an equipment failure cut  power to nearly all its customers across northern Nevada and in the eastern  Sierra portion of California. An estimated 230,000 homes and businesses were  without power.  </P> <P> Spokesman Mike Reed said crews were battling heavy drifts to reach substations,  and service was being slowly restored at 4:45 p.m., one hour after the outage  began.  </P> <P> Staff writer Davan Maharaj contributed to this report from Orange County.  </P></p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Latin American foreign borrowings drop to Dollars 2bn Latin American borrowers raised slightly more than Dollars 2bn in foreign bond issues in the second quarter of this year, a sharp drop on the previous quarter's Dollars 6.42bn and the lowest figure since the third quarter of 1992. The Dollars 8.4bn raised in the first half was 21.5 per cent down on the first half of 1993, according to figures compiled by West Merchant Bank. The new issue market recovered in June, when Dollars 990m in new bonds were issued, from a slump in May when only Dollars 345m of bonds were launched. The second quarter decline - following the rise in US interest rates which started in February - was most marked in Mexico, also hit by political uncertainties in an election year. New Mexican issues in the second quarter dropped to Dollars 995m from Dollars 3.46bn in the first; in Argentina the decline was to Dollars 904m from Dollars 1.14bn and in Brazil to only Dollars 81m from Dollars 1.15bn. As a whole, the bank said it expected between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 17bn of new issues this year, against last year's record Dollars 26.6bn. Redemptions of Latin American bond issues will fall slightly this year - but then rise sharply. The bank estimates about Dollars 3.2bn of Latin bond issues will be redeemed this year, down from Dollars 3.2bn last year. But redemptions will rise to Dollars 8.0bn in 1995 and Dollars 8.4bn in 1996, suggesting a continuing heavy demand for bond finance from issuers in Latin American countries. Other developments, mostly reflecting the increased caution of investors and a flight to quality, were: The average maturity of issues declined. The average for the second quarter for all Latin issuers was 3.2 years, compared with 4.5 years in 1993. Mexico continued to issue the longest dated bonds - an average 3.5 years - but suffered the greatest maturity reduction from an average 6.0 years in 1993. Public sector bond issuance has outstripped private sector issuance this year in contrast with 1992 and 1993. This year, 42.2 per cent of the bonds were issued by the private sector, against 60.1 per cent last year and 63.4 per cent in 1992. The fall was almost entirely caused by Mexican borrowers, with the private sector accounting for 29.4 per cent of issuance against 64 per cent last year. Floating rate notes have become more important. They accounted for 38 per cent of issues in the second quarter against 22 per cent in the first and 7 per cent last year.</p>

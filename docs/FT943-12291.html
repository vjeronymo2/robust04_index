			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Arts: Thomas Ades - a special talent / Almeida Festival For its last concert on Sunday, the Almeida Festival chose to give us something quite open-ended, not conclusive at all: a sampling of the music of Thomas Ades, with himself as pianist, four other performers and other music of his own choice. Young Ades is a recent Cambridge product - a double-starred First in music, in fact (we shall not mention that again); much feted in Cambridge, and therefore more widely. A general conviction that there is a rare talent here, though still finding its feet, is supported by his extreme finesse at the keyboard. Like several other critics I was greatly taken by his Park Lane Group recital last year, which included his Still Sorrowing: a most delicately calculated and imaginative piece for 'prepared' piano, with ambitions well beyond a clever exercise. Sunday's Almeida concert, however, left us tantalised. Of the non-Ades music, John Woolrich's Light and Rock songs on Yugoslav folk poems were astringent and effective, with roots alike in Britten and in Berio's Folk Songs. Two Conlon Nancarrow canons, delivered by Ades with uncanny precision, were as deeply unsettling as Nancarrow's studies always are. (Until you've heard some Nancarrow, you don't know how radically your ears can be twisted.) The reduced suite from Stravinsky's Soldier's Tale, with a terrific violinist in Anthony Marwood, fairly crackled. Only Per Norgaard's Lin stood somewhat apart in this programme of lean music; its sober, neo-romantic expansiveness needed different ears from the rest. But Ades himself? Well: he exhibited three quite disparate works. Five Eliot Landscapes was one, for very high soprano - soprano in altissimo: the Canadian Valdine Anderson floated and sculpted her Straussian lines exquisitely, over intricate, multi-fingered whispers from the Ades piano. She reappeared to sing 'Love Me', a delectable 1930s pastiche which will wind through an Ades opera due next year at the Almeida. Finally we had Catch, a one-off tour de force in which the official scenario - a clarinet teased, rejected, and then welcomed and absorbed by the other instruments - was realised in musical terms that went well beyond the simple joke. All these pieces were musical mousetraps: intricate mechanisms, eccentric but very carefully determined, which in due course sprang the traps that were their point. Very clever exercises, and original; the fine-spun detail answers perfectly to his guiding intentions. We shall have to wait for more and larger Ades music, nonetheless, to discover how much more he has to say. So far, his is evidently a special talent.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow shows resilience after fall led by bonds Wall Street US share prices lost ground yesterday after a sell-off in the US Treasury market put investors on the defensive, but the blue chip indicator finished well above the day's worst, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chips was finally 7.88 off at 3,967.66, after fighting back from a 25-point deficit at midday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.29 at 480.71 and the Nasdaq composite relinquished 1.78 at 797.79. New York SE volume, at 318.3m shares, was heavy and falls outscored advances at the close by 1,180 to 919. After a record-breaking session for most market measures and an 11-point advance by the Dow the previous day, stocks were ripe for a setback. Bonds provided the trigger, as growing speculation that the Federal Reserve would soon tighten its accommodative monetary policy sent a shiver through the US Treasury market. Prices across the yield curve slid, with the benchmark 30-year security down  11/32 to 99 1/4 in late trading. The day's economic news was mixed, and somewhat inconclusive. The Labor Department reported a 59,000 jump in weekly claims for unemployment benefit, but the unfavourable trend was largely blamed on the cold weather and disruption caused by the Los Angeles earthquake. The Commerce Department said that December factory orders were up 1.2 per cent. The figure was strong, but it fell just below the consensus forecast of 1.4 per cent. Most investors were focusing their attention on today's report on January employment data, which may prove to be the last bit of evidence the Fed requires before taking action. Share prices of all three big US car makers rallied on news that the big chill failed to stall January sales. General Motors, boasting a 14.8 per cent increase in car sales, powered Dollars 1 1/2 ahead to Dollars 63. Ford, with some impressive light truck figures, gained Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 69 3/8 . Chrysler kept pace with a Dollars 1 1/4 spurt to Dollars 62 1/2 . Under the threat of higher short-term interest rates, many banking issues were set back. JP Morgan, a Dow Industrial component, was Dollars 1 down at Dollars 70 7/8 , Citicorp shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 42 1/2 and First Chicago declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/4 . Retailers also released data on January sales which generally held up well under the adverse weather conditions. Wal-Mart rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 28 on the news and the Gap Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 41 5/8 . But Woolworth fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 5/8 after warning of a fourth-quarter earnings downturn. Canada A further mild retreat was seen in Toronto in record trading volume, leaving the TSE 300 index 13.1 easier at 4,560.3 and declines outnumbering advances by 426 to 370. Volume expanded to 106.4m shares. Maclean Hunter, CDollars 1 5/8 higher at CDollars 17, and Rogers Communications 'B', CDollars  3/4 lower at CDollars 20 5/8 , continued to be the focus of much trading activity on Wednesday's news that Rogers intends to make an offer for Maclean.</p>

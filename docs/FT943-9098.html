			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Beating the big freeze in Ulan Bator Having hauled equipment 8,000km across the former Soviet Union under armed guard, an Anglo-German joint venture is racing against time to beat the big freeze in an attempt to modernise Mongolia's only international airport at Ulan Bator. In two months it will be too cold to work outside. Before then the contractors - Wimpey of the UK and Philipp Holzmann of Germany - must reassemble some of their 500 tonnes of construction equipment, knowing that the nearest spares are seven time zones away. The equipment for the airport, including a 140 tonne British asphalt mixing plant cut into component parts and accompanied by armed guards, took 16 days to travel from Kosice in Slovakia to the Mongolian capital. The parts need to be welded back together before contractors can start resurfacing the 3,200 metre runway. But the intense cold is just one of the problems which will have to be overcome by the two companies which won the Dollars 31m (Pounds 20m) contract. Almost all the equipment and materials needed to resurface the runway, overhaul aircraft taxi and parking areas, construct a new control tower and refurbish the airport terminal will need to be imported. The asphalt mixing plant and other construction equipment and spares, much of it used by Wimpey on an airport contract in Slovakia, was transported in two trains. A mobile crane, on a defective truck, is still making slow progress through Siberia. The rest of the equipment, including electric generators to augment the shaky Mongolian power supply, has arrived safely. The rifle-toting guards, veterans of the Afghan war, were customary on freight trains crossing the former Soviet Union, said Mr Nick Connor, general manager of Wimpey Asphalt's overseas division. In this case, the only pilfering that occurred was inside Slovakia when lights for night working and a small electric motor were stolen. Night work, out of doors, will become impossible by mid-September. By the end of October all outside work will halt until spring. Resurfacing the runway, due to be completed by the end of this year, must start in the next fortnight if the timetable is to be met. Agreements have still to be reached with Russian oil refineries which, because of shortages in Mongolia, will have to supply 2,000 tonnes of bitumen for asphalt as well as 500 tonnes of diesel and 150 tonnes of petrol. Even propane gas used to heat asphalt laying pavers will need to be imported. Negotiations are taking place with four refineries. The nearest is at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, 800km from Ulan Bator. The farthest is 8,000km away at Ukhta close to the Artic circle. One of the problems for the contractors is that 86 per cent of the finance for the project comes from the Asian Development Bank which stipulates that purchases of equipment and materials can be made only from member countries, which excludes Russia. The contract also involves moving Russian-built navigation equipment to work alongside newly purchased western navigation aids. Engineers, employed by an east German sub-contractor with experience of Russian equipment, will work on the project. Slovakian engineers who worked with Wimpey in Slovakia will help train Mongolian construction workers who cost Dollars 150 (Pounds 96.70) a month in pay and keep compared with Dollars 6,500 a month for a European worker. That was 40 Mongolians for the price of one European, Mr Connor pointed out. 'There is no way we could complete the job for this price without using local labour. At the peak we will employ about 200 workers, of which three quarters will be Mongolian.' Plant is a different matter. Most local equipment comes from the former Soviet Union. In terms of technical sophistication and reliability it is 20-30 years behind that used in the west, the Wimpey boss said. Ulan Bator has a population of some 600,000 people of which about half live in yurts, the traditional tent-like home of the nomadic Mongolian people. Expatriate construction workers, however, will be housed in flats connected to the Russian hospital where Wimpey and Holzmann have their offices. The hospital needs to raise finance to remain operational and is renting out part of its space to commercial concerns. It will also provide medical insurance at Dollars 20 per person to Wimpey and Holzmann. Both companies plan to bid for further work in Mongolia with several large road contracts expected to go to international tender. After the struggle of getting its equipment to Ulan Bator, Wimpey hopes not to have to haul it so far for the next job.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The defense of Gorazde has fallen, and I believe  that the situation is out of control, said Vitaliy Churkin, the  Russian president's special envoy, today at Zagreb Airport  before returning to Moscow. He believes that at present the  most important thing for the Serbs is the lifting of  international sanctions against them. All they have to do is to  stop attacking Gorazde. However, the Serbs are not prepared to  do it, he said.</p>

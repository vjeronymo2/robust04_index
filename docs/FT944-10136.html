			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Bolivia needs Dollars 2bn to stem cocaine output Bolivia needs at least Dollars 2bn in foreign aid to begin eradicating its illegal but lucrative cocaine industry, the country's president said yesterday, AP reports from La Paz. President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada said at a news conference that the government had a plan to replace coca leaf production - the raw material processed into cocaine - with other cash crops and industry. 'We cannot wait for the demand side of cocaine to be resolved; it is important that we deal with the production side,' he said. 'It is more convenient to invest Dollars 1m in development and substituting coca fields than Dollars 1bn in reducing demand and combating drug traffickers.' The success of the government's plan is dependent on foreign aid of at least Dollars 2bn and the consensus of Bolivian society, Mr Sanchez de Lozada said. The plan would convert the main coca leaf producing region of Chapare into an industrial park to be developed with the active participation of private business. A meeting of the country's top political leaders is set for next week to discuss and reach a consensus on this plan. At least 300,000 people in the Chapare region depend on coca cultivation for their livelihood. Coca leaf has been grown for centuries in Bolivia; it is used as a tea for religious rites and chewed by farmers and miners to help combat the effects of high altitude and hunger. Most of the leaf devoted to traditional uses is grown on the eastern slopes of the Andes, while the coca for cocaine - about 40,000 hectares - is grown in the Chapare, a lush sub-tropical region in the middle of the country. Coca leaf farmers say that no other crop provides the income and assured markets and have resisted switching from coca to other crops until they are convinced they can earn the same. The plan includes converting fields to other crops, relocating farmers to other regions of the country and establishing industrial plants in areas not suitable for farming. The government has begun negotiations with the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the United Nations to finance this programme. Bolivia, an impoverished country of 7m people, produces an estimated quarter of the world's coca leaf that is processed into cocaine.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Peel Holdings rises to Pounds 10.2m - Shares fall 12p to 298p on disappointing growth in net asset value Peel Holdings, the property company that owns the Manchester Ship Canal, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.2m for the year to March 31, up from Pounds 9.4m in 1993. The shares fell 12p to 298p, reflecting a lower-than-expected increase in net asset value per share, which rose only 13p to 328p, despite the recovery in the UK property market. The results followed the announcement last Friday that the Court of Appeal had quashed planning permission for Peel's proposed Pounds 200m shopping centre at Dumplington, Greater Manchester. But the company remains optimistic that its appeal will be successful. The Dumplington development was at the centre of Peel's eight-year battle to gain control of Manchester Ship Canal. This site remains on the books valued at Pounds 18.1m, but Mr Peter Scott, managing director, said this was a comfortable 'fall-back value.' Turnover during the year fell marginally to Pounds 67.6m (Pounds 68.1m), with total net rental income rising from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 43.2m, despite Pounds 2.52m of fresh annualised voids. The company's portfolio is currently carrying voids of Pounds 5.2m, and this was reflected in an external valuation of the office and industrial properties, which lowered their values by 16 per cent and 19 per cent respectively, compared with the last external valuation in 1991. Overall, however, property values rose by Pounds 9.7m, due to a 28 per cent increase in values of out-of-town retail centres, and increases in overseas property. The company has also reinstated a property development programme, but it is proceeding only where sufficient pre-sales and pre-lets can be achieved. It has only Pounds 10m tied up in development projects. The port operations contributed operating profit of Pounds 3.8m, but suffered a further Pounds 1.22m from voluntary severance costs. The company's net debt has increased by Pounds 33m to Pounds 369.1m, as a result of the buy-out of the minority shareholders in Manchester Ship Canal last year. Gearing amounts to 116 per cent, but interest payable fell from Pounds 37.2m to Pounds 36.1m, due to lower interest rates. Last November, the company issued Pounds 37.4m of 8.59 per cent long-term bonds, and its fixed average borrowing cost is now 10.05 per cent. The recommended final dividend of 3.2p makes a total of 4.5p (4p) for the year. Earnings per share were 6.11p (2.41p).</p>

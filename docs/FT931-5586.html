			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Challenge to news agency THE PRESS Association, the UK's national news agency, appears to be facing the strongest challenge to its effective monopoly for decades. Two regional newspaper groups, Northcliffe Newspapers and Westminster Press, have decided to extend the trial of their own internal service, UK News, until the end of the this month. A decision will then be taken on whether to make UK News a permanent business which will try to recruit further subscribers. A team of more than 20 journalists at UK News headquarters in Leicester puts together a daily file of about 15,000 words, making it available to newspapers ranging from The Gloucester Echo at Cheltenham to the Evening Advertiser at Swindon. UK News can call on the work of more than 1,700 journalists from the two newspaper groups around the country. Critics of the PA service say that the 100,000 or so words filed each day are too unwieldly and costly for small regional dailies to handle and that the fees - ranging from more than Pounds 60,000 a year to over Pounds 200,000 - are too high. Mr Richard Wooldridge, editorial director of Westminster Press - which, like the Financial Times, is part of the Pearson Group - said he was pleased with the UK News's quality and speed of output. An attempt in 1991 to set up an alternative to PA, which included the Birmingham Post and Mail, did not succeed. It is not yet clear whether UK News will be a rival to PA, which is owned by the regional and local press, or is merely an attempt to change the nature and cost of the PA service. Mr Colin Webb, editor-in-chief of PA, would only say last night that the agency was in 'proper talks' with Westminster Press and Northcliffe Newspapers.</p>

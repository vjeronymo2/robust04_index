			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The provincial party committee held a monthly  meeting yesterday morning [6 April] to relay the spirit of the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC].  Governor Tian Chengping, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, presided over the meeting, at which Huanjue  Cenam, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing  committee, relayed the spirit of the Second Session of the  Eighth NPC. [passage omitted]    Governor Tian Chengping, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, delivered a speech in which he called for  implementing comprehensively the spirit of the Second Session of  the Eighth NPC. He stated: It is necessary to organize the  broad masses of cadres, and especially leading cadres, to  continually and profoundly study the 'Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping," volume three; the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics; the basic theory of the socialist  market economy; and the relevant state principles, policies,  laws, and decrees; as well as to firmly master the principal  spirit of each and every major reform; unify ideology; work for,  submit to, and serve the overall interests; strive to  successfully push ahead with reforms; work out new reform  measures; gradually resolve the province's in-depth  contradictions; and deepen reforms.    Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: With the central  financial strength becoming stronger with each passing day, the  state gradually will make more investment in and accelerate the  economic exploitation of central and west China. Therefore, we  should firmly grasp the current excellent opportunity to quicken  the pace of resource exploitation and economic development;  bring into full play Qinghai's superior resources; take full  advantage of the fact that Qinghai has a relatively small  population; make redoubled efforts to build each and every  locally based small and medium-sized resource exploitation  project; secure more state investment in the locally based large  and medium-sized construction projects; and strive to accelerate  resource exploitation by developing lateral economic  associations with neighboring provinces and regions, inviting  more foreign and domestic funds; and developing compensation  trade.    Governor Tian Chengping maintained: It is also necessary to  energetically and simultaneously build both the spiritual and  material civilizations; to vigorously strengthen and improve  ideological and propaganda work; to rely on the broad masses of  people; to enhance solidarity; to vigorously push ahead with all  types of work; to implement to the letter each and every basic  party and state principle, as well as the spirit of the current  meeting; to unify ideology; to strengthen confidence; to make  concerted efforts; and to make greater contributions to building  a stronger and more prosperous Qinghai.</p>

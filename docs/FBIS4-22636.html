			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, economist, by Yelena </F> Vishnevskaya; place and date not given: "Not To Break Under the  Burden of Debt"]    [Text] What is happening to the economy? Why is the  crisis worsening? The questions that many reputable economists  attempt to answer most often draw quite fuzzy answers. The  "Gaydar team" appears to have done everything properly at the  outset: It liberated the economy from the Gosplan [State  Planning Committee] and the Gossnab [State Committee for  Material and Technical Supply] and other legacies of the old  system, decontrolled prices, and put production under the power  of the "invisible hand" of the market. However, we have somehow  gotten stuck at the accomplishments of summer 1992.... This is  fraught with consequences! As is known, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy has  his own view of what is happening, his own predictions for the  future, and also his own program for overcoming the crisis.  Grigoriy Alekseyevich believes that the main point is for us not  to break under the burden of debt.    [Yavlinskiy] At present, the economy of the country is under  pressure from a powerful spring of inflation which was  compressed precisely by the Gaydar government. Total debts for  last year by virtue of state procurement and settlements with  sectors receiving money from the budget now comes to about 5  percent of the gross national product. In the fourth quarter  alone, the growth of credit outlays came to 75 percent of growth  during all of 1993. It comes to approximately 15 trillion rubles  [R]. All this is a consequence of decisions made previously.    [Vishnevskaya] However, public opinion is that the "fathers  of reform" have left the government, and the latter is now  rolling back slowly but surely. Preferences for the  military-industrial complex and subsidies for agriculture have  already been promised.... Could it be that the past two years  have been in vain?    [Yavlinskiy] That the new government could lead Russia back  is not the trouble. There is no way back anymore. However, not  only does the new government lack a program, it also hardly has  any idea of the situation that is beginning to emerge this year.  It is this situation that conceals the danger! The danger is  that, with its vision of reforms, the new government may embark  on a path of extensively handing out easy credit and subsidies  from the budget. Trillions of rubles have already been promised  to various sectors. To be sure, it has not yet come to making  payments; they are talking about stage-by-stage payment of the  debt. However, how long will the government be able to resist  powerful pressure from sectoral lobbyists and evade meeting its  own obligations? The temptation to become a kind and good  government is great; besides, sectoral lobbies are very strong  in the government.    To be sure, the latest events indicate that the government  expects to stay the old course for a while longer. Under such  circumstances, our analysis outlined above may end up shifted in  time somewhat in the direction of delay; on the other hand, the  projected crisis may turn out to be deeper....    [Vishnevskaya] So, what may lie ahead for us? Under the  circumstances, what scenario for the development of events do  you see for the coming year, especially because the first  quarter is already coming to the end, and its preliminary  results can be assessed?    [Yavlinskiy] The first quarter took pressure from the credit  outlays of last year and the need to pay back the debts of the  budget which, in turn, were induced by a chain of nonpayments  throughout the economy. This is why the spring will apparently  become the first critical mark this year. A quite sharp upsurge  in inflation is possible in the spring in conjunction with the  infusion of money in the first quarter. The budget deficit will  grow considerably. Spring will be difficult and this will, of  course, provide the background for changes in the political  sphere. Summer could be relatively stable, but then at a new  level of the critical phenomena which I discussed. The fall, the  second critical mark, gives rise to the greatest concern. At  this point the risk of losing control over inflation and a slump  in production is high. In the fall, inflation may exceed the 50  percent level, and it will be very hard, if not impossible, to  manage.    [Vishnevskaya] Why should this definitely happen in the  fall?  The government intends to pay the debts back to rural residents  virtually right away. Besides, procurement of agricultural  products by the state is far less now....    [Yavlinskiy] The volume of state procurement is large enough  to cause both an aggravation of the budget deficit and an  increase in effective demand. However, this is only the first  alarming factor of the coming summer. An increase in energy  resource prices is the second. The pressure of cost-push  inflation through energy resources will be extremely serious and  very extensive by this fall.    [Vishnevskaya] What awaits us by the end of the year in your  scenario?    [Yavlinskiy] The slump in production may exceed 52 percent  of  the 1989 level--the last year of growth. The absence of  investment will become the fundamental, root cause of the slump.    [Vishnevskaya] This cause has been affecting the status of  production for a long time....    [Yavlinskiy] Its effect is exacerbated by another cause,  which does not appear to be new. It is the loss of markets for  sales. We have lost not just Western markets. Markets in the CIS  have been lost in conjunction with the cancellation of an  economic treaty with the republics of the former USSR and an  unwise attitude toward economic integration with them. Beginning  15 June of last year we managed to lose at an accelerated rate  our own, Russian market for our industry because of the  situation with the exchange rate of the dollar. As the sharp  growth of prices continued, the Central Bank maintained the  artificial exchange rate of the ruble against the dollar for so  long that it became more advantageous to import goods rather  than have them produced by domestic industry. The loss of  domestic markets by the latter has virtually become an  accomplished fact. Of course, we can recover these markets.  However, it is now going to cost us in the form of a sharp  decline in the exchange rate over a quite lengthy period of time.    [Vishnevskaya] However, yet another weighty factor which  induces a drop in production has appeared or rather become  sharply more pronounced: Labor collectives are increasingly  striving to use available funds for consumption rather than  investing them in the development of production.    [Yavlinskiy] This is a new problem generated as a result of  the kind of privatization of large enterprises the Gaydar  government accepted and conducted, and which the Chernomyrdin  government is continuing. Therefore, rather than referring to a  structural fall which is generally necessary, we are compelled  to refer to a general slump which has advanced to such a stage  that it has now become a factor in the accident rate, various  production stoppages for technical reasons, and other major  troubles which call for 10-fold expenditures from the budget.    [Vishnevskaya] To your mind, what can be done to prevent,  after all, the development of events in keeping with the quite  gloomy scenario outlined here?    [Yavlinskiy] Trying to keep inflation to a rate of 20  percent  a month in 1994 is the foremost among many urgent tasks. To this  end it is necessary, first, to bring the exchange rate of the  dollar into line with the dynamics of inflation. If the dynamics  of the market rate do not correspond to that projected, the  government should compensate for the difference those with whom  it has concluded futures transactions. Second, by no means and  under no circumstances may there be a transition to a policy of  easy credit and direct subsidies. Instead, I am proposing a  painful measure, but the only correct one under such conditions:  a reduction in the interest rate, with the volume of credit  being administratively regulated. Enterprises are simply not in  a position to take out loans given the current interest rate!  This would be a temporary measure because in principle it is  necessary to strive for an interest rate that exceeds the rate  of inflation in the country.    Third, the policy of preferences for exporters should be  revised sharply in order to prevent the outflow of foreign  exchange from the country. Of course, the tax on the difference  in exchange rates, the most powerful incentive for the  exportation of funds, should be canceled immediately.    [Vishnevskaya] However, whether we like it or not, the  problem of debt due to state procurement remains. Will this  inflationary mine be rendered less dangerous if the measures you  are proposing are implemented?    [Yavlinskiy] The signing of contracts for the delivery of  foodstuffs to the state stocks in the fall should begin right  now! This would make it possible to spread all transactions and  expenditures throughout the year and not accumulate the entire  backlog of debt in the fall. Reductions in the volume of state  procurement for current consumption should also begin without  delay. It is necessary to privatize the entire procurement  infrastructure, primarily the elevators, right now. These are  absolutely urgent measures which would make it possible to bring  inflation under control within a year if they were taken  immediately.    [Vishnevskaya] And if they were not?    [Yavlinskiy] Then we will mark time again and endlessly  complain about "the forces hindering reforms...."</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Fall in steel use forecast CONSUMPTION of steel in the industrialised countries will fall by 3 per cent this year to 297m tonnes, reflecting sharp declines in the European Community and Japanese markets, according to the International Iron and Steel Institute, Andrew Baxter reports. Consumption in the EC, excluding eastern Germany, is expected to fall by nearly 9m tonnes or 8 per cent from the 1992 level, and will recover by only 3m tonnes in 1994, the institute said yesterday. In Japan, it is expected to fall by 3m tonnes or 4 per cent this year, with a further decline seen next year. The decline reflects the recession in many steel-consuming industries, and is offset by a predicted 5 per cent rise in developing countries' consumption to 135m tonnes this year. Overall, consumption in the western world - industrialised and developing countries - is forecast to fall by 1 per cent this year to 432m tonnes, and to rise by 2.7 per cent next year to 443m tonnes. Total world consumption is predicted to fall by 1 per cent this year to 611m tonnes.</p>

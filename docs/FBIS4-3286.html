			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng, delivering a speech at the parliament of Uzbekistan here  this afternoon, stated a four-point basic policy of the Chinese  Government for developing relations with Central Asian nations.    Li, referring to the frequent exchange of visits between  leaders of China and Central Asian nations, said "this signifies  that relations between China and Central Asian nations have  entered a new era."    The friendship between the Chinese people and their  counterparts in Central Asia dates back to ancient times, he  said.    "The Central Asian countries, as a main passage along the  silk-road, contributed significantly not only to brisk  commercial and cultural exchanges between Asia and Europe, but  also to the advancement of civilization and progress of  mankind," Li added.    Today, with increasing contact with the rest of the world,  the Central Asian nations are "writing new chapters" of  promoting common development and friendly exchanges of Asia and  Europe, he said.    China attaches great importance to its relations with  Central  Asian countries and, together with them, "we are willing to work  for the building of a new silk-road, with a perspective towards  the future and the next century," Li said.    Li summed up China's basic policy on developing relations  with the Central Asian nations in four points.    The first point is "maintaining goodneighborly relations and  peaceful coexistence."    China and Central Asian nations are close neighbors, with  some sharing common borders, Li noted. "it is the shared desire  of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples to be friendly  neighbors, for it serves our fundamental interests."    "As the Chinese people are concentrating on building up  their  own country, they need a long-term stable and peaceful  international environment, a good surrounding environment in  particular," he said.    "We have always cherished a good will towards the Central  Asian peoples, and will remain your good friends and neighbor  forever," he noted.    China seeks no self-interests or sphere of influence in the  world, including this region, Li stated. "Even when China  becomes more developed or prosperous in the future, it will  never seek hegemonism or power politics, either. Instead, China  will always maintain equal and friendly relations with its  neighbors."    "You can be fully confident that no matter what happens in  the world, China will not change this policy," he said,  stressing that "we keep our words."    The second point is "promoting cooperation of equality and  mutual benefit and seeking common prosperity."    "Economic cooperation and trade are an important aspect of  our bilateral relations," Li said, adding that "a good beginning  has already been made, but much more remains to be done."    In developing economic cooperation with the Central Asian  nations, China strictly abides by the principle of equality and  mutual benefit, and attaches no political conditions, the  Chinese premier said.    "We would like to work with all the Central Asian countries  to constantly improve the environment, expand the scope and  enhance the quality and level of cooperation, and with mutual  benefit, march along the path of common development," he said.    The third point of the policy is "respecting the independent  choice of the Central Asian peoples and never interfering in  their internal affairs."    As the world is diversified, the national conditions of the  Central Asian nations differ from each other, Li noted.    "There has never been and can never be a unified mode of  development that suits the realities of all countries," he said.  "We believe that the Central Asian nations, just like China and  other countries in the world, are entitled to independently  choose the social system, concepts of values and path of  development compatible with their national conditions."    He expressed the conviction that the Central Asian nations  are fully capable of "handling well their own matters."    The fourth point Li stated is "respecting other countries'  independence and sovereignty and contributing to regional  stability."    China sincerely hopes to see the maintenance of long-term  peace and stability in central Asia, Li said. "We appreciate  and support all efforts made by central Asian countries to  safeguard their independence and sovereignty, promote regional  peace and stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation  among nations."    "The development of our relations with any Central Asian  nation is not directed against any third country, and we are  willing to see the Central Asian countries living in harmony  with each other," he said.    Also, China is ready to develop friendly relations with all  countries in the world, particularly the neighboring nations,  including Russia and other CIS countries, Li said.    "The development of Central Asian nations depends on world  peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and  prosperous Central Asia," he said.</p>

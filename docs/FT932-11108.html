			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Concern grows over health of Li Peng MR LI PENG, China's 65-year-old premier, has not been sighted in public for two weeks, prompting speculation that he may be suffering from a more serious illness than first indicated. Chinese officials explained his failure to keep an appointment with visiting Philippine President Fidel Ramos late last month by saying that he was suffering from a cold, and that he had been taken to hospital. The Chinese language Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported on Monday that Mr Li had been suffering from heart problems. Mr Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, has been endeavouring to dampen speculation about Mr Li's health, telling reporters: 'There's no point speculating about. . . He's just got a cold. That's very common.' Western officials discount a 'political illness'. Mr Li was recently re-confirmed at a session of China's parliament, or National People's Congress, to a second five-year term. No hint has appeared that he might be in political difficulties. Health details of China's leadership are normally closely guarded secrets. China's premier was photographed playing tennis on April 20 with Mr Goh Chok Tong, the visiting Singapore prime minister. There was no indication then of any infirmity, although photographers noted that Mr Li remained on court only for about 15 minutes. His disappearance has inevitably revived discussion about the health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's 88-year-old senior leader, who was last sighted in Shanghai in January during the spring festival.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Board approach at Intl Food Directors of International Food Machinery said yesterday that approaches had been received from two parties interested in strengthening management and injecting working cap-ital. They added that the approaches were at a preliminary stage and that a further statement would be made as soon as practicable. Commenting on the 1993 year, directors said that while no indication of the results could yet be given, trading in the last two months 'continued to be poor.' For 1992 profits before tax totalled Pounds 1.05m. In the opening six months of 1993 they rose from Pounds 292,000 to Pounds 878,000 but in November the company warned that the full year figures were likely to be 'substantially below' market estimates. The food processing and refrigeration equipment company came to market in December 1992 with the shares priced at 51p. They closed 3p lower yesterday at 20p.</p>

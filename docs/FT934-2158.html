			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Whessoe slips 11% to Pounds 7.14m After four years of steadily increasing profits, Whessoe, the instrumentation and control and piping systems group, saw pre-tax profits slip almost 11 per cent, from Pounds 7.98m to Pounds 7.14m, in the year to September 30. Turnover expanded to Pounds 99.7m (Pounds 79.7m). Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, said the profits decline was mainly the result of 'severe market trading conditions', and consequent pressure on margins, in certain of the group's markets. Specifically he said that there had been a certain lack of activity at Connex and Aiton, the group's US and UK piping systems businesses respectively. He suggested that the government's pit closure programme had adversely affected Aiton by depressing UK demand for power station piping systems. Further, he said that Varec, in the liquid instrumentation and control division, had a 'mixed year' with a second-half downturn in the US. Mr Fleetwood added that the project engineering division had still not been sold. In October Whessoe gained the approval of the Norwegian government for the Pounds 21.8m acquisition of Autronica, the marine instrumentation and fire detection company which was part of the group's move away from dependence on the contract-based business of its pipework activities. Consequently only two months of Autronica's trading results have been included: it made profits of Pounds 397,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.61m. However, Mr Fleetwood said the sharp increase in group net operating expenses to Pounds 17.8m (Pounds 12.8m) was due to the consolidation of Autronica. A pension surplus of Pounds 977,000 was all but offset by a provision against the discontinuation of Whessoe Projects and interest receivable fell to Pounds 38,000 (Pounds 909,000) as Whessoe built up borrowings of Pounds 12.9m (nil) by buying Autronica. Earnings per share under FRS 3 were 18.8p (25.04p) and adjusted were 20.97p (25.16p). A final dividend of 5.9p is proposed for a total of 8.2p (8p).</p>

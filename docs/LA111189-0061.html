			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS AND PLANTERS  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> Ask a nurseryman now for the correct spray to use on your dormant plants to  control pests and diseases.  </P> <P> Plant cyclamen for an endless show of color during the coolest and wettest  months of the year.  </P> <P> Keep those annuals you planted last month well watered and be sure to feed them  this month.  </P> <P> House plants need less water as the days get shorter and skies grow dimmer,  especially those in plastic pots (which don't breathe like clay pots); keep an  eye on those near the fireplace or heater, though.  </P></p>

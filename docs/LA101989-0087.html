			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMARILLO READIES FOR MT. SAC ATTACK  </P> <P> Camarillo High's powerhouse boys' cross-country team, second in the Mt. San  Antonio College Invitational last year, will make another run at the event's  team sweepstakes title Saturday at Mt. SAC in Walnut.  </P> <P> However, the Scorpions, who were defeated by Christian Brothers Academy (N.J.),  96-124, in the 1988 meet, will not have an easier task this year.  </P> <P> Camarillo, ranked No. 1 in the state after consecutive fourth-place finishes in  the state Division I championships in 1987 and '88, must face the No. 2-  through No. 5-ranked teams in Concord De La Salle, Canyon Country Canyon,  Arroyo Grande and Agoura.  </P> <P> Also in attendance will be Santa Ana Saddleback and Glendale Hoover, ranked  fourth and fifth in the Southern Section 4-A Division; Hart, top ranked in the  3-A; and L. A. Belmont, winner of seven consecutive City Section titles from  1982 to '88.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of teams at Mt. SAC that scare me," Camarillo Coach Mike Smith  said. "All the top teams are capable of beating each other."  </P> <P> Smith's assessment is right on.  </P> <P> Agoura, top ranked in the 2-A, upended Canyon, the No. 2 seeded in the 4-A,  64-69, in the Kenny Staub Invitational Oct. 7. That same weekend, the Scorpions  defeated Concord De La Salle, 49-95, for their second consecutive Stanford  Invitational crown.  </P> <P> Camarillo, led by its senior foursome of Shawn Goetzinger (15:26 at Mt. SAC  last year), Abe Valdez (15:31), Derek Kite (15:55) and Chad Malesich (15:59),  unlike last year, isn't resting on its laurels just yet.  </P> <P> "After last year, (my runners) think that Stanford beat us, not the state  meet," Smith said.  </P> <P> After being ranked No. 1 in the 4-A through much of the 1988 season and having  whipped a highly regarded Bend High (Ore.) squad at Stanford, Camarillo dropped  a spine-tingler, 86-90, to Dana Hills, the eventual state Division I champion,  in the 4-A final.  </P> <P> "Last year after Stanford we continued to train hard and run well," Smith said,  "but I think we thought it was going to come a little easier than it was going  to."  </P> <P> The boys' invitational sweepstakes race begins at 9:43 a.m. and the girls' team  sweepstakes competition starts at 10:47.  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, Buena, second-ranked in the 4-A, and Channel Islands  (sixth) will meet Agoura and Arroyo Grande, the Nos. 1 and 2 teams in the 2-A,  in the team sweepstakes race.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs have won six Channel League titles in a row under Coach Steve  Blum. Channel Islands, coached by Debbie Blum, Steve's wife, finished 12th in  the 4-A championships last year. Agoura has been runner-up in the state  Division I race the past two years.  </P></p>

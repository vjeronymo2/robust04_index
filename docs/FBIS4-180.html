			<p>BFN     [Text] Bamako, 1 Apr (AFP) -- The residence of the French  consul general here was attacked and looted by a group of youths  yesterday, a reliable source disclosed. The assailants, after  overpowering the watchman, raided the residence, which they  ransacked and looted, taking away valuable objects and money.    The attack, which did not result in casualties, has not been  claimed but various sources attribute it to a new organization  called the "Armed Resistance Group," which recently released a  leaflet carrying threats to attack foreign interests --  particularly, French, American, and German -- in Mali.  According to official sources, there is no information about  the perpetrators of the attack, which coincided with the  political opposition's ghost city operation organized in Bamako  to demand the reopening of schools closed since mid-February by  the government.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: BZW launches commodities fund Barclays de Zoete Wedd yesterday launched a new commodities investment fund which it claims is the first fund to be listed on the London Stock Exchange offering investors access to a wide range of commodities. The Jersey-based investment fund, which will be managed by BZW Investment Management (BZWIM), has already attracted Pounds 70m of institutional interest. A shelf registration has been filed with the London Stock Exchange putting a maximum of Pounds 200m on the amount of the fund. Mr Ronald Gould, the managing director of BZWIM, said that 'despite difficult general market conditions, there has been widespread global interest' in the commodities fund 'based on the strong investment outlook for commodities and their powerful diversification benefits'. Investor interest in real assets, such as commodities, has been aroused recently following the strong economic upturn in parts of Europe and the US, which has caused sharp rises in some commodity prices, coupled with signs of a resurgence in inflation and rising interest rates. Commodities can be used as a hedge against inflation and as a play on economic growth. The minimum investment required by the fund is Pounds 5,000. The fund was due to be launched in early September. However, unexpectedly strong interest from Japanese investors prompted a delay in the publication of the fund's pathfinder prospectus to allow time for it to get clearance from Japan's ministry of finance. Japanese investors account for around Pounds 10m of the shares already placed. The fund will aim to outperform the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index by giving a greater weighting to industrial materials and energy, which BZW thinks should benefit the most from stronger economic growth.</p>

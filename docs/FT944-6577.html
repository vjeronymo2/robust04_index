			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Drawn to the kitchen sink - William Packer reviews the work of five artists in vogue during the 1950s Give a dog a bad name - but with art it would seem that any name will stick. It was remarked in the mid-1950s that certain younger realist painters and writers were fixing upon the more unkempt and informal features of domestic life: the lovely Mary Ure at the ironing-board, the unmade bed, the lavatory bowl, the breakfast-table, the kitchen sink itself. And 'Kitchen Sink' was taken up at once, and still stands, as the epithet by which to characterise much of the work, indeed the very mood, of the entire period. That it was only ever a partial truth would hardly disqualify so patently catchy and convenient a term. But it had its effects, even so, and not all of them benign. It might be all very well in relation to Look Back in Anger, or to John Bratby's paintings of table-tops, or Jack Smith's babies, prams and sink. But was it always quite so apropos? What about Lucky Jim or Godot? More to the point, what about the still-lifes and butchers' shops of Peter Coker, the fields and streams of Edward Middleditch, the Italian farmyards and rooftops of Derrick Greaves? Give a dog a bad name: so when the mood of the moment lightened with the turn of the decade, and the arch and ironical references of Pop-Art replaced a supposed realist gloom, small wonder that all these painters seemed suddenly so irrelevant and passe, ripe for the rubbish bin. Greaves, Smith, Middleditch and Bratby had together represented Britain at the Venice Biennale of 1956. By the mid-1960s, only Smith, who had since 'gone abstract', still enjoyed any critical credibility at all. The critical rehabilitation, which at times amounts to rediscovery, of the painting of the 1950s has been one of the most positive and encouraging critical developments of recent years. For it reminds us that no critical orthodoxy is either permanent or necessarily narrow, and suggests besides that good work eventually will receive its due. The process continues happily with this handsome show at the Mayor Gallery, in which a considerable emphasis is placed upon the role of drawing in relation to painting. What emerges is that drawing as a discipline is no mere thing of indulgent self-expression, though inevitably the self is expressed. Nor is it simply a matter of technical mastery or demonstration, though of course skill is not to be sniffed at. Rather it is a discipline quite as much of the eye and the mind as of the hand, of observation, understanding and enquiry. The particular subject is studied, the useful record of information made, the larger composition proposed and modified through variation. It is a practical and unselfconscious business, out of which things of great power and beauty emerge. That we see all these artists as they were as young artists, is, however, a shade dispiriting. For, leaving their painting aside for the moment, here is drawing of a technical quality and seriousness of purpose which in those days could be assumed even from the young, but which today is entirely foreign to the experience of almost any artist under 50. We simply never see it because it is not done, nor even thought to be relevant. The five heroes, Bratby, Smith, Middleditch, Greaves and Coker, are represented by substantial paintings of that period, including Smith's eponymous 'Baby in Sink' of 1953, and they are joined in their draughtsman aspect by Henry Inlander and Bruce Tippett. And of them all, what with Bratby, Middleditch and Inlander already dead, Coker sadly now an invalid, and Smith and Tippett both now abstract painters, only Greaves is still at work in the old way. He was always the aesthete, even then as concerned with the elegant run and sweep of the line as with his nominal subject of a pregnant woman or a sleeping baby. John Bratby's remains a powerful presence, with some fine still-lifes and kitchen interiors and strong drawings. They offer a salutary reminder that a remarkable young artist has been too-long obscured by the reputation of the uncritical, self-regarding buffoon and caricature of himself he became in his later years. Certainly he is remembered by those who taught him at the Royal College in the early 1950s as still one of the most gifted draughtsmen ever to pass through the painting school. But the star of the show is Peter Coker, with but one large painting of an apple tree, of 1956, and a sequence of ravishing drawings, of trees and landscape, of dead fish and hare and chickens, of butchers heaving carcases about, and of his baby son asleep - for they all drew and painted their children. And the young Coker's drawings, above the rest, make the very point that drawing too, and with a wonderful economy, can aspire to the condition of true art. He is one of the great unacknowledged painters of our time, and it is time we put that right. The Kitchen Sink and the Beaux Arts Gallery: Mayor Gallery, 22a Cork Street W1 until December 23, in association with Julian Hartnoll.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rosemarie V. Francisco] </F>   [Text] The recently signed banking liberalization law  effectively eliminates the nationalization privilege of rural  banks as foreign banks are now also allowed to invest in rural  banks, savings and loan associations and thrift banks.    Senator Raul S. Roco, chairman of the committee on banks,  financial institutions and currencies yesterday, told members of  the Makati Chamber of Commerce and Industry that the new law  liberalizes not only the commercial banking industry but also  the rural banking industry which was previously monopolized by  Filipinos.    One mode of entry for foreign banks under the banking  liberalization law is the opening or acquisition of subsidiaries  where they can own up to 60 percent voting stock. Mr. Roco said  foreign banks can, therefore, acquire rural and thrift banks as  subsidiaries.    However, Mr. Roco told BUSINESS WORLD he has not heard yet  of  any foreign bank interested to enter such an investment in small  rural and thrift banks.    In case foreign banks do invest in rural banks, this would  lead to the closure of or mergers among small rural banks which  do not have the financial backing of foreign banks.    Earlier, Negros Oriental Rep. Margarito Teves told a forum  at  the Center for Research and Communication the entry of new  foreign banks in the country will not affect smaller financial  entities like rural banks since foreign banks are more likely to  concentrate on wholesale business. Rural banks specialize in  the retail business.    Mr. Teves also said he expects a linkage between foreign  banks and rural banks to be established with the new law since  foreign banks need the expertise of rural banks in countryside  lending.    Some bankers also expect that foreign banks would  concentrate  on big-ticket transactions, which are the business of large  commercial banks.    Benjamin Palma Gil, Philippine National Bank (PNB) executive  vice president, earlier said the entry of foreign banks may  create competition on the level of bigger banks. Community  banks will then be left to handle the smaller businesses.    Mr. Roco also said the new law also increases the ownership  cap of Filipinos in local banks from 30 percent to 40 percent.  While foreign banks are allowed to own up to 60 percent of the  total voting stock in a domestic bank or subsidiary, Filipino  groups who are listed in the stock exchange or are existing for  at least 10 years are also accorded the same privilege.    The banking liberalization law also provides for new funding  sources for educational institutions, hospitals, cooperatives,  local government units and low-cost housing. Mr. Roco said  foreign banks which would offer financing for these sectors  would be given incentives under the law.    The law signed by President Ramos last 18 May allows 10 new  foreign banks to establish branches in the country within five  years. It also permits an unlimited number of entrants to set  up subsidiaries or buy into any of the existing 28 local banks.  Since the Monetary Board holds the right to decide where the  last three of the allowable six branches of foreign banks would  be situated, Mr. Roco said the government would still have  control over the dispersal of development in the country.</p>

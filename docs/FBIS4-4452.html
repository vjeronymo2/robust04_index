			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate and opposition rammed a new draft charter  through its first reading in Parliament yesterday and threatened  to kill government-backed constitutional amendment bills today,  plunging the administration into its worst political crisis.    All senior government officials and military leaders in the  Senate, including Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak and Army  Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit, gave solid support to the  opposition's controversial draft, criticized by government MPs  as plagued with errors and "dictatorial" clauses.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai tried to play down the  government's embarrassing failure, but calls mounted even  within, his coalition for a House dissolution to stop what was  described as a dangerous Senate-opposition conspiracy to bring  back the "NPKC [National Peacekeeping Council] shadow".    Many government MPs, academics and political action groups  called the development a "silent coup" by remnants of the  National Peacekeeping Council, which seized power in 1991. A  bloody pro-democracy uprising the following year disintegrated  the junta.    The present Senate was appointed by the NPKC and has  strongly  opposed the Chuan government's attempts to whittle it down in  size and reduce senators' powers.    The opposition, which took a promilitary stand prior to the  1992 upheaval, proposes maintaining the status quo while  slightly increasing the size of the upper House.    Prime Minister Chuan said he did not expect any major  political change. "I have said all along that changing the  Constitution is not the government's duty. It's Parliament's,"  Chuan said. "The government has only 193 votes, which are not  enough (to unilaterally pass government-sponsored amendments)."    The joint sitting of Parliament voted 369 in favour of  passing the first reading of the opposition's draft bill,  against 194 abstentions -- mainly government MPs with a few  senators.    The meeting then was adjourned, with threats to shoot down  the government's eight amending bills today.    Chuan said he would not take action against Defence Minister  Wichit who supported the opposition's draft. "I have told  non-MP government officials that changing the charter is not an  administrative matter and they were free to use their  judgement," he said.    But other government MPs talked about a House dissolution,  which some of them believed was imminent.    "I don't know what is going to happen next," government  spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa told reporters. "This is a bad  situation."    Ominous signs for the government came as soon as Parliament  began an extra-ordinary session to deliberate charter reform  yesterday morning. The Senate-opposition alliance outvoted  government MPs, moving the opposition draft charter to the top  of the agenda and sidelining the administration-sponsored  amendment bills.    A tumultuous debate ensued. Government lawmakers outlined  one "flaw" after another in the opposition's proposed charter  and attacked Parliament President Marut Bunnak for violating  parliamentary rules by not giving Parliament enough time to  study the Senators and opposition MPs responded by accusing the  government of jumping the gun by assuming that the Senate was  not wanted by the public.    After the opposition's draft sailed through its first  reading, Parliament set up a special panel of 45 members to vet  the bill over the next month. Government representatives are  outnumbered by opposition MPs and senators on the panel.    Parliament adjourned until 10 am today, when it will  consider  the government bills.    The Phalang Tham Party reemphasized its belief that Chuan  should dissolve Parliament if charter reform proposals become  deadlocked. But sources who attended the party's meeting  yesterday said members were of an opinion that Chuan would be  unable to justify a House dissolution and should instead resign.    "We are proud of the Senate," said Chat Phatthana leader  Chatchai Chunhawan. "I think the Senate voted for us because we  are sincere with the people."    Ratsadon leader Chaiphak Siriwat said the  bureaucrat-dominated Senate's move meant the Chuan government  had lost control of the bureaucracy and should resign.    Solidarity MP Khanin Bunsuwan, a government whip, said the  opposition, in its "blind attempt" to topple the coalition, had  been "used" by the anti-reform Senate.    Senator Somphop Hotrakit warned the government to withdraw  the eight bills from Parliament or they would be rejected by  senators today.    "We, senators, aren't slaves. We have warned the government  not to trample on others' dignity," Somphop said.    "The military obviously wants its power back," said Phalang  Tham spokesman Sutham Saengprathum. "The goverment will have to  do something. But only the prime minister can say where the way  out is. My duty is only to apply to run in an election."    Solidarity leader Uthai Phimchaichon said though the  government had lost face, it was the opposition which would  later suffer a major political backlash. "The ones who cheat  will lose," he said.    Opposition leader Praman Adireksan was buoyed and adamant.  "You I asked me whether the opposition's draft fulfills the  wishes of the people. My answer is you must understand that  this Parliament represents the people. Everything passed by  this Parliament has passed a democratic process," Praman said.    Nine pro-democracy groups deplored yesterday's development  and vowed to campaign to publicize the "bad points" of the  opposition draft. Some of the movement's leaders suggested  Chuan dissolve Parliament but others wanted the charter reform  process to be completed.</p>

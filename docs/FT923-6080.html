			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Gulf allies impose 'no-fly' zone in south Iraq THE US, Britain and France yesterday announced an air exclusion zone over southern Iraq and made an open-ended commitment to protect the Shia population against what President George Bush described as the 'brutality and harsh repression' of President Saddam Hussein's regime. From today, Iraqi helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft will be forbidden to fly south of the 32nd parallel, establishing a zone similar to that in the north which protects the Kurdish population above the 36th parallel. Allied air forces are prepared to shoot down Iraqi aircraft violating the 'no-fly' zone, although they do not expect challenges. 'If Iraq violates the 'no-fly' rule, the coalition forces will respond appropriately and decisively,' a Pentagon spokesman said, but he declined to reveal the specific rules of engagement. Iraq's representative at the UN, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, later warned that military confrontation was inevitable if the west's plans went ahead, according to Baghdad radio. Mr Bush also threatened tougher measures against the Baghdad regime if it continues to oppress the population in contravention of UN resolution 688 passed at the end of the Gulf war. The US administration is believed to be ready to order air attacks against targets in Baghdad if Iraq stands by its threat to refuse UN weapons inspectors access to government ministries. Many Arab governments have opposed the allied air exclusion zone, warning that it could lead to a three-way partition of Iraq. But Mr Bush said the US did not support partition and claimed the allies were receiving 'the full and active support of a number of countries that form part of the Gulf Co-operation Council, including Saudi Arabia'. Washington is understood to have warned Iran against trying to increase its influence among its Shia co-religionists in southern Iraq. The US has more than 200 combat and reconnaissance aircraft in Saudi Arabia and on the carrier USS Independence in the Gulf, and will provide most of the patrols over southern Iraq. Britain is contributing six Tornado aircraft, expected in Saudi Arabia today, and France is sending 10 Mirage 2000s. Mr Bush again denied that the decision was related to his re-election campaign. The president said recent evidence from witnesses and from Mr Max van der Stoel, the UN human rights envoy, had provided graphic proof of Saddam Hussein's brutality. Michael Littlejohns, UN correspondent, adds: The UN Security Council last night reaffirmed its guarantee of the inviolability of Kuwait's border with Iraq and urged a UN boundary commission to complete the demarcation process as soon as possible.

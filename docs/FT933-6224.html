			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Books: Mystic meditations THE VOICE OF THUNDER by Laurens van der Post Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 229 pages SIR LAURENS van der Post has led a life of adventure - soldier in the jungles of the Far East, explorer of the deserts of Southern Africa, great white hunter. Like a character in a John Buchan novel, he is equally at home in tent and palace, welcomed, trusted and consulted as sincerely in Botswana as in Belgravia. Unlike the predecessors who trampled uncomprehendingly over local cultures, he was sensitive and sympathetic. He understood that simple technology does not imply simple minds; that peoples without books may share rich resources of legendary traditions; and that those whose lives are precariously balanced retain an understanding of the changing seasons, the vital force of rain and sun, our kinship with animals, and other aspects of humanity which are lost or obscured in the comfortable West. Van der Post wrote marvellous books. He was quick to exploit television when it was new and to help change old attitudes. To the post-imperial generation brought up in this country after the war, as well as to recent environmentalists and conservationists, Laurens van der Post is a modern hero. His new book The Voice of Thunder brings together two pieces written some years ago,'The Little Memory' and 'The Great Memory', and a recent essay, 'The Other Journey'. The earlier pieces are classic van der Post, part autobiography, part good yarn about the desert, interspersed with observations and speculations about how the bushmen of the Kalahari see the world and how we can share their wisdom. The new essay has no narrative, it is an old man's meditation on the story of the Odyssey, the perpetual cycle of departure, return and departure which he sees as intrinsic to all lives. As he has grown older, van der Post's mystical streak has become more pronounced. He is sure he has a message to pass on, but it is hard to pin down what exactly it is. The ancient Greeks would have recognised his awe at the power of nature as a sense of the divine, Pan in the woods, Nereids in the Ocean, without implying a personal deity or an intended discoverable design. The romantic poets shared his vision of the mountains, the torrents and the deserts as metaphors of the tempests and aridities of life. Jung, whom van der Post knew personally, suggested the concept of the collective unconscious, the cumulative effect of heredity and experience, which is unique to each individual but of which a good deal is also shared with other human beings. Van der Post sees a revealed secret in the urge of the unconscious to become conscious. Perhaps, he suggests elsewhere, everything in the universe is synchronised. The metaphor of a journey can give shape to recurring patterns in human lives. Mixing personal experience with fragments of science, myth and literature, drawing on a quotation here and a famous name there, van der Post constantly risks appearing banal and confused. He is a remarkable man, but wonderment and benevolence are not, by themselves, enough to make a poet or a philosopher.</p>

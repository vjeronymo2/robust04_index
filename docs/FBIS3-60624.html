			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Dec. 8 (YONHAP) -- Presidents Kim Yong-sam  and Bill Clinton agreed in a telephone conversation Tuesday that  North Korea's nuclear inspection offer contains some elements  that deserve a positive reaction from South Korea and the United  States, but that it is insufficient and unsatisfactory as a  whole.    The two presidents felt that the offer made by North Korea  on  Friday requires basic consideration regarding the future of the  Korean peninsula, and agreed to take advantage of the  opportunity within reason, Presidential Spokesman Yi Kyong-chae  said Wednesday.    Yi said that making use of the opportunity within reason  meant that the presidents had agreed to consider elements of the  offer and not reject it entirely.    In their 30-minute conversation, Clinton conveyed the firm  and resolute U.S. stance on the North Korean nuclear issue and  Kim stressed the need for close cooperation between their  countries in dealing with the issue, Yi said.    They agreed to continue discussing details of a joint South  Korea-U.S. approach to the North Korean nuclear issue at a  working level.    Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign  affairs and national security, will fly to Washington to meet  with National Security Adviser Anthony Lake for talks on the  approach.    Yi said the presidents discussed tariffication of rice and  rice market opening, but he refused to reveal the content of  their discussion because negotiations between the two  governments are under way in Geneva.    The negotiations are expected to make progress on the basis  of the presidential conversation, officials said.    On Dec. 3, Kim reportedly met a high-ranking U.S. Government  official at his office to ask for U.S. understanding of Korea's  unique situation in Uruguay Round negotiations on rice market  opening.    The telephone conversation was the first between the two  presidents using a hot line that was opened in July.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "African News" program] </F>   [Text] The leader of the rebel UNITA [National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola] movement in Angola, Jonas  Savimbi, has said he remains optimistic that peace talks with  the government will succeed despite the gloomy assessment by the  United Nations secretary general. Speaking in central Angola,  he said UNITA could sign a peace agreement within days. The UN  secretary general, Butrus-Butrus Ghali, has reported to the  Security Council that the Angolan peace talks are deadlocked,  but Mr. Savimbi told a group of especially invited journalists  that progress at the talks had been so great that the United  Nations was unlikely to proceed with the imposition of new  sanctions against UNITA. Mr. Savimbi said he would return to  the capital, Maputo [as heard], only if his security could be  guaranteed.</p>

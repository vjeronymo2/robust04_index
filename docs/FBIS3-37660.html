			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 19 Feb -- An IL-18 plane, the undying  veteran of our air fleet, was the most suitable vehicle for the  Russian Government delegation as it arrived today at Belgrade  airport, which was covered with snow and wrapped in fog. Its  members, which include Vitaliy Churkin, special envoy of the  Russian president and Russian Federation deputy foreign  minister, and Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of  the Russian airborne assault troops, have to tackle a number of  practical issues relating to the redeployment of a unit of the  Russian "Blue Helmet" battalion from the Vukovar area to  Sarajevo. The operation is being carried out within the  framework of Russia's initiative aimed at settling the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and at removing the threat of NATO air  strikes on the positions of the Bosnian Serbs.    During its stay in former Yugoslavia the Russian delegation  plans to see the situation at first hand and to hold talks with  the UN forces command and the leadership of the Bosnian sides to  get the necessary guarantees for the successful and safe  implementation by the Russian contingent of its peacekeeping  mission in the hottest part of the Bosnian conflict.    After arriving in Belgrade the commander of the airborne  assault troops left for the Russian battalion, which had already  started to move toward Sarajevo. After that Ye. Podkolzin and  V. Churkin will fly on to Zagreb where the main headquarters of  the UN forces command in former Yugoslavia is situated. On  Sunday they will go to Sarajevo to see the situation at first  hand and to meet the representatives of the confronting sides.    In an arrival statement Vitaliy Churkin stated that the  Russian delegation's main work would be in Sarajevo, where there  are to be talks with representatives of the sides and the local  UN command on the tasks of the Russian contingent. We want also  to acquaint ourselves with the progress in the withdrawal of the  heavy weapons from the city.    We plan to stay in Sarajevo until the evening of 21 February  to see that "there are absolutely no surprises," the Russian  diplomat said, having in mind the expiry at midnight on the 20th  of the NATO ultimatum on air strikes.    If snowfalls and snowdrifts prevent the Serbs from  completing  the withdrawal of their artillery from the city, will the NATO  forces not use this pretext to inflict air strikes, V. Churkin  was asked.    "I think that it will be simpler to ask us to resolve all  the  issues than to inflict strikes and undertake other reckless and  risky steps," he replied.    "We are willing to give priority attention to ensuring the  safety of our fighters in Sarajevo," the commander of the  Russian airborne assault troops stated. "This is going to be  one of the most important points in our upcoming conversations  with the command of the UN troops and with representatives of  the Bosnian sides. We want to obtain firm assurances from them  and guarantees protecting our fighters from all surprises," Ye.  Podkolzin emphasized.    One of the sides gave such guarantees without any delay.  Army General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander who  arrived in Belgrade especially to meet with the Russian  delegations, said that the Russian fighters can have full trust  in the Serb side. We are very interested in seeing the Russian  peace-keeping contingent operate in Sarajevo and we hope that  its presence will speed up the achievement of peace, he said.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (6): The hothouse of competition - Andrew Adonis looks at trends and new entrants to the UK cellular market The UK is Europe's foremost laboratory for testing the impact of competition on telecommunications. Everyone knows that the privatisation of British Telecommunications a decade ago went hand-in-hand with the licensing of a competitor, Mercury Communications. And most of Britain's urban dwellers, whose streets are being dug up by cable companies constructing combined cable TV and telephone networks, are alive to the presence of more competitors. As other west European countries, with a few exceptions still state monopolies, struggle to privatise and liberalise, it is to Britain that they look for inspiration. Less celebrated, but equally developed, is competition in the UK's cellular industry. When cellular telephony started seriously in the mid-1980s, most European governments simply extended the existing monopoly in the provision of telecoms services to the cellular sector. Not the UK, which at the outset licensed two cellular operators, and allowed BT to take only a 60 per cent stake in one of them. Since then, competition has been the hallmark of UK government policy for mobile communications. At every opportunity it has offered competing licences. The policy has not invariably succeeded: initial failures among Personal Communications Networks (PCN) operators might be entered on the debit side. But most analysts agree that the UK's cellular strategy has been more effective than monopoly at stimulating subscriber growth and effective price competition. The case is not beyond dispute. Scandinavia has achieved cellular penetration rates more than twice as high as the UK's, yet cellular competition is still in its infancy across the region. Cultural and business factors may explain the divergence: all forms of telecoms are more heavily employed in Scandinavia than across the rest of Europe, and the region's operators have long been conditioned to behave in an entrepreneurial fashion. At any rate, the whole of western Europe - including Scandinavia - is proceeding fast down the UK road. Almost every EU state has now licensed competing GSM operators. The larger countries have either licensed a PCN operator or are about to do so. The UK has four operators: Vodafone, launched as a subsidiary of Racal Electronics but demerged as a free-standing company in 1991; Cellnet, a joint venture between BT and Securicor; Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture between Mercury, BT's main fixed-line competitor, and US West, a US regional Bell operator; and Orange, in which the largest shareholder is Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate. Vodafone and Cellnet, the original competitors, both have analogue and GSM networks, the latter compatible with overseas built to the same standard. Most of their 2.5m subscribers are signed up to analogue networks: analogue handset prices are cheaper than GSM, and service quality is better. However, tariffs are comparable: as GSM service improves, the greater functionality of GSM handsets becomes apparent, and the virtues of overseas 'roaming' come to be appreciated, GSM will catch on. Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, predicts that Vodafone will be attracting GSM subscribers at the same rate as analogue by the end of the year. Mercury One-2-One and Orange, the new operators, have launched PCN networks in the last year. Both lack national coverage: One-2-One is currently limited to London and the south-east, Orange to main population centres and travel routes. However, both are building out fast, and so rapid is subscriber growth in the industry that last year's warnings that four networks were at least one too many have proved misplaced so far. Mobile phones are enjoying such a boom in the UK that new cellular phone connections are racing ahead of links to traditional fixed phone networks. Net new connections to mobile networks overtook fixed network connections to BT and the cable TV companies last December, on a surge of pre-Christmas mobile phone buying. Analysts expected the mobile phone tide would ebb after Christmas, but cellular has stayed ahead every month this year except January. The larger operators have proved adept at expanding the market without imperilling their margins. Vodafone, the most adept of all, believes it can sustain last year's revenue per subscriber figure of Pounds 665, despite pressure on prices. 'There is plenty of room for four of us,' says Mr Whent. 'We trade on our quality, national coverage, and the potential of GSM.' To gain market share, the new entrants have adopted strategies aimed at expanding the market. Both launched with an advertising blitz - which, predictably, did as much or more to boost their larger rivals as themselves. They have also sought to expand the market through careful positioning. One-2-One has been the bolder by far, with its residential offering of free local calls in the evenings and at weekends. Orange's strategy has been more subtle, linking its tariffs to blocks of 'free' calling time, geared particularly to more heavy-usage business customers. Both operators have introduced serious price competition into the industry for the first time. Branding is also becoming important, as independent service providers decline and operators seek to carve out a distinct identity based on price and network functionality. 'Nobody has yet invented a brand in this business,' claims Mr Hans Snook, Orange's managing director. 'We intend to do so by marketing our brand benefits - lower prices, and the services available on our handsets such as multiple lines.' All four operators are anxiously positioning themselves for the rise of the mass consumer market. The dread is a repeat of the 1980s experience of the consumer electronics industry, where margins collapsed and price wars reigned supreme. Vodafone and Cellnet insist they will not be dragged down that road, and so far they have managed the market successfully. But with two competitors who both need large volumes, fast, to repay their investments, the future is anything but predictable.</p>

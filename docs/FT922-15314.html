			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / World Trade News: Hong Kong airport costs increase 13.8% in real terms THE estimated cost of Hong Kong's new airport and associated infrastructure projects has risen by 13.8 per cent in real terms in less than a year, the Hong Kong government said last night. The airport, which last July was estimated to cost HKDollars 96.8bn (Pounds 7.2bn), will now cost an estimated HKDollars 112.2bn in March 1991 prices - the best attempt by the government to quantify the cost of the entire project. In today's money the value equates to about HKDollars 122bn. Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, said the HKDollars 15.4bn overshoot would not, however, be borne by the Hong Kong taxpayer - the government's share has remained at HKDollars 59.3bn, implying a fall in real terms - but will be paid for by private developers and their lenders. 'We are confident that the project costs will be kept under control,' he said. 'We have put in place a specially designed project management and cash-limiting cost-control system, and we are also using fixed price lump sum contracts as far as possible.' The new estimates were given to Beijing midway through last month. Under the terms of the airport agreement Britain and China signed last September, the Chinese government's approval is needed because the project will extend beyond June 1997, when China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong. A speedy approval by the Chinese is being sought by the government so that it can get on with letting contracts for the airport and airport railway. China's approval is not thought necessary for the construction of the Tsing Ma bridge. Early indications are that the Chinese want more details on the funding of the project; there are some suggestions that they are concerned about the cost of the airport railway, although the government is confident it can allay those concerns. The railway is the main reason for the cost overrun. The plan calls for a high speed railway link between the airport - situated on the island of Chek Lap Kok, north of Lantau Island - and the central district of Hong Kong. The railway was estimated to cost HKDollars 12.5bn. This estimate has been raised to HKDollars 22.1bn to take account of station modification, a change in the location of a depot and the provision of deeper tunnels and foundations on reclaimed land. The Mass Transit Railway Corporation will bear responsibility for the increased costs - the government has in fact cut its proposed equity injection by HKDollars 800m to HKDollars 3bn - but it is confident that it will be able to finance the rail link. The government has vested in the MTRC an unprecedented 60 hectares of land, around the proposed rail tracks and above stations, for redevelopment. If the MTRC follows past practice it will develop the land in conjunction with a property company which will bear the cost of the land's purchase and share the profits post development. The MTRC has briefed international banks and credit rating agencies about the project.</p>

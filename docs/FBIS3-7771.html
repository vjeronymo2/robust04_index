Ratko Mladic, has said one  should not worry over the Serb defence positions around Sarajevo  after the withdrawal of heavy weapons, because the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was really making an effort to  maintain ceasefire.    If, however, the Moslems launch an offensive (in the  Sarajevo  area) the (Bosnian) Serbs will fiercely respond with all  available means, Gen. Mladic warned in an interview to the Novi  Sad daily DNEVNIK on Saturday.    I would not recommend to Moslems to take up arms. It is  better (for them) to try to achieve their goals peacefully --  through negotiations, in which they can achieve much, because  they can lose everything by opting for war, he said.    In connection with the insistence by some western countries,  especially france to threaten the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes  unless they allow the opening of the airfield in Tuzla, Gen.  Mladic said he was confident that the airfield in that Moslem  enclave would be least used for humanitarian aid supply.    We have reliable information that weapons and ammunition, as  well as Mujaheddin from Islamic countries would be brought in by  planes, he said.    Stressing that the Serb side will discuss with UNPROFOR the  possibilities for the opening of the airfield, and that it is  ready to negotiate this directly with the Moslems, Gen. Mladic  warned that it should, nevertheless, be clear to everybody that  Bosnian Serbs would not allow the case of the Sarajevo airport  to be repeated.    "We held the Sarajevo airport, and then turned it over to  UNPROFOR, and the Moslems dug a tunnel under the airport and use  it unhindered (for military purposes), despite our warnings to  the peace-keeping command and U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali," said Gen. Mladic.    In connection with the talks on forming a common Bosnian  Moslem- Croat state, Gen. Mladic said it was possible that a  Moslem-Croat coalition backed primarily by Croatia, as well as  many other countries, again take up arms and come against the  Serbs.    As long as the international factors do not want peace in  Bosnia- Herzegovina, there will be no peace, Gen. Mladic  concluded.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Setback for GM over assembly plant ruling GENERAL Motors, the US car group, yesterday suffered an unusual setback in its efforts to slash its North American production costs when a Michigan court ordered it to keep open an assembly plant scheduled for closure. The plant involved is Willow Run, at Ypsilanti, west of Detroit. GM announced a year ago that the works would be shut in 1993 and its output consolidated at a plant in Arlington, Texas. Yesterday, however, a Michigan circuit court judge enjoined GM from moving production of its Caprice station wagon from Ypsilanti to Arlington. The judge supported a challenge by Ypsilanti Township, which argued GM had violated provisions of tax breaks given in the 1980s in the hope of keeping the plant open. Mr Lee Schutzman, an attorney for GM, said the ruling was unprecedented and the company would appeal. GM has already started transferring workers from the plant to Arlington. When the judge's ruling was announced, members of the United Auto Workers union filled the court room with cheers. The UAW has reacted particularly bitterly to the closing of Ypsilanti and accused GM of 'whip-sawing' - playing the Michigan and Texas plants off against one another in the hope of extracting maximum concessions from the union. Mr Doug Winters, an attorney for the township, said: 'GM for years has asked for a level playing field in terms of global competition, and all we ever asked for was a level playing field to present our case. Fortunately, we had a judge with enough courage to give us that.' The closure is part of GM's plan to shut 21 assembly and parts plants by the mid-1990s in an attempt to return its loss-making North American operations to profit.</p>

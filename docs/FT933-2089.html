			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Up and up for Schindler - A company that spurned the advice of consultants Here is a story to warm the hearts of management consultant sceptics. In 1985, Schindler, the Swiss elevators and escalators group, called in some consultants to assess its escalator business. At the time, Schindler was a minor player, active mainly in the European market and with a world market share of less than 10 per cent. The consultants told the family-controlled group to give up. The escalator business, like so many other specialised engineering sectors, was going global. Schindler lacked critical mass and could not catch up with Otis and other better established groups, they concluded. Alfred Schindler, who had just taken over as chief executive, felt otherwise. 'It is not our style to drop out of a business,' he says. The group then set out systematically to build up its position to a sustainable level. The landmark events were fairly predictable - streamlining of the group's European escalator manufacturing plant in Vienna, rebuilding a depleted market position in the US after taking over the Westinghouse elevator and escalator business in 1989, and plunging into China with three joint ventures. The result: last week, Schindler announced that it had become the world market leader in the escalator business with a share of more than 20 per cent. Schindler is a fairly secretive group - partly because the sectors in which it operates are marked by fierce competition among only a few global groups  -so the whole story of how this success came about will not be told here. Alfred Schindler nevertheless points to some interesting lessons. Yes, a considerable amount of investment was required, but money was not the crucial factor, he insists. No, this project was not the sort of long-term payback venture that only a family-controlled company could take on, although a public one might have difficulty getting shareholders to accept it. 'We raised the stakes as we went along. The opportunities in the Pacific region developed much faster than we expected,' he says. 'Much more important was getting organised in a global way.' The escalator business, like many other specialised industrial product sectors, involves a constant chase after big contracts in open competition. Airports, shopping centres and underground railways are the main customers. Often, time is of the essence, and Schindler has worked hard to develop a single product line and a network of loyal subcontractors throughout the world. The idea, one pioneered by Caterpillar Tractor several years ago, is that its products can be manufacturered in any of its plants. 'The advantage we have is that market needs are not tied to a particular plant capacity,' says Peter Zbinden, president of the escalator division. 'We can adjust to whatever speed of delivery is required.' Zbinden said speed was particularly important in winning contracts for the Kansai airport project in Japan and a recent expansion of the Atlanta airport. Schindler says the other important factors were emphases on training and efficient, high-quality production. 'We had a lot of specialists in Europe. We sent them to the US for long periods, even welding specialists, and then did the same thing in China.' The company put a big effort into improving output at a factory for making escalator steps in Ternitz, Austria. Now competitors buy their steps from this factory, too, and a few have insisted on buying equity stakes in it for security. 'It is also very important to work hard and not talk about it,' Schindler says. 'We are often criticised for being too discreet. But in the military, you never say anything, unless it is to mislead the enemy.' Postscript: It is well known that Schindler frequently employs the Boston Consulting Group. Schindler wishes to make clear that BCG was not the unfortunate firm used in this case.</p>

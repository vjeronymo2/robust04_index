			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's address by Askar Akayev; place and date not </F> given -- recorded]    [Text] The most important and pleasing fact for me in 1993  was the fact that our Commonwealth, the CIS, turned from an  amorphous formation into an effectively operating mechanism of  multilateral economic cooperation, on the one hand, and, on the  other hand, into a mechanism of maintaining peace and stability  and preventing conflicts on the whole enormous Eurasian  continent.    Hence, my main wish to all of us is that in 1994 the  mechanism should begin working in full and we should begin to  overcome a political, economic, and spiritual crisis that all of  us are going through. The most important thing -- my sincere  wish is that finally, there should be a reconciliation at places  where blood is being shed and civil war is under way. I am  saying this with pain in my heart. My sincere wish is that  people should return to a peaceful life.    One more thing, I would particularly like to wish to the  citizens of Russia that 1994 should be a year of peace,  stability, and progress.    It is the destiny of world history that without great Russia  there can be no harmony, peace, or stability not only on the  Eurasian continent, but in the whole world.    I would like to address all of us, CIS countries citizens,  as  my compatriots since we all come from a single Fatherland.  Compatriots: I would like to wish you peace, well-being,  solidarity, and fraternity in 1994. Happy New Year!</p>

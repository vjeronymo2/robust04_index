			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chung Han (0022 3466): "Those Trying To Split </F> and Weaken China Are Simply Mistaken in Their Calculations"]    [Text] As a component of its entire policy toward China  and in accordance with its policy toward Hong Kong, the British  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee's report  advocates confronting China on the issues of Tibet and Taiwan as  well.  <H5>  Aiming To Support the Independence of Tibet, Taiwan </H5>   The Report quotes a 1943 British diplomatic document,  saying:  "The British Government has always been willing to recognize  China's suzerainty over Tibet; however, such recognition must be  based on an understanding of Tibet's autonomy"; at the same  time, the document maintained that Tibet should be allowed  "fuller autonomy" when necessary, and proposed that the British  Government "hold discussions on the issue of Tibet's right to  self-determination" with its Chinese counterpart. Those who  have a knowledge of politics see clearly that suzerainty and  sovereignty are two entirely different concepts; the  nationality-defined autonomous region within a sovereign country  and the relations between a metropolis and its vassal are  basically different. The so-called recognition of China's  "suzerainty" and Tibet's "fuller autonomy" referred to in the  document is precisely meant to violate China's sovereignty, so  that Tibet would leave the Chinese Government's jurisdiction and  realize its independence in disguise under the pretext of  "autonomy." The reason why the British Parliament shows such  extraordinary concern over Tibet lies -- just as the report says  -- in "the historical ties between Britain and Tibet." Such  "ties" actually stem from the shameful history of Britain's  invasion of China's Tibet and its intervention in Tibetan  affairs. Regrettably, the British have the guts to glorify  themselves with that incident. Back in 1888 and 1903, when  Britain met with strong resistance in its invasion of Tibet,  Britain changed its strategy and took the goal of separating  Tibet from China. In 1907, when imperial Russia signed the  "Treaty on the British-Russian Alliance," which aimed to contend  for Central Asia, it had -- for the first time in history --  misrepresented China's sovereignty over Tibet and changed it  into "suzerainty." At the Simla Conference in 1913, with  participation of British and Tibetan delegates, the British  Government required the Chinese Government to recognize the  "autonomy of outer Tibet (including Tibet and western Sikang),"  and "refrain from intervening in its internal affairs," with the  effect of changing China's sovereignty over Tibet into  suzerainty. Thanks to the strong opposition of the Chinese  Government, the British attempt to sever Tibet from China was  never successful. This shows that the British Parliamentary  Foreign Affairs Select Committee is actually playing the same  old tune and Britain has never given up its effort to separate  Tibet from China. The so-called "violation of human rights in  Tibet and threats to Tibetan cultural and religious  characteristics" are nothing but pretexts. The report asserts,  "a satisfactory solution to anxieties over the former (human  rights violations) will be possible only by making progress in  the latter (the Tibetan right to self-determination); this  statement reveals the aforementioned British effort. If we  examine Tibet's actual conditions, in the 43 years since its  peaceful liberation, it has thoroughly abolished the extremely  backward feudal serfdom, and, consequently, a million former  serfs have taken the bright road of modernization. There is a  world of difference between the present human rights conditions  and those under the previous rule of slave owners in Tibet. The  so-called "human rights violations" are obviously a deliberate  exaggeration, and even a fabrication at that.    According to the report's own words, "signs of a thaw" in  the  "rigid" relations between the British Government and Taiwan have  surfaced in recent years. In 1992, Britain appointed a diplomat  to the general executive office of the Committee for  British-Taiwan Trade (which was later changed into the British  Office for Trade and Culture.) For the first time, the British  Minister of Trade paid Taipei an official visit in 1993. Since  Chris Patten's arrival in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong  Government has kept one eye shut, given silent consent, and  tolerated the Taiwan Authorities when they conduct activities in  a governmental capacity as well as the high-sounding activities  of Taiwan governmental organizations in Hong Kong. While  expressing admiration for such tendencies, the report says, "it  is suggested that the Government should reassess the status of  the Taiwan office in Britain," "relax related restrictions," and  even "propose closer ties between Westminster and Taiwan's  Legislative Yuan." Furthermore, it expresses the hope that the  international community "will help Taiwan pursue its goal of  obtaining official status in the world." In actual fact, this  aims to maintain and expand the separation of Taiwan and  mainland China, tolerating and supporting Taiwan independence,  and thus directly violating the position and commitment the  British Government has openly taken on the "Taiwan issue."    British Strategy of Disintegration    The report links its position on the issues of Tibet,  Taiwan,  and Hong Kong, and it is not difficult to see that the truth  behind all this can be summed up with but one word:  "independence." Specifically, by supporting the independence of  Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, Britain seeks to secure "Britain's  essential interests" and protect and expand its influence.  There are several differences: In Tibet, the British want to  recover their lost influence; in Taiwan they want to expand  their influence; and in Hong Kong, they want to protect and  maintain their special vested interests. The British have bet  their largest stake on Hong Kong. Because 1997 is approaching,  Britain knows pretty well that its influence in Hong Kong is  continuously dwindling. That being the case, it is  simultaneously playing the "Tibet card" and the "Taiwan card" so  as to more powerfully contain mainland China. At the same time,  it is attempting to join hands with the EC and the United States  to jointly deal with mainland China. Thus, the report calls on  "the world to concern itself with the Tibet issue" and is  pinning high hope on international public opinion toward the  Hong Kong issue. In addition, the report has done its best to  sow discord between China and its neighboring countries and has  brazenly alleged that "other countries, especially China's  northern and western neighboring countries, will show  increasingly greater interest in how China is treating other  minority nationalities," in an attempt to tempt those countries  to work for Britain.    What are some British politicians really after? After some  further analysis of the report, we find that some British  politicians have become psychologically imbalanced when faced  with the rapid growth of China's national strength and its  increasingly elevated position in the world. They do not want  to see a powerful China and are being unable to forget their  dreams of splitting and weakening China and making China return  to the state of disintegration of the 1940's. Beyond a shadow  of a doubt, that is the general goal of the British politicians'  proposal for a policy toward China. The report supports Hong  Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan to pursue independence in disguise, and  calls Macao China's "neighboring country." It instigates  foreign intervention in China's minority nationality issues,  along with the creation of public opinion on disharmony between  the central and local governments in China. All this is being  done in pursuit of "disintegration" and represent important  steps in their general policy toward China. Out of the need to  maintain its rule over Hong Kong in the past, Britain was not in  the position to openly intervene in Taiwan affairs, nor dared it  be excessively aggressive over the Tibet issue. Now, the  British seem to have no misgivings whatsoever; in addition to  the tremendous changes in the world situation in the late  1980's, Britain has eventually changed its entire policy toward  China, including its policies toward Hong Kong, Taiwan, and  Tibet. Regarding the British strategy of disintegration, a  report written by British International Strategy Society early  this year contained a relatively detailed discussion of the  plan, and may serve as a footnote to the British Parliament  report.  <H5>  China Is Able To Face Any Challenges </H5>   The Chinese Government has repeatedly reiterated that the  Tibet and Taiwan issues and Hong Kong affairs after its return  to China in 1997 are purely China's internal affairs, and no  foreign forces have the right to intervene. It is absurd that  the report should link opposing intervention in another  country's internal affairs to "restricting the freedom of speech  of the citizen of another country." Just as was indicated by  Hong Kong media, should the Chinese discuss the issue of  Northern Ireland, it is believed that Britain would not tolerate  it. Especially considering that the issues of Hong Kong,  Taiwan, and Tibet have a bearing on China's national security  and stability. Facing such major issues of principle, there is  no leeway for the Chinese Government. Furthermore, in recent  years, China has enjoyed a stable political situation, social  solidarity, and sustained rapid economic growth. Facts have  shown that China has sufficient confidence and strength to face  challenges from any international forces. At the same time,  China's relations with peripheral countries have been  consolidated and developed, and some Western countries are  showing their friendliness one after another. The current world  situation is favorable to China as well. In contrast, British  domestic issues are piling up, and the Major government can do  nothing to improve the situation. The Conservatives are  suffering from a confidence crisis which grows increasingly  serious with every passing day. In recent British local  parliamentary elections, the Conservatives have been reduced to  a third party. At the international level, British influence  within the EC has all along been insignificant, and its  relations with the United States are far from what they used to  be. With increasingly greater importance being attached to  economic factors, the British attempt to join hands with  international forces to deal with China is undoubtedly wishful  thinking. In the final analysis, all factors have decided that  any evil plots to split China will be in vain.</p>

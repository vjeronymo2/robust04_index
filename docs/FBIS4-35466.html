			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, May 29 (AFP) -- Gunmen in a taxi shot dead  an Iranian dissident in an attack north of the Iraqi capital on  Sunday, Iran's main armed opposition group said, blaming Tehran  for the killing.    The People's Mujahedeen, in a communique sent from Baghdad,  said Seyeed Ahmad Sadr Lahijani, a 35-year-old member of the  group, was shot in the head as he drove his car through  Ghalebieh, 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the capital.    The Iranian Embassy in Baghdad was behind the attack, it  charged.</p>

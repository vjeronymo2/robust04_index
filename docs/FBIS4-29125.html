			<p>BFN     [Text] The meeting of the commission on the roundtable for  national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia was held  energetically at Damnak Chan Pavilion in the Royal Palace.    His Excellency [H.E.] Ung Teaseam, under secretary of state  for information, told national and international correspondents  at the end of this first meeting that the participants discussed  the first issue, that is, a cease-fire. Regarding this issue,  the representatives of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]  and National Assembly followed His Majesty's idea. To speed up  a concrete schedule for the cease-fire, the RGC representatives  proposed a starting date of 30 June or earlier.    Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge [KR] side proposed that a control  committee be set up and still refused to accept the proposed  schedule.    The roundtable meeting adjourned at 1200 and will resume  work  tomorrow morning at 0900.</p>

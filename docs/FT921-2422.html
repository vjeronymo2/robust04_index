			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (42): The key to better business decisions - Case Study: Building company upgrades database system AT a time when the slump in the housing market has made cash flow uncomfortably tight for most building companies, Laing Homes has a system in place which enables it to make well-informed decisions about the state of the market. It has centralised information so that all users, from the directors downwards, are tapping into the same source of information. Laing Homes wanted to take one step at a time when it came to upgrading its systems. Its problem in 1985 was a number of different systems, spread across different hardware, including old DEC PDP 11 minicomputers. 'We wanted to make changes, and we particularly wanted software to be easy to transport between systems,' explains John McNab, John Laing's director of computing services, homes division. Communications was the real problem: there was no way of passing information between the various applications such as accounts, stock control, material take-off and job costing, including quantity surveying for materials - 'to get our applications communicating, we had to move to an integrated environment, and update the applications one by one.' Laing also recognised that it needed a relational database, to make information retrieval easier in the new applications, and knew that PCs would be an important vehicle for that activity. A shortlist of five products, including Oracle was picked and tested. DEC's Rdb was dropped early on because it was 'single platform' software (ie limited to one specific hardware-host), and Supra was also ruled out in the early stages. Adabas lost out because it was felt that at the time, its VMS version ran a poor second to its IBM base, and this concentrated attention on Ingres and Oracle, both of which were 'native VMS' developed, although running in other environments. At the time, Ingres had no PC version, and Oracle clinched the deal by scoring higher on functionality. 'We were commercially more comfortable with Oracle,' recalls John McNab. The availability of a strong 4GL had also played an important part in the selection, and Oracle was further helped by its ability to offer a number of ready-made applications, such as Oracle Financials (now called Business Patterns). This now forms the core of the accounting systems. 'By choosing Oracle, we could change platforms,' says John McNab. 'If we were going through the same exercise now, we might well be looking at RISC-based Unix machines: VMS software licences are more expensive than Unix. The beauty is that we now have that option if we want it. The software alone in the contract cost Pounds 100,000. About 100 of Laing's 400 employees use the Oracle software, with a handful of them - no more than four - empowered to make interactive queries against the database, using the SQL language themselves. Since the installation, Laing has developed its own Oracle applications, known as CASE - Construction and Sales Events. Built in Oracle by the four in-house development staff, this helps to provide up-to-date, consistent information on the state of the construction process, and the stage of each estate sale. In the recession, the need to match construction with sales ever more tightly became important - 'there's a definite business benefit in knowing exactly where the sale is: completion, exchange, and so on.' The benefit of integrated applications is less easy to quantify in business terms, but one advantage has been the increase of accuracy in the information, since very little now has to be re-keyed. Management users of the system include Colin Seymour, financial director, who regularly taps into the mainframe to use the information for financial planning. He uses the SQL language to make his own direct queries. One advantage of this power is the constant 'refining' process which takes place. For example, on one occasion he picked up an inconsistency in the data to do with progressing sales of a set of dwellings. The classification had not taken into account an important factor: the houses were retirement homes, and those buying were, in the main, not in need of mortgages, a common factor revealed in his off-the-cuff search. The quality of information means that Laing is in a better position to make good business decisions, on such issues as what percentage of deposit is needed before building starts. The central warehouse - through which all materials were channelled and stockpiled in the building boom - is no longer necessary, as there is better control over materials and building planning. John McNab feels that the venture into relational database, undertaken at an early stage of the market, has given Laing a distinct advantage - 'no other housebuilder has comparable systems,' he believes. But he also observes that five years ago, there were no software packages dealing with housebuilding, whereas now, software developers seem to have woken up to the possibilities in this particular 'vertical market.'

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Peru to grant free trade zone PERU is to grant South Korea about 1m square metres of territory on the coast north of Lima for the establishment of a free trade zone, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. It will be the first such venture in newly liberalised Peru. According to Mr Oscar de la Puente, the prime minister, the area under consideration is about 40km north of Lima, with easy access to the port of Callao. South Korean entrepreneurs will be expected to install all the necessary infrastructure - access roads, water and sewage as well as energy generation. 'Peru won't invest a cent in this,' the Peruvian premier said. He denied there would be a threat to Peruvian sovereignty. 'This is co-participation in development,' he said. The new commercial relationship between South Korea and Peru was announced during a visit by President Alberto Fujimori and senior government officials to Seoul, part of a 10-day, investment-promotion tour to a variety of Asian countries. South Korea has offered Peru a gift of Dollars 18m (Pounds 11.6m) to rehabilitate the international airport in the Andean town of Cuzco. Reuter adds: Speaking in Los Angeles, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said this week that his country now offered tremendous profit opportunities to foreign investors willing to do business there. 'The inflation rate has declined from 7,695 per cent in 1990, to 130 per cent in 1991, and to 60 per cent in 1992,' Mr Fujimori said.</p>

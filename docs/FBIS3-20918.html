			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Bangemann: "Research Policies Play a Key </F> Roll in Europe's Structural Industrial Change, yet they must be  Supported by a Broad Section of the Public"]    [TEXT]    VDI-N, Brussels, 24 December 1993-The European Union  wants to give greater encouragement to technological innovations  which will make a viable contribution to strengthening Europe's  competitiveness, according to EU Commissioner Martin Bangemann  in his following article.    In recent years the European economy has lost a lot of  ground  in the technologies of the future. Japan's leadership in the  high-tech sector seems almost unstoppable, and a similar lag in  genetic and biotechnology compared with the USA is also taking  shape.    While the European share of the world market in high  technology was still around 25% in 1970, today it is less  than  20%. In contrast, during the same period of time, Japanese  companies have increased their share from 15% to  25%. It is  therefore not astonishing that the number of Japanese patent  registrations in the USA today is greater than those of all the  countries of the European Union put together. Does this mean we  are on our way to second class status in technology?    That is surely an exaggeration. European industry is still  the world market leader in many areas, and no other industrial  region has at its disposal such a highly developed industrial  culture. But it cannot be overlooked that the trump cards of the  past such as steel, automobiles, and chemistry are no longer,  and new ones are not in sight. This leads to the question of  where the new jobs will come from which are so urgently needed  to compensate for the increasingly rapid dismantling of jobs in  the old industries.    In this situation it is not enough just to appeal to  European  businesses and demand of them greater efforts in research to  make European industry competitive. The most important thing is  the creation of a climate favorable toward innovation, since  throughout the European Union a whole series of complicated  administrative and procedural provisions prevent private  investments in the area of research. Therefore, it is completely  understandable that increasingly more European firms are moving  their research activities to countries where there are no such  limitations.    There is a peculiar ambivalence in the public debate. On the  one hand, the decline in jobs and growing unemployment are  loudly lamented. On the other hand, technological innovations  are resisted, and researchers are discouraged from translating  the results of their work into competitive products. Those  attitudes are not very compatible, but the political strength is  lacking to expose the obvious contradictions and develop  strategies which point to the future. Here we just talk too many  things to death without thinking about the economic consequences.    We have to support technology and research policies in  Europe  more strongly than we have in the past. Our competitors on the  world market are fully aware of the importance of federal  policies on technology and research. While, for example, in 1991  the total expenditure for research and development in the  European Union was only 2.1% of the gross domestic product  (GDP) of the EU, the USA and Japan spent around 2.8% and  3.5%  of their GDP to fund research and development. The amount of  money spent is not in itself decisive in the results which are  achieved. But it would be a mistake to deny any connection  between investment capital and demonstrable success.    Therefore, with the Fourth General Program for Research and  Technology we want first of all to strengthen the technological  competency of the European economy. The continuing increase in  the share of research expenditures within the Union's total  budget indicates what importance we place on policies for  research and technology--incidentally, in contrast to the member  states which are more likely to be cutting back their research  budgets as a whole.    There is a fateful tendency, especially in times of economic  crisis, to use a great deal of money to support old industries  which are no longer competitive. How many new jobs could have  been created in recent years in Germany if the billions used for  coal had been invested in research? Today this money is gone,  without an end in sight to the coal subsidies--on the contrary.  On 1 January 1994, the coal pfennig will actually be increased.  An estimated 6.1 billion German marks will then be being spent  just to preserve unprofitable German coal mining. We can  certainly not improve the position of research in Germany in  this way.    With the Fourth General Program we are gathering all the  research efforts of the Union together in a single program,  where we have to concentrate on fewer lines of research because  of the relatively smaller share of our resources to all public  research resources. This does not mean that we primarily want to  support large individual projects as we did in the past. This  action was not successful, as the example of the high-definition  television shows. We are rather concentrating on supporting  generic technologies. These are technologies which have an  important overlapping effect on various branches of industry. So  the first area of activity for implementing programs for  research, technological development, and demonstration forms the  main focus of the program. The total budget for this area is to  be around 17 billion German marks, the 7.5 billion mark bulk of  which will go to support new information and communications  technologies, and 2.5 billion marks will go to support  industrial technologies.    The Fourth General Program for Research and Technology  carries through an important change in the paradigm. While,  previously, individual technologies were specifically promoted,  especially those from which large companies profited, the  emphasis now is on technologies which overlap multiple fields.  This requires a different sort of implementation. The goal is no  longer to identify tomorrow's winner, which due to the  increasingly greater market dynamics and the increasingly  swifter decline of technological competence, is also no longer  possible. The point is much more to encourage technological  innovations which conform with pubic priorities, innovations  which make an effective contribution to strengthening the  competitiveness of European industry.    One important focus must lie in the development of  environmentally sound products and production processes as well  as of intelligent transportation and communications systems.  There can be no doubt that these are important problems for the  future whose solution will be of decisive significance for  competitiveness. Until now we have just been lacking  comprehensive technological approaches which link strategically  important goals with appropriate technological means in the  solution of problems.    Our research activity will continue to be concentrated on  the  economically pre-competitive stage. We thereby take into account  the demand from trade and industry itself which wants to avoid a  distorting effect on competition as much as possible through  market-oriented research. Yet research may not limit itself to  basic research if it is supposed to lead to quickly practical  results. It must become by and large "closer to the market",  since it is only with new products and new production processes  which reach the market quickly that we can maintain the  competitiveness of the European economy. We can no longer afford  to be world leaders in basic research while leaving it to our  competitors in the world market to bring the results of our  research to the marketplace. We are only wasting our resources  by doing this.    We first need stronger networking to develop new  manufacturing processes or to deal with public tasks more  efficiently with the most modern information technologies. The  new conceptualization of our support for research thus  fundamentally concerns the development of "networks of  excellence" among industry, science, and end-users, so that more  and more information in word, picture, and sound can be  exchanged with ever increasing speed and accuracy. The common  priorities for research must be determined in close dialog with  business and industry and above all must contribute to the  purposeful dissemination of the results of research. The small  and mid-sized businesses in particular will also profit from  this, companies which often do not have sufficient means at  their disposal to participate directly in our research plans.  Only in this way can we make a contribution to reducing  structural unemployment.    European policies on research and technology are making an  important contribution to the structural industrial change in  the Union. They cannot, however, bring it about alone. It first  depends on society's ability to make a systemic change. Still,  modern policies on research and technology can contribute in  substantial measure to keeping jobs which are endangered and  recovering those already lost. However, it is decisive here that  the goals of our policies are shared by the majority of our  citizens. For this we need information and solutions which are  free of taboos. That is the prime task of the state in a highly  developed industrial society.</p>

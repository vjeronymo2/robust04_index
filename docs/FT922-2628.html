			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Cloud over ICI shares A REDUCED profits forecast for ICI prompted dealers to mark down the share price ahead of a presentation to analysts by the company on Thursday. The stock was down 27 at one stage and closed a net 18 off at 1267p, but turnover, at under 1m shares, was slim. The negative sentiment came from Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, which cut its 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m to Pounds 890m and decreased its 1993 figure by Pounds 80m to Pounds 1.09bn. Mr Martin Glen, Lehman's chemicals analyst, said he had been a seller of ICI previously but was inspired to slice his forecasts because of external factors. He saw no improvement in European chemicals demand, believed the recent Common Agriculture Policy reforms would lead prices to fall by between 20 and 30 per cent, and said that Tenormin, ICI's best selling drug, was losing US market share more quickly than anticipated. There was further pressure from speculation that US broker CJ Lawrence had also reduced forecasts, although no-one from the house was available for comment yesterday. Finally, some observers said Goldman Sachs was still holding a large chunk of the 20m shares it had bought from Hanson for 1400p apiece in early May and that stock was still overshadowing the share price. Utility tremors Results from the electricity sector are likely to provide continuing ammunition for the anti-privatisation lobby, according to analysts, but the figures should be regarded with caution and look like being in line with expectations. Yesterday's announcement of a 41 per cent rise in profits from East Midlands Electricity was much as forecast and left the share price unchanged at 293p. The market took a relaxed attitude towards the comment from Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, that he plans to 'set tougher standards' for the distribution companies and eliminate sharp swings in customer prices. Ms Liz Christie, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said such comments are not very threatening and that the regulatory mechanism is working well, given the terms of the government's price controls. Norweb, down 6 at 334p, reports today and the market expects a profit rise of 80 per cent. Although this may produce further adverse comments it was pointed out that the company was involved in very big one-off costs last year. Today's figures from National Power, 2 higher at 241p, will be looked at to see whether the profit and dividend are up to the same level as the recent results from PowerGen, unaltered at 248p. Vodafone weak Plans announced yesterday by mobile phone operator Cellnet to restructure its pricing policies and strengthen its consumer operations prompted renewed worries that rival operator Vodafone will be forced to respond, as the two companies gear up for the launch of personal communications network (PCN), a cheaper but more specialised version of cellular for which the government plans to issue licences late next year. Although the move by Cellnet, in which BT has a 60 per cent stake and Securicor the remainder, had been widely expected, the rekindling of the threat of a price war upset sentiment in a weak telecoms sector. Vodafone dropped 18 to 334p, although 3p of the fall represented dividend payment. Turnover was a brisk 6.4m. BT, whose shares dipped 3 to 347 1/2 p, announced after the market closed that it had sold its controlling equity interest in Canadian telecoms group Mitel at a loss of CDollars 120m. Business services group BET closed a net 4 lighter at 136p after the company reported a slump in full-year profits after exceptional charges to Pounds 18.5m from a previous Pounds 217m, and also cut the dividend. One market observer said: 'Everyone was resigned to the dividend cut and reasonably prepared for the fall in profits.' This may have helped the shares partially recover from a fall sustained earlier in the session. Turnover rose to 7.7m. French stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull is refusing to lighten its gloomy view of BP. Superbear Mr John Toalster said after a long talk with the company that he was planning to cut his profits forecast once again in the belief that second-quarter figures would be 'pretty dreadful'. Mr Toalster has reduced his replacement cost profits forecast by Pounds 70m to Pounds 430m and argues that the only support for the share price is in the firm underlying oil price. BP eased 1 1/2 to 259 1/2 p on thin volume of 3.3m shares. Lasmo rose 5 to 199p on optimism ahead of the pricing of the sale of its Ultramar unit's North American assets. The price is due to be set tomorrow. Turnover of 3.6m shares was boosted by an agency cross of 1/2 m shares. Concern about the British Aerospace dividend and worries that the company may be forced to make provisions continued to weaken the shares, which ended 8 lower at 294p. Explaining the current mood, Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman Brothers said: 'The market is coming to a realistic position on issues such as current trading, dividend prospects and possible provisions.' Continued selling following the company's profits warning on Friday ensured that Fisons was the most heavily traded stock yesterday. The stock fell 24 but then rallied to close only 7 off at 238p as dealers felt a level had been reached. Regional brewer JA Devenish gained 11 to 289p xd as speculation mounted that Boddington, unsuccessful in a bid attempt last year, will soon announce a renewed offer. Boddington eased 4 to 177p. Discount retailer Amber Day warned that a poor second half meant annual profits will be below analysts' expectations. The shares declined 4 to 58p in spite of reassurances from the company that its core business is strong. Leading leisure stocks fared poorly in a dull sector. Ladbroke held up against a downgrade and a sell note from Paribas after a worthy annual statement, easing just 1 1/2 to 211p. Granada, shortly to join the FT-SE 100 Index, lost 6 to 261p, Rank Organisation, dulled by recent downgrades, shed 11 to 700p, while Thorn EMI gave up 14 to 834p after a recent good run. Critical weekend press comment stung Forte, although the shares recovered to close 4 off at 218p. Property shares remained under a cloud, with few features to tempt prospective buyers. Hammerson's announcement that it had secured more tenants for a prestigious New York office block failed to help the shares, 5 down at 363p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (27).

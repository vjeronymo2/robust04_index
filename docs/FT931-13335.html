			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Benefits for the adventurous - Off the Wall COULD IT happen at last? Is the Arts Council about to raise its chopper and axe the grants of some of the 150 clients that still look to it for sustenance? It is one of the vagaries of arts funding in the UK that, despite frequent huffing and puffing and the occasional minor sacrificial victim, once you are in with the Arts Council your organisation is supported for life. The Regional Boards are more vicious, especially to community projects, but the leading theatre companies, dance troupes, art galleries and orchestras never suffer more than the occasional frozen grant from the Council. But, by a nice irony, the platitudinous strategy document finally produced this week, A Creative Future, is to form the basis of - guess what - a radical strategy. Within three months the Council will decide its funding priorities on the basis of the guidelines mapped out in this document. It promises to go for quality rather than quantity, and to scythe off not just individual client companies but whole areas of funding, while lavishing more resources on key objectives. This will not mean the end of literature, touring opera, or regional theatre. But it could mean a system which rewards creativity, educational work, access - all the new buzzwords - and hits hard at the routine potboilers. Basically, the controversial decision of the Eastern Orchestral Board to fix its grants to concert promoters in line with the popularity of the composers programmed - a Pounds 450 grant if you put on Tchaikovsky, Pounds 1,000 for Mahler, building up to Pounds 2,000 for Harrison Birtwistle  -will become the national template. So, in theory, if the Royal Opera House, facing a growing deficit, plans more performances of Tosca, Carmen and Boheme in its 1993-94 season, it can anticipate a reduced grant. But since the Council thinks that Covent Garden is at last getting its act together, this is unlikely to happen. More likely victims are the orchestras and regional theatre companies which play safe with a diet of Beethoven and Ayckbourn. What has happened spasmodically in the past - as in the reduction of the Council's grant to the RPO because it favoured programmes of popular classics which attracted big audiences - will become the norm. Arts groups with an impressive youth programme, or which commission new dance works, or tour round village halls, can expect more. The Council has the advantage of a lower grant for 1994-95, down Pounds 5m to Pounds 220m,which can justify some pruning. Nothing has yet been settled, but the likely blueprint is more for living artists, less for dead masters. In May some unadventurous regional theatre companies or dance troupes might lose all their subsidy. That is until the specialist panels, the vested interests and the local lobbyists start kicking up a rumpus and the Council backs down. There is also the chance that the Heritage Minister, Peter Brooke, who is being lobbied by his good friend, the Arts Council chairman Lord Palumbo to rescind the Pounds 5m cut, will deliver more cash for 1994-95. The eventual bloodletting is likely to disappoint Dracula. The auction houses see no early end to the recession and are drastically reducing staff. Christie's did it in one foul swoop before Christmas; Sotheby's favours the gradual approach. Another 15 went in London this week. There is a sad case of shooting the messenger because the main casualty is Fiona Ford, a Sotheby's loyalist for 25 years, who resigned as head of the press office when her department was shorn of two staff. Casualties have been among support workers, but departures from the top echelons are expected. WITH Art 93 at the Business Design Centre in Islington (until Sunday), London at last has a contemporary art fair which can stand comparison with those in Chicago, Basle, Frankfurt and Madrid. It is also more populist than in the past, with decorative prints priced around Pounds 250 alongside grittier abstract sculptures costing Pounds 100,000 plus. In a recession dealers take few chances, and anyone put off contemporary art by the lumpen choices for the Turner Prize can have their enthusiasm re-fired. The first buyer was dealer Leslie Waddington, who snapped up an Anthony Caro sculpture from Anneley Juda and a David Mach sculpture from William Jackson. He got a small discount - but, these days, so can you. Also active was Unilever, which is showing its corporate collection on the upper gallery and adding to it all the time, buying a Martin Kane painting from Jill George for Pounds 4,000 and six works by Royal College of Art student Nicholas Morris for a total of around Pounds 1,200 from the Contemporary Art Society's Mini-market, where works start at Pounds 100. But perhaps the most eye catching exhibit is Michael Roosen's stand, which displays 48 portraits by Zsuzsi Roboz of leading contemporary artists, including Hockney, Rego, Frink and Bacon. He insists on selling the collection intact, for around Pounds 160,000. With the IRA making a pre-Christmas visit to the theatre too much of a drama for some last month, attendances in the West End in 1992 are likely to match, rather than overhaul, the 10.9m set the previous year. This is still some achievement, given the recession and the fact that 1991 produced the second best total on record. But there are causes for alarm. After a good first half 1992 got progressively stickier and more seats than ever were sold at a discount. There are signs that private angels are less keen to regularly lose money backing plays and that producers are having to dip into their own bank balances to put them on. But theatre owners, instead of being only interested in rent, are now considering themselves part of the play. The most striking commitment was by Maybox, owner of seven West End theatres, which agreed to cover the production costs of Sam Mendes' ambitious season at the revamped Donmar Warehouse which, because of its small size, can never be commercially viable. The success of his first production, Assassins, helped secure the Donmar Pounds 100,000 and a year's sponsorship from Carlton TV, which relieves Maybox of its burden.</p>

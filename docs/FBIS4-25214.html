			<p>BFN     [Text] The director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, Lu Ping, has told a top-level delegation from Hong Kong  that the territory's unique economic position is important not  only to maintain the territory's stability and prosperity, but  also to help the overall development of China's economy. He was  talking to an economic mission headed by Trade Development  Council (TDC) chairman Victor Fung, which yesterday met Chinese  officials in Beijing to discuss strengthening economic ties.    Mr Lu urged all provinces and major cities on the mainland  to  help protect Hong Kong's economic system and to take advantage  of the territory's position for expanding international trade.  Mr Lu said the TDC had done much in fostering closer economic  ties with the mainland, which should be strengthened further.    At a meeting with Minister of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo,  Mr  Fung said Hong Kong companies wanted to expand further in China  and hoped to broaden their scope of operation into China's  distribution system. Mr Zhang said China would continue to do  its best to conform to international practices as it developed  its internal commerce.    The mission also met Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation Zheng Silin. They discussed issues facing  China in its application to re-enter GATT and the subjects of  anti-dumping legislation and protectionism in major markets.    The mission was part of Hong Kong's participation in the  Asia  Pacific International Trade Fair in Beijing, to which the TDC  has sent a delegation representing 118 Hong Kong companies.</p>

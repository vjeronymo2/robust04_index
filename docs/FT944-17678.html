			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Reforms led to rise in deaths Soaring death rates and worsening health in eastern and central Europe threaten social stability and the entire reform process, according to the United Nations Childrens' Fund (Unicef) in a report published yesterday. The fund estimates that, since the fall of communism in 1989, 800,000 more people in the region have died than if 1989 death rates had prevailed. 'Such a death toll, mainly among males aged 30-55 and across so many countries, is without precedent in peacetime,' it says. It attributes the mortality crisis to the stress of changing to a market economy which has brought in its wake increased poverty, crime and breakdown of the social and institutional fabric. Of the nine countries surveyed in detail, Russia, Ukraine and south-eastern Europe were worst affected. In Russia, male life expectancy at birth has plunged 5.2 years since 1989 to just 59 years in 1993. However, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were largely untouched, while Poland by 1993 showed signs of returning to pre-transition mortality rates, the report notes. Unicef says most of the extra deaths were caused by heart problems, alcohol and food poisoning, accidents, homicides and suicides.</p>

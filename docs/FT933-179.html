			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Arts: Songs of innocence - Musical Plaid, to borrow from the Oxford English Dictionary, is 'a long piece of twilled woollen cloth, usually having a chequered or tartan pattern, forming the outer article of the Highland costume'. That is distinct from the Lowland plaid, which has a different pattern and is more commonly known as a maud. Americans are very fond of the Highland version. In the delightful musical entertainment that has opened at the Apollo, plaid is pronounced to rhyme with glad. Do not be misled by the bagpiper outside the theatre. Forever Plaid takes its name from a fictitious four guy harmony group of the kind that was immensely popular, especially in the US, in the 1950s. The story is that their kind of music was killed off by the arrival of the Beatles. Unlike Buddy Holly, Forever Plaid didn't even have a plane crash: they died in a road accident while still rehearsing. Now they come back from heaven. And heaven in a way it is. These are fresh-faced American guys, with short hair and intelligent looks. It is about as far from Grease or Hair as a musical can get. When not wearing plaid, they tend to wear elegant white dinner jackets: sometimes a mixture of the two. It is not hard to imagine them in high society, whether the movie or the real thing. There is a certain amount of dialogue and knock-about. For the most part, however, they simply sing the 1950s songs of innocence in their harmonised style. At one stage,they adapt the Beatles' 'She Loves Me', and you know that can't be bad. They have a wonderful time with 'Lady of Spain', bring in the audience when it comes to the mambo and show their more emotional range in their version of 'Cry'. Some will settle simply for the sheer nostalgic pleasure of their arrangements of 'Three Coins in the Fountain' and 'Catch a Falling Star', though they can have deeper voices when they want to, as in 'Sixteen Tons'. Plaid lasts for less than two hours without an interval, is directed by Stuart Ross, and has a splendid pianist in James Compton. Here is a show that you cannot fail to enjoy.

The headquarters of Koreans in China of Pomminnyon sponsored  a central meeting for the implementation of "10-Point Programme  of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of  the Country." Meetings were held also by its branch  associations in Zhongnan area, Liaoning and Jilin Provinces,  Yanbian and other areas.    The speakers said the programme is a great charter of  national reunification which reflects the ardent desire of the  fellow countrymen for reunification and declared that the  Koreans in China will make every possible effort to implement it.    At the second conference of Kotongnyon held in-Moscow in  September last year, delegates of Kotongnyon from Russia,  Kazakhstan, Tadzhikstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and other  republics and delegates of Pomminnyon organizations from other  regions called on the Koreans for reunifying the country in the  90s without fail with concerted efforts of the whole nation on  the basis of the programme, transcending the differences in  political view and religious belief, whether they reside in the  North or South or overseas.    After the programme was published, the headquarters of  Koreans in China of Pomminnyon and its Liaoning and Jilin  provincial associations, Kotongnyon, the association of Koreans  in Russia for reunification and the Moscow Committee of Korean  Veterans and figures of various social strata released  statements.

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Brazil awaits election results The announcement of final results for last week's presidential and congressional elections in Brazil has been delayed amid concerns about widespread election fraud in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Angus Foster writes. The fraud, which involved vote buying and tampering with ballot papers, seems only to have occurred in elections to the lower house of Congress and the state legislature. A special investigator from the capital Braslia was due to arrive yesterday in Rio to observe the vote counting and was reported to be under heavy armed protection. Rio is the only state where counting is still under way. Election authorities fear that ballot papers which voters had left blank were subsequently filled in to benefit certain candidates. Voting is compulsory in Brazil but voters leave their ballot papers blank either as a protest vote or because they do not know candidates' names.</p>

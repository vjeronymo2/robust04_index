			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is also concerned about its ability to grant SIP credits for emissions reductions under the FLEV proposal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> First, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  credits are ordinarily limited to emissions reduction measures that are adopted in a State's SIP, after reasonable notice and public hearing (as provided in section 110(a)(2) of the Act). One issue is whether under the FLEV proposal, the emissions controls could be part of the SIP, since to make them part of the SIP could conflict with the preemption provisions of section 209(a) of the Act. Further, once controls are adopted in the SIP, they are ordinarily federally enforceable under section 113 of the Act. Under the FLEV proposal, EPA would not be in a position to enforce the controls, both because the controls would not be in the SIP, and because the auto manufacturers have proposed that EPA not sign the consent decree. And it is not clear what jurisdiction the court would have to allow EPA to intervene in the New York or Massachusetts litigation to sign the consent decree, or to otherwise seek judicial enforcement of such a decree. For OTC States that would not sign the consent decree, it is unclear how such States could seek enforcement of the FLEV standards, or how EPA could grant SIP credits to them. Finally, the existence of clauses allowing the auto manufacturers to escape from their obligations to provide cars meeting the FLEV standards under particular circumstances reduces the certainty of the emissions controls. EPA is concerned that this lack of certainty conflicts with the ordinary certainty of SIP creditable measures. EPA requests comment on its ability to grant SIP credits for reductions generated under the FLEV proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Other Measures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OTC in its recommendation stated that it expects EPA to evaluate alternatives comparable to the OTC&hyph;LEV program in terms of enforceability, timeliness, quantity of emissions reductions, consistency with the Act, and advancement in technology. EPA recognizes that the magnitude of emissions reductions needed to mitigate significant contribution to nonattainment in the OTR is likely to exceed the reductions that the measures specified in the Act plus the LEV program will generate. To the extent more reductions will be needed even with the LEV program, other measures that address that shortfall would not, for that reason alone, qualify as ``alternatives'' to LEV. Rather, other measures might qualify as ``alternatives'' only if such other measures, singly or in combination, generate enough reductions to fill the entire shortfall needed without LEV. Any conclusions about what may qualify as ``alternatives,'' therefore, would depend on a prior evaluation of the magnitude of reductions needed. Once the amount of reductions needed is ascertained, then the emissions reductions and costs associated with measures other than LEV that could fill the shortfall without LEV might be evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, EPA believes it may be useful to consider the emissions reductions associated with other emission control measures that the Act specifically mandates for areas in the OTR, for example, reformulated gasoline, enhanced inspection and maintenance programs, and Stage II refueling vapor recovery controls. While these measures are not ``alternatives'' because they are mandatory, EPA believes that the amount of reductions they will generate is important in evaluating the magnitude of the shortfall for attainment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Next, EPA believes it may evaluate the emissions reductions associated with other measures that the OTC itself is considering and has agreed to adopt (in addition to the LEV program) or further explore through memoranda of understanding (MOU), including federal reformulated gasoline in areas where it is not mandatory under the Act, a ``second phase'' of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission reductions from stationary sources and an intrastate NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission offset trading program. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OTC MOUs signed October 29, 1991, March 10, 1992, and May 18, 1993.) Another source of measures is the menu of options identified by STAPPA/ALAPCO in a document entitled ``Meeting the 15&hyph;Percent Rate-of-Progress Requirement Under the Clean Air Act: A Menu of Options'' (September 1993). Finally, measures identified in the recent FIP proposal for certain areas in California (EPA Air Docket No. A&hyph;94&hyph;09) could be evaluated. EPA requests comment on measures from these sources and other potential measures for evaluation that could be alternatives to the recommended OTC&hyph;LEV program. EPA might evaluate the cost, reasonableness, and other factors associated with these other measures if they are shown, in fact, to be ``alternatives'' to the LEV program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Consistency With the Clean Air Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, section 184 requires that in reviewing the recommendation of the OTC, EPA must evaluate whether the additional control measures are ``otherwise consistent with this Act.'' In particular, the additional control measures must be consistent with section 177 of the Act, which provides States with the authority to adopt and enforce emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines if such standards are identical to California standards and if the State adopts the standards at least two years before the commencement of the model year to which such standards apply. Also, the State standards must not prohibit the manufacture or sale of California-certified motor vehicles, nor may they create a ``third car.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

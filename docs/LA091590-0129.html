			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER BIG METHAMPHETAMINE BUST IN BUENA PARK  </P> <P> Police, working on an informant's tip, raided a 22-year-old woman's motel room  and then her Encinitas home and seized about 20 pounds of methamphetamine and  $80,000 in cash, police said Friday.  </P> <P> It was second methamphetamine bust in Buena Park in the past two days, police  said.  </P> <P> The latest raid occurred about midnight Thursday when investigators stopped a  driver on the Riverside Freeway who had a small amount of the drug. After  interviewing the driver, investigators were led to a motel room in Buena Park  rented by Julia Anna Clark.  </P> <P> When investigators searched Clark's room, they found a small amount of drugs  and $43,000 in cash, police said. Officers then obtained a warrant to search  Clark's Encinitas home where they found 20 pounds of methamphetamine and an  additional $37,000, police said.  </P> <P> Clark was arrested on suspicion of possession of methamphetamines with the  intent to sell and was being held in Orange County Jail on $500,000 bail.  </P> <P> In an unrelated investigation earlier Thursday, narcotics officers raided a  methamphetamine laboratory set up in a Buena Park house, seizing between 5 and  10 pounds of the drug and arresting a Riverside man, police said Friday.  </P> <P> That raid capped a three-week investigation involving Brea police and the state  Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement.  </P> <P> Police said the laboratory was capable of making of 25 pounds of  methamphetamine worth an estimated $250,000 on the street.  </P> <P> James Scigliano, 26, of Riverside was arrested on suspicion of manufacturing  methamphetamines after investigators found him hiding in a closet, police said.  </P> <P> During the raid, investigators wore special suits and gas masks for their  protection while handling potentially toxic chemicals.  </P> <P> Laboratory equipment was seized in addition to the drug and chemicals, police  said.  </P></p>

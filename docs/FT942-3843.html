			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Mid-life change for insurers: Recent takeovers show how the European industry is preparing for liberalisation Casual observers might get the impression that European insurers are in the grip of takeover fever. Commercial Union's announcement last week that it is poised to buy France's sixth biggest life insurer, Groupe Victoire, for some FFr12.5bn (Pounds 1.45bn), is the latest in a recent flurry of deals. It is also a further example of consolidation as the industry prepares to adapt to a new and more liberal regulatory regime. By the beginning of next month, European Union member states must implement new legislation which completes the deregulation of their markets. And as Europe emerges from recession, insurers appear to be becoming increasingly acquisitive as they prepare for the competition which will result. In January, Switzerland's Winterthur bought one of Germany's biggest insurers, DBV, for an estimated DM900m (Pounds 360m). Last autumn, Victoire's owners, Compagnie de Suez, the French financial conglomerate, sold off Victoire's Germany subsidiary in a deal worth about FFr20bn to France's Union des Assurances de Paris. And in March 1993, Sun Alliance, one of Commercial Union's UK rivals, became the biggest insurer in Denmark when it paid Kr1.27bn (Pounds 129m) to buy the business of Hafnia, a company pushed into receivership after an unsuccessful effort to expand. Commercial Union's foray, to be financed through a mixture of debt, cash and equity, is the most significant European acquisition by a UK insurer for 20 years and one of the biggest acquisitions of a French company by any UK business. Commercial Union has long harboured European ambitions - it acquired its Dutch subsidiary in 1973. But for the UK insurance industry as a whole - which has traditionally focused overseas activities in the United States and other English-speaking territories - the deal marks a change in direction. 'Europe is our home market from which we seek to expand,' explains Mr Tony Wyand, Commercial Union's finance director. 'A lot of people at the political level approach Europe with ingrained suspicion. But more and more business people regard the Continent as a significant opportunity to increase profitability.' Although the acquisition will leapfrog Commercial Union into the European industry's 'premier league', Mr Wyand suggests that many of the benefits stemming from economies of scale will emerge only in the longer term. To a degree its timing - just three weeks before the 1 July deadline - is coincidental and Commercial Union's approach to the deal, painstakingly negotiated over the last three to four months, reflects the adoption of a more realistic attitude to European expansion by many companies. First, it is becoming clear that despite the achievement of a liberal market framework the development of a genuine single European insurance market could be a slow process. By July 1 European Union member states must implement new rules which allow insurers licensed in any state to trade throughout the union. Price control and rules giving local regulators control over the types of insurance policies available must be abolished. But in practice most European markets are already liberalised in these respects. Price control, effectively limited to motor liability insurance, has disappeared in most EU countries - except Germany, Italy and some smaller markets. Across the Continent, in line with long-established UK practice, the focus of regulation is on ensuring the financial health or solvency of insurance companies. At the same time the EU directives will have no impact on a range of other factors which are likely to restrict cross-border competition, especially insofar as the needs of individual consumers - rather than corporate buyers  -are concerned. Europe's biggest insurers, such as Italy's Generali, Germany's Allianz and France's UAP, dominate their local markets partially because the agents who sell their products exclusively tend to enjoy high degrees of customer loyalty. Tax rules vary sharply between different states and are unaffected by the new legislation. Differences in tax treatment have a crucial impact on the life insurance market, where sales are often driven by tax advantages. Although British life insurance policies frequently produce better returns for policyholders, this is sometimes at the expense of higher risk and volatility to which consumers in France and Germany have proved to be averse. In addition, local regulators will continue to enjoy some power, and could restrict the extent to which overseas companies can compete. In particular, they can limit the freedoms of companies whose policies are deemed to conflict with a legal principle known as the 'general good'. There are fears, for example, that some regulators could limit insurers' ability to vary the premium rates charged to customers on the grounds that such moves would be discriminatory, for groups such as ethnic minorities. Second, it is partially the problems created by an over-hasty approach to European expansion which have given Commercial Union its current opportunity to expand. Many observers believe companies - such as Suez  - paid too much to build their European operations in the late 1980s, in preparation for the first phase of single market regulation. Rules lifting restrictions on cross-border trade in large commercial risks - the so-called second non-life directive - were implemented by member states in 1990. Suez itself was unable to sustain its aggressive European strategy after acquiring the Victoire group in a takeover valued at FFr27.4bn in 1989. Denmark's Hafnia was pushed into receivership and Norway's Uni Storebrand forced to restructure after launching a joint plan to take over Sweden's Skandia, with the goal of creating a Scandinavian insurance giant capable of competing with its larger European rivals. A number of other companies made smaller, less ambitious, acquisitions in a bid to establish a toehold. But few of these deals brought lasting benefits and some, such as Guardian Royal Exchange's acquisition of an Italian motor insurance company, left buyers with heavy losses. 'A decade ago the major companies were desperate to establish their toehold in Europe. This quest typically resulted in making an exorbitantly priced, though not necessarily large, acquisition in one of the fast-growing southern European markets,' says Mr Michael Huttner, analyst with BZW, the securities house. 'Over the last few years there has been a definite change in approach,' says Mr Huttner, who believes insurers are much more likely to consider alternatives to acquisition. The success of direct telephone sales in the UK has spurred a number of companies to set up new operations in other EU states as an alternative to purchase. Winterthur, which owns the second biggest telephone insurer in the UK, Churchill, recently set up another operation in Denmark, for example, while its Swiss rival, Zurich Insurance, announced its intention earlier this month to set up a new telephone insurer in Switzerland, which it intends to extend throughout Europe. Mr Wyand, who is part of the management team which has led Commercial Union's recovery since its disastrous US losses in the early and mid-1980s, is anxious to downplay any accusations of hubris. 'This is a strategic decision taken without regard to premium volume,' he explains. Five years ago, companies typically paid prices equal to twice the annual premium income of the businesses they acquired. By contrast, Commercial Union has a bargain paying Suez a price equal to about half Victoire's annual premiums. 'Size is the consequence of success not the cause. We have obtained critical mass at a price we believe is economic,' Mr Wyand insists.  --------------------------------------------------------             HOW COMMERCIAL UNION MEASURES UP  -------------------------------------------------------- Compared with leading Euro insurers (1993 actual or estimated premium income)  --------------------------------------------------------                                               Pounds                                               billion  -------------------------------------------------------- Allianz                    Germany             26.6 UAP*                       France              19.0 Swiss Re                   Switzerland         11.7 Zurich                     Switzerland         11.6 Axa                        France              11.4 BAT                        UK                  10.4 Includes premium income of Farmers Exchanges plus Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar Munich Re                  Germany             10.2 Generali                   Italy               10.1 Prudential                 UK                   9.8 Winterthur**               Switzerland          9.3 Commercial Union***        UK                   8.7 AGF                        France               7.6  -------------------------------------------------------- *Pro forma after Colonia acquisition **Pro forma after DBV acquisition ***Pro forma after Victoire acqusition  -------------------------------------------------------- Source: BZW Securities: FT  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

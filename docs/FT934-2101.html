			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Goodman Fielder chief replaced in shake-up The chief executive of Goodman Fielder, the Australian food group, has been replaced in a shake-up of top management aimed at restoring investor confidence. Mr John Studdy, chairman. announced last night that the company's chief executive, Mr Michael Nugent, would be replaced immediately by Mr Barry Weir, formerly managing director of Goodman Fielder's European operations. The announcement, which came after the close of Australian share trading, surprised analysts although it continued an executive exodus from Goodman which has sapped investor confidence in recent months. Most recent resignations include the company's baking and milling chief, Mr John Baird, and poultry and ingredients executive, Mr John Keniry. Goodman's earnings growth has been sluggish in recent years, in spite of severe cost-cutting exercises and the sale of a number of non-core assets. Market perception is that the company has failed to recover sufficiently from two failed takeover attempts in the late 1980s, a Pounds 1.3bn (USDollars 1.93bn) tilt at Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK food group, and a ADollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.17bn) move on Industrial Equity, the former Australian corporate raider. Despite recent market purchases of Goodman shares by potential acquisitors, the company's share price has underperformed the Australian market this year, raising speculation of a possible takeover or break up of the group. GF shares closed 3 cents higher at ADollars 1.66 on Australian markets yesterday. A measure of the swiftness of yesterday's action by the board came with Mr Studdy's announcement that Mr Weir had already assumed Mr Nugent's responsibilities. Other management changes include the appointment of Mr Cees Spoon as chairman of the company's European operations and Mr Ken Green as operations director for Europe. Mr Weir said last night he believed GF could meet 'significantly improved performance targets in the near term'. He said some of the company's businesses exhibited brand bias and others commodity bias and they should be managed accordingly. 'An early priority will be to develop a strong succession plan, with particular emphasis at the most senior management levels,' he said. 'The European group, which now accounts for 25 per cent of GF's turnover, is becoming a very strong performer for the group, with continuing integration benefits from the acquisition of Wessanen expected through 1995.'</p>

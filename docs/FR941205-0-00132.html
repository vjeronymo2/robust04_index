			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methods for Secondary Contaminants_Some commenters believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that delisting a secondary contaminant method precludes its use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for other than compliance monitoring samples. This is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correct; EPA does not certify laboratories for secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring, and EPA only recommends methods for secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants. Unless State requirements provide otherwise,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratories may use methods other than those cited at 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 143.4(b) for measurement of secondary contaminants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Method 245.2 (mercury)_EPA was asked to withdraw this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method, which is an automated, cold vapor method for mercury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA cannot withdraw this method because there is no other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent version of the method. Because EPA does not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough information to assess the effect that withdrawal of Method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 245.2 would have, it is deferring a decision on withdrawal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Methods 150.1, 150.2 (pH)_In the 1994 NOA, EPA proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to replace these methods with equivalent ASTM and Standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods for pH. A commenter noted that the EPA methods are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easier to use under field conditions. The commenter indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that since many pH measurements are made in the field at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point of sample collection, withdrawal of the EPA methods would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose a significant hardship. EPA agrees with the commenter, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not withdraw these methods until ASTM or Standard Methods pH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods are simplified for field use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reformat Listing of Methods in 40 CFR Parts 141 and 143_Commenters have asked EPA to improve the organization and clarity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the drinking water regulations. Commenters have criticized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the organization of the rules, and noted difficulty in obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> copies of drinking water regulations. They need the regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because they contain tables and lists of approved methods, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because mandatory method instructions are included in the text of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rules and in footnotes to the tables of methods. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instructions are not contained in the approved methods, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were developed after the method was published. In today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, EPA is minimizing the use of footnotes and lengthy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical instructions in drinking water rules. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishing this by including these instructions in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document Technical Notes on Drinking Water Methods (EPA, 1994d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This EPA publication contains mandatory procedures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifications and helpful options, such as guidance on more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficient ways to conduct asbestos and dioxin compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements. EPA will place these instructions in the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method when the method is revised and published. EPA intends to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use this document to publish future method corrections or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications (after notice and comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as necessary). EPA believes Technical Notes will be easier for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> users to obtain, read and photocopy than the tables of approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods in the drinking water rules. Incorporating Technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notes on Drinking Water Methods by reference in the rule has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of making its provisions as mandatory as those in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved drinking water methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is improving the clarity of the rules by consolidating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listings of analytical methods. Analytical methods for THMs have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been moved from &sect;141.30 to &sect;141.24(e). Appendix C of &sect;141.30,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which contained THM Methods 501.1 and 501.2, is withdrawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately, but the methods may be used for compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring under &sect;141.30 until July 1, 1996 (or 18 months from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication, whichever is later). And analytical methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formerly specified for lead, copper, and corrosivity at 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 141.89(a) and sodium at &sect;141.41(d) are now listed with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inorganic methods at &sect;141.23(k)(1). EPA notes that although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sodium was removed from the list of 83 contaminants included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1986 amendments to the SDWA (53 FR 26487), the provisions at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;141.41 still obtain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifications for Continuous Chlorine Monitoring Methods_Commenters favored the proposed specification for continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorine monitoring measurements to be based on calibration with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an approved grab sample method. Two commenters asked EPA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extend the calibration period to seven days. EPA has no data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support such an extension. However, the EPA protocol for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous chlorine monitoring allows a laboratory to use an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative protocol, if it is approved by the State. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes it is prudent for States to monitor and approve changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the EPA protocol, such as those suggested by commenters. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocol approved in today's rule is specified at 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 141.74(a)(2), and allows States to grant variations, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain changes in the chemistry of the method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

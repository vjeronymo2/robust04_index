			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: News in Brief HOUSING: Council rent arrears stood at Pounds 430m at the end of March 1991, a Pounds 70m rise on the previous year, Housing Minister Sir George Young said last night. The figure, given in a Commons written reply, represented 8.5 per cent of the total sum collectable in 1990-91. Sir George said London councils accounted for Pounds 200m, nearly half of English arrears and the capital included eight of the ten authorities with the poorest performances. ***** CIVIL SERVICE: The government is to launch at least a dozen more Civil Service agencies in April. That will bring the proportion of civil servants working fully along lines laid down in the Next Steps programme to 50 per cent. ***** ARTS: Labour yesterday accused the government of neglecting a 'great jewel in the British crown' by cutting the British Library's acquisitions budget by 41 per cent in real terms over four years. Mr Tim Renton, arts minister, said it was up to the Library to decide what proportion of its grant in aid should be earmarked for acquisitions.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa swings into deficit TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the leading Swedish insurance group, swung to a SKr5.2bn (Dollars 682m) loss in 1992 from a SKr531m profit a year earlier after suffering more than SKr6bn in losses through its exposure to three bankrupt Swedish companies. The group had large holdings in Gota AB (the holding company for Gota Bank) and two collapsed credit insurers, Svenska Kredit and International Credit, which were written down to zero at a total cost of SKr6.03bn. It also suffered from a negative reinsurance result and a further drop in property values. As a result, the company scrapped its dividend after paying out SKr4 per share in 1991. The insurance result halved to SKr500m from SKr1.01bn, even though premiums rose 14 per cent to SKr8.53bn. The group blamed its reinsurance operations for the fall, saying the impact of Hurricane Andrew and credit losses caused a reinsurance deficit of 'several hundred million krona,' compared with a SKr28m profit in 1991. The group is to cut its reinsurance business by 50 per cent this year, sharply reducing its catastrophe exposure but also reducing its activity in a number of European markets and business areas. In 1992, reinsurance premiums totalled SKr2.5bn. 'We have made this move because we do not regard reinsurance as a core business and it was becoming too costly to buy retrocession protection,' said Mr Lars Pihlgren, head of Trygg's reinsurance and marine operations. A consolation for the group was the revival in share prices towards the end of the year, which pushed up the group's solvency margin to 134 per cent at the year end from 110 per cent at the eight-month stage.</p>

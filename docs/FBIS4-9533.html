			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Warsaw, 27 Apr--Out of a sense of responsibility  for the country and the success of the Polish reforms, the  Council of Ministers deems it essential to take up a position on  the wave of strikes currently being organized. Society must  know that the strikes in the brown coal mines constitute a  threat to Poland's power supply, and the spread of strike  actions can ruin the chances of economic development, a  Government Press Bureau communique on 27 April states. [passage  omitted]    In the government's assessment, their are no substantive  grounds for reaching for the strike weapon. The strikes are  continuing in spite of clear assurances that the reform of the  brown-coal mining industry depends on an earlier agreement with  the trade unions and in spite of the annulment by the industry  minister of the instruction concerning changes in this sector of  the economy. The response to the decision by the minister of  industry and trade was more demands and attempts at diktat. The  readiness for talks is being ignored. Such a reaction proves  unambiguously that, for the strike organizers, the content  itself of the demands and negotiations is of lesser importance.  Unrest and tensions themselves are what count.    The leaders of the Solidarity trade union have made a  nervous  attempt to force decisions by the state's constitutional bodies  and to restore a situation guaranteeing Solidarity a privileged  position vis-a-vis the other trade unions. To achieve these  aims, it is deceiving the working milieux by disseminating  untrue reports of mass redundancies being prepared.    The government is open to talks with the trade unions,  employer representatives, and local self-government leaders.  [passage omitted]    Such talks are already under way. It is Solidarity that has  refused to take part in them. [passage omitted]    The organizers of the strike bear responsibility for  diminishing chances for development. The effect of their deeds  is that we in Poland see, with each passing hour, a  disorganization of the economy, a smaller cake to share, and  less to satisfy the needs of the population.    These strikes have no legal basis nor any substantive,  rational justification. Enterprises have every right to seek  compensation from the strike organizers for losses incurred, we  read in the communique of the Government Press Office.    The government is taking essential steps to limit the danger  to the security of the country and to lessen the extent of  economic losses and the inconvenience caused to Polish families  by strike actions. Unfortunately, should restrictions in the  production of electricity be protracted, periodic power cuts in  homes will become inevitable.    The Council of Ministers expresses its trust that the Polish  people will not surrender to the blackmail of strikes. While  keeping its open-minded attitude toward substantive  negotiations, the government declares that it will decisively  oppose any anarchy in economic life and work for the security of  the citizens.    Negotiations need an atmosphere of cooperation and not one  of  threats and irresponsibility. Participation in the strike is  like voting for destabilization and for hindering any chance of  social demands being implemented. The prime minister has  empowered Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol to hold talks on  demands made by different sectors of industry. As far as issues  concerning the whole of society are concerned, such a remit has  been entrusted to Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social  policy.    A meeting of all the trade unions that belong to the  Tripartite Commission will take place on 29 April.    According to the prime minister, there is no basis for  calling a national strike, states the communique.</p>

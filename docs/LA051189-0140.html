			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The perception of college sports as inherently corrupt is unfair to many good  programs and changing that image is the top priority of the National Collegiate  Athletic Assn., Executive Director Dick Schultz said in a speech at  Spartanburg, S.C.  </P> <P> "We're getting a pretty good handle on recruiting violations," Schultz said in  his address at the Wofford College athletic awards banquet. "By the time that  happens, we have the social problems that start popping up."  </P> <P> Schultz referred specifically to several recent criminal incidents involving  members of the University of Oklahoma football team. He later said the NCAA was  following with interest the case at South Carolina, where four former coaches  have been charged in federal court in connection with the purchase and  distribution of steroids.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article, under the rubric "Business": "The </F> Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Has Again Liberalized Investment  Conditions. But For How Long?"]    [Text] As we know, a few years ago, Ukraine's legislative  base for investment was the most liberal in the whole CIS. But  investors did not have the opportunity to rejoice for long: a  series of government decrees and directives virtually nullified  the laws passed by the Supreme Council, as a result of which the  investment climate in Ukraine became intolerable. It seems that  the government has now realized that investments are a necessary  thing. Thus, there was recent approval for the "State Program To  Encourage Foreign Investment in Ukraine," which so far has  produced no impressive results, even though it came into force  on 1 March 1994. Specialists believe that the program will begin  to function in a real way after 1 April -- that is, when the  benefits to investors that the program provides come into force.    Thus, as of 1 April of this year, foreign investors will  enjoy the following benefits:    1. Accelerated rates of depreciation on machiney and  equipment.    2. Exemption from profits tax for a period that will depend  on the size of the foreign investment: for investments up to and  including $500,000 --one year; for investments above $500,000  and up to and including $5 million -- two years; for investments  above $5 million and up to and including $50 million -- three  years; for investments above $50 million --five years.    3. Tax credits on preferential terms on taxes that are  subject to payment during the first three years of operation of  enterprises with foreign investments.    4. A refund of 50% of the import duties paid on  producer  goods brought in from abroad and 100% of the duty paid on  imported parts, accessories, and machine units for joint  projects upon submission of evidence that these were used by an  enterprise with foreign investment in its own production. This  benefit is in effect for five years from the moment that the  International Cooperation and Investment Agency approves the  foreign investment project.    5. Credits on preferential terms granted by authorized banks  from a special budget fund created for this purpose on the basis  of a credit agreement, which must also be approved by the  International Cooperation and Investment Agency and the Ministry  of Finance of Ukraine.    6. Insurance for investment risks from a special budget fund  for insurance guarantees.    Observers believe that even with the existence of such  benefits, there will be no flood of investments into Ukraine. No  investor is going to bring his millions to Ukraine only to read  in the newspaper some time later that these benefits have been  abolished because of a decision to implement measures to  stabilize the Ukrainian karbovanets or some other such  eventuality. The government of Ukraine has already earned the  reputation of being the most inscrutable government in Europe.  For that reason, such guarantees can only be given by the  president, and he has not yet said how long these benefits will  remain irrevocable.</p>

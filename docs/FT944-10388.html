			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades Eli Lilly to Aa3 Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has lowered the long-term debt ratings of Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, to Aa3 from Aa1, affecting about Dollars 825m of debt securities, AP-DJ reports. The downgrade concludes a review begun on July 11, after Lilly revealed its intention to purchase the PCS Health Systems business from McKesson, the US healthcare group, for Dollars 4bn. Moody's said the downgrade recognised the heavy debt burden Lilly would undertake to complete the acquisition as well as the uncertainty whether incremental profits attributable to PCS would generate attractive investment returns.</p>

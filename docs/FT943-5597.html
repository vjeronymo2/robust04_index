			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (16): Big spenders await the rush - Airport development With world air passenger traffic rising by 5 per cent a year, the current annual passenger total of 1.25bn is expected to double by the early years of the next century. The air transport industry is gearing itself to meet this growth. Airlines are gradually restructuring to improve their operational and financial performance; manufacturers are building ever-larger aircraft; and airports are increasing their own capacity. More than 200 substantial airport modernisation and expansion schemes are under way. They include new airports on land reclaimed from the sea, as at Kansai, in Osaka Bay, Japan, and at Chek Lap Kok, off Lantau Island, Hong Kong; the near-Pounds 1bn proposed Terminal Five at London's Heathrow; and the comparatively simple but nonetheless vital smaller restructurings, such as the Pounds 21m redevelopment at Southampton Eastleigh, also in the UK. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, the aviation agency of the United Nations, suggests that the cost of all this work is likely to be Dollars 240bn over the next 10 years. But this covers only the direct airport development costs - work being done inside airport boundaries on terminals, runways and associated roads, and items of internal equipment such as information systems, security systems, passenger amenities and fire and rescue equipment. It does not include the massive associated infrastructure costs outside, which are just as necessary to enable airports to function smoothly. These include road and rail links with adjacent cities (for example, the Pounds 300m direct rail link between Paddington station in central London and Heathrow airport), and the big investments needed in air traffic control (ATC) facilities (such as the Pounds 350m new en route ATC centre being built at Fareham, Hampshire, by the Civil Aviation Authority for the UK National Air Traffic Services). If these outlays are also included, overall airport and associated infrastructure costs over the next decade could rise to at least Dollars 400bn. Oris Dunham, director-general of Airports Council International, an independent non-profit body representing more than 420 international airports in 139 countries, points out that keeping up the momentum of airport development will require the co-operation of all elements of the air transport system. He suggests that there are four principal challenges: finding physical space for the developments; finding the money; political considerations; and increasing environmental concerns. The first is already serious: breaking out of existing airport boundaries to undertake new terminal or runway development is difficult for many reasons, especially environmental constraints; and most airport authorities find they have to squeeze new terminals out of existing space, meeting the increased pressures by improved operational procedures. This is why some authorities - in Japan, Hong Kong and Macao - have opted for the offshore airport approach, although such solutions are available in few places. The financial problem is just as difficult. While some of the money can be derived from an airport's own activities - such as the expanding retailing ventures by the British Airports Authority - in many cases, it must come from either governments or the capital markets. An improvement in financial management and operational efficiency by airport authorities can do much to help secure outside investors' funds, without risking counter-productive increases in tariffs for airlines and passengers. The political problems stem from governments' need to recognise that the air transport industry is a generator of economic growth, and not to be regarded as a cash-cow for national treasuries and subjected to penal taxation. The international Air Transport Action Group, representing airlines, aircraft manufacturers, tourist bodies and other organisations involved in air transport, is already doing much to stimulate governments to do more for aviation. It points out that every 1m passengers passing through an airport generate between 2,500 and 8,000 jobs, (depending upon airport size) and a financial benefit to the local and national economy of between Dollars 130m and Dollars 1.6bn. In other words, growth in air transport drives economic progress, and in turn benefits from it. Taxing air transport (such as through passenger departure taxes) can only be acceptable to the industry if the money is fed back into the development of the air transport infrastructure, but not if it is used as just another means of raising revenues for non-aviation purposes. The environmental challenge is likely to become even more severe. Much has already been done to reduce aircraft noise and emission levels, but it seems likely that more stringent regulations will be imposed in the next few years. It also seems certain that existing night-noise curfews will in most places become more restrictive, so that the burden of an increasing number of flights will have to be met by increased efficiency in handling during daylight. This will in turn affect other elements of the overall system - with pressure for faster handling of passengers through airports, improved access to airports by road and rail, the use of larger aircraft, and tougher air traffic controls.</p>

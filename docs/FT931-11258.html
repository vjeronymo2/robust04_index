			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Problem-country provisions push BfG to DM1bn net loss BFG BANK, the German bank majority-owned by Credit Lyonnais of France, made a net loss of DM1.1bn (Dollars 681m) last year as a result of a significant increase in provisions against problem-country risks. At the operating level, the bank raised its group profits by about DM100m from DM144m in 1991. It is aiming for a further increase in operating profits during the current year, assuming falling interest rates in Germany. Until the end of last year, BfG was owned by the Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs insurance group and the BGAG trades-union holding company. Majority-control was acquired by Credit Lyonnais, the large state-owned French bank, in a deal that valued BfG at DM2.1bn. The bank said that it had increased its provisions against doubtful-country debts to 75 per cent from 50 per cent of the total exposure. It also increased the absolute number of countries covered. The provisions accounted for DM910m of the DM1.1m net loss, the bank said. BfG traditionally had strong business links with the eastern bloc, which left it with a high level of bad and doubtful debts. Shareholders injected DM1bn over 1990 and 1991 to enable the bank to provide against about 50 per cent of questionable debts of DM3.2bn at the end of 1991. The increased provisioning was agreed to as part of the deal with Credit Lyonnais. The French bank has injected DM1.2bn into its new German subsidiary in order to bolster its balance sheet. It said that it had been able to reduce the level of provisioning against domestic loans during the course of the past year. Without giving any details, it said that trading profits had increased while the level of securities write-offs had declined. These preliminary details were released in Paris to coincide with the Credit Lyonnais general meeting to approve the acquisition. Full details will be published in March. At the operating level, the bank raised its group profits by about DM100m, from DM144m in 1991.  It is aiming for a further increase in operating profits during the current year, on the assumption that interest rates in Germany fall.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Dangerous Corner - Theatre JB Priestly (1894-1984) wrote his first play, Dangerous Corner, in 1932. England was in recession, unemployment around three million, and society changing rapidly. Under identical circumstances in 1992, Priestly's message holds true: the future must be reworked from the past, learning from mistakes. The Birmingham Rep's production of Dangerous Corner offers a meticulous account of this unquiet comedy thriller, entertaining and instructive. Dangerous Corner belongs with Time and the Conways (1937), An Inspector Calls (1946) and with Anthony Ackland's The Dark River (1939). All are forensic studies of society which start in the present to uncover the past. The production opens with a billowing curtain drawn upward, like a dust sheet, revealing a frozen social tableau. A chance after-dinner remark about a cigarette box leads six upper-middle class characters into a sticky web of connection. They deep question each other into the early hours. All emerge as liars, sometimes pernicious, but more often muddled and confused: 'The real truth is something so deep you can't get at it; all half-truth does is to blow it all up. It isn't civilised.' Priestly contrives a plausible ending by making the news of past events bear on present relationships. But the play commits itself to more than the search for truth, since the action uncovers sex, drugs, greed and hatred beneath the sober patina of polite society. It amounts to social archaeology. Just as Priestly's English Journey (1934) found old England in York and Durham, Victorian England in Manchester, and post-war England in filling stations and cigarette coupons, so Dangerous Corner finds women's sexuality in an after-dinner smile, new commercial attitudes in the flourish of a dress, old values in a formal goodnight. Robert Jones' excellent design is a simple drawing-room with the Priestly essentials: whisky and a way out to the conservatory. Gwenda Hughes's direction misses the fun and cliche embedded in the play, and takes itself too seriously: one woman returns to the party, convinced she is being talked about; an outraged hostess awaits her husband's crooked business partner with 'he'll get no sandwiches from me'. The acting of Marilyn Cutts, Graham Padden and David Hobbs catches some of Priestly's wit; the other actors have yet to find the right tone. Priestly offers a quiet coda, repeating the first scene, in which the casual question which started the previous three acts is deftly turned aside, a road not taken. It is a witty turn into a social rather than philosophical definition of truth. But then, even serious philosophers can be distracted: Bertrand Russell once asked GE Moore, 'Do you always tell the truth?' Moore replied, 'No.' Russell recalled: 'That was the only lie I ever knew him to tell.' Birmingham Rep (021 236 4455)</p>

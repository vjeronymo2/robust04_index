			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (5): Reforms aim to free farmers - Agriculture The contrast between Ukraine's prosperous farms and the sparse shelves in Kiev's state stores provides a dramatic demonstration of the breakdown of the planned economy. Ukraine's farmers are no longer willing to sell their produce to the state market now that the threat of retribution from the centre has disappeared. So the government is trying to bring the market economy to the Ukrainian countryside. Agriculture is Ukraine's most efficient and potentially profitable export industry. Last year, Ukraine's farms produced 39m tonnes of grain, despite a mild drought. But the Ukrainian government, once responsible for 25 per cent of grain production in the entire Soviet Union, was forced to import 3m tonnes of grain last year to make up the short-fall in its 17m-tonne state order. Ukraine's new reform-minded government hopes that the agricultural sector will be the first to reap the fruits of reform and shake up Ukraine's 8,000 collective farms, many of which are inefficient and inert. It has abolished subsidies for almost all agricultural products, raised the food prices in state stores by 300-500 per cent and is preparing a package of agricultural reforms which aim to free farmers to sell their produce at market prices and dismantle the system whereby the state provided farms with all of their inputs. The plan, intended to erode the power of Ukraine's vast agricultural bureaucracy and bankrupt the most inefficient farms, is political risky. But Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, minister for the economy and architect of the government's overall reform programme, is confident that the government can succeed in implementing its agricultural package. A decision to continue the old practice of setting a target for government grain purchases, with the official 'state order' for 1993 pegged at 13 million tonnes, illustrates the reformers' technique for evading criticism by conservatives. On the face of it, no single measure could be more threatening to reforms because it is the state order system which has been used to force farmers to sell to a single monopoly purchaser - the government. But, as Mr Pynzenyk explains, officially perpetuating the state order system is a cosmetic effort to appease political opponents of reform. While the state order will exist on paper, farms will be able to fulfil their state order by selling their grain anywhere, including for export. 'The state order is just a formality, a formal sacrifice we are making to some of our bureaucracy,' he explains. The system of central state orders and subsidies may be the main reason for the relative inefficiency of the agricultural sector. But those farms which have begun to free themselves from state control have a long way to go. The 40 Years October (as in 'October Revolution') collective farm, in the village of Ustynivka about 70km south of Kiev, is one of the more progressive collectives in the region. The 2,000ha farm, which employs more than 500 people, began a co-operative venture with ICI nearly a decade ago. It sold only 70 per cent of this year's crop to the state, and is trying to sell more of its output independently. Small meat and vegetable processing factories have been set up on the farm to give it independence from the monopolistic state food processing industry. Chemicals bought from the west have boosted grain yields to nearly double the Ukrainian average. Mr Vasyl Vasylenko, the chief economist, welcomed the government's price liberalisation. The old system of state-controlled food prices, coupled with the sudden increase in Russian fuel prices to world levels, made milk and meat production loss-making activities and forced 40 Years October to cut its dairy cattle herd by 100 head last year. But Mr Vasylenko will be less pleased by other reforms that the government is planning to implement. In recent years, as the hand of the state has withered, farms such as 40 Years October have converted themselves into closed joint-stock companies dividing the farm into non-tradeable shares owned by the former collective farm members. In practice, this has allowed farm directors throughout Ukraine to assume control of the assets, according to research by Mr Simon Johnson of the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and Ms Zanny Minton-Beddoes of Harvard University. The government plans to compel the 50 per cent of collective farms which have become closed stock companies to convert to open joint-stock companies so that workers can trade their shares and inefficient or corrupt directors can be replaced. For more immediate and dramatic results, the government is focusing its attention on giving plots of land to its citizens, similar to those which collective farm members have always possessed. More than 13m citizens now farm these smallholdings. The loosening of state controls in 1992 triggered a 50 per cent increase in the output of these plots which now provide nearly a third of total agricultural production. Earlier this month the government passed a decree giving the cultivators of private plots full ownership of their land. It is now seeking to increase the size of the garden plots. 'These garden plots are the main source of food for the cities' says Mr Pynzenyk. In Ustynivka, the importance of the garden plots to the general health of the Ukrainian economy is evident. In the O6 hectare garden plot behind her immaculate, white-washed house Mrs Paraska Mykhnenko, a retired member of the 40 Years October collective farm, feeds an entire extended family. With her pigs, cattle, chickens, turkeys and vegetable garden, Mrs Mykhnenko supports herself and her husband, her daughter and grand-daughter and the family of another daughter who lives in Kiev. 'We always gave her almost all of her food,' Mrs Mykhnenko says of the daughter in Kiev. 'But earlier, she was reluctant to take it. Now, with the very high prices, she takes everything we give her. It is harder to live in the city. Here we do not feel the crisis. We grow everything we need.'</p>

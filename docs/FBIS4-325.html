			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini by CNN </F> correspondent Brent Sadler; place and date not given; on the  "Agenda" program, introduction by announcer Tim Modise--recorded]    [Text] [Modise] The long-awaited summit between State  President F.W. de Klerk, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, IFP [Inkatha  Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and Zulu King  Goodwill Zwelithini takes place tomorrow. CNN's Brent Sadler  interviewed King Goodwill Zwelithini and asked him about his  expectations ahead of the summit.    [Begin recording] [Sadler] Your Majesty, what do you expect  to happen during these talks?    [Zwelithini] Actually, if they can just show if the outcome  could be a recognition of the sovereign kingdom of the Zulu  nation, if the acceptance should take place, I would be very  much grateful to see that. It means that the Zulu kingdom, it's  not threatened in the new government. Nobody will touch it. I  pray to the almighty God that it must be the time where maybe  the turning point should take place and everybody be made to  understand each other and to listen to each other's problems.    [Sadler] Do you fear that a new ANC-led government would  wish  to crush Zulu independence?    [Zwelithini] If there is any wish of that from any political  party that will win in ... that will win elections, thinking of  crushing KwaZulu, that would be a very big mistake because  within the ANC there is some of my people who are members of the  ANC, and then in each and every party that will take over, that  might win the elections, there is some of my people that are  members of that party so it will be a disgrace if the government  that might win elections will think of crushing KwaZulu because  KwaZulu is there. It has been there before the white man set  his foot here. I am not supportive to anyone being killed,  especially as the king of the people. I don't like to lead the  dead. I want to lead the living. It's a very dramatic thing  that my people today find themselves fighting against each other  and killing against each other when they need to get together  and face a new future with a bright things that might happen for  the Zulu people and the whole of South Africa.    [Sadler] Do you expect your people to vote or not in the  elections?    [Zwelithini] I won't advise my people to vote. I have never  said that they mustn't go to vote, but the only thing that has  made me to take an initiative of not advising my people to vote  is because I didn't know what my position and the position of my  people is going to be in a new South Africa.    [Sadler] Do you think your intervention on the political  scene, by calling for sovereignty, was something of a gamble?    [Zwelithini] I was not gambling. I just wanted to make the  negotiators to understand the importance of any other race group  in this country. All political parties should just get their  minds together and look at the issue as it is. I am not  expecting to see that there are too many bloodshed that is going  to take place because I'm not....[pauses] I was born not to be a  man who must create bloodshed. I know that my hands are clean.  I'm not the one who has created ... who has made this country  to be what it is at the moment and I'm not the one who have sent  the people to be killed. I have never instructed anybody to  kill anyone because I believe that through negotiations, on  peaceful structures, peace will be created.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Conservative Party Funding: Two-pronged attack on Pounds 15m debts - How the Conservative party raises money from industry has long been one of the great puzzles of UK political life. In a special report, Peter Marsh, with William Lewis, Jimmy Burns, Roland Adburgham and Robert Peston, unravels some aspects of the mystery / Fundraisers The Conservative party's fundraising operation is headed by the double act of Lord Hambro, chairman of Hambros, the blue chip merchant bank, and Sir Philip Harris, chairman of Carpetright, the discount carpet retailer. The duo, appointed party treasurer and deputy treasurer respectively last year, come from different backgrounds, but insiders say they have developed a close-knit 'nasty and nice' fundraising technique in their quest to reduce the party's Pounds 15m overdraft. One Tory party source said: 'Hambro is the titular head. He sweet-talks the donors and Harris comes in the next day to collect the cheques.' Sir Philip said last week: 'We are a team, but Charlie (Lord Hambro) and I do not go to the same people. I look after the retailers and industrialists and he looks after insurance and banking. 'We talk to them and say: 'We want you to support us.' But we are not nasty, we do not say: 'If you do not give money then Labour is going to get in.' We talk to them about Conservative policies and what they have done in the past few years. We talk to them about paying less tax.' Lord Hambro is said 'to charm donations' from companies. Mr David Verey, chief executive of merchant bank Lazard Brothers, which has given Pounds 180,000 to the Conservative party since 1986, said of Lord Hambro: 'He is a gentle chap. I would not expect him to beat up anyone who did not want to give.' Another example of how Lord Hambro's charm offensive has paid dividends comes from Robert Fleming, the City bank. Mr John Manser, chief executive, said that after receiving a letter from Lord Hambro asking for extra cash to help reduce the overdraft, the company last year increased its donation by 50 per cent from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 75,000. Lord Hambro is well connected in the City. He has been on the board of Hambros since 1970 and is chairman of the Guardian Royal Exchange insurance company, where he has been a director since 1968. Additionally, he has been a director of Taylor Woodrow, the construction group, for 32 years and of the P&amp;O shipping group since 1987. In the time he has been on their boards these companies have given the Tories a total of Pounds 3.58m, worth Pounds 6.43m in today's money. One of Lord Hambro's employees described him as 'incredibly shy'. His discretion about his role as Conservative party fundraiser may have been inherited from his father, a leading intelligence figure in the second world war. Sir Philip's style is 'more straightforward and to the point', according to a senior executive of a retail company who has had dealings with him. Sir Philip said: 'I make them see the logic of it. Raising money for the Conservative party is like raising money for charity, which I do. 'When I am talking to companies I just tell them if you want a Conservative party, support us. I can only tell them what is happening.' Of the four other businessmen who assist Lord Hambro and Sir Philip on the Conservatives' board of treasurers, which oversees the party's fundraising, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough Estates, is given responsibility for donations from property companies, while Mr David Davies, chairman of Johnson Matthey, looks after foreign gifts. Mr William Hughes, chairman of Grampian Holdings, is responsible for raising cash from Scottish industrialists, while Sir Malcolm Chaplin, senior partner of Hilberty Chaplin surveyors, looks after constituency funds.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Survey of Management Consultants (4): Forward thinking - Profile of Andersen Consulting IN TODAY'S bleak business climate, it is not just the big corporation that needs to ensure it is thinking well ahead but also the management consultancies that advise them. Which is why consultants at Andersen Consulting, the Chicago-based firm, with a fee income of more than Dollars 2bn, will shortly be mulling over proposals due to emerge in November from a one year study in which 250 of the firm's 800 partners have been directly involved. Set in train by Mr George Shaheen, the 48-year-old managing partner who took over at Andersen shortly after the consultancy's emergence as a separate business from accountants Arthur Andersen, it will look at the industrial, marketplace and geopolitical changes likely to take place in the years up to 2000. Its conclusions will not, however, be set in stone: under Mr Shaheen the firm is committed to a new look, every three years, at the world it inhabits. Since it first moved into consultancy in 1954 when it was commissioned to help General Electric of the US implement the first commercial computer application, Andersen has grown into a strong force in technical consultancy in the US and a number of other world markets, including the UK, France, Spain and Italy. With growth accelerating in the 1980s, a decision to split from the audit side was taken in 1988. 'We realised information technology had become 'mission critical' in a number of sectors from airlines to utilities and it seemed illogical that a business with its core in accountancy should be significant in this field,' Mr Shaheen says. 'We believed we had to define where the business was going and claim ownership of the concepts we were pioneering.' In the period since the division - both parts of the company continue to be ultimately owned by a private Swiss holding company Arthur Andersen and Company SC - consulting revenues have grown rapidly, as big companies, many of them multinationals, have sought help in using IT to pull together international operations and to improve their response to customer demand and market conditions. In Europe, Andersen expertise in putting together the right systems and software was seen at the 1992 Winter Olympics, while in Britain the company has been working on a large scheme for the Department of Social Security in which IT is being used to improve service delivery by unifying the often bewildering range of details surrounding each client and their benefit entitlements. The backbone around which Andersen's efforts in the consultancy field has been built is its impressive training programme on which it spends around Dollars 160m a year or roughly Dollars 7,200 per consultant. New recruits to consulting are for the most part taken on straight from universities around the world and brought over early in their careers to probably the biggest private educational campus in the world at St Charles, 25 miles outside Chicago. There they spend time learning the company's strictly laid-down methodology for handling computer projects. At regular intervals during their careers they will return to the classrooms at the 150 acre St Charles site, teaching new classes themselves or undergoing further training. The result is that the firm can apply a consistent approach and methodology to problem-solving around the world and can easily assemble English-speaking, multi-disciplinary specialists from a variety of countries and backgrounds to tackle projects. 'You cannot fight a war with different systems. Clients can expect to receive the same level of service wherever they get it, ' Mr Shaheen says. The danger, as some critics have been quick to point out, is that the firm produces clones whose ability to think creatively will be lost, and that by using raw recruits it deprives itself of the wider experience more seasoned outsiders would bring. Andersen's 20 per cent worldwide and 37 per cent European growth in 1991, at a time when some other consultancies have been beginning to experience recessionary downturn, suggests clients are not taking this view, but the review now in place is intended to guard against the kind of problems which have affected other big groups holding a strong position in their sectors, such as IBM and General Motors. Among the challenges which Andersen has already had to face have been continued rapid technological developments, including the shift from mainframe computing systems, in which it had built up years of expertise, to client-server systems, in which high powered desktop systems are networked with each other. This shift, which has set the new computer paradigm for the 1990s, has meant that Andersen itself has had to mount a big exercise to retrain its own personnel in a completely new set of skills, centred on networking. Without such a re-education exercise, Andersen was in danger of being left behind, with more than two thirds of Fortune 1000 companies either planning or implementing a move to client-server computing. Externally, the worldwide business environment in which the consultancy and its clients operates is in the midst, too, of not only economic but also structural change with the great corporations that have dominated world business being forced to operate in much more entrepreneurial ways, and increasingly in need of advice on how to achieve new patterns of organisation. These developments and recent dramatic world geopolitical changes have provided another big test for consultants' skills. At the same time, competition has intensified as new competitors have emerged. In technical consulting Andersen comes up against computer hardware and software companies such as IBM and EDS, and a host of other smaller companies, with aggressive new entrants such as the French company CAP Gemini Sogeti also building market share through acquisitions. In strategy consulting, where it is seeking to grow further, Andersen meets established names such as McKinsey, Booz Allen, and Bain. Competition also comes from other members of the Big Six accountancy firms, all of which are trying to build up their position in IT consulting. Although the results of the consultancy's internal review are not yet known, the direction in which Andersen has already travelled since its early days is from systems building to a much broader range of activities, involving systems integration, systems management, strategic consulting and change management across the six broad sectors in which it operates. The next moves are likely to see greater emphasis on what it can offer in business integration and re-engineering, a process whereby businesses are helped to look at their strategies, their organisational structure and their technology in the round, and at how to make the best use of IT in achieving any restructuring required. It is a concept which is difficult to describe fully to clients, which is why Andersen has set up in the US a number of centres which business executives can visit to see just how the integration of technology and innovative business thinking can reshape an industry. In Chicago itself, Andersen has created a model specialist retailer and supermarket of the future. Other centres elsewhere demonstrate new ways of thinking about logistics and process manufacturing, and about the delivery of medical care, all involving greatly increased use of IT. The aim is to impress clients that Andersen is more than just an IT consultancy that has bolted on a strategic capability, but a partner that can bring together and implement all the elements that can help businesses succeed. As Mr Shaheen says: 'We want to be the firm that makes technology succeed in the marketplace.'</p>

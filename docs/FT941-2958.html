			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Minister condemns boundary proposals Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, yesterday denounced Boundary Commission proposals which would remove part of his Stirling constituency and would, in the view of some political observers, cost him victory there at the next general election. Mr Forsyth said the revised proposals to transfer Bridge of Allan and Stirling University from Stirling constituency to the new Ochil constituency were 'ludicrous' and would tear the heart out of the constituency. He would be arguing for a second inquiry by the commission. 'I will be fighting not for the Conservative interest but for the integrity of the Stirling constituency as a whole,' he said. Mr Forsyth, who was a controversial Scottish Office minister and for a year chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, had a majority of 703 in the 1992 general election. The disputed ward has a Conservative regional councillor and some local observers believe its transfer to Ochil - likely to be Labour-dominated - could cost the Tories between 1,100 and 2,000 votes. The Stirling decision, which followed an inquiry, added to dismay among Scottish Tories that boundary changes do not appear to be working in their favour as they had hoped they would. The Conservatives hold only 11 of the 72 Scottish seats, in spite of winning 26 per cent of the Scottish vote in 1992. Last month the Boundary Commission backtracked on a decision - which had been thought likely to benefit the Tories - to abolish one of the two Liberal Democrat-held seats in the Borders. Yesterday Mr John Curtice, a lecturer in politics at the university of Strathclyde, said he believed Mr Forsyth would hold Stirling on the new boundaries with a halved majority. He pointed out that the Conservative regional councillor had won the ward with only a third of the vote. But he estimated that the boundary changes in Scotland would probably lead to the Conservatives making a net loss of one seat at the next election, assuming people voted in the same pattern as in 1992. They would lose Ayr, held by Mr Phil Gallie MP, to Labour, and Aberdeen South, held by Mr Raymond Robertson, to the Liberal Democrats, but would gain the new seat to be created in Grampian region.</p>

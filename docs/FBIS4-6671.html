			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter  in Tokyo on 20 April, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Don  McKinnon, who is on a visit to Japan, said, "We must keep in  mind that China is not as concerned over the issue of North  Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons as are other  nations." In the interview, he also said he was doubtful about  how far China would go in taking concerted steps with Japan, the  United States, and South Korea to resolve the issue.    In late March, the UN Security Council issued a presidential  statement calling on North Korea to accept international  inspections of its nuclear facilities. Commenting on the  opinion that China took the initiative in issuing the  presidential statement, the New Zealand deputy prime minister  denied that China took any initiative, saying, "Other nations  decided to issue that presidential statement out of  consideration for China." In calling China the "player who  holds the key," he stressed the need to continue the efforts to  urge China to get involved in the issue.</p>

			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / EC budget increase is urged for EMU THE European Community needs a much larger budget to make a success of economic and monetary union, according to Sir Donald MacDougall, a former chief economic adviser to the UK government. Writing in the National Institute Economic Review, Sir Donald said countries might face 'a prolonged period of painful adjustment, with sluggish or even negative economic growth' if they did not have Community financial help after losing the power to vary exchange rates. Sir Donald, appointed by the EC Commission in the late 1970s to head a high-level study group on public finance and European integration, said the lack of a larger budget 'would run the risk of setting back, rather than promoting, progress towards closer integration in Europe'. His 1977 report advocated increasing the EC budget from the then 0.7 per cent of Community GDP to between 2 and 2.5 per cent over a decade.</p>

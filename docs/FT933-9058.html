			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Headhunters back on the trail THE RECESSION took a heavy toll from headhunters, with the size of the European executive search market shrinking by nearly a quarter last year, says a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit. But the market has stabilised and is forecast to pick up next year. The report estimates that consultancy income last year was about Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m (Pounds 475m-Pounds 545m) - 20 per cent to 25 per cent less than the previous year. The fall was most marked in middle management, where headhunters' revenues dropped by more than 40 per cent. Headhunting of top-level executives was relatively unaffected. The report shows that the structure of the industry is changing, with consultants increasingly offering multinational clients cross-border searches. Headhunters are also diversifying into related areas such as interim management, management audit and assessment, executive selection and headhunting non-executive directors. The survey ranks headhunters by revenue, and names the Swiss consultancy Egon Zehnder as the largest with nearly 10 per cent of the market. It is followed by GKR Neumann and Amrop International. The two largest markets are Germany and the UK. In Germany the top 10 companies have combined revenues of Dollars 93m. The corresponding figure for the UK is Dollars 78m. The top 10 consultants' revenues in France, the third-largest market, were Dollars 43m. Executive Search in Europe: Choosing and Using a Headhunter.

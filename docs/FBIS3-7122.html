During her visit, she met with Deputy Foreign  Minister Le Mai and held discussion on issues related to the MIA  with representatives of the Ministries of Defense and Interior,  the Vietnam MIA Office, and the U.S. MIA Office in Hanoi.    On 23 March, Mrs. Griffiths paid a courtesy call on Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet at the Government Office. During the  meeting, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: The Vietnamese  Government has always regarded the search for Americans missing  in action as a humanitarian issue which is in line with the  Vietnamese people's tradition. The Vietnamese Government, past  and present, has done its best in searching for MIAs. The  Vietnamese Government will continue its best efforts to carry  out this task in the days ahead. The government also urges  people in localities throughout the country to report to the  authorities all information which are of interest to families of  the American MIA.    The prime minister also said he hoped to receive new,  positive, and effective cooperation from the NLPMF in searching  for American and Vietnamese soldiers missing in action. He  stressed that this is a compensation for the losses experienced  by both sides in the past.</p>

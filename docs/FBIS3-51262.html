Colonel Hector Mario Castro, police commander in Bolivar  Department, whose capital is Cartagena, said that the attack  took place some time after 1200 in the neighborhood of San  Felipe Castle on Pedro de Heredia Avenue.    According to Col. Castro, the attackers, who were on a  motorcycle, intercepted Horta's vehicle and shot him. However,  at that moment, a police patrol came along and prevented the  terrorists from accomplishing their objective, which was  seemingly to assassinate him.    Following a confrontation between the criminals and  policemen, the criminals fled while the patrol took Horta to the  Cartagena de Indias University Hospital. Horta was shot in the  chin, neck, and a hand.    Col. Castro stated that the reasons for the attack are  unknown, and that although Horta remained conscious while he was  being taken to the hospital, his health condition is critical.</p>

Shubenko; </F> UDC [(633.11+633.14)+633.16]:57.086.83]    [Abstract] In 1991, intergeneric hybrids of hexaploid (2n =  42) triticale and diploid (2n = 14) barley were bred through a  culture of immature inflorescences from two constant lines of  triticale, i.e., (6TA 502 x Rosner) x AD 206 and TPG 2333, and  the experimental winter barley line Bemir 2. Further research  has been conducted to determine the optimum age of the  inflorescence and to identify the respective conditions  resulting in more effective callus formation and regeneration  during in vitro culture of the study hybrids. Inflorescences of  various age (from the setting of the spikelet tubercle to  meiosis) and lengths (from 0.8 to 80 mm) were sterilized,  divided into small segments measuring 1-2 mm each, and placed in  agar-treated Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with 2,4-D (2.5  mg/l). The inflorescences were cultured at 28C. Every 2-3  weeks, they were subcultured in modified media with a graduated  decrease in the concentration of 2,4-D or replacement of 2,4-D  in the medium by 6-BAP (0.5 mg/l), _a_-NUC (0.2 mg/l), and  casein hydrolysate (1 g/l). To regenerate plants, the callus  tissue was placed in a lit climate chamber with a temperature of  26C and relative humidity of 70 percent. Callus incubation  was observed 4-8 days after explantation and was most active,  i.e., nearly 100 percent effective, in those inflorescences that  were 20-40 mm long and in the pre-meiosis stage of development.  Different types of callus were observed to form depending on the  development of the explant in the starting medium. Embryoid-like  structures grew most often in the hormone-free medium. Depending  on the stage of the inflorescence's development, the number of  plants regenerated per explant ranged from 1.4 to 64.6. Several  of the calluses in the experiments remained capable of  morphogenesis for 10 months. The appearance of embryoid-like  structures from callus tissue formed by immature inflorescences  and their development into plants were taken as confirmation of  the possibility of breeding the said intergeneric hybrids by  somatic embryogenesis.

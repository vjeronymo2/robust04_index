			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney Even Goofy could see that Euro Disney needs more funding. Over the full year to the end of March, its cash outflow from operations amounted to FFr600m, before the capital spending required to keep the Magic Kingdom in shape. With FFr20bn of debt outstanding Euro Disney cannot easily go back to the banks for more. Additional guarantees from Fairy Godmother, in the form of Walt Disney, might help. But Euro Disney already has shareholder approval for up to FFr5bn of convertible or warrant bonds, so an equity-related issue cannot be ruled out. The 4 per cent fall in the shares yesterday shows investors do not relish the prospect. Funding for the second phase of the project - due to open in 1996 and likely to cost FFr9bn - has not even been addressed. There must be a temptation to put expansion plans on ice until the first phase is profitable. But yesterday's results suggest Euro Disney would benefit from a grander scale. While the number of visitors during the winter was encouraging, tourists are spending too little and hotel occupancy was low. A bigger theme park would help spread fixed costs and encourage overnight stays. While the existing business is losing money, though, Euro Disney will have its work cut out persuading investors to suspend their disbelief. With recession looming in Germany and France - and devaluations discouraging visitors from the UK, Italy and Spain - simply keeping the turnstiles turning will be challenging enough.</p>

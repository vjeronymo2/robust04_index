			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Strike shipyard may lay off 750 YARROW Shipbuilders on Clydeside proposes to lay off half of its 1,500 manual workers from Monday and cut back production in the face of an official strike by the company's 600 white collar staff which has lasted 10 days. Staff belonging to the MSF general technical union are demanding pay rises equal to the 3.7 per cent plus Pounds 300 deal secured by manual workers at the yard in February after a bitter dispute. The company has withdrawn a 'final' offer to the staff of a basic 1.8 per cent wage rise plus a further award of up to 2.6 per cent based on the introduction of a performance-related pay scheme. Talks were going on last night over the lay offs, but the two sides were not in pay negotiations. Yarrow said it would try to keep the shipyard open through rotation of its manual workers, but pointed out that the skilled supervisors were on strike and only 30 managers were available to do their work. The yard is building three Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy and two frigates for Malaysia. Ms Jane Lindsay, one of the white collar staff strike leaders, called yesterday for a return to the negotiating table. 'We have been negotiating with the company for the past two-and-a-half years and management has offered nothing new,' she said. 'All we want is equal treatment with the manual workers. 'Surely it is not too much to expect a little bit of social justice for the workforce so we can carry on with the business of building ships and getting more orders for the yard?' Union officials said they would like Acas, the conciliation service, to intervene, accusing Yarrow senior management of being too abrasive.</p>

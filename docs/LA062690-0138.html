			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALDERON HAS RIGHT MOVE AT RIGHT TIME  </P> <P> Ivan Calderon told it like he saw it.  </P> <P> "He didn't have a chance," Calderon said. "When I got the ball he was running  to home plate, and I said, 'He's out."'  </P> <P> With the Angels trailing the Chicago White Sox, 2-0, with two out in the ninth  Monday, Chili Davis was trying to score from second base on Luis Polonia's  pinch-hit single to left.  </P> <P> He was out by a long shot, and the White Sox had their fifth victory in a row  against the Oakland Athletics or the Angels, their chief competition in the  American League West.  </P> <P> With two out and runners on first and second, and with two strikes on the  left-handed Polonia, Calderon had moved toward the left-field line, perhaps  within 15 or 20 feet of it.  </P> <P> The adjustment might have made the difference.  </P> <P> "With two strikes, we move to the line," Calderon said. "He's just trying to  make contact."  </P> <P> The outfield assist helped save the game -- as did Bobby Thigpen, who got the  final two outs for his 24th save, best in the major leagues.  </P> <P> Davis was Calderon's victim -- and not just once.  </P> <P> Calderon threw him out at third in the fourth inning as Davis tried to take two  bases on Lance Parrish's single to left.  </P> <P> It was the first time he has had two assists in a game, Calderon said. But  Terry Bevington, one of the White Sox coaches, was not surprised.  </P> <P> "There hasn't been anybody in this league who is playing better defensively,"  Bevington said. "He knows where to play the batters. You never have to remind  him."  </P> <P> Calderon feigned no surprise, either.  </P> <P> "The way I've been playing, I think I'm the best left fielder playing," he  said.  </P> <P> The White Sox were supposed to get their comeuppance when they played Oakland  and the Angels in back-to-back series in Comiskey Park beginning June 14.  </P> <P> It seemed as if they had. After winning the first game against Oakland, the  White Sox lost their next five games in a row, losing three to the A's and two  to the Angels before beating the Angels in the final game.  </P> <P> Then they went on the road, and they haven't lost yet, sweeping the Athletics  over the weekend and opening this three-game series with a victory.  </P> <P> They have gone from washed-up to praiseworthy.  </P> <P> "What are they saying now that we've won (five) in a row?" Manager Jeff Torborg  said. "What does that mean? We could lose four in a row next."  </P> <P> But they have made a habit of winning the close ones.  </P> <P> They are 26-13 in games decided by two runs or less -- including Monday's.  </P> <P> "We never quit," Calderon said. "We play to the end."  </P> <P> But despite their recent run of success, Torborg says the White Sox aren't  developing any of the swagger that Oakland is so famous for.  </P> <P> "I think they're playing hard," he said. "You don't swagger until you've won it  all. Even then, you don't swagger."  </P> <P> He forgot to mention that to Calderon.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. al-Majali, has received in his  office at the Prime Ministry Dr. George Habash, secretary  general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  [PFLP]. During the meeting, the two sides reviewed developments  in the Palestinian cause and the ongoing peace march in the  region.    [Begin Habash recording] Naturally, the Palestinian issue,  in particular, is a basic issue. It was very important to me to  explain the PFLP's stand on the entire course of the settlement.  In fact, I felt that I benefited very much from the prime  minister's views during this meeting because I listened to the  official Jordanian viewpoint on the course of the settlement. I  actually expressed much concern about the continuation of  positive relations between the PFLP and Jordan on the basis that  whatever the differences, the basic focus should be on the need  to achieve the Palestinian national program -- the program  toward achieving repatriation and self-determination and  establishing the Palestinian state. I confidently felt that  Jordan's regime, under the leadership of his majesty the king,  will continue to be of great support to our cause. [end  recording]</p>

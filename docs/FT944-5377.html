			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Alternative Investment): Funeral wishes ignored - Briefcase We are a small firm of funeral directors. Some time ago, we were instructed by a man who made quite clear that he wanted no service at either church or crematorium, and his ashes to be buried with his brother. He died soon after. The closest relatives were two nephews, who were also executors. They changed his wishes and had a church service, although we disagreed. Do executors have a legal right to do this? I believe this is more a moral than a legal problem although, clearly, the executors should not alter the wishes of the deceased. I suggest you get advice from a local solicitor. If the legal view is in accordance with the above, then you could decline to act in future if you found an executor wished to act against the wishes of the deceased. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

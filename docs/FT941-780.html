			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Israelis shoot dead six Fatah activists: Deaths cast shadow on Hebron security talks In the bloodiest single incident since last month's Hebron mosque massacre, Israeli undercover troops shot dead six Palestinians and seriously injured a seventh in Gaza's Jebalya refugee camp yesterday. The dead men were identified by local residents as members of Mr Yassir Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the PLO, and their deaths cast a shadow over today's scheduled resumption of talks in Cairo between Israeli and PLO delegations trying to agree on protective measures for the Palestinians of Hebron. Last week, the Israeli army's killing of four Hamas Islamic militants in Hebron almost forced a suspension of the talks, and it seems likely that Mr Arafat would be more sensitive to the deaths of his own loyalists. Yesterday's incident occurred shortly after PLO supporters had held a memorial ceremony in Gaza's Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood for a Fatah activist killed a month ago by the Israeli army. Two carloads of Fatah supporters were returning to Jebalya when, according to Israeli military sources, they were spotted by undercover troops and ordered to halt. The army claimed the Fatah men ignored the order and fired on the soldiers, who shot back. Three Palestinian youths standing near the cars were also slightly hurt. The army claimed the dead men were found to have been armed, but witnesses denied this and said they were simply handing out leaflets to passers-by through the car windows. State television said last night that the army had closed off the immediate area, and was considering placing much of Gaza under curfew. Israeli and Palestinian officials could seal agreement by today on security measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, they said yesterday. This should lead to the immediate resumption of suspended talks on Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Mr Nabill Shaath, chief PLO negotiator, said the two sides had 'gone a long and important way' in the talks and only 'some points' remained at issue. PLO officials in Tunis said the differences were over the precise number of international observers and Palestinian police to be deployed in Hebron, and some details of their jurisdiction and rules of deployment. The Israelis want to limit the observer force to 60 officers, to be supplied by Norway, and the Palestinian force to a few dozen. The PLO is seeking 150 observers and 400 police. Mr Shaath said the PLO was awaiting responses to its demands from Israel. 'We are not going to discuss anything else until we finish this agreement,' he added. Both sides appear eager to return to full peace talks as soon as possible. However, while PLO officials in Tunis said they still hoped Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho could begin as scheduled on April 13, Israeli officials have suggested the talks might need 'a few weeks' to conclude agreement.</p>

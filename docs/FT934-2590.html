			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Company News: Ford promotes founder's great-grandson Edsel Ford has appointed Mr Edsel Ford II, the great-grandson of the auto group's founder, Mr Henry Ford, a vice-president of the company. Analysts said the promotion of Mr Ford, 44, and currently president and chief operating officer of Ford Motor Credit, the group's finance unit, suggests the management may be grooming him for the top job at Ford. However, analysts said it was unlikely Mr Ford would succeed the current chairman, Mr Alexander Trotman, who is due to retire in the late 1990s. This was because of his lack of experience in senior management. Mr Ford joined the company in 1974, and worked in product planning and marketing before taking over at Ford Credit in 1991. Mr Ford has a good chance of becoming chairman because 40 per cent of the company's voting stock is controlled by the Ford family, and three members of the family sit on the board of directors. Fords have run the company for all but 13 years of its 90-year history.</p>

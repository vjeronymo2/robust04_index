			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARRY SHEARER  </P> <P> Harry Shearer's "High Desert Drifters" (Man Bites Town, April 8) is another  example of why he occupies the way cool end of a spectrum that includes the  late Andy Kaufman (the other end) and Garrison Keillor (center).  </P> <P> The best satirists can undermine our vanity by slipping in references to forces  in our lives that we mistakenly thought we had dismissed, outgrown, transcended  or rejected. But even for someone gifted with impeccable social timing, this is  an heroic task in an age when nobody gets to see the wizard, not nobody, not no  how. I respectfully submit, however, that Shearer wears the ruby slippers. And  that, ladies and gentlemen, is a chakra of a different color.  </P> <P> JOHN SARLI  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / How to Spend It: The New Designer's Exhibition Claire Norwood is a splendid example of what can happen to young students whose work is shown at the New Designers' Exhibition. Just a year ago she was graduating from the Cordwainers' College and her individual interpretation of what footwear could be like was on view. One year on finds her with her own workshop at 398 St John's Street, London EC1, creating idiosyncratic made-to-measure shoes. Her customers include sculptors, journalists, a rehabilitation officer, a fashion photographer, a magazine editor, a financial analyst, shop assistants, Glenys Kinnock's speech writer, and a make-up artist and stylist. Although her shoes are all made to order she does have a consistent aesthetic. For new customers she has a portfolio of previous work which customers can refer to and order from. Like many designers her career got off the ground by chance. Vogue magazine asked her to make some footwear reminiscent of the 1950s for a picture they had in mind. She often uses old leather and materials which give her work a special air. 'I rummage around,' she tells me, 'and find old things which I re-use - like old stiletto shoes or an old green leather coat which I found in a flea market for about Pounds 5 and cut up to make five or six pairs of shoes. 'I know several old shoemakers on their last legs and I go in and raid their workshops and they think it is great to have their backrooms cleared out. I also scout around in markets for buckles, bits of leather, buttons, bits of jewellery which I use to give individuality to the shoes. 'I made some wonderful boots from old used leather which have a splendid patina to them which makes them look different.' Claire will take green patent leather or gunmetal organza and make them into mules for the 1990s. She makes shoes simple and wearable but makes them special by using beautiful detailing. 'If I'm not using old materials I go to Northampton to buy the top quality leather, which is beautifully soft,' she says. Prices range from Pounds 90, for a pair of mules from the existing collection, up to Pounds 250 for a pair of knee-high boots (but these will be made to suit your own contours). She takes measurements - and prefers to see her customers, but adds: 'I have had a lady in Gloucestershire who just sent in her measurements after seeing the piece in Vogue and I'm making her a pair of sandals.' A small collection of her work can be seen at the Islington workshop (tel: 071-837 2355), from which you may order, and at Yvonne Damant, 2 The Square, Richmond, Surrey.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Earnings warning drives Apple stock price down APPLE Computer's share price dropped sharply yesterday when the personal computer company revealed that second-half earnings would be lower than in the same period last year, and below the company's expectations. Apple's stock was down Dollars 5 at midday, trading at Dollars 44 1/2 . In the second half of 1992, Apple earned Dollars 229.2m, or Dollars 1.88 a share. Analysts had been expecting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.05 a share, compared with Dollars 1.07 in the third quarter of 1992. Apple said that while volume sales of its Macintosh personal computers continued to be strong, price cuts forced by aggressive competition had reduced gross profit margins. 'According to published industry reports, Macintosh continues to gain market share in a very competitive industry,' said Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive. 'However, our growth in unit shipments is coming at lower prices than we previously expected - and this will diminish our profitability during the second half of the fiscal year. 'We remain committed to our strategy of market share growth,' he said, 'and we will be taking aggressive actions to accelerate sales momentum.' Apple's announcement prompted several Wall Street analysts to lower their earnings estimates for the company. Apple shares had been on a steady decline since Monday, when analysts at Dean Witter and Bear Stearns expressed concerns about their estimates. Moody's Investors Service said yesterday it may downgrade Apple's shelf registered debt currently at A2 and short-term debt at Prime-1.</p>

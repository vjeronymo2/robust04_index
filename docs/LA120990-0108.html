			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: IS THIS THE DAY THAT MT. DITKA ERUPTS AGAIN?  </P> <P> Friday, Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun recalled the Chicago Bears' 38-14  loss to the Washington Redskins in 1989. Afterward, Bear Coach Mike Ditka went  into a tantrum, said that Bear cornerback Donnell Woolford "couldn't cover  anybody," and predicted that his team wouldn't win another game.  </P> <P> Good prediction. The Bears lost their final three games and finished 6-10.  </P> <P> Stellino also noted that Ditka brought a new, relaxed attitude to the Bears'  training camp last July. When asked how long he thought it would last, Ditka  said: "We'll see what happens when we get in the third period in Washington and  the score is tied."  </P> <P> The Bears play Washington at RFK Stadium today.  </P> <P> Add Ditka: He said the media are primed for another outburst, adding:  </P> <P> "My God, I'll tell you what, the camera is on me more. . . . If I had to run  off and go to the bathroom I don't know what they'd do. They're not going to  find anything. It's just not going to happen."  </P> <P> Last add Ditka: Although he prides himself on his blue-collar image, his  business empire has grown to the point where he has marketed his own  fragrances.  </P> <P> Joking with Stellino about the current economic climate, Ditka said: "The  perfumes are down, the restaurants are down. I'm just struggling. I wish  there'd be a little sympathy for me. As a matter of fact, maybe we can have a  little tag day for me at RFK, everybody throw in a couple of bucks for me and  that'll tide me through the next couple of months."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Who was the oldest man to coach a major college football team?  </P> <P> Green carpet treatment: Dave Wagner of Dodge City, Kan., said Friday that he  and his wife Carol "are very happy to share some of our good fortune with  Kansas State."  </P> <P> Wagner, a 1969 Kansas State graduate, donated $796,000 to install new  artificial turf at KSU Stadium.  </P> <P> He could afford it. Last July, he and his wife won $35 million in the Kansas  lottery.  </P> <P> Run-and-stun: In the 1989-90 college basketball season, Southern University  averaged 99.2 points per game, third behind Loyola Marymount and Oklahoma.  </P> <P> Thursday night, after his team defeated Texas College, 159-65, Jaguar Coach Ben  Jode told Guy Coates of the Associated Press it was "no big deal."  </P> <P> Attributing his style to the teaching of John McLendon, the former Tennessee  State coach, Jode explained:  </P> <P> "You try to get a shot every eight seconds. You try for 93 shots a game. The  youngsters like it. It's great for the spectators. Some coaches say you don't  win a championship with it. But McLendon always said if you combine upbeat  defense with upbeat offense, you're going to get your 93 shots."  </P> <P> Add Jode: He still invites McLendon, now retired, to visit Southern's practice  sessions.  </P> <P> Said Jode: "He was here a couple of weeks ago. I sat on the bench and watched  him coach."  </P> <P> Rim shot time, baby: Inside Sports' anonymous columnist, "The Good Doctor,"  strikes again in the magazine's January edition, responding to "K.J. Jackson,  Miss."  </P> <P> Q: "Dick Vitale continues to be our favorite sportscaster. Is there anything  that could make him even better?"  </P> <P> A: "A 45-second clock."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Amos Alonzo Stagg, who was 84 when he coached College of the  Pacific in 1946.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Baltimore Evening Sun columnist Phil Jackman, on CBS-TV's  announcement that Tim McCarver would co-host the network's coverage of the 1992  Winter Olympics: "Has baseball been tossed out of the Summer Games?"

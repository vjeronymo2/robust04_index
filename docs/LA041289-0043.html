			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ZONING APPEALS BOARD'S VOTE BLOCKS ENCINO MOVIE  COMPLEX  </P> <P> Homeowners attempting to block construction of three movie complexes in Encino  won their first battle Tuesday as Los Angeles officials voted against allowing  a five-screen theater at the northeast corner of Ventura Boulevard and Gaviota  Avenue.  </P> <P> The city's Board of Zoning Appeals had voted 2 to 1 against the project March  28 but needed a third vote to defeat the proposed Mann Theaters development.  </P> <P> The necessary vote came Tuesday when board member Joe Mandel sided with BZA  President Nikolas Patsaouras and member James D. Leewong in opposing the  theaters.  </P> <P> Developer Jason Heltzer will have 15 days to appeal the vote to the City  Council after the board ruling is formally issued, said board secretary Terry  Speth.  </P> <P> Heltzer could not be reached for comment. But he has looked to the 1,500-seat  theater complex as the centerpiece for his proposed $22-million "Encino  Marketplace" project.  </P> <P> Other developers are planning a 1,600-seat complex on the north side of Ventura  east of Encino Avenue and an 1,800-seat complex north of Ventura east of  Hayvenhurst Avenue.  </P> <P> "We're delighted," said Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino.  "This will set a model in terms of community opposition to the other two  theater proposals."  </P></p>

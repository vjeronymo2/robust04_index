			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Lee Hsien Yang moves up at ST The hottest item of news on the Singapore business circuit in recent days has been the rapid rise in the island republic's corporate world of Lee Hsien Yang, a son of Lee Kuan Yew, writes Kieran Cooke. Lee junior has been appointed to the new position of deputy president of Singapore Telecom (ST), Singapore's biggest listed company. Lee Hsien Yang, who is in his late 30's, only joined ST six months ago. Corporate analysts predict that before too long he could take over as chief executive at ST. Singapore's telecommunications conglomerate, which is 90 per cent controlled by the government, has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 36bn (a figure similar to that of British Telecom) though its sales last year amounted to only Dollars 1.8bn. Lee Hsien Yang is a graduate of Cambridge and Stanford. He is a brigadier general, and before joining ST was head of the Singapore army's joint operations and planning directorate. His elder brother, Lee Hsien Loong, also an army brigadier general, is now deputy prime minister and is generally seen as the most likely candidate to succeed Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister.</p>

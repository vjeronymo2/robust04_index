			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television A beast called the Devilfish, an enormous octopus which swims in the south Pacific, is the subject of Wildlife on One (BBC 1, 8.00). Hard, really, to think of anything nastier than a creature which may be 16ft long, is boneless and changes its shape at will. It pounces on its prey, which it embraces, poisons, and then digests. Yet perhaps we should beware of misjudging a beast which is considered intelligent and endowed with emotions. Close To Home (C4, 8.00), delves into a classic and unattractive case of 'nimbyism' (ie. 'Not In My Backyard') in Manchester. Residents are indignant because the Probation Service is turning hotels in their areas into bail hostels. Never mind that it is immeasurably fairer and cheaper to get defendants into hostels and out of prison. The 'nimbies' protest that vodka bottles get thrown across the fence into their gardens. . The Essential History of Europe: Belgium (BBC 2, 8.00) scrutinises the entrails of Belgium. It presents that country as a land of terrific gastronomy but, in terms of national identity, a total wash-out.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Arts: Aribert Reimann's 'Das Schloss' - Berlin Festival Kafka-esque: you don't even need to have read the novels to know what it means - a nightmare vision of the world in which no-one gets anywhere. That just about sums up Aribert Reimann's sixth opera, Das Schloss (The Castle), derived from Kafka's posthumously published novel and the play which Max Brod made out of it. The work has just been premiered at Berlin's Deutsche Oper and makes a powerful centrepiece for this year's Berlin Festival. The festival theme is Prague, Kafka's birthplace, but the topicality of Das Schloss lies much closer to Berlin. The central figure - known only as K, the protagonist of several Kafka works - arrives in a wintry, loveless village with a commission to work as land surveyor at the Castle. His repeated efforts to gain access to the Castle meet with indifference, obstruction, betrayal and hostility. The villagers, who have learned to live with the inescapable, invisible power of the Castle, treat K like an unwelcome foreigner, and at the final curtain he is as helplessly isolated as he was at the start. The parallel with the bureaucracy and xenophobia of contemporary Germany is inescapable. Neither Reimann nor the producer, Willy Decker, do anything to point up the analogy: they don't need to. Divided into nine scenes with interludes of Pelleas-like potency and a single interval, Das Schloss is a bleak, three-hour, symbolist slog - but it was absorbed with extreme concentration by a full audience on the night I attended. Reimann has cut the Brod dramatisation by two-thirds and added some poems and passages from Kafka's diaries. He should have cut more. As operatic material, the main weakness is that we know almost from the start that K is not going to make progress - which automatically reduces the scope for surprise and tension. Another problem is that Reimann works in solo-speeches of arduous length, sapping the dramatic punch of several key scenes. Nor do his cantabile vocal lines offer much differentiation: of the 15 solo parts, only Frieda, K's sympathetic mistress, has music that conveys a sense of emotional turmoil. The score, based on Reimann's adaptation of the 12-tone technique, is spare and refined, as if the physical battery of sound in Lear has been turned inwards to produce an atmosphere of abstract psychological oppression. Reimann composes along the text, weaving and keening the music on a carpet of subtle string sound and deploying the rest of the orchestra in oblique compartmentalised blocks. The quality of craftsmanship and invention is undeniable - above all the prism-like textures Reimann creates within individual instrumental sections  -but like the world K inhabits, the musical atmosphere is mysteriously lacking in variety of pace and colour. In common with the protagonists of Reimann's Shakespeare, Strindberg and Euripides operas, K is a lonely figure involved in a struggle. But our sympathy is compromised by his blind, self-defeating doggedness - as when he falls asleep during a crucial meeting with an official from the Castle (a spoken role), in a final scene of Beckett-like absurdity. The part, a long and arduous one, was created by Wolfgang Schone, an experienced baritone who knows how to blend lyrical poise and expression. Of the remaining roles, the most distinctive are the two apprentices (sung by Bengt-Ola Morgny and Ralf Lukas), a double-act haunting K at every turn and providing some welcome comedy - not a quality previously associated with Reimann. Adrianne Pieczonka was a radiant Frieda, Isolde Elchlepp the neurotic Hostess and Peter Maus the exploitative Schoolteacher. Decker's lucid staging, designed by Wolfgang Gussmann, was built around a black snow-swept bastion, with doors and a staircase opening from the inside but strangely impenetrable from without. Michael Boder conducted with cool precision. Further stagings this season in Hanover, Duisburg and Berne may well reveal a less severe dimension to this worthy, uncontroversial modern opera.</p>

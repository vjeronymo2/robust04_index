			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROFESSIONAL LICENSE FEES RAISED  </P> <P> Professionals and tradespeople working in Hermosa Beach, such as contractors,  doctors and lawyers, will pay a higher fee when they renew their annual  business licenses this year.  </P> <P> Increases in the flat fees -- now $150, plus $12 for each of the professional's  employees, in most categories -- will be tied to annual rises in the cost of  living.  </P> <P> Retail businesses, which pay fees based on a percentage of gross income, will  not be affected by the new measure, which voters approved in November. The City  Council adopted a policy resolution Tuesday to increase the fees.  </P></p>

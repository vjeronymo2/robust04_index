			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Steady demand for Deutsche Finance's DM1bn offer A handful of borrowers braved the international bond market yesterday as underlying government bond markets remained volatile, keeping plenty of traditional institutional investors at bay. Deutsche Finance (Netherlands) launched a DM1bn, five-year deal with a 5.75 per cent coupon. Deutsche Bank, the lead manager, reported good demand from retail investors in Switzerland, the Benelux countries and Germany, but admitted activity was slower than usual. Deutsche Bank said it held the yield spread steady at 25 basis points over the 5 per cent Treuhand issue. However, the bonds traded outside fees at 99.15-99.20 by late after-noon as the underlying government bond market tumbled. Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, tapped the Eurolira sector of the bond market with a L170bn deal, hoping to take advantage of favourable swap opportunities and investor enthusiasm for lira-denominated paper in the wake of the general election. The triple-A rated bonds carry an attractively high coupon of 9.125 per cent and have a 10-year maturity, although they are callable after two years. The proceeds were swapped into floating rate dollars to give sub-Libor funding. BCI, one of the joint lead managers, noted that it could take some time for Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, to form a new government. It added that prospects for lira-denominated paper were favourable, given that interest rates are expected to fall and there is scope for the lire to appreciate against other European currencies. BCI quoted a redemption yield of 9.42 per cent based on a 10-year maturity, and of 10.19 per cent if the bonds are called after two years. One syndicate official said the borrower was in the enviable position of being able to call the bonds if interest rates decline rapidly, allowing Bank Austria to refinance at more attractive rates. 'Whichever way you look at it, investors are going to lose out - the chance of seeing capital appreciation is better if they buy longer-dated paper,' said one official, adding that there is still plenty of Eurolira paper 'sitting around' following the flood of new issues earlier this year. The bonds traded at 98.35 by late afternoon, within full fees. The Kingdom of Sweden took advantage of a favourable swap opportunity in the Dutch guilder sector of the bond market, launching a Fl 400m four-year issue with a coupon of 5.75 per cent. The borrower obtained funding at about 20 basis points below Libor by swapping into floating rate guilders. While guilder experts said the deal was sensibly priced, yielding 5.885 per cent at the re-offer price of 99.53, syndicate officials said it would take time to sell the issue given market conditions. Sweden's foreign currency borrowing programme for 1994 is about Dollars 10bn-Dollars 11bn, and in the first three months it has achieved more than half.</p>

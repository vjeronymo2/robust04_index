			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Murdoch agrees to resume role at NY Post MR Rupert Murdoch has agreed to resume publishing the New York Post following a decision by leaders of the newspaper's production unions to break a four-day strike by journalists. However, it was not clear last night if the paper would be on news-stands this morning. Earlier this week, Mr Murdoch said he was walking away from his agreement to manage the bankrupt tabloid after members of the Newspaper Guild, representing journalists and advertising staff, walked out, and drivers and printers refused to cross the guild's picket line. The guild is fighting Mr Murdoch's demands to slash severance pay and to have the right to dismiss any employee, regardless of seniority, within a four-month period. However after leaders of the paper's eight craft unions, including printers and drivers, said on Wednesday their members would return to work, Mr Murdoch extended his management contract by one week. He is expected to complete his Dollars 25m purchase of the paper within a week, assuming no further stoppages. The support of the journalists by other union members was a surprise. Mr Murdoch had struck agreements with all of The Post's other unions in July. At the time, guild members agreed to return to work while negotiations continued. Mr Colin Miner, a reporter at The Post said: 'It was a miracle that the drivers didn't cross on Monday. It's unlikely to happen again.'</p>

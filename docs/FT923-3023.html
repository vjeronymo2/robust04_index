			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / R-R Power offshoot wins Singapore contract NEI PARSONS, part of the Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, has won a Pounds 100m order, against international competition to supply three 250MW steam turbine generators for the Pulau Seraya power station in Singapore. The order, placed by the Public Utilities Board of Singapore, will mean recruitment next year of more than 100 shopfloor employees at Parsons' Newcastle upon Tyne plant, which has halved its workforce to 2,500 since the mid 1980s. A few design engineers will be recruited immediately. The new contract, coupled with a Pounds 70m Indian order won in May for two turbine generators, means security of employment for Parsons' existing workforce for several years. The first of the three turbine generators for Singapore will be installed and fully operative by October 1995. The other two will follow at six-monthly intervals. NEI Parsons beat six European and Japanese companies to win the order, which also includes condensing and feed heating plant and associated equipment. 'We have beaten the Japanese in the Far East,' the company said. Mr Trevor Murch, Parsons managing director, said the order would provide 'very valuable work' for the company over the next four years. He said it could also strengthen prospects by proving that it was world-competitive. Mr Barney McGill, convener, said: 'In the last few years there has certainly been a very good pulling together. It's been rewarded all round.'</p>

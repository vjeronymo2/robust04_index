			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TASTES OF U.S. YUPPIES SPREADING TO EUROPE;  </P> <P> INTERNATIONAL: ALLIGATOR STEAKS, CALIFORNIA WINES, LOW-CALORIE DISHES AND  HICKORY CHIPS BLAZE THE OVERSEAS TRAIL.  </P> <P> Alligator steaks in Britain, California wines in France and Texas-style  barbecues in West Germany are part of what some Agriculture Department  observers say is a move by European yuppies to go up-scale American.  </P> <P> "The marketing niche of young, urban professionals, or yuppies, that originated  in the United States has spread to Europe as well," says the department's  Foreign Agricultural Service.  </P> <P> But while sellers in Europe "are targeting young and affluent consumers for  their upscale consumption and bulging wallets," the agency said it may be a bit  early to predict whether U.S. exporters can benefit significantly.  </P> <P> "Whatever the European country, yuppie food tastes have common preferences for  high quality, convenience and innovation," said Mark Condon, a trade show  manager for the USDA agency.  </P> <P> "These qualities are part of the market of the future," he said. "In our  upcoming food exhibits in Europe, we have a lot of the kinds of products that  would appeal to yuppies."  </P> <P> Those include: low-calorie and low-fat health foods, non-alcoholic beers,  hickory chips for barbecue fires, ethnic foods, picture-perfect produce,  California wines, and foods with no preservatives or additives.  </P> <P> "Europeans are market-savvy people," Condon said. "Items must be of top  quality. They can't be cheap or discounted."  </P> <P> The rise of yuppie food interests in Europe is described in the forthcoming  December issue of AgExporter magazine published by the agency.  </P> <P> "As in the United States, the European yuppie market is small," the report  said. "But yuppies are trend-setters and innovators, often the first to try a  new food or fashion. Later, their tastes and preference trickle down to other  segments of the population, gradually being adopted by a broader audience."  </P> <P> So it is important to know what European yuppies are currently consuming, the  report added. Their tastes, however unusual today, could be the general rule  tomorrow.  </P> <P> Dale Good, U.S. agricultural trade officer in Hamburg, said the appeal of  American foods to European yuppies varies from country to country. For example,  in West Germany the products have to be compatible with German food traditions.  </P> <P> "The concept of eating cuisines from other countries is just emerging," Good  said.  </P> <P> But in Italy, the opposite seems to be the case, says U.S. agricultural  counselor for Rome, Frank Piason. The current rage is for ethnic food,  especially Tex-Mex, in the land of pasta.  </P> <P> "For the Italian yuppie, the focus is on lighter eating and less fatty food,"  Piason said. "The Italian yuppie is likely to consume pasta salad or rice  salad, rather than pasta, during lunch."  </P> <P> Also, U.S. wines are popular with the young Italians, the report said. That's  also the case in France.  </P> <P> "While trying to sell U.S. wines in France might seem like bringing coal to  Newcastle, the French are actually fascinated with U.S. wines," said Holly  Higgins, who recently completed a two-year assignment as U.S. agricultural  attache in Paris.  </P> <P> So the "plugged-in group" in France goes for American wines and Tex-Mex  specialties such as chili and enchiladas, she said.  </P> <P> Microwave ovens also are gaining in France, the land of the long-simmering  sauce, Higgins said. Changes in life styles, more working women and less time  for cooking are changing eating habits.  </P> <P> David Mergen, U.S. agricultural attache in Madrid, says, "Yes, Spain does have  yuppies" and they can be found in the middle of the day at expensive  restaurants close to where they work.  </P> <P> "Spanish yuppies prefer to eat dishes that are low in cholesterol and they also  tend to drink lighter alcoholic drinks," Mergen said. "Yuppies drink mineral  water and fruit juices. They drink wine with meals, however, and gin and tonics  in the evening."  </P> <P> One of Mergen's colleagues, Isabel Pastor, said the opening of several Madrid  restaurants that serve American food has helped promote awareness of those  foods. At least two of the restaurants have names such as "Hollywood" and  "Boston," she said.  </P> <P> In Britain, the preferences of yuppies are also highly varied and subject to  changing moods of style and trend, said marketing specialist Christine Chapman  of the U.S. agricultural trade office in London. But a few of the "in" foods  are alligator steaks and spicy Creole cooking.  </P> <P> Chapman said organic foods are part of the yuppie menu, along with foreign  items such as surimi, a processed fish product from Japan, Tex-Mex from the  United States, and kedgeree, a dish originally from India of rice and chopped  fish bound together with egg.  </P> <P> "Champagne is high on the list, particularly if it is laced with black currant  juice or wine," she said. New World wines from the United States and Chile are  growing in popularity.  </P> <P> Even conservative Switzerland has a yuppie market, according to agricultural  specialist Hansruedi Bachmann of the U.S. embassy in Bern. More than the  average consumer, the Swiss yuppie is attracted by U.S. foods, especially  California wines.  </P> <P> "Swiss yuppies, however, do not eat fast food," Bachmann said. "Instead, they  frequent luxury restaurants with an upscale, high-quality image."  </P></p>

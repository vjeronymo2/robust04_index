			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Opinion on Hold"] </F>   [Excerpt] At this point it is clear that the negotiations  concluded in March between Sweden and the European Union [EU]  did not give the proponents of membership any additional forward  momentum. The first negotiation round, which was completed  before the turn of the year, led to a clear yes effect in the  opinion polls. This time, however, the opinion seems to be wait  and see.    According to the most recent poll, carried out by Skop and  published in DAGENS INDUSTRI, the no side has even been somewhat  strengthened. To the straight question of how a person would  vote there are in April 55 percent who say no to membership, as  against 45 percent yes. To be sure, that is a clear improvement  over to the situation in the fall, when the yes side was below  40 percent, but a drop of 3 percentage points since February for  yes.    But Skop also has another question that provides more room  for the interviewed to indicate his uncertainty. To the question  of whether we should enter the EU there were in April 34 percent  who replied "yes, absolutely" or "yes, perhaps," while 32  percent replied "no, probably not" or "no, absolutely not." The  remaining 35 percent were therefore genuinely undecided. This,  the largest group, has grown since the negotiations were  concluded, and it is primarily among these that many today say  they would vote no.    So even if the no side seems to continue to stand stronger  than the yes side, many persons who apparently had envisioned  voting no have become more receptive to influence. [passage  omitted]</p>

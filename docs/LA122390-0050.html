			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: FINDING LOCAL SPECIALS IN MUNICH MAKES CENTS  </P> <P> Earlier this month in Munich, vendors were setting up wooden booths for  Cristkindlmarkt, the Christmas market in the town square Marienplatz.  Shopkeepers were draping boughs of fir and spruce over doorways. Restaurant  owners were offering such seasonal specialties as Christmas stollen and roast  goose.  </P> <P> And we were searching for affordable food. For this endeavor we had asked  Christie Aswell, an American living in Germany, to act as our guide.  </P> <P> "Once the bells of St. Peter's Church have chimed noon, you're not supposed to  eat weisswurste," Aswell said as we strolled the winding streets of Munich.  "Nobody knows how the custom started, but if you order them after noon, you'll  get rude stares."  </P> <P> Not wanting to flaunt tradition, Aswell, whose husband is in the U.S. Army in  Germany, took us to the restaurant Weisses Brauhaus for an 11:30 a.m. sausage  lunch.  </P> <P> Like many military families stationed in Europe, Aswell and her husband have  become proficient at stretching today's anemic dollar in an increasingly  expensive Germany, so she helped us find affordable restaurants that serve  local specialties.  </P> <P> At Weisses Brauhaus, we nibbled crusty rolls and large pretzels from a communal  basket on the table and ordered weisswurste, fat veal sausage seasoned with  lemon and parsley.  </P> <P> There is even a traditional way to eat weisswurste. After cutting the sausage  in half, you pick up a piece and dip it into some sweet mustard (there are pots  of it on each table), then you suck the meat out of the casing. The activity  itself is fun and the sweet mustard is delicious with the mild, white sausage.  </P> <P> Totaling the bill, the waitress asked how many rolls and pretzels we'd eaten.  They were 35 cents each. A serving of two sausages was about $4.50. Tips are  included in restaurant bills, but locals often leave an additional 5% if  service is good.  </P> <P> Weisswurste is just one of the specialties we savored in a city that offers  everything from traditional Bavarian pork sausage to Belon oysters from  Brittany. Fancy food markets such as the well-established Alois Dallmayr and  the newer, trendier Kafer cater to local food lovers, while the  Viktualienmarkt, an open-air market in the center of town, offers an abundance  of fresh fruit and vegetables year-round.  </P> <P> "Goose is served everywhere at Christmas," Aswell said as we sat down to dinner  at Durnbrau, a typical Bavarian restaurant in the center of Munich. Deer  antlers hung on the walls and holiday decorations dangled from the ceiling.  Although it was early in the evening, the restaurant, which dates to 1487, was  already crowded.  </P> <P> We tried the roast goose marinated in vinegar and red wine (about $16). It had  a wonderful, sweet-sour taste. The skin was crisp, the meat tender. Red cabbage  cooked with apples was pleasantly tart, and bread dumplings the size of tennis  balls were perfect for sopping up the rich brown gravy from the wooden serving  bowl.  </P> <P> For dessert, we split an order of kaiserschmarn (about $9). The thick pancake,  which was massive enough for eight, contained almonds and raisins and was baked  until a crust of caramelized sugar formed on the bottom. We dipped the warm,  powdered-sugar-sprinkled pieces into applesauce and wished we had begun with  dessert.  </P> <P> German pastries are habit-forming, and we adopted the local custom of stopping  in small cafes for an afternoon snack. Kreutzkamm Conditorei is famous for its  Christmas stollen, a traditional holiday yeast cake crammed with raisins,  currants, citron and almonds and drenched in powdered sugar.  </P> <P> We also tried baumkuchen, a butter cake made by pouring layers of batter over a  pole that revolves in front of a fire.  </P> <P> While Kreutzkamm is a traditional, Old World-style bakery/cafe, Gourmet Morth  is contemporary. There we tried a mango mousse tart, fragrant with fresh mango  and, miraculously in December, a wild strawberry tart. These cafes can also be  affordable spots for a light lunch. You can have a bowl of soup for about  $3.50, sandwiches for about $5 and pastries for about $3.  </P> <P> Or try Nurnberger schweinwurst, tiny pork sausages the size of a finger. They  originated in Nuremberg but are a passion in Munich. A good place to sample  them is Nurnberger Bratwurstglockl, a cozy restaurant near Marienplatz. We sat  at a corner table beneath leaded glass windows and ordered leberspatzl soup  (about $2.95). Out came a bowl of clear consomme with liver dumplings and  chives. The savory broth was warming on a damp December morning, and the  dumplings tasted strongly of liver.  </P> <P> In the back of the small, crowded room, we could see through a glass door into  the kitchen where a woman was roasting bratwurst scented with garlic and herbs  over an open flame. The bratwurst was sensational with sauerkraut and sharp  mustard.  </P> <P> The same type of sausage was boiled and served with carrots, celery and onions.  The aroma of the vegetables permeated the sausages with a delectable  combination of flavors that was very different from the grilled version. The  grilled sausages were about $4 for four; boiled they were about $7 for six.  </P> <P> Munich has its share of fancy restaurants, but the current exchange rate makes  them incredibly expensive. "At the best restaurants, it will cost you $300 to  $400 for a meal for two people without wine," Aswell said.  </P> <P> As an alternative, she suggested Mark's, which opened this spring in the Hotel  Rafael. So on our last night in Munich, we climbed a circular staircase from  the hotel lobby to find a spacious room with candles and orchids on every  table.  </P> <P> We began with a terrine of goose liver layered with sliced truffle and  lingonberries. It was fabulous.  </P> <P> Although a native of Munich, chef Frank Heppner cooked for years in the Orient,  and that influence was seen in a dish of prawns and noodles. For it, a sauce of  ginger and lemon grass topped with finely chopped red bell peppers, chives and  ginger was served over very thin noodles something like angel hair pasta.  </P> <P> Veal fillets were served with intensely flavored, slightly sweet port wine  sauces -- one white, one red, with grilled Belgian endive on the side. For  dessert there were deep-fried Asian spring rolls filled with fresh fruit glazed  with honey and served on a fresh coconut sauce. It was a light dessert with  just enough sweetness to satisfy.  </P> <P> The restaurant was quiet with lots of space between tables and perfect service.  It's the kind of place you wish for at home. At $150 for two, the dinner was  expensive, but it was one of those meals we will savor for years.  </P> <P> Recommended: Weisses Brauhaus, Munchen im Tal (call locally 299875); Durnbrau,  Durnbraugrasse 2 (222195); Kreutzkamm, Maffeistrasse 4 (293277); Gourmet Morth,  Amplatzl 3 (226061); Nurnberger Bratwurstglockl, Frauenplatz 9 (220385);  Mark's, Hotel Rafael, Neuturmstrasse 1 (290980).  </P></p>

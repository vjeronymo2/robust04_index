			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUS FIRM TO LOSE CONTRACT WITH SCHOOLS IN NEWHALL  </P> <P> The Newhall School District has decided not to renew its $300,000 annual  contract with Laidlaw Transit when it expires in June, saying the company has  provided poor bus service.  </P> <P> Laidlaw's poor record, as well as a desire to cut costs, has motivated the  district to seek bids from other contractors, Pat Willett, a school district  trustee, said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Laidlaw buses serving the William S. Hart Union High School District  continue to have scheduling problems, a school district official said.  </P> <P> "They really haven't shown any improvement," said Jim Bown, director of support  services in the Hart district.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buses Often Late  </P> <P> Officials of the Hart and Newhall districts, both in the Santa Clarita Valley,  have complained for months that a chronic shortage of drivers results in sloppy  bus service. Buses are habitually late and many drivers are unfamiliar with  routes, district officials said.  </P> <P> Laidlaw, the largest school bus transportation company in the nation, has  pledged repeatedly to improve service. The company is paid about $1 million a  year to transport 3,600 Hart and Newhall students.  </P> <P> Newhall Supt. J. Michael McGrath notified Laidlaw on Jan. 23 that the district  plans to seek transportation bids for the new fiscal year, which begins July 1.  McGrath did not cite poor service in his letter, but the message was clear, he  said Wednesday. The letter's tone, he said, "was rather cold."  </P> <P> Laidlaw officials could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renewed Contract Unlikely  </P> <P> Laidlaw is free to bid on Newhall's contract once again, but the district has  little confidence in the company, McGrath said. "They almost seem incapable of  dealing with it," he said of the tardy buses. "The real issue is that they have  a constant shortage of drivers."  </P> <P> The company has tried to fill its driving ranks in the valley by housing  substitute Laidlaw drivers in area motels. The company also has tried to  recruit valley residents to drive its buses. The firm has run classified  advertisements in community newspapers and stationed recruiters outside  supermarkets.  </P> <P> But Willett said bad publicity probably has hampered Laidlaw's efforts. Bown  said Laidlaw is short of drivers in some of the company's other Southern  California operations and is hard-pressed to find substitutes to drive in the  Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> "I don't think they've got anyone to bring up here," Bown said.  </P> <P> Laidlaw's performance in the valley improved in November and December after  Hart officials threatened to sever their contract unless buses started running  on time. But bus service nose-dived when students returned from their winter  break last month, Bown said.  </P> <P> An independent auditor is reviewing transportation services in the Hart and  Newhall districts. The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the  month.  </P> <P> Complaints about Laidlaw's service in the valley mirror criticisms leveled  against the company in the Las Virgenes Unified School District during the  1987-88 school year. Laidlaw buses were late and the firm had to rely on a  staff of substitute drivers, said Fred Wendt, the Las Virgenes district's  supervisor of maintenance operations and transportation.  </P> <P> The Las Virgenes district decided not to renew its contract with Laidlaw partly  because of poor service, Wendt said. The district also sought a less costly  transportation firm, he said. Laidlaw bid to regain the contract but lost to  another firm, he said.  </P></p>

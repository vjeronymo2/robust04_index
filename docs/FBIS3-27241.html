Addressing a national work conference, Fei Ziwen, general  manager of the China National Nonferrous Metals Industry  Corporation, said that China's output of ten types of major  nonferrous metals reached 3.27 million tons last year, meeting  the 1995 target two years ahead of schedule.    "Meanwhile, our corporation has also made great progress in  improving productivity by transferring a number of workers to  the service sector and other lines of production," Fei told  managers of nonferrous metals companies across the country.    By doing so, companies attached to the corporation cut their  total workforce by 12 percent in 1993, or 90,000 people, he said.    He said that his corporation will continue to do so until  the  end of the century. It plans to transfer another 10 percent of  the workforce to other production lines in 1994 and 33 percent  by 2000, he added.    "China's nonferrous industry is still far behind its  colleagues in developed countries in terms of productivity," he  conceded.    Although the country's present nonferrous metals production  is 11 times the amount in the 1950s, the productivity of the  industry rose by just 100 percent, he said.    He described the 11 percent rise in the industry's  productivity in 1993 as a "significant achievement."    "Only by continuing to improve its productivity, will  China's  nonferrous industry become more competitive in the world  market," he said.</p>

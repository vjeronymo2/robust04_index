			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Danish demands MEANWHILE, DENMARK. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, may be correct in his belief that the terms of the Danish demands would involve a renegotiation of the treaty, which the 12 have already ruled out as a matter of principle. But it was not prudent of him to say so in the way he did last week. On commonsense grounds, a compromise ought to be possible. Cumulatively, the Danish demands undoubtedly represent a pretty comprehensive rejection of the Maastricht vision of greater unity at the political and economic level. But in detail each item on the Danish list can be dealt with. Indeed, most of them seem based on a misapprehension of what the treaty could require of Denmark. There is no provision for a compulsory common defence policy, and no chance that such a policy could be imposed. Danish anxieties that the Community could encroach on national sovereignty in the fields of citizenship and law enforcement are equally overdone. The most substantial demand is for a strengthened opt-out from the plan for a single currency. Yet Denmark already has a protocol in the treaty allowing it to secure exemption from monetary union, so an expansion of this let-out would not be a major departure of principle. The most difficult feature of the Danish package is not so much these issues themselves as the form in which they have been wrapped. If the Danish government continues to insist upon an instrument which is legally binding and therefore involving directly or indirectly an effective modification of the treaty and a new round of ratifications, the other member states will be right to resist. It may yet be that, faced with a treaty ratified by 11 members, the Danes will be willing to settle for the kind of declaratory interpretation the 11 would certainly be willing to sign. What seems beyond doubt, is that an accommodation will require negotiation and compromise at the political level. This is not a task at this stage in which Mr Delors can play a leading role.</p>

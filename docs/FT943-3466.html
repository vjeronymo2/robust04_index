			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Revenue urged to pay compensation The Inland Revenue should consider offering compensation to taxpayers it has mistreated, its independent adjudicator said yesterday. Ms Elizabeth Filkin, the Revenue adjudicator appointed last year, said she had come across several cases where she felt reimbursing overpaid tax was not a sufficient financial response to complaints. She said the Revenue should make additional ex gratia payments to taxpayers. She has made the recommendation to the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner - or ombudsman - which is considering the idea for all government departments. Her remarks coincided with the publication of the adjudicator's first annual report yesterday, which showed that two-thirds of complaints against the Revenue investigated by the office had been upheld. Of 105 complaints settled in the 11 months to March 31, 65 were wholly or partly in favour of the complainant, 36 wholly in favour of the Revenue and four were withdrawn. About 60 per cent were resolved by mediation and most of the rest through formal recommendations. In 29 cases the Revenue made repayments to the taxpayer ranging from Pounds 25 to Pounds 10,937. The most common concerns related to the repayment of tax. The largest number of complaints were about mistakes, the use of discretion, the attitude of Revenue staff and delays. There were 308 complaints which had been taken up for full investigation during the year. The office received 1,615 complaints, which Ms Filkin said was substantially more than had been expected. Ms Filkin said that many of the problems taxpayers had with the Revenue related to the size and complexity of the tax system. She said tax officials sometimes failed to appreciate 'just how confusing and indeed frightening' the Revenue could seem. She stressed that complaints were inevitable in such a large organisation that deals with as many individuals as the Revenue does, and it had responded well to her recommendations. However, she highlighted a tendency for managers to support their staff automatically rather than examining an issue objectively after a complaint. A number of apologies were given only grudgingly after mistakes were identified. She said the decision to launch investigations was normally justified but there was sometimes a 'stubborn' reluctance by officials to close their inquiries even after adequate responses from taxpayers. Ms Filkin said that in some cases the accountant advising a taxpayer had made mistakes and then tried to blame the Revenue. She said this was something the accountancy profession should examine. The costs of the adjudicator's office were Pounds 596,000 in the first year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region utilized foreign funds of 120  million U.S. dollars in the first quarter this year, up 56  percent over the same period in 1993.    According to Lei Aizu, official in charge of opening  affairs,  overseas money has now turned to industry, agriculture and  infrastructures from real estate and tourism, which were hot  spots in recent years.    Industrial and farming projects accounted for 69 percent of  the 239 foreign-funded enterprises newly approved in the last  quarter.    Ten of them have been invested with over 10 million U.S.  dollars each.    Lei said that 80 percent of the newly-approved projects are  funded by investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.    He also noted that foreign investors have started to expand  their businesses into the mountainous areas.    At the beginning of this year, a special committee led by  the  region's top officials was set up to promote investment from  abroad.    The region's growth of foreign investment in 1993 topped the  list among the provinces in China's coastal areas.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Leoniid Tratsevskiy for </F> TASS]    [Text] Minsk, 8 Apr -- "The campaign to elect our first  president, which is now under way, is being accompanied by a  stepping up of political and media tension around the Army and  its daily activities," according to a statement issued today by  the Collegium of the Belarus Defense Ministry. The statement  points out that "the Armed Forces of Belarus, which are intended  for the armed defense of their country and the protection of its  sovereignty and state integrity, must not be an arena for  political confrontation by any political parties and  sociopolitical movements whatsoever."    The statement declares that all attempts to destabilize the  political neutrality of the Army and its loyalty to the laws of  Belarus will be decisively nipped in the bud. At the same time,  the document states, "we will preserve restraint and good sense,  we will not allow ourselves to be drawn into political battles  and propaganda actions."</p>

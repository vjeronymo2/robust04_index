			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shares gain on renewed confidence THE UNEXPECTED link-up in the UK property industry between Mr George Soros and British Land provided a strong stimulus to confidence in the London stock market yesterday. Driven by gains in British Land and other leading property stocks, the FT-SE Index extended its advance into its latest trading range by nearly 20 points before closing well below the best as US investors continued to sell pharmaceutical stocks after Wall Street opened. A secondary support for investment confidence came from hopes that political pressures might yet induce the new UK chancellor of the exchequer to cut base rates, although these were restrained by the Bank of England's actions in the money markets and by renewed warnings on inflation from the president of the Bundesbank, ahead of today's policy meeting at the German central bank. The latest UK money supply data, however, encouraged speculation on domestic rate cuts and the London markets were not wholly convinced by the Bank's actions in the money markets. 'Mr Clarke (the new UK chancellor) has little to lose by cutting rates,' commented Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull. The FT-SE Index closed 13.8 up at 2,863.0, after touching 2,868.7 at mid-session. This left the market still comfortably inside its latest trading range, which will not be seriously tested until the Footsie reaches the 2,880 area. UBS, the London securities arm of the Swiss bank, yesterday raised its year-end forecast for the Footsie to 3,100, indicating a total return for the year of around 23 per cent; UBS is setting the same target for 1994. The rebound in confidence was shown most clearly in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which jumped by 25.1 points to a new peak of 3,191.4. However, trading volume in the non-Footsie stocks which make up the bulk of the Mid 250 Index made up only 56 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 601.9m shares. On Tuesday, when the London market was very slow to return from the extended holiday weekend, Seaq volume of 401.9m shares was worth only Pounds 841m in retail, or customer, business, the lowest daily figure for many months. The London market has enjoyed a virtually unbroken run of Pounds 1bn daily customer business levels since sterling left the ERM in mid-September last year. Among the strongest sectors in the Footsie 100 stocks list, property shares, represented by a gain of more than 5 per cent in Land Securities, stood out. But the implications for their loan books of a revival of confidence in the UK property market also boosted the domestic clearing banks, where Barclays and National Westminster moved ahead. Firmness in the US dollar helped sentiment among the international stocks but this was overshadowed by further, determined selling of the pharmaceutical sector by US investors. Downward pressure on Glaxo was increased when a UK investment bank moved to sell the share options heavily at mid-session. Wellcome was another weak feature in the pharmaceuticals sector. The gathering clouds over drug stocks, which have been driven by uncertainties over the Clinton administration's healthcare policies, continued to benefit ICI, which again attracted significant support from investors both in the UK and in New York.</p>

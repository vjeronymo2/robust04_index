			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Survey targets tardy offices THE WELSH Office and the building management section of the Property Services Agency are the worst government departments when it comes to paying their bills on time, Diane Summers writes. Less than 42 per cent of PSA building management bills are paid within the contract terms or 30 days. The Welsh Office, meanwhile, pays 65 per cent of invoices within the period, government figures indicate. Top of the prompt payment league is the Inland Revenue, which pays 99 per cent of invoices within 30 days.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Big jump in US housing starts US HOUSING starts in August showed the strongest increase in 18 months, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The annual rate of starts on new homes climbed by 10.4 per cent to a seasonally adjusted 1,237m units. This followed declines of 4.1 and 2.4 per cent in June and July respectively and was far stronger than expected. The bond market fell as investors felt the increase would lower chances of an interest rate cut. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond lost a full point. August's increase came after bad weather limited building in the summer. The housing market is being helped by lower interest rates, with mortgage rates near a 20-year low. Although construction activity picked up strength last month, applications for new permits fell by 1.6 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,063m units. This followed a 4.7 per cent increase in permits in July and suggests August's big gain in construction is likely to moderate in coming months.</p>

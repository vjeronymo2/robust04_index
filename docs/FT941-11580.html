			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Goodman buys into Mexico's gelatine market Goodman Fielder, the Australian food company which takes in the Leiner and Davis gelatine brands, is acquiring Panamericana de Grenetina (Pagsa), which claims to be Mexico's largest gelatine manufacturer, for an undisclosed sum. Goodman is buying the business via its Intergel division, and said the deal would provide a wholly-owned gelatine production facility, and direct access to the Mexican gelatine market. The initial impact on Intergel's revenues will be small, adding about ADollars 15m (USDollars 10m) in sales.</p>

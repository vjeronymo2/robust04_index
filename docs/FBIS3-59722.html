Introduction </H5>   Though electric power is essential in our present lifestyle,  as energy consumption increases, frequent reliance on fossil  fuel energy for power has led to problems such as destruction of  the global environment and the pollution of urban environments.  Thus engines for power generation that prevent these problems  are needed. Crucial to this end is the ability to reduce exhaust  emissions themselves through the use of motors with good heat  efficiency, and the ability to further reduce global  environmental pollution from exhaust through the use of clean  fuels.    Currently, low-speed, two-stroke diesel engines exhibit the  highest heat efficiency among commercial heat engines, and LNG  is the most promising clean fuel. However since conventional  diesel engines were built to run on liquid fuels (light and  heavy oils), advantageous use of clean fuels has not been  achieved.    Amidst the trend of energy resource diversification, since  1978 we have been developing a novel engine, the Mitsui  Gas-injected Diesel Engine (GIDE), that allows the use of  natural gas with heat efficiency and output efficiency akin to  that of conventional diesel engines. In 1985, as part of the  Western Australia LNG Project, a gas fueled Mitsui MAN-B&amp;W  6L35MC-GI low-speed, two-stroke GIDE was successfully  demonstrated in public. For the first commercial model,  gas-related parts for the Holeby 16V28/32-GI (3.52 MW)  medium-speed diesel engine were also jointly developed with  MAN-B&amp;W Diesel, Inc. (MBD) and entered commercial operation  in  Denmark in May, 1991.    The Mitsui MAN-B&amp;W 12K80MC-GI-S introduced here is the  world's first large-scale, low-speed, commercial GIDE in which  gas injection technology we have developed on the basis of the  foregoing technology and experience is applied to a large-scale,  low-speed diesel engine licensed by Mitsui in conjunction with  MBD.    With a single unit output of 40.7 MW and gross thermal  efficiency of approximately 48&percnt;, the engine also possesses  world class output and peak heat efficiency among current  power-generating diesel land engines and is naturally the  world's largest gas-fueled engine.    Testing and research facilities making use of the engine are  now under construction at Mitsui's Chiba site with anticipated  completion in July, 1994. Plans call for development of  low-speed, gas-injected diesel engines and development and  trials of land power plant-related technology, including  high-efficiency scrubbers (SCR) for removal of NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  from exhaust.    A structural description of the engine and an overview of  testing facilities are given below.  <H5>  2. Advantages of Gas-injected Diesel Engines </H5>   MC-GI engines are based on Mitsui MAN-B&amp;W L/S/K-MC  engines,  for which considerable practical results exist, and represent  enhancements of an engine capable of efficient use of gas fuel  as a primary fuel. These engines derive the following superior  advantages from their use of so-called diffused combustion  systems in which, unlike conventional (low pressure) gas-fueled  engines, high pressure gas fuel (250-300 bar) is injected  directly into the cylinders, ignited by a small amount of pilot  fuel injected nearly simultaneously, and consumed.    (1) Achievement of diesel engine-equivalent heat efficiency  and output efficiency at virtually all load regions.    (2) Excellent responsiveness to load variance.    (3) Excellent structural safety eliminating internal leakage  of gas fuel into scavenger chambers during the compression  stroke.    (4) Capability for both a wide range of multifuel combustion  of gas and heavy oil fuels, and monofuel combustion of heavy oil  fuels.  <H5>  3. Engine Construction </H5>   In GI conversion of MC engines, MC engine parts with  demonstrated reliability and durability are used without  modification as principal structural parts of the engine and  structural parts of combustion chambers. Only the following  parts are added or partially modified.    In other words, the engine is of proven safety and  reliability.    Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, respectively, a vertical cross  section and an outline view of the engine. Table 1 gives  principal data for the engine.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-13A>             Figure 1. Mitsui MAN-B </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-13B>             Figure 2.

Gas fuel is supplied to the gas compressor under medium  pressure, raised to a pressure of 250-300 bar, and directed to  the engine's main gas fuel pipes. By way of thin, flexible  branch pipes, the fuel is then directed from the main pipes to a  valve block in each cylinder attached to the side of a cylinder  cover. Valve blocks are internally equipped with an accumulator  to prevent a reduction in gas pressure during gas injection,  various safety valves that comprise part of a safety apparatus  described below, and a pressure converter.    Two gas injection valves per cylinder are provided at  cylinder covers, and [gas] passes from the accumulator to each  gas injection valve by way of a gas pathway inside the cover.    Gas injection valves are opened and closed by oil pressure  raised by a control oil pump structurally identical to the fuel  pump, and a safety apparatus described below ensures that gas  fuel is injected only when pilot fuel has been injected.    Two pilot valves structurally identical to fuel injection  valves for a diesel engine are provided at cylinder covers, and  operation proceeds through these valves alone at load ranges  during starting and at up to roughly 30&percnt;, but at higher  load  ranges, a small amount of heavy oil A is injected as a pilot  fuel used to ignite the gas fuel. Two fuel regulating shafts are  installed in the engine to control these two fuels, and the  respective regulating shafts are driven by separate electrical  actuators that operate under the instructions of a controller  controlling the entire power plant.  <H5>  4. Newly Developed Parts </H5>   Major newly developed parts for use the gas-injected engine  are described in detail below.    4.1 Gas Injection Valve    Figure 4 shows an assembled cross section. As seen from the  figure, the valve has a previously employed spindle-type  structure but differs from conventional fuel valves in the  following points.     -  Regular supply of high pressure gas fuel.    -  Regular supply of sealing oil    -  Supply of control oil for spindle opening and closing       Specifically, in contrast to conventional automatic valves  used with liquid fuels, 250-300 bar high pressure gas fuel is  continually supplied around the gas spindle, and injection of  gas fuel is therefore controlled by the increase and decrease of  control oil pressure. When control oil pressure between the  control oil chamber and the gas supply component of the spindle  is not raised, sealing oil of somewhat higher pressure than the  gas fuel is supplied in order to prevent the gas fuel from  infiltrating the control oil chamber. Sealing rings are provided  around the outside of gas injection valves to prevent leakage of  the high pressure gas fuel. The material of these sealing rings  has both adequate sealing properties in the relatively high  temperature environment inside the cylinder cover and endurance  versus sudden pressure changes. A double pipe structure equipped  with drain holes both within gas injection valves and within  cylinder covers prevents accidental leakage of gas fuel directly  to the outside.    The structure of this gas injection valve is identical to  that of injection valves for Holeby engines and the Mitsui  MAN-B&amp;W 6L35MC-GI supplied for equipment testing in the  Western  Australia LNG Project in 1985, and has thus enjoyed substantial  actual use. The functioning and endurance of this injection  valve will also be further checked with a testing apparatus for  the gas injection system alone.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-14A>             Figure 4. Cross Section of Gas Injection Valve </FIG>       4.2 Cylinder Covers    Though the structure of the cylinder cover is identical to  that of the cylinder cover used with the K80MC base engine,  starting valves have been miniaturized and their position  changed to accommodate a pair of gas injection valves and pilot  valves.    Gas injection valves provide capability ranging from a  minimum injection quantity corresponding to an approximate  30&percnt;  load to a maximum injection quantity covering the rated load,  but because this engine is used to drive a land power plant,  pilot valves consist of fuel valves with the capability to  handle only low load ranges extending through starting and  conversion to gas fuel operation.    The double pipe structure concept has also been applied  within the cylinder cover, in the provision of gas drain holes  and holes that supply gas to gas injection valves.    Valve blocks are bolted to the camshaft side of cylinder  covers.    4.3 Valve Blocks    Figure 5 shows an assembled cross section of a valve block.  Within a valve block are provided a large capacity gas  accumulator, emergency cutoff valve, emergency release valve,  gas release valve internal to the accumulator, check valve, and  pressure transducer for monitoring gas pressure within the  accumulator.    The volume of the accumulator is sufficient to allow gas  injection with combustion unimpaired simply by the expansion of  gas fuel accumulated during one stroke, supply of gas from  branch pipes until the next injection begins, and maintenance of  a constant gas supply pressure. Gas fuel from the branch pipes  of each cylinder passes through the check valve provided at the  accumulator inlet, enters the accumulator and, during normal gas  operation, is directed from the emergency cutoff valve to gas  holes within the cylinder cover.    When gas operation ends, the emergency cutoff valve closes  and the emergency release valve simultaneously opens and  immediately releases gas fuel within the cylinder cover into gas  drain pipes. A backflow of gas contained within the accumulator  by the check valve is released into the gas drain pipes by the  gas release valve, and the release of gas fuel from around the  engine is completed.    A safety apparatus is also provided such that if the gas  valve spindle should stick in the open position, or other  abnormalities occur, the pressure transducer used to monitor gas  pressure within the accumulator detects an abnormal drop in gas  pressure, valve operations identical to those at the end of gas  operation are carried out, and abnormal gas flow into cylinders  is kept to a minimum.    Gas fuel sealing components, like other parts, are all of  double seal construction.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-15A>             Figure 5. Cross Section of Valve Block </FIG>       4.4 Gas Supply Pipes    Engine gas pipes are all of double construction and consist  of main supply pipes, main drain pipes, and branch pipes that  connect both sets of main pipes to the valve block of each  cylinder. During gas operation, ejectors provided at double pipe  outlets continually ventilate the double pipe spacing so that  its pressure is lower than that of the engine room.    The ends of main gas supply pipes are equipped with check  valves and connected to (nitrogen gas) purge lines.    As shown in Figure 6, the main pipe internal to the double  pipes is supported from the outer pipe at three points to allow  free sliding in the axial direction, which counters mechanical  oscillation and differences in deformation of the inner and  outer pipes due to thermal expansion.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-16A>             Figure 6. Gas Supply Pipe </FIG>       4.5 Fuel Pumps and Fuel Regulating Shafts    Figure 7 shows the location of a pilot oil pump and a  control oil pump.    The pilot oil pump provides the capacity required to handle  injection at starting and up to an approximate 30&percnt; load.    Naturally, a normal K80MC fuel pump may be used when  operation up to the rated load with heavy oil fuel is required,  as with an LNG main ship's engine.    (tab)The control oil pump has the same basic structure as  the fuel pump but has a tip constructed as a safety device to  prevent the injection of gas fuel, as shown in Figure 8, if the  pilot plunger sticks and pilot fuel injection pressure is  insufficient; thus preventing a situation in which only gas fuel  has been injected into a cylinder and remains uncombusted.    As shown in Figure 9, both pumps are controlled by  respective  fuel regulating shafts, and the fuel regulating shafts are  driven by electrical actuators controlled by a computer that  controls the entire power plant (or PPC; programmable process  controller).    PPC-directed electrical actuator control is as follows. In  pilot oil monofuel operation during starting and at low loads,  only the pilot regulating shaft is controlled and the control  oil regulating shaft is held at a zero position. When the  instruction to begin gas operation is issued, control switches  to the control regulating shaft and the pilot regulating shaft  recedes at a constant speed to a preset minimum injection  position where it is held.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-16B>             Figure 7.

Safety Devices </H5>   Preventing leakage of uncombusted gas fuel outside the  engine  room and cylinders is crucial for safe utilization of gas fuel.  Equally important is the prevention of accidents through  essential measures such as early detection of any leakage that  does occur, stopping leakage before dangerous conditions are  reached, and engine shutdown. To these ends, the following  special safety devices are provided in addition to those  included in typical engines.    Signals from these safety devices are all received by the  PPC, which takes actions appropriate to operating status. Tables  2 and 3 summarize major trouble and responses thereto.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Among these, the combustion gas pressure monitor  normally monitors the pressure within all cylinders and  terminates gas operation mode if the compression pressure or  maximum pressure of any cylinder greatly differs from the  average for all cylinders. Devices monitoring gas pressure  within gas accumulators operate as previously stated. In either  case, the change in operating mode is rapid; the valve operation  described in 4.3 is carried out within one stroke after  detection.    5.2 Exhaust Gas Temperature Deviation Alarm    If operation becomes unreliable due to an inadequate gas  injection valve seat seal or the like, a small amount of gas  fuel will leak into a cylinder during operation. Since the  exhaust gas temperature of that cylinder will rise above that of  other cylinders, cylinder outlet exhaust gas temperatures are  monitored, and a temperature deviation alarm terminating gas  operation mode is triggered in such cases.    5.3 Pilot Fuel Injection Failure Prevention Apparatus    Gas fuel is not ignited by the rise in cylinder temperature  produced by diesel engine compression alone. Thus a small amount  of pilot fuel is required as a heat source for ignition and is  injected into the cylinders before the gas fuel. However  ignition will fail if the pilot fuel is not injected due to a  stuck pump, malfunctioning intake valve, or bad pipe coupling  connection or the like, and a risk of explosion in the exhaust  receiver can result. The pilot fuel injection failure prevention  apparatus noted in 4.5 is provided to prevent this situation  from occurring. In addition to failed pilot fuel injection, this  system also detects pilot spindles stuck in the open position.  <H5>  6. Power Plants and Pollution Prevention </H5>   When a diesel power plant is installed in a Japanese city,  it  must clear pollution regulations governing exhaust gas, warm  discharge water, oscillation and noise, etc. Ichihara, Chiba  Prefecture, in particular, where this test plant was installed,  is a Specially Designated Regulated Pollution Area and the  prefecture, city, and company have therefore agreed to special  regulatory values. This equipment is designed to satisfy all  regulatory values.    The adoption of LNG as a primary fuel makes sulfur oxides  and  soot in exhaust non-problematic, but considerable  NO&lt;inf&gt; x&lt;/inf&gt;  exhaust from this high-efficiency engine itself  requires special countermeasures.    Thus a catalytic reduction-type exhaust scrubber (SCR) is  provided as shown in the conceptual view Figure 10.    In a 4-stroke engine produced in 1980, we introduced Japan's  first plant combining an SCR and diesel engine and have  considerable experience in the field. The development of such  large-scale, high efficiency scrubbers is a world first.    In general, this type of scrubber is located in an engine  supercharger backflow, but in the case of a large 2-stroke  engine, the exhaust gas temperature in the supercharger backflow  is below the optimal operating temperature range of the  scrubber, which is therefore located between the engine and the  supercharger in the current test plant. This location results in  the denitration of high pressure gas, which is advantageous for  allowing greater miniaturization than under atmospheric pressure.    Figure 11 shows a full layout view of the test plant.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-19A>             Figure 10. Conceptual View of Exhaust Gas System </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-20A>             Figure 11. Full Layout View of Test Plant </FIG>      <H5>    7. Conclusion </H5>   The GIDE introduced here is one solution to future  environmental problems that stems from our experience and  technical ability as the world's largest producer of  large-scale, two-stroke, marine diesel engines.    The high heat efficiency of large-scale, two-stroke,  gas-injected diesel engines (GIDE) themselves and the use of  clean LNG as a primary fuel are expected to bring about future  low-pollution power plants using these engines, especially in  the form of large-scale plants suitable for suburban  installation.    For this test plant, we plan long-term operation of several  thousand hours per year designed to establish large-scale  GIDE-related technology and reliability; looking forward as well  to its utilization as a proven, large-scale GIDE power plant  incorporating high-efficiency denitration equipment to counter  exhaust gas.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Steady as she goes but watch bonds Leaving aside politics and the bond market, the UK recovery is doing better than might have been expected. Output is rising at trend rates or slightly above: that is sufficiently fast to make inroads into unemployment and unused capacity, but not so fast as to stoke up inflation. Indeed, the April increase in earnings growth has, for the moment at least, reversed itself. The official index of underlying retail price inflation is 2.5 per cent, lower than predicted in any of the Bank of England Inflation Reports. The Bank's own index, stripped of indirect tax increases, is even lower, at around 2 per cent or less. Moreover inflation worriers should be reassured by recent evidence that the pace of home demand is moderating. Retail spending, although well up on a year ago, is increasing less quickly. Monetary conditions have tightened themselves owing to the rise in bond yields; and an increase in the cost of fixed interest mortgages has taken the edge off the housing market. Thus, as the world economy recovers, there should be room for exports to take over some of the momentum from home spending. What, then, are the financial markets worrying about? The political weakness of the British government is not a good explanation. There have been plenty of bull markets under Labour governments and bear markets under Conservative ones. Labour leaders are, if anything, hypersensitive to international and financial market sentiments. Have financial analysts already forgotten the prawn cocktail offensive in the City before the last election to persuade the City of Labour's financial responsibility? The real dangers of a Labour government are from the harm it might inflict on its natural supporters through devices like minimum wages. Another false worry is that the present government will refuse to tighten monetary policy when the Bank of England advises it to do so. The chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, is 'philosophically' in favour of central bank independence, but does not think the time right for a full-frontal move. Meanwhile, the publication of the minutes of his monthly meetings with the governor has put the latter in the driving seat. If the Bank of England is really intent on raising interest rates  - which it is not at present - the most that the chancellor is able to do, as he well recognises, is to interpose a minor delay. Moreover, a Blair-Brown Labour government would not reverse the moves made so far to give the Bank more scope. Indeed Labour's mood at the moment is to settle for a transitional set of arrangements quite similar to the government's own. What then is worrying markets? The source of the trouble is clearly the US. Even here, there may not be anything all that fundamental. We may simply have seen the bursting of a moderate speculative bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is still much higher than in most of 1992 and 1993. The same applies to the FT-SE 100 Index in the UK. The German Dax index has seen nothing more than a hesitation in a two-year upward trend. Similar remarks apply to bonds. In the US and the UK, bond yields have more than reversed their 1993 fall, but are still lower than two years ago. The rise in German yields has been less, but sufficient to put a brake on the succession of short-term interest rate cuts. One way of putting what has happened is that, a year ago, inflation was widely held to be dead and deflation declared to be the new problem. Today's perception is of a normal upward phase in the business cycle, bringing with it the familiar need for vigilance against any inflationary take-off. The most striking feature of world financial markets is the weakness of the dollar against the yen. But this is not yet a generalised dollar weakness. The US currency is a good deal higher, for instance, against the D-Mark than it was in the closing months of the Bush administration, when it touched DM1.39. Sterling has weakened less than the dollar and it is still well above the low levels it reached after the 1992 ERM exit. But having said all this, the weakness of bond prices will indeed become a severe warning signal if it goes much further. The rise of nearly 3 percentage points in UK bond yields since last winter can be decomposed into two elements. There has been a rise of over 1 point in the return on index-linked securities, which now yield around 4 per cent. This is an approximation to the real rate of interest not only in the UK, but in the world - for real rates tend to equality in a worldwide capital market. This real component of the rise in rates could be a sign that the world capital shortage, which was prematurely diagnosed after the fall of the Berlin wall, has at last really arrived. In the words of David Hale of Kemper Financial Services, 'the potential exists for the old industrial countries to experience a cyclical economic recovery coincident with rapid economic growth in countries making the transition to market-based economic systems. This is likely to put upward pressure on real interest rates, because it will generate investment activity and credit demand from countries which have not been players since the first world war.' In addition, there will be the need to finance budget deficits in most western countries. On top of these structural forces, there is an apparent rise of more than 1 percentage point in the UK 'inflation premium', derived by subtracting the yield on indexed gilts from that on normal gilts. The one worldwide force suggesting the possible return of inflation has been a 25 per cent jump this year in commodity prices. In fact, a sharp rise here in the course of a world recovery is quite normal. An occasional bump of this kind is an illustration of the point by former UK chancellor Lord Lawson that we cannot expect either output or prices to move in a straight line. However, a continued commodity price increase of recent dimensions could not be so readily explained away and would be a sign of worldwide pressures on capacity. I can still hear critics saying that the true constraint on UK recovery is not inflation but the balance of payments. Let us cut out the scholastic argument about how much this matters and conduct the argument in terms of capacity instead. For what could make it necessary to slow down the recovery well before a reasonable level of employment had been reached, would be a shortage of capacity. Here the former Nedo economists, whose book Britain's Economic Performance was reviewed by Edward Balls in the FT last Thursday, have a point. With the cost indices showing Britain being highly competitive against the rest of the world, further devaluation would just be inflationary. Despite the peculiar left-right coalition which regards such a prospect with indifference, if not joy, continuing depreciation of sterling is not an option for governments even half serious about a 1 to 4 per cent inflation rate. Admittedly, in the Treasury model sterling is not a good predictor of inflation for up to two years ahead. But this is just a question of forecasting techniques. There can be little doubt that, if sterling continued to drop year after year against the world's main currencies, the UK inflation rate would be correspondingly higher. Britain has already had, when it left the ERM, the one-off devaluation which might be benign. Where, however, the ex-Nedo economists are obstinately wrong is in failing to see that the capacity shortage is at bottom a labour market problem. For in the end businesses will install the amount of capacity that they regard as profitable. In the long run extra workers are taken on, and the capacity to employ them installed, if the gains from so doing exceed the extra costs involved. If labour markets were more flexible, it would pay to add capacity and employ more people. (Readers who disagree should write 'to the editor', not to me.) It is at least a good sign that the chancellor is using the present respite from monetary controversy to investigate ideas for improving the workings of the labour markets in a humane way, so that it becomes possible to create low-paid jobs for the less skilled, while topping up their pay by other means.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further evidence of the growth of the almond industry is provided by the fact that the use of almonds as ingredients in new products continues to increase. In 1992, almonds were most often included in all new foods containing tree nuts or peanuts which were introduced on the market. In all, 35% of all new products containing any type of nuts which were introduced in 1992 contained almonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that economic studies of the almond industry also show that advertising is a good use of industry funds. In his 1985 study of the relationship between advertising, risk and domestic sales of almonds, Dr. John Baritelle, a research agricultural economist and a professor at the University of California-Riverside, concluded that advertising has been a good investment for the industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the basis for his study, Baritelle posed the initial question, ``What does the industry get for its advertising dollar, and what would we get if we advertised even more?'' (Non-Technical Statement on Almond Advertising Model and Domestic Sales, at p. 2) (July, 1985). Almond crops for the years 1981 through 1983 were analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study found that for the crop year 1981, when almond production was at an all time high of 408 million pounds and the advertising budget was 10.86 million dollars, total estimated returns on advertising ranged from $1.21 to $4.51 for each dollar spent. This figure included the estimated returns that advertising dollars expended in 1981 would yield in 1982 since the study found that advertising has an impact on per capita sales in the year of expenditure as well as in the following year. Importantly, Baritelle found that even if the 1981 advertising budget had been increased by 25% to $13.58 million, the industry would still have received a total return of at least $1.02 on every dollar spent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1982, when almond production returned to more normal levels and the advertising budget was $8.85 million, total estimated returns on advertising ranged from $1.75 to $6.26 for each dollar spent. Again, this figure included the estimated returns that advertising dollars expended in 1982 would yield in 1983. Additionally, Baritelle noted that even if the 1982 budget had been increased by 75% to $15.49 million, the return to the industry would have been at least $1.04 for every dollar spent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Department notes that in 1983, when almond production was low due to poor weather conditions and the advertising budget was $6.10 million, estimated returns ranged from $2.34 to $8.37. Again, this figure took into account returns that were expected to be realized in 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Wasson went on to state that although investing in the advertisement of almonds is a proven way to increase sales, it is significant that, when compared to other commodity boards, the Almond industry spends relatively little on promotional activities. For instance, the Washington Apple and Almond industries have similar crop sizes_about $1 billion_yet the Almond Board spends substantially less on advertising than the Washington Apple Commission. The Almond Board's promotional budget for the year 1993&hyph;94 was $5.4 million. The Washington Apple Commissions' advertising expenses for that same period was a little over $7.0 million. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also significant that the Almond Board's lengthy process of developing and implementing generic advertising campaigns is consistent with advertising industry norms. Testing and monitoring is performed at various stages in the development and airing of advertisements and follow-up research on their effectiveness is conducted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Different concepts regarding the best method of promoting almonds are also explored. For example, focus group concept testing was conducted prior to the 1993&hyph;94 advertising campaign, and a concept was chosen from four alternatives. Advertisements were then developed, presented to a consumer audience for reaction, and adjustments and refinements were made before a final product was developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After airing an advertisement, consumer awareness is measured since this is a basic measurement of an advertisement's effectiveness. Results of these tests recently showed that the television advertisement approved for use by the Almond Board during the 1993&hyph;94 campaign was very successful. In addition, based on the experience gained from the 1993&hyph;94 campaign, the Board has conducted research to assist in developing a new program for 1994&hyph;95. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Order and its regulations were initiated by the industry for the benefit of the industry. Without majority industry support, the Order, or any part of it, could have been suspended or terminated. Mr. Wasson concluded by stating that the advertising and promotional programs instituted by the Board have received continual majority support since their inception. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department's experience has been that whenever a segment of any industry is ``required'' to do certain things in order to make a program work for all, it is not unusual to find members of the industry who do not agree with any or all aspects of the program. There are some who just do not want to participate in any advertising or promotion programs. In order for a marketing order to be successful, however, participation by everyone is very important. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the decision of the Ninth Circuit, the Department's oversight responsibilities of the almond marketing order were carefully analyzed and considered. It was determined that it is in the best interest of the majority of the almond industry that the advertising and promotion program continue as modified herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

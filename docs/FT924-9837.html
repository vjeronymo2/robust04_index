			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Moscow tries to reassure Baltic states MR Vitaly Churkin, the Russian deputy foreign minister, yesterday sought to reassure leaders of the Baltic states that President Boris Yeltsin's decision to suspend Russian troop withdrawals did not mean a fundamental change in policy. Moscow's intention of pulling out 'has never been questioned,' he told Estonian leaders yesterday. Mr Yeltsin's action has been seen as a protest against the way Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have deprived many ethnic Russians of the vote by insisting on residential, linguistic and other voting qualifications designed to favour the indigenous population. His decree set alarm bells ringing in the Baltic states and caused widespread concern in the west with Nato urging the Russians to continue withdrawal by 1993 as originally agreed. Senior US officials warned the pace of withdrawals would be seen as a litmus test of Russia's good intentions generally. Yesterday Mr Lennart Meri, the Estonian president, said in an interview he had been reassured in talks with Mr Churkin that Russia would not pursue any linkage between human rights extended to its 500,000 strong Russian-speaking population and the withdrawal of Russian troops. Russia, which had 30,000 troops in Estonia at the end of 1991, has in the past year reduced the force to 11,000. However, most of those who left were conscripts, leaving behind officers increasingly resistant to moving - and putting pressure on Moscow to delay their departure. The new Estonian government is anxious not to increase Mr Yeltsin's domestic political problems. Mr Trivimi Velliste, the Estonian foreign minister, said in an interview the 'Yeltsin government is the best Russian government we are ever likely to have'. The Estonian soft diplomatic line comes after months during which relations between the 1.6m strong state and its giant Russian neighbour had grown increasingly tense. Mr Meri said Mr Yeltsin's move to centralise negotiations with the three Baltic states under the presidential security council directed by Mr Yuri Skokov was a sign that Mr Yeltsin is 'making a settlement of the Baltic question a matter of his own prestige'.</p>

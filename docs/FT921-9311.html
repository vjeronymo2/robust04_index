			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: No celebrations over bumper tea crop / A report on the problems facing Sri Lankan growers SRI LANKAN tea production last year reached a record 240.7m kg, beating the 1990 figure of 233m kg. But the bumper crop was no cause for celebration: sales were down by 2 per cent and prices by more than 20 per cent. Mr Michael de Zoysa, chairman of the Ceylon Tea Traders Association, estimates that sales totaled about 225m kg in 1991, down from 230m kg. And Mr Sepala Ilangakoon, president of the island's tea board calculates that in 1991 the average price per kilogram fell from 1990's exceptionally high figure of SLR70.97 (Dollars 1.77) to about R56 (Dollars 1.33 at the depreciated exchange rate). Both Mr Ilangakoon and Mr de Zoysa agree that the chaos in the Soviet Union, a big buyer, Iraq's absence from the Colombo auctions and over-supply were responsible for the drop in prices. 'Two good crops in 1989 and 1990 led to an over-supply situation in exporting countries, while importers were also over-stocked,' says Mr Ilangakoon. The large 1990 crop, coupled with attractive prices, tended to spoil producers, observes Mr de Zoysa. Meanwhile, the government exacerbated the situation by taking measures benefitting private owners of smaller tea estates, who are less able than the two giant state corporations, the SPC and the JEDB, to absorb wage increases. These measures include a reduction in export duties, the tea cess (local tax) and the sales tax. At the same time a new credit scheme by state banks offers factory owners easier credit, with the government paying half the interest for specified projects such as factory modernisation. The government also adapted an idea from Indonesia to make arrangements with both the state-run banks to give foreign currency loans at concessionary interest rates. Some of these relief measures have been particularly appreciated by the island's 170,000 smallholders, who own anything from 10 to 50 acres of tea. The quality of the produce in such estates remains a worry for the government, however, while an ill-disciplined labour force, given to absenteeism, is a particular worry for the small producer. Sri Lankan tea producers were lucky last year, particularly because of the armed separatist revolt in India's state of Assam, where high-grown quality tea, comparable with Sri Lanka's Nuwara Eliya or Uva, is grown. Tea production in Assam has been hit severely by the insurgency. Meanwhile the World Bank has urged the government to 'commercialise' the JEDB and the SPC, the two huge state corporations set up by the 'socialist' government of Mrs Bandaranaike as part of a land reform programme introduced by her Marxist plantations minister. Each individual's holding was limited to 50 acres and the vast acreage surrendered by land owners were placed under two state-run corporations. The labour force was organised by leftwing trade unions controlled by the Marxist parties. Prolonged strikes and wild-cat stoppages for higher wages or on some political issue were quite frequent. The leader of the largest and the most disciplined union was Mr S. Thondaman, now tourism minister in President Premadasa's cabinet. The plantation labour is Indian (rather than Sri Lankan) Tamil. A cheap labour force numbering nearly 1m was imported from south India by British planters and large British tea companies before Sri Lanka became independent in 1948. To please the majority (Buddhist) Sinhalese, the Indian Tamil (Hindu) plantation workers were made 'stateless', under Indian/Sri Lankan agreements. The Indian government agreed to the repatriation of 600,000 while Sri Lanka agreed to take back 400,000 of its citizens. The process is under way but there is still a large number of 'Indian workers' on the plantations. Entirely new dangers now threaten the tea lands. When the Aid Sri Lanka group sponsored by the World Bank, meets in Paris on February 7 one of the major recommendations is the dissolution of the two state corporations. They will be replaced by 22 state-owned companies that will be managed by private companies, local or foreign. Already 110 have passed 'pre-qualification' tests, British, Hong Kong and Malysian companies being approved. But the best known are top Indian groups like Tata Teas, the Chettinad Corporation and Birlas, as well as Brooke Bond and AV Thomas. A fiercely anti-Tamil and anti-Indian Sinhala opposition has raised the bogey of another 'Indian invasion' into the central highlands at a time when the north and east are ravaged by the separatist Tamil Tiger insurgency. The local press has highlighted a daring payroll robbery on the tea plantations recently, for which the press claim the Tigers were responsible. And there have been reports of the Tigers recruiting Tamil youth on the plantations to open a new front. The spectre of Assam is haunting Sri Lanka's green tea lands.</p>

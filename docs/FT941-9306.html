			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Survey of Housing Associations (7): First breaks in the ice pack - Andrew Taylor weighs the building industry's debt to social housing It has been a slow thaw rather than a rapid recovery. The icy grip that has held the housing market in recession began to loosen its hold last year, but progress remains slow. Sales to owner occupiers and the prices they have paid have edged up during the past 14 months but builders remain glad to uncover any market they can find for their developments. Housing associations have been among the most enthusiastic buyers. Last year saw record sales by the private builders to associations. These mainly supply rented housing to the poor, infirm and disabled, an area euphemistically dubbed social housing. Associations, since the 1988 Housing Act, have become the principal purchasers of social housing taking over from local authorities which have become buyers of associations' services rather than providers of housing in their own right. At the same time the government has expected associations to raise more of their finance from the private sector. This switch in emphasis coincided with the deepest recession in the private sector housing market for more than half a century. The growth of housing association purchases has cushioned some of the decline in total sales. The number of homes annually acquired by associations in England trebled from 20,889 to 62,137 between 1989-90 and 1992-93. Associations are expected to have purchased nearly 60,000 more homes in the current financial year. The proportion of homes acquired from private sector builders has risen: from about 55 per cent in the mid 1980s to 85 per cent currently. These purchases have enabled private builders to raise much needed cash by selling expertise as well as developments and land. These otherwise might have sat in their balance sheets, unwanted by private sector home owners, and attracting high interest payments on the money borrowed to develop them. The Government's decision to provide associations with a windfall grant of more than Pounds 700m in November 1992 to buy unsold properties proved a boon to housebuilders. These had just seen the bottom kicked out of the private housing market after sterling left the ERM. The grant had to be spent by the end of the following March. The Pounds 591m made available in England and Wales acquired more than 18,000 homes of which more than 9,000 were properties originally built for sale to owners. The speed with which the money had to be spent meant that associations had to buy a large proportion of completed properties. More usually associations buy land themselves, sometimes from housebuilders, which they then employ under under contract, to develop the site. The Housing Corporation, which administers government grants to associations, estimates that about 70 per cent of homes purchased by associations will have been acquired under design and build contracts with the private sector. Less than 5 per cent of purchases are likely to have been new homes which have failed to find a private sector buyer. Mr Derek King, the corporation's director managing the investment programme, says: 'We are sensitive to complaints from owners who have bought homes on private sector developments only to find that part of the developments is being sold to a housing association. This is only a small part of our business but we prefer it when owners are told from the start that a development is going to be of mixed tenancies. In practice we have had very frew problems.' Private builders like contract work. They receive a guaranteed cash flow for virtually no capital investment. Mr Alan Cherry, chairman of Countryside Properties, one of the most successful builders of homes for associations, says: 'Housing association work very quickly generates a positive cash flow so there is relatively little capital employed in the process. 'Even though it would appear that some tenders are won on 2.5 per cent net profit the return on capital should be very good. Most builders will approach this activity on the basis of return on capital and, looked at this way, housing association work can be just as rewarding as speculative developments.' Builders might expect net profits of 10-15 per cent on developments built for sale to private owners but the company could expect to have a lot of capital tied up in land and work in progress. Countryside has recently signed long-term building contracts with several groups of housing associations including a three year project to develop 1,800 homes over three years on 24 sites for South Thames Housing Partnership in consortium with three housing associations. Large scale projects such as these enable builders to offer substantial economies of scale in terms of design, building and legal costs, he says. Pressure on government spending means, however, that the amount of grant administered by the Housing Corporation is due to fall over the next few years from Pounds 1.86bn in 1993-94 to Pounds 1.51bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.48bn in 1995-96. Housebuilders can also expect the resurgence in private sector housing to continue. Even so they are expected to maintain their interest in housing association work which has become a permanent feature of many businesses, providing cash flow irrespective of market conditions elsewhere.</p>

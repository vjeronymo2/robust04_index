			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Bosnian Serb leader signs peace pact MR FIKRET ABDIC, a local Moslem leader in Bosnia's northwest, yesterday signed a peace agreement with Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic in an attempt to undermine Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia. In Belgrade for the first time since war erupted 18 months ago, Mr Abdic and his one-time rival Mr Karadzic signed a joint declaration which Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said 'brought peace to half of former Bosnia-Hercegovina' and could be a step towards the endorsement of the Geneva partition plan. Mr Abdic yesterday celebrated the 'recognition' of Western Bosnia, even though he controls just one quarter of the self-proclaimed autonomous region. Bosnian Government forces loyal to Mr Izetbegovic hold most of the region, surrounded by Serb rebels in Croatia and Bosnia. Mr Abdic appears to be holding out hope that yesterday's signing will pave the way or military support from his Serb neighbours. Mr Mate Boban, head of the Croat statelet in Bosnia, on Thursday signed a similar agreement in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, with Mr Abdic.</p>

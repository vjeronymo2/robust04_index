			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Volvo renews commitment to merger with Renault VOLVO yesterday issued a strong restatement of its commitment to merge its car and truck operations with state-owned Renault of France. The Swedish motor group said 'further clarification' was expected shortly from Paris to help it overcome a shareholder revolt. 'It is our conviction that the transaction with Renault is industrially and commercially correct and should be implemented,' said Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, after a board meeting in Stockholm. This was the first full board meeting at Volvo since the company was forced to postpone a shareholder vote on the merger because of the strength of opposition. Swedish institutions have demanded that Volvo win stronger commitments from the French government on the timetable for the privatisation of Renault and on excluding Volvo from the terms of a golden share the state intends to retain as a way of blocking any hostile takeover of the merged company. Mr Gyll, who this week held talks with Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said discussions were under way 'to clarify the (merger) terms'. The French government has ruled out changing the terms of the merger agreement but is considering issuing a clearer timetable for privatisation and may be prepared to give written guarantees concerning the use of the golden share. Volvo officials made clear yesterday they would press ahead with the rescheduled shareholders' meeting on December 7. The company believes it can still win a clear majority for the deal. Volvo this week brought in analysts and consultants it used in its own assessment of the merger to impress on shareholders the bleak future facing Volvo's car operations if it does not proceed with the Renault deal. 'Further substantial investments are required for Volvo, single-handedly, to be able to achieve the profit levels that are demanded long-term in the automotive industry,' Mr Gyll said. Volvo, the prospective junior partner in the merger, showed a robust return to profit in results for the first nine months, published yesterday. Renault pre-tax profits fell steeply.

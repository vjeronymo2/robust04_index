A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said Andreatta  and  Stoltenberg expressed great satisfaction with the accord reached  in Washington for the formation of a confederation in  violence-torn Bosnia and view this as a positive turning point  in the negotiating process.    Italy, the communique recalled, has actively favored  rapprochement between Sarajevo and Zagreb and sought to further  dialogue between Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the  Bosnian Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, at the time of a  visit to Rome by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, on  February 3, for talks with Andreatta.    The Italian minister, who has directly followed developments  in this area through meetings and contacts with Croatian and  Muslim authorities, agreed today with Stoltenberg on the point  that the institutional framework now crystallizing between the  two sides could become a fundamental stage for the settlement of  the entire set of disputes pertaining to ex-Yugoslavia.    Andreatta and the international mediator also stressed the  need to maintain the pace of political and diplomatic  initiatives in the successive phases of the accord. For this  purpose, greater commitment will be required to win a deeper  involvement of Bosnian Serbs so as to move on to a global  political solution to the conflict.    The importance of strengthening consultations among the  European Union, the United States and Russia, for the purpose of  consolidating the coordination of international actions, will  also be indispensable for achieving results, within the  framework of the Geneva Conference, acceptable to all sides,  said the two men.    At the end of their meeting, Andreatta invited Stoltenberg  to  Trieste for a meeting of the Central European Initiative,  scheduled for Friday [4 March] and Saturday. Expected for this  assembly are the Bosnian and Croatian foreign ministers for  discussion on the details of the accord reached today in  Washington.</p>

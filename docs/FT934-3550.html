			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Confidence on future as Eldridge Pope doubles Shares of Eldridge Pope rose 9p to 134p yesterday after the USM-traded retailer, brewer and wine shipper announced near-doubled annual profits. In an upbeat statement, Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said: 'A fundamental restructuring is now being achieved . . . there are now considerably brighter prospects for the company.' The full benefits of the trading alliance with Carlsburg-Tetley will be felt from the spring of next year, he said. Although turnover dipped to Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 43.1m) in the 12 months to September 30 - reflecting the disposal of the beer wholesaling business to Carlsburg-Tetley in July - an 11 per cent upturn in operating profits, coupled with sharply reduced inter-est charges, left the pre-tax line 95 per cent higher at Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 901,000 restated for FRS 3). The outcome took in a net surplus of Pounds 252,000 on the restructuring, comprising a profit on sale of goodwill of Pounds 4m less a series of write-offs and provisions. The company is also writing down the balance sheet carrying value of its main site in Dorchester by Pounds 2.6m, redu-cing total net assets to Pounds 57.6m, against Pounds 59.1m. Borrowings fell from Pounds 17m to Pounds 8.85m, leaving gearing at 15.4 per cent. After a tax credit of Pounds 51,000 (Pounds 136,000), resulting from losses and reliefs in previous years - set to continue for another two years at least, Mr Pope said - earnings per share improved from 5p to 8.6p. A proposed final dividend of 2.15p brings the total for the year to 3.55p (3.25p). Mr Pope reiterated that 'restoring the dividend to its former level and beyond is a top priority'.</p>

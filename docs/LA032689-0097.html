			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT LOOKS AT WAYS TO HALT INCREASE IN GANG ASSAULTS, KILLINGS  </P> <P> Alarmed by an increase in gang assaults and killings, the City Council is  reviewing several proposals, including adding more sheriff's deputies to a gang  detail, expanding an anti-gang program in the schools, and counseling families  of suspected gang members.  </P> <P> The entire project would cost more than $1 million and require an increase in  taxes, City Manager Bill Holt said. The proposals were drawn up by the city  staff and submitted to the council last week. The council is expected to  discuss the proposals further at its next meeting April 4.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Going to Make an Effort'  </P> <P> "We have got to try something. We're going to make an effort," Mayor Charles R.  Weldon said.  </P> <P> Weldon said he was "personally and emotionally" affected by the lastest gang  killings in which two teen-age boys died in a drive-by shooting Feb. 27.  </P> <P> Weldon said he knew the family of one of the boys, John Adrian Borrego, 16, and  had coached one of his older brothers in Little League baseball several years  ago. "I was moved. This was not right. It should not happen," Weldon said.  </P> <P> Borrego and Saul Martinez, 14, were killed and three other youths wounded. The  shooting occurred in the 13900 block of Downey Avenue, a few doors from  Borrego's home. A group of youths were talking when shots were fired from a  small red sports car, sheriff's deputies said.  </P> <P> Gang-related killings and assaults have risen in the past couple of years  throughout the county, including Paramount, according to statistics from the  Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The Downey Avenue killing was the fifth gang-related murder in Paramount since  June, 1988. There were three such slayings in fiscal 1987-88 ending June 30,  and one in 1986-87. Gang-related assaults have shown a steady increase, from 15  in 1986-87 to 27 in 1987-88, to 57 since last June.  </P> <P> The staff submitted more than 30 anti-gang measures in response to a council  request after the February drive-by shooting, Weldon said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3,000 Have Been Taught  </P> <P> These included expanding an anti-gang program in the public schools to all  grades from kindergarten through 12th grade. The existing program is limited to  fifth, sixth and seventh grades of the Paramount Unified School District. The  program, called Alternative to Gang Membership Program, has been a part of the  regular curriculum since 1982.  </P> <P> Patrick West, a deputy city manager, said more than 3,000 students have gone  through the program, which covers the problems and dangers of belonging to a  gang. The program expansion would cost more than $122,000 to hire additional  personnel the first year.  </P> <P> Another program calls for expanding the special two-member gang detail to four  deputies, which would cost nearly $200,000.  </P> <P> Under another proposal, a total of $75,000 would be earmarked for hiring  counselors to work with gang members and their families. "We know that some  gang members have parents and grandparents who were in gangs. This program  would try and break this pattern," Councilman Manuel E. Gullien said.  </P> <P> The staff also suggested that prison visits be scheduled for children "to be  scared straight" by criminals. "We would get the permission of their parents  before locking them up with criminals who would talk to them about going  straight," City Manager Holt said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Future Tax Increase  </P> <P> The city has about $200,000 in its budget that could be used to expand the  anti-gang program in schools or establish the counseling program for families  of gang members, Holt said. But taxes would have to be increased to pay for  these and other programs in future years, he told the council.  </P> <P> The council could consider increasing business license fees; levying a refinery  tax on Paramount Petroleum, the city's only refinery; charging an admissions  tax at the Paramount Swap Meet, and increasing dog license fees.  </P> <P> "We need time to think about these proposals. We need to go to the public and  see if people are willing to fund them," Weldon said.  </P> <P> The council is expected to get the public's reaction at the April meeting,  Weldon said.  </P></p>

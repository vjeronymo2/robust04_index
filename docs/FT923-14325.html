			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Saudi banker in BCCI case quits SHEIKH Khalid bin Mahfouz yesterday resigned as the chief operating officer of National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia's biggest and best-connected bank, saying he would devote his 'full energies' to fighting fraud charges brought against him in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair. Sheikh Khalid's resignation comes less than a week after he and a London-based associate were indicted in New York on charges that they had schemed between 1985 and 1991 to defraud depositors, regulators and auditors of the collapsed BCCI. The indictment, announced by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, alleges that Sheikh Khalid and Mr Haroon Kahlon, an associate, fraudulently obtained more than Dollars 300m from BCCI depositors and other customers. The charges are diplomatically sensitive, because of the prominence of the bin Mahfouz family in Saudi Arabia, where NCB is considered to have close ties to the royal family. Sheikh Khalid reacted angrily, vowing to fight the indictment and calling the charges 'completely unwarranted'. In New York yesterday, an aide to Mr Morgenthau noted that NCB had not been indicted in the BCCI affair, but he said the bank remained under investigation. Sheikh Mohammed bin Mahfouz, chairman of NCB's management committee and Sheikh Khalid's brother, said in a statement from the bank's Jeddah head office he had 'reluctantly accepted' the resignation, which he called 'a sacrifice he believes is in the best interests of the bank'. Sheikh Mohammed will take operational control of NCB. The statement quoted Sheikh Khalid saying 'he cannot allow the continuing smooth operation of the bank to be interfered with in any way' as a result of the indictment. 'We are fully confident of Sheikh Khalid's innocence,' the statement said. 'God willing, he will be vindicated.' Sheikh Khalid's resignation clouds the immediate outlook for NCB, which holds around a third of Saudi Arabia's total bank deposits, claimed assets in 1991 of SR82.3bn (Dollars 22bn) and is widely viewed as the Saudi royal family's bank, but which has produced no full financial figures since 1989. Capital Intelligence (CI), the Arab world's leading bank rating agency, last month suspended NCB's rating on the ground that it had produced no accounts for 1990 and 1991 and said in a circular to clients that the bank's ownership structure, as an unlimited liability partnership, was 'inappropriate for its size'. The bank, which prizes the confidentiality afforded by its position as Saudi Arabia's sole privately-held bank, is majority owned by the bin Mahfouz family, with the kingdom's wealthy al-Kaaki family holding the remainder. NCB closed its London branch in May, justifying the move on cost grounds. However, the Bank of England is widely believed to have been uncomfortable that the bank, which had a loan book worth some Dollars 1bn in London, had released no figures since 1989.

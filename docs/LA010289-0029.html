			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOLITION IS STOPPED ON HISTORIC MCKINLEY HOUSE  </P> <P> The Italian Renaissance-styled McKinley Mansion, which is on Los Angeles'  official list of historic-cultural monuments, was saved from the wrecker's ball  over the weekend after a city building inspector arrived on the scene and  declared that a demolition permit had been issued by mistake.  </P> <P> Contractors hired by owner Jason Lee had been at work an hour or more and did  what could be thousands of dollars in damage before building inspector Michael  D. Tharpe ordered them to stop demolishing the $4.5-million property at 301 S.  Lafayette Park Place on Saturday morning.  </P> <P> By the time neighbors' complaints and police inquiries had brought out the  building inspector, the wreckers had smashed the front patio superstructure,  wrecked the adjacent arbors and made a number of gashes in the main part of the  house, including exposing the wood frame on the southwest corner.  </P> <P> Lee said Sunday that his contractors had obtained the demolition permit from  the city Friday afternoon, and he believed that he was fully authorized to  destroy the 13,000-square-foot house, built in 1917 and named for the late  mortuary operator, Maytor H. McKinley. Lee wants to remove the house to make  way for a 140-unit apartment house.  </P> <P> However, an official of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Christy McAvoy, said a  demolition permit cannot legitimately be issued, pending completion of an  environmental impact report and exploration of alternative uses for the  property.  </P> <P> "The owners were aware of that, but they evidently took advantage of the  situation in the city offices on the eve of a holiday," she said. "The permits  division may have been shorthanded. These properties are supposed to be clearly  flagged in the city's files, however, so I really don't know how they got the  permit.  </P> <P> "I'm very saddened by the owners' action. We had a substantial communication  with them, and the situation had been fully explained to them. I'm deeply  disappointed that they chose to do this."  </P> <P> Lee, who said he has owned the property for about seven months, said he had  grown tired of waiting for the city to act and told his contractors this fall  to see what they could do about getting a demolition permit.  </P> <P> He said that the city's building inspector had told him he was stopping the  demolition only until Tuesday, when the city would decide what to do next.  </P> <P> Lee showed the permit his contractors had obtained to a reporter Sunday. He  also displayed a city report saying that the Cultural Heritage Board had lifted  a 180-day stay on issuing a demolition permit last March and said he knew  nothing about any requirement for an environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Present at the house Sunday was another man, Rod Daniels, a San Fernando Valley  developer who said he has been seeking permission to move the house to  Chatsworth and that he would like to live in it. It has also been proposed that  the house be left where it is and used as an AIDS hospice.  </P></p>

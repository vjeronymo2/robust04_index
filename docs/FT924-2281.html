			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Kidnap raises security stakes in Israel: Fundamentalists who seized policeman demand release of leader THE ISRAELI government is facing its severest security challenge since taking power in July following the kidnap of a paramilitary police officer yesterday by an Islamic fundamentalist group demanding the release of its jailed leader. The kidnapping inside Israel of the Border Police officer came on a weekend when three Palestinians and a soldier were killed in the continuing surge of armed attacks and violent demonstrations coinciding with last week's fifth anniversary of the intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule in the occupied territories. The government's reaction to the abduction, in the central city of Lod, will be closely scrutinised by the opposition Likud party and its right-wing allies which had already strongly criticised Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, over the recent spate of violence. Qassam, military wing of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement, announced it was holding Sgt-Major Nissim Toledano and would kill him if Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, jailed for life in 1991 for ordering the killing of Palestinian collaborators, was not freed by 9pm local time last night. The deadline passed without word from the kidnappers, who were the subject of an intense manhunt by the security forces. In an interview from prison, Mr Yassin said he hoped the kidnappers would give the authorities more time to respond. The government, however, said it viewed the kidnapping with the 'utmost gravity' and warned the perpetrators against harming Sgt-Major Toledano. Qassam also claimed responsibility for death a soldier in an armed ambush near the West Bank town of Hebron yesterday. It was the fifth such killing by Qassam in less than a week and brought to 24 the number of soldiers killed during the uprising. Hamas, which strongly opposes the current Middle East peace talks, has grown in strength since it was founded by Sheikh Yassin exactly five years ago. In the Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were shot dead and more than 100 injured in clashes with troops yesterday and on Saturday. Another was killed in the West Bank. Mr Moshe Katsav, leader of Likud's parliamentary group, said there was a direct link between the government's relatively conciliatory stance in the peace talks and the rise in violence. But Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister, said only a political solution would end the violence.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM appreciates the commenter's suggestion, but does not believe that further proposed rules are needed or that amendments to the final rules should be made to reflect the commenter's proposal. The AVS Office will work with anyone at any time, including when there is no pending permitting action, to answer questions and make appropriate corrections to ownership and control information in the database. Data in the system is available on-line to any interested party, and the AVS Office will provide print-outs of AVS data on request. The AVS Office will also provide training to interested parties on the use of the system. The AVS Office routinely works with major companies to insure that their ownership and control information in the system is kept current. Given all these factors, there is no ``risk of permit denial'' necessarily involved in the resolution of an ownership and control link. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, applicants and permittees are deemed to be aware of the law. The ownership and control rules were published in October, 1988. Since that time, applicants and permittees could reasonably be expected to be aware of the regulations and could have acted to cure any outstanding violations or to resolve any erroneous links in the AVS which would form the basis for a permit denial or revocation. Thus, any ``unfair surprise'' to applicants or permittees posited by the commenter is not an actual problem. Accordingly, it is entirely legitimate to deny permits to such applicants or permittees when they are linked to violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, permit applicants are required to provide full ownership and control information at the time of permit application. See 30 CFR 778.13; 778.14. Permittees are required to update relevant ownership and control information in a timely manner. See 30 CFR 774.17. Thus, the proposed remedy offered by the commenter is already a requirement of the rules. Finally, in the unlikely event that a person has been unfairly subjected to permit denial by the process, that person could still seek temporary relief from OHA in accordance with procedures governing such relief provided by OHA's and OSM's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Primacy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Industry and State commenters asserted a number of concerns relating to the impact of the proposed rules upon the primacy of States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, industry commenters argued that the proposed rules and the AVS itself impermissibly substitute Federal authority for State authority in the permitting process. They argued that, under the principle of State primacy, once a State's program has been approved by OSM, the State should have sole authority for making decisions with respect to permit issuance, including the determination of ownership and control matters. They asserted that requiring a State to query the AVS before making a permitting decision takes the decision out of the hands of the State and transfers substantive control of the decision to OSM which controls the content of the AVS. As evidence of this Federal control, industry commenters cited, with disapproval, provisions of the proposed rules which provide that challenges of ownership and control information on the AVS must be made to OSM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees. First, in the cases of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Wildlife Federation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 88&hyph;3117 (D.D.C.), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lujan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  No. 81&hyph;2134 (D.D.C.), coal industry interests advanced similar primacy arguments attacking the agency's ownership and control rules published in 1988. OSM responded to those arguments in detail demonstrating that the ownership and control rules support State programs, rather than undermine them. Copies of these briefs are being placed in the Administrative Record of this rulemaking. OSM incorporates the arguments advanced by the Department in those briefs herein by reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the purpose of AVS is to assist, rather than to undermine, the States in the exercise of their primary authority for the implementation of their approved programs. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act require that the regulatory authority deny a permit to an applicant where ``information available'' to the regulatory authority indicates that any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant is currently in violation'' of the Act or certain other governmental laws. See section 510(c) of the Act. In a State which has an approved program to regulate surface coal mining operations pursuant to section 503 of the Act, neither OSM nor AVS decides whether or not to issue a permit to an applicant in that State. The State regulatory authority is the decisionmaker. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contrary to the commenter's assertions, however, the Federal government has an ongoing role in this system of State primacy. The Act and Federal regulations require that OSM assist the States in the implementation of their programs under the Act and that OSM provide oversight of the State regulatory authorities' activities. See sections 102(g), 201(c), 503, 504, 505, and 521 of the Act; 30 CFR parts 732, 733, and 842. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

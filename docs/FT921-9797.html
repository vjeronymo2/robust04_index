			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Big market predicted for private mail service GOVERNMENT PLANS in the Citizen's Charter to open postal services to competition will create a Pounds 500m market for letter services, according to independent research published yesterday. Dr Peter Rickard, former director of the Royal Mail letters network, says the largest potential market will come from the proposal to reduce the present Pounds 1 minimum postage fee which an independent letter service is obliged to charge. The market for a more reliable next-day letter service could exceed Pounds 200m, but only if the monopoly limit is brought down very close to the first-class price, he says. A highly reliable and profitable next-day service could be provided for business-to-business mail at a modest price premium to first-class post. Dr Rickard said yesterday that the threat to Royal Mail from private-sector competition was real. But even if competitors built up a Pounds 500m market this would still represent less than one-sixth of current mail volumes. Losing one sixth of current mail volume would require Royal Mail to increase prices by about 5 per cent. This would bring the price of delivery in real terms to the level of five years ago. Letter volumes had grown by 56 per cent since 1983 whereas postage rates had fallen by 14 per cent in real terms. It was extremely unlikely that all Royal Mail's first-class business-to-business mail would be lost, Dr Rickard said. The research indicates that if the loss was less than 3 per cent of the total mail volumes each year - equivalent to the current loss of mail to licensed document exchange operators - and allowing for general growth in the market, Royal Mail's total volumes need not fall at all. This would allow it to maintain economies of scale and avoid the need for postal price increases.

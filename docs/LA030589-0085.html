			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HITTING NAIL ON THE BISHOP  </P> <P> For those of us who have grown weary of reading totally irrelevant accounts of  what prominent women in the news are wearing, it was indeed inspiring to learn  from Betty Cuniberti ("The Bishop of Controversy," Feb. 15) that Barbara  Harris, the first female bishop of the Episcopal Church, has "manicured mauve  nails."  </P> <P> Next will we know whether Bishop Tutu bites his and the Pope prefers clippers  to scissors? What is the View section calling this series: Manicures and  Morals? Christianity and the Cuticle?  </P> <P> CAROLYN A. WIDENER  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

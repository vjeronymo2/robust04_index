			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Travel: In Ceausescu's broken footsteps - Romania is free, but David Pilling finds it is still a depressing place to visit or live in BUCHAREST is in a bad way. The Intercontinental Hotel has no coffee and many restaurants have little or no food. Buildings in the centre of town, many of them once quite handsome, are coated in thick grime. Some are peppered with bullet holes. The city smells of cabbage and cheap tobacco. My taxi driver, on the way into town from the airport, told me that things were better now. I was glad I had not come before. He said he was now free to travel abroad, only he had no money with which to do so. He could say what he wanted now. He said 'Ceausescu' and made an obscene gesture, removing both hands from the steering wheel and causing the cab to veer alarmingly in the near-deserted road. Bucharest boasts very few private vehicles. Indeed, it has very little to boast about at all. I might have guessed things were going to be bad in Romania as early as Stansted airport. 'You're flight is due to leave on time, sir,' the check in girl gushed, as though this were an achievement. I was flying with Romania's national airline, Tarom. The aircraft did not leave on time. It left two hours late, but I was amazed it got off the ground at all. The inside of the aircraft was kitted out like a troop carrier, with seat coverings of coarse green material and stewardesses who looked so miserable I later decided they must have sampled some of the inflight food. My knees were somewhere near my chin for the duration of the flight, but I felt privileged to have a seat belt. Many adjacent seats were not so well equipped. The fun really began at Bucharest airport with a mad scramble to push through customs. Later, I wondered why everyone was so keen to get in. I tried to change Dollars 100 at the airport bank. The clerk, a dishevelled man in his forties with an unkempt moustache and greying sideburns that seemed to sprout from his ears, thrust the note back at me and told me I would not need to change more than Dollars 20. I tried to convert the sum he had suggested but he lost interest, telling me to change my money in town where I could get a better rate. His friend, the taxi driver, would take me into the centre for Dollars 5. The driver assumed I was Russian at first. 'Gavareesh pa Rusky?' he kept growling in an insinuating sort of way. I finally convinced him that I spoke English, a language over which he held about the same command as I do over Russian. Nevertheless, when someone wants to tell you something, they generally find a way. On the approach to Bucharest the driver pointed to a statue of Lenin. All that remained was a pair of boots, standing surrealistically on a concrete podium. The driver wheezed and chortled hysterically. 'Rooshian army,' he said later, indicating a now-derelict strip of land where barracks must once have stood. He found this highly amusing too. His passing shot was to drive by the great residence Ceausescu had built for himself, a chalk-white edifice with Greek pillars and, according to my guide, 5,000 rooms. The driver said the buildings around were erected in such a way that, from the air, they spelled out Ceausescu's name. Many parts of Bucharest were bulldozed to make way for the late dictator's fanatical construction plans. I checked into a musty hotel and set out in search of food. Street lights go off at about 9.30pm to save power, so I spent the evening wandering around the dim and derelict streets looking for a restaurant prepared to cook me a meal. A guide book from pre-revolution days directed me to a place where I could get 'great food' for 40 lei. One of the several waitresses - there were no diners - ushered me into the kitchen with tremendous excitement. There I was treated to the sight of a fat women in a greasy apron waving a gristly piece of sausage about as though it were a pools-winner's cheque. I tried to look enthusiastic and ordered a plate, a treat that set me back 400 lei and sent me to the Intercontinental for all subsequent meals. My next day I spent 'sightseeing.' I wandered down the city's fine boulevards. I found a couple of tiny but richly decorated churches. I visited some department stores where I discovered why nearly everyone appeared to have bought their clothes at a 1970s jumble sale. I sat in some of the city's fine parks, still beautifully maintained in spite of everything. I went to the main railway station where a man with a toasted-sandwich maker was doing a roaring trade. I tried to visit the art gallery, but it was closed. I visited a pizzeria. Unfortunately it was open. After one bite of its fare I dashed back to the Intercontinental. The next day I met a young doctor and her boyfriend. Things were awful, they said. Life, they had no doubt, would get better now that Ceausescu had gone, but change would not come soon enough for them. The girl said she would go to Sweden and find someone to marry her. Her boyfriend did not look too hurt, such being the decisions Romanians must make if they are to get on in the world. As a doctor she earned Dollars 50 a month, more or less what my visa for Romania had cost me. She spoke Romanian, English, French and a smattering of Swedish. She had never been abroad. My plane lifted off the tarmac a few days later for my return to London. Unfortunately my luggage was not so blessed and had to be bundled on to another Tarom flight to catch up with me 24 hours after. My rucksack has thus spent longer in Romania than I have. I plan to take it somewhere sunny as soon as possible.</p>

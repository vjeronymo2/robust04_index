			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK steelmakers question aid plan for Spain BRITISH steel industry officials are mounting a campaign to force changes in a European Commission-backed restructuring scheme for Sidenor, the loss-making Spanish special steels producer. Mr Ian Rodgers, director for international affairs at the British Iron and Steel Producers Association (Bispa), will today launch a strong attack on the plan, which he claims would harm private unsubsidised competitors and is, anyway, not viable. The Commission had hoped that the restructuring of Sidenor, along with that of Freital in Germany, would be approved at the last EC industry ministers' meeting in Brussels on September 21. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, wanted the two relatively minor subsidy cases resolved to send a clear signal of intent to reach a solution on the larger cases - involving CSI in Spain, Ilva in Italy and Ekostahl in eastern Germany. But the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and France said they wanted more time to study the proposals, and the UK argued that all the subsidy cases should be agreed together. Since then, UES Steels, a private competitor of Sidenor, has announced it is closing its Templeborough plant in Rotherham, northern England, with the loss of 260 jobs. UES blamed excess capacity for engineering steels, which was being artificially kept in place by state subsidies. Mr Rodgers says the Commission had made no attempt to reassess the viability of the Sidenor scheme, drawn up last year, in the light of present market conditions and Sidenor's recent operating performance. He is expected to tell a meeting of the European coal and steel community consultative committee in Luxembourg today that the amount of aid proposed has increased by 13 per cent to Pta80bn (Pounds 406m) since the plan was drawn up. According to Bispa, Sidenor's domestic turnover fell by 33 per cent in the first half of this year, and orders in export markets are being won as a result of 'ruthless' price cutting that has only been made possible by subsidies. The association says sales targets assumed in Sidenor's 'viability' plan are unachievable without further price cutting, and says the next industry ministers' meeting in November should not authorise aid without significant additional closures.</p>

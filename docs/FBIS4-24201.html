			<p>BFN     [Text] There's growing concern in right-wing circles to the  proposed truth commission. A group of former police and defense  force generals have called on ANC members to disclose their role  in what they termed past acts of terror. The newly-appointed  deputy defense minister and former MK [Spear of the Nation --  ANC military wing] intelligence chief, Ronnie Kasrils, has  dismissed the nine generals' call as a red herring. Ronel van  Zyl reports.    [Begin recording] [Van Zyl] Freedom Front leader Constand  Viljoen, the only one of the group who is in Parliament,  seriously questions the merits of the truth commission.    [Viljoen] We in this regard feel that it is necessary for us  in the interest of our own people, but also in the general  interest of the country, for peace for our country, that we  should warn the people against such a commission which might  have the opposite effect which the ANC has in mind about the  commission.    [Van Zyl] He said equal treatment should be meted out to  anyone who committed crimes in the political struggle. Mr.  Kasrils, who was sworn in as deputy defense minister this  afternoon, described the general's statement as totally  irrelevant.    [Kasrils] We stood for indemnity. We provided the  information. Our slate is clean. That's why we've been  insisting those who served apartheid must do likewise.    [Van Zyl] Mr. Kasrils' appointment follows a request from  Defense Minister Joe Modise for additional senior personnel to  run the Defense Ministry. Mr. Modise has indicated that he's  prepared to testify before the truth commission if it's expected  of him. [end recording]</p>

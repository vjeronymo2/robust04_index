			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ARIZONA;  </P> <P> REORGANIZED NAVAJO ELECT A PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Navajo voters chose Peterson Zah to lead the tribe as the first elected  successor to the disgraced former chairman, Peter MacDonald.  </P> <P> "The first order of business will be to put the tribe back together," Zah told  supporters at Window Rock, Ariz., after he defeated interim President Leonard  Haskie 46% to 32%. Zah, 52, was tribal chairman from 1983 until 1987. He will  serve as president in a reorganized system of government. The post of chairman  has been eliminated. Navajo election officials disqualified MacDonald, 61, from  the ballot after a tribal court convicted him on bribery, ethics and conspiracy  charges last month.  </P></p>

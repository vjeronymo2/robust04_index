			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Modest gain for dollar THE DOLLAR appreciated about  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, but was pushed down again after Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary Designate, said the US had to reassert leadership in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, writes James Blitz. Mr Bentsen may have depressed the US currency at his nomination hearings, because his statement gave some strength to recent speculation that the G7 might act to put a cap on the recent rise in the dollar at a time when the US is trying to boost its trade position. At the start of European trading, the dollar made modest headway against the German currency, partly due to the relative calm in the exchange rate mechanism. The US unit peaked at DM1.6350 in London, also helped by continuing tensions in the Middle East, which tend to be positive for the dollar. However, an analyst sugg-ested that the dollar will probably be confined to tight range-trading in the run-up to Mr Bill Clinton's inaugur-ation as US President later this month. There is growing uncertainty as to whether Mr Clinton will announce a major fiscal package at the start of his presidency to stimulate the economy. The US currency's recent gains had partly been the result of expectations that a fiscal stimulus would bring higher US interest rates, but recent signs of strength in the US economy are starting to undermine this view. The dollar ended in London slightly firmer at DM1.6320 compared with a previous close of DM1.6305. It finished unchanged from the London level in New York at DM1.6320. The D-Mark again showed little new strength inside the European exchange rate mechanism. The French franc rose to a six-week high against the German currency, helped by news that France's inflation rate was at its lowest level since 1956. With the year-on-year inflation level down to 2.0 per cent, the franc moved as high as FFr3.3924 per D-Mark, a point not seen since the end of November. However, the currency later lost some ground to the D-Mark, finishing at FFr3.395, up  1/2 centime on balance. An analyst pointed out that the low inflation figure makes short-term interest rates in France, which are still between 11 and 12 per cent, look very punishing. There was less tension surrounding the Irish punt, which traded above its floors against the Belgian franc and Dutch guilder for the second day running. The only significant loser yesterday was sterling, which suffered a 2-pfennig fall against the German currency to close at DM2.5125. Speculative selling orders from Scandinavia were cited as a factor behind the currency's fall. After last week's 6-pfennig rally against the D-Mark, a technical correction was to be expected.</p>

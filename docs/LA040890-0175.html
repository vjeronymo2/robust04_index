			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: USDA PROVIDES DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES FOR CURING, DRYING, COOKING  MEATS  </P> <P> DEAR BUTCHER: Your recipe for beef jerky, which appeared at least a year ago  and which I have made often, produces excellent jerky. However, at some point  in my Food Guide readings, I came across a discussion of "safe cooking  temperatures" and so called the United States Department of Agriculture to ask  them about the slow drying at 150-degrees method. To my dismay, they did not  recommend cooking any meat at lower than 325 and further to cook the meat to an  internal temperature of 160.  </P> <P>  -- A READER  </P> <P> DEAR READER: Our government takes such very good care of us. If we listened to  and adhered to all government recommendations, I'm quite sure that death would  be optional, 160 degrees, indeed. I'll have my steak rare and 130 degrees,  thank you.  </P> <P> Next time you call the USDA, try to talk to a food scientist about curing and  drying, not cooking. Curing and drying are two of the oldest methods of food  preservation known to man, and they have served us well. Enjoy your jerky.  </P> <P> For more good sound scientific information on the subject, I recommend: "A  Complete Guide to Home Meat Curing" available from Morton Salt Co., P.O. Box  355, Argo, Ill. 60501. The price is $1 plus 25 cents, shipping and handling.  Also recommended: "How to Dry Foods" by Deanna DeLong (HP Books).  </P> <P>  -- MERLE  </P> <P> DEAR BUTCHER: This nutrition business certainly is out of hand and a pain in  the neck. I am a retired old lady in my mid-'80s and terribly tired of hearing  about cholesterol and what foods are good for you or terribly bad for you.  </P> <P> I remember how in years long ago conversation at the dinner table with regard  to food was about how good it looked and tasted and good recipes, etc. Those  days are gone.  </P> <P>  -- A READER  </P> <P> DEAR READER: I hope not. The tide already shows signs of swinging back to some  of the nutritional common sense of yesteryear. More and more these days I am  hearing scientists and nutritionists, dietitians and such recommend pretty much  the same thing Grandma used to: a well-balanced diet from the four basic food  groups; a little moderation, and "get off your duff and go do the chores, the  exercise will do you good."  </P> <P> The whole cholesterol issue is being hotly debated in scientific circles these  days and one would hope that out of all the debate will come some truth and  perhaps even some common sense. In the meantime, be grateful that there is  still some conversation around your dinner table.  </P> <P> The latest for the younger set, for whom even fast food isn't fast enough, is  the computerized ordering system now in place at several Arby's Roast Beef  Shops. Just step right up to the computer and punch in your order. Faced with a  barrage of complains about slow service, Arby's installed the system for  customers who no longer have time to spend.  </P> <P>  -- MERLE  </P> <P> DEAR BUTCHER: When serving my family stuffed cabbage, the meat is always a  bright pink. I suspect this is caused by some color additive in the ground  meat. Am I right?  </P> <P>  -- A READER  </P> <P> DEAR READER: The cause of the pink color is nitrate, but it's not something  added to the meat. Rather, it's the naturally occurring nitrate in the cabbage.  Nitrate is added to meat products like ham and hot dogs and other sausage  products to prevent botulism, which is why those products have a pink color.  But green leaf vegetables also contain nitrates. According to Dr. George York,  a good friend and one of the leading food scientists in the country, cabbage  has 50 to 100 parts-per-million nitrates, more than most hot dogs and more than  enough to turn the meat in a cabbage roll pink. If you would like an even  pinker color, wrap your meat in spinach that contains 1,500 parts per million.  </P> <P>  -- MERLE  </P> <P> DEAR MERLE: Why do I see so much seafood, pork ribs, beef ribs, etc., market  with bright tags saying "Thawed, Previously Frozen"? Why in heaven's name don't  they leave them frozen, omit the thawing?  </P> <P>  -- A READER  </P> <P> DEAR READER: I don't know, but I suspect the reason markets thaw frozen meats  is very likely because people won't buy them in the frozen state. And  government regulations demand that we be told if the product has been frozen.  If enough folks like you would ask for frozen seafood, pork and beef ribs,  etc., you can bet markets would stop thawing them.  </P> <P>  -- MERLE  </P></p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Fiat given go-ahead for takeover FIAT HAS agreed to loosen its hold on tractor dealerships in Italy as the price for gaining European Community approval for its purchase of Ford's New Holland agricultural machinery subsidiary. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, said yesterday that Fiat's competitors would thus have 'a significant opportunity to improve their market position in Italy'. Fiat has ended its exclusive supply arrangements with a national grouping of 72 consorzi or farmers' co-operatives, each of which can now choose to continue with Fiat or not. In addition, Fiat will give former New Holland dealers a 15-day option to end their current distribution contracts. Sir Leon warned, however, that he would keep a close watch to see that competition was safeguarded 'because of the high level of concentration on the EC market as a whole'. By acquiring Ford New Holland, Fiat would become the EC market leader in farming machinery. But the Commission concluded that Fiat would still face enough competition to justify letting through the acquisition, vetted under new merger control powers.</p>

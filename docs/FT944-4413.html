			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow buy-back Taylor Woodrow yesterday became the first company in the property and construction sector to buy back its own shares. The company said it would acquire up to 10 per cent of its share capital, or 42m shares, at prices up to net asset value - 128.8p per share at June 30. Through its agents Hoare Govett and James Capel, Taylor Woodrow yesterday bought about 28m shares in the market, or 7 per cent of its capital. The shares closed up 5p at 124p. The company said the programme would result in a more efficient capital structure and enhanced earnings per share. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, added: 'The repurchase programme will not restrict the expansion plans within the company's strategic business plan. Taylor Woodrow's own assets represent a first class investment opportunity at the discounted price, which cannot be matched externally.' Taylor Woodrow has made a number of land acquisitions this year, including purchasing the assets of Heron Homes for Pounds 30m in March and deals in the US and Australia. At the end of the last financial year, gearing was about 16 per cent. The maximum expenditure under the repurchase programme is Pounds 54m.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / US plans drive to open overseas finance markets: Asia and Latin America likely to be the main targets THE US Treasury plans a drive next month to try to open up financial services markets in key Asian and Latin American countries. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said the Clinton administration would work to level the playing field for US banks and financial service companies. 'Too often the playing field looks like the Rockies. Barriers - both formal and informal - prevent US firms from entering markets on an equal footing with their competitors,' Mr Bentsen said in a speech yesterday to the Center for National Policy, a Washington think-tank. Mr Bentsen said the US's highest priority was a multilateral agreement in the Uruguay Round of trade talks that would open financial markets on a non-discriminatory basis. 'But we have made it clear that we will not agree to lock our markets open on a Most Favoured Nation basis, unless or until other countries commit to open their markets to US financial institutions,' Mr Bentsen said. 'We are prepared to guarantee national treatment and full access to countries that commit to open their markets. And, we are prepared to guarantee their existing operations in our market. But we will not assure countries that keep their markets closed the right to expand operations here, or to take advantage of new powers or benefit from future reforms,' he added. Mr Jeffrey Shafer, the assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs, is to travel to a number of countries to warn them they must do more to lower barriers to US banks. The administration yesterday threw its weight behind the fair trade in financial services bill being sponsored in Congress by Senator Donald Riegle. The legislation would empower - but not compel - the US government to deny the right of further expansion to banks and financial institutions from countries which did not offer equal access to US institutions. Such a measure parallels retaliatory mechanisms contained in the European Community's second banking directive, and is not expected to cause difficulty to banks from European countries. US commercial banks are likely to concentrate their complaints on countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Brazil. The Treasury secretary also called for legislation to allow US banks to open branches outside their home states. 'The basic approach would be to let banking organisations convert existing multi-bank, multi-state operations into a single bank, multi-branch operation,' he said. Richard Waters adds from New York: US banks gave only a subdued welcome to this initiative. Few restrictions remain on their ability to operate across the US through separate subsidiaries, although the ability to branch across state lines would reduce the cost and complexity of nationwide banking. On the other hand, the banks fear that a debate over branching could allow insurance agents to lobby against banks' involvement in selling insurance products.</p>

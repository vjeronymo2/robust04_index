Inienger said in an interview aired on national radio that  the UN-supervised force would be "evenhanded" and "neutral" but  warned that "any party acting alone or in contract to frustrate  disarmament will be forced to disarm." He said he was aware the  disarmament process would be lengthy and fraught with obstacles  but that his force is "resolved and committed to bring about  total peace to Liberia."    But so far the Nigerian-led ECOMOG force which began  deploying here last Tuesday has made little headway as it  attempts to fan out across the country. Local observers fear  that an internal power dispute among leaders of one of the  country's two main factions, the United Liberation Movement  (ULIMO) could scuttle the peace process.    On Sunday ULIMO's military command, headed by General  Roosevelt Johnson, issued a communique announcing that the  president of the movement, Alhaji Koromah, had been dismissed.  Johnson is from the Krahn ethnic group and Koromah from the  Mandingo group.    Johnson in his communique accused Koromah of engaging in  "inconsistent activities which the movement considered obstacles  in the peace process" and rejected his decision earlier this  week to dismiss Thomas Ziah, an ULIMO representative appointed  to the country's State Council, an interim collegial presidency  which is to rule the country between March 7 and September 7.    Koromah's stand against Ziah was apparently prompted by the  latter's refusal to support ULIMO representative Mohamed Sheriff  to the presidency of the transitional government on February 28.    As a result, David Kpormakor, an interim government  representative, was elected president of the State Council, a  decision immediately contested by the ULIMO representatives.    Meanwhile Koromah on Friday ordered his followers to disarm  members of the Krahn ethnic group, a decision that resulted in a  shootout that left four Krahn members injured.</p>

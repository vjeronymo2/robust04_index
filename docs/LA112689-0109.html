			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND SET FOR SHOWDOWN WITH WASHINGTON OVER NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE  </P> <P> Nuclear weapons work goes on all around Oakland, Calif. Among the U.S.  government facilities calling that city home are a naval shore depot that  stocks non-nuclear spare parts for nuclear weapons and a Department of Energy  office that oversees nuclear design work at the nearby Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory.  </P> <P> Military bases where actual nuclear weapons might be stored surround Oakland.  The Naval Air Station in next-door Alameda is home to five nuclear-powered  ships, including two aircraft carriers. The Mare Island Naval Shipyard, north  of the city, services nuclear-powered submarines.  </P> <P> So when the voters of Oakland passed a referendum last year declaring their  city a nuclear-free zone, they set up an inevitable clash with the federal  government. The sweeping terms of the referendum not only ban production and  storage of nuclear weapons, weapon components and radioactive materials in  Oakland, they call for a flat ban on any person engaging in nuclear weapons  work within the city limits.  </P> <P> The Department of Justice has now filed suit against Oakland, challenging the  constitutionality of its nuclear-free ordinance. It is the first federal attack  of its kind, and it could affect the more than 150 other self-declared U.S.  municipal nuclear-free zones.  </P> <P> The Oakland nuclear-free area "impedes and interferes with the accomplishment  and execution of unified policies regarding national defense," charges the  Justice Department's complaint.  </P> <P> The concept of communities declaring themselves nuclear-free zones first  surfaced in Japan about 30 years ago. In the United States, the nuclear-free  zone movement took off in the 1980s, with about 164 self-declared zones now  established across the country, according to the Baltimore-based nonprofit  organization Nuclear Free America.  </P> <P> Some zones were established by voter-passed resolutions, as in Oakland. Some  are the result of bylaws passed by city or county councils. In Malibu, a  nuclear-free zone was simply declared by honorary Mayor Martin Sheen.  </P> <P> In banning nuclear weapons and related work from their environs, most  communities are making a symbolic gesture. Many nuclear-free zones are places  far from concentrations of defense contractors and military bases. About 15  zone resolutions contain provisions prohibiting city business with firms linked  to nuclear weapons. In Takoma Park, Md., a Washington suburb, this has meant  phasing out police cars made by General Motors, a large defense contractor.  </P> <P> Under an ordinance passed by its City Council in 1986, Chicago is the biggest  declared U.S. nuclear-free city. But Chicago is still gathering information  about city defense contracting and thus has not yet made any enforcement moves.  </P> <P> Oakland's nuclear-free resolution was passed by voters in November, 1988.  Besides prohibiting production of nuclear weapons in Oakland, the ordinance  regulates transportation of nuclear-related materials through the city and  prohibits any person within the city limits from knowingly engaging in nuclear  weapons work after a two-year grace period.  </P> <P> Most city politicians did not support the ordinance, yet in May, Oakland served  notice to the federal government that it would try to enforce its new law. As  the first self-declared nuclear-free zone to make such a move, Oakland set the  stage for a constitutional showdown.  </P> <P> "I think we're on very firm ground with almost every part of this ordinance,"  said Oakland City Council member Wilson Riles, an original supporter of the  nuclear-free resolution.  </P> <P> The Justice Department says it believes that Oakland's case is badly flawed. At  issue is the complicated legal issue of when federal law preempts local  statutes.  </P> <P> According to the Justice Department complaint, under the U.S. Constitution  states and cities have no authority to regulate "any matter relating to the  national defense as provided for by the United States government."  </P> <P> The complaint claims that the Oakland ordinance's attempt to regulate nuclear  weapons work is an unconstitutional infringement on interstate commerce, that  the city has no right to try to regulate actions taken on federal property, and  that the Atomic Energy Act gives Washington exclusive control over atomic  energy, both military and civilian.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the complaint says that under the 1975 Hazardous Materials  Transportation Act the government has the right to ship nuclear-related  materials through Oakland if it wants to.  </P> <P> There are few legal precedents for the Justice Department suit. In a 1985 case  involving the Navy's right to build a Staten Island home port for a battleship,  the New York state Supreme Court ruled that a local ordinance blocking federal  defense policies is invalid if it was passed because of local objections to  Washington's defense actions.  </P> <P> Also in 1985, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld a Cambridge  municipal regulation preventing Arthur D. Little Inc. from conducting work with  chemical-warfare poisons within the city limits. The court concluded that the  health risk to citizens was relatively large, while the effect on national  defense was only incidental.  </P> <P> A 1988 University of Chicago Law Review article concluded that "many of the  recent Nuclear Free Zone ordinances are invalid as unconstitutional intrusions  on the federal power to provide for national defense and to conduct foreign  affairs."  </P> <P> David Birman, director of the Lawyer's Committee on Nuclear Policy, holds that  threatening the use of nuclear weapons is illegal under international law. Thus  any local ordinance that bans nuclear weapons is in turn legal, he said. But  Birman added that he's "not that optimistic" the Oakland nuclear free zone will  be upheld in U.S. courts.  </P></p>

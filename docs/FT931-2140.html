			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / People: Credit Lyonnais' Menard says 'Oui' to Barclays Christian Menard, a 25 year veteran of Credit Lyonnais, is leaving in June to join Barclays Bank as head of the French operation. He replaces Jacques Rambosson, director of European corporate banking, who moved to London in December. Since then, Carlos Martinez de Campos, director of retail banking in Europe, has been temporarily filling the position. During a peripatetic career at CL, Menard has lived in Portugal and Brazil, and had two stints in London. He spent four years as managing director of Credit Lyonnais Capital Markets and is credited with returning the UK securities operation to profit after several years of losses following the French bank's ill-timed acquisition of Alexanders Laing &amp; Cruickshank in 1987. At the beginning of 1992, Menard, 51, returned to head office; he is currently 'directeur central' in charge of the branch network. He was not prepared to comment on his move. Barclays, which employs over 2,500 people in France as a whole, has recently been expanding its retail network. It has added twenty branches in the past few months in the Paris region, and plans to open another 20 before the end of the year, bringing the total to 90. The bank also caused a stir among the French banking community last autumn with an attempt to get around the ban on interest-bearing current accounts, and, despite further government prohibitions, it has already found 10,000 customers for a modified product.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri met  U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley in the Chamber headquarters.  Hambley said afterward: I wanted to talk to Speaker Birri about  particular incidents that occurred last week and to discuss  developments in south Lebanon and to express my belief that  controlling the situation there is very important. Right now we  are focusing on the Washington talks. But we seek to stop these  attacks, which, I believe, only hinder the ongoing peace process.    The U.S. ambassador was asked about his remark that only  conciliation will solve the problem in south Lebanon. A  reporter asked him what he meant by conciliation and with whom.  He said: I believe the basic point needed to secure and  maintain the ongoing process in Washington is to reach solutions  that will bring peace to the entire Middle East region. This  includes all the parties concerned with peace, in other words,  Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and all the other parties. We must  maintain the dialogue in Washington to reach the desired  solutions.    Hambley was asked about the positive signs that emerged  after  the Geneva summit and about the talks remaining stagnant. Asked  whether there is a way to push the talks ahead, he replied: I  think some progress has been made since the talks resumed in  Washington. We are not imposing a specific time limit on  negotiators. So we cannot expect instant results. The  negotiating process is too complicated to make rapid progress.  What counts is to finally see progress in the right direction  leading to solutions that are acceptable to everyone.    The ambassador was asked about his call to disarm the  Resistance and about his country's failure to put pressure on  Israel to implement international resolutions and withdraw from  the south. He said: Our stance on Resolution 425 is very  clear. We want to see the foreign troops withdraw from Lebanon,  as he put it. He added: We hope the Washington talks will be a  gateway to that goal so that the security and other guarantees  can be provided. We hope they will guarantee peaceful relations  among all the parties concerned.    Hambley was asked about the repeated U.S. remark that the  Americans are helping Lebanon at a time when the State  Department has issued a decision extending the ban on Americans  traveling to Lebanon. Asked to explain this contradiction, he  said: This is a very important question. But we must  distinguish between a decision banning the travel of U.S.  passport holders, which is based purely on affairs relating to  security [sentence incomplete as heard]. He added: We can only  hope the future will show some signs that allow us to revoke  that decision. It is very important to us to guarantee the  safety of our sons who visit Lebanon. This is the U.S.  Government's main concern. The second issue, he added, does not  mean we did not launch cooperation programs with the Lebanese  Government. Although cooperation is small, it is continuous and  we hope it will be expanded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Federico Guiglia; place and date not given: "Fini: Let Us Move  to a Presidential System Now" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- First Republic, farewell. Having  (successfully) gotten two elections behind it, the Freedom  Alliance is now setting its sights on a grand reform of the  state. "The time for a presidential system has come," [National  Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini said in this interview with IL  GIORNALE. "We are initiating a parliamentary debate on the  direct election of the president." But meanwhile a test of  strength is under way between [Prime Minister] Berlusconi and  [League Secretary] Bossi, and the majority has split in the  Senate over the decree to salvage the RAI [Italian Broadcasting  Corporation]. As though that were not enough, [Interior  Minister] Maroni has proposed the "integration" of Forza  Italia, the National Alliance, and the Northern League.    [Guiglia] Is a great "Freedom Party" about to be formed in  our country, as in America?    [Fini] The proposal made by Maroni needs to be further  detailed, but must certainly be encouraged. The government must  govern, and it needs the utmost cooperation among its allies.  But their backgrounds and identities are different and cannot  be nullified. The important thing now, right away, is to create  electoral and administrative cartels. We and Forza Italia have  done so, also in the north, whereas the League is going it  alone. And it is making a mistake.    [Guiglia] Berlusconi is demanding a "clarification" from  Bossi. Is it their own affair or does it concern the whole of  the majority?    [Fini] Each political group has its own autonomy, and there  cannot and must not be any interference in internal party  debates. Having said that, the prime minister is entitled to  demand from his coalition partners a clear position, which is  essential to the stability of the majority.    [Guiglia] But in the Senate Forza Italia, not the League,  voted for [former Prime Minister] Ciampi's decree to salvage the  RAI, together with Communist Renewal. Is there a test of  strength on the way between the government partners over the  media too?    [Fini] There will be no test of strength, because I am sure  that in the next few days it will be easy to find a common  stance on the issue. The National Alliance has no intention of  dismantling the RAI. But there is a large difference between  dismantling and approving a watertight measure. I am sure that  Forza Italia's future options will no longer be in tune with  those of the Left, as unfortunately happened in the Senate.  That decree must be modified. the RAI's wise men are neither  representative nor guarantors -- as they should be -- of  pluralism within that public service.    [Guiglia] Berlusconi is experiencing a honeymoon with the  voters. Did you, as his ally, feel somewhat "neglected" on 12  June?    [Fini] For us that day's positive vote is a starting point,  not the electoral target of the Italian Right. We will work to  make ourselves even more clearly identifiable by the public,  through a presidential system, which we will now make the  subject of a debate in Parliament; economic liberalism combined  with social solidarity, and the renewal of public  administration, from the ethical viewpoint, too.    [Guiglia] The National Alliance has a secretary, but does  not  give the impression of having a leadership class. Is this the  weak spot of Italy's Right?    [Fini] There would be no leader unless he were flanked by a  substantial group of officials. Nobody is so presumptuous as to  do things entirely by himself. We have 17 members in the  government, either as ministers or as under secretaries. We  have another five who are chairmen of parliamentary committees  and two deputy speakers of Parliament. Do I need to go on?    [Guiglia] Yes: Who is your "deputy?"    [Fini] There is no one deputy; we have four or five.    [Guiglia] Who are they?    [Fini] I cannot say; otherwise the other six or seven will  get angry.    [Guiglia] When will you convene the National Alliance  congress?    [Fini] Before the end of the year, at the same time as the  MSI [Italian Social Movement] congress. There must be an  operational and organizational agreement between the National  Alliance and the MSI. The Alliance no longer consists solely of  MSI members: There are Catholics, Liberals, Republicans. Then  we need to update our policies to tae into account particpation  in government, reform, the electoral law, developments on the  Left , plus all that has happened in recent months.    [Guiglia] Will you also discuss the greatest statesman of  the  century?    [Fini] I no longer express any judgments about the past.    [Guiglia] Is this an embarrassing way of eliminating it?    [Fini] It is a way of eliminating polemics and artificial  disputes over the Alliance policies, which have nothing to do  with the past.    [Guiglia] Israel has placed the MSI members in the  government  under observation. When will they emerge from quarantine?    [Fini] I can very well understand the Israelis' sensitivity.  Foreign Minister Peres said that he will judge our ministers on  what they do. This is the greatest reassurance that we could be  given. The facts will speak for themselves.    [Guiglia] Will the PPI [Italian Popular Party] help you in  the Senate?    [Fini] That depends entirely on them. I foresee not their  joining the majority, but their ability to adopt responsible  positions different from those of the progressive forces in each  instance.    [Guiglia] Who is best: D'Alema, Veltroni, or Cacciari  [candidates to succeed Occhetto as Democratic Party of the Left  secretary]?    [Fini] They are all the same. As long as it remains  illiberal and continues systematically to denigrate its  adversaries, the Left will not go anywhere. This, even if it  changes, and keeps changing, its secretaries.</p>

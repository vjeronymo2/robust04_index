			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Observer: Cheap option What price Britain's presidency of the European Community? Certainly not the minting of a special set of Ecu coins - the customary way for member countries to mark their stewardship. John Major's government is breaking the mould, perhaps reflecting the seriousness with which the UK government takes its opt-out clause from the single currency envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty. Instead, for all the talk about keeping Britain at the heart of Europe, what it will hand out on its assumption of the presidency next Wednesday will be a 50p coin, commemorative issue, of course. An insider at the Royal Mint says it would have 'loved' to strike an Ecu coin for sale to collectors, but Chancellor Lamont - Euro-sceptic architect of the Maastricht opt-out - vetoed the idea. Maybe the 50p alternative struck him as a bargain price to pay for keeping calm among anti-federalist Tory backbenchers.</p>

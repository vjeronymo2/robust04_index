			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Patagonia feels chilly free-market winds: John Barham on the fierce struggle of a remote Argentine region to survive the rigours of President Menem's economic policy PATAGONIA is synonymous with desolation and remoteness. Now, in addition to the daily battle against the elements, its inhabitants are struggling to survive the rigours of President Carlos Menem's economic policies. Argentina's experiment with free markets halted hyperinflation and brought rapid economic growth. But for some outlying regions it has meant increased unemployment, a dwindling population and rising government deficits. Patagonia's economy is shrinking as the state which once subsidised the region withdraws. Patagonia obsesses Argentines. It is considered a national disgrace that a region covering a third of the country and containing important natural resources should remain an empty wilderness more than a century after it was conquered from Indian tribes. Although most Argentines prefer the comforts and bright lights of cities, they admire pioneers who occupy the rough interior. They even have a phrase  -'hacer patria', literally making the nation - for the defenders of Argentina's sovereignty in frontier regions. It is widely believed that foreigners, like the British, who once owned vast sheep farms in Patagonia, and Chileans covet Patagonia; Argentina and Chile almost went to war in the south 15 years ago. Chileans comprise a large minority in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, where they work for low wages in manual jobs scorned by Argentines. Patagonia was first settled in 1865 by Welsh and Scottish immigrants who introduced sheep from the nearby Falkland Islands. The discovery of oil in 1907 led to the creation of YPF, the world's first state-owned oil company, in 1922. YPF ran hospitals and schools and provided jobs. Later, governments offered a cornucopia of subsidies to attract companies and settlers from the north. Invoking the threat from Chile, Buenos Aires ran loss-making coal and iron ore mines, subsidised the creation of textile and consumer electronics industries and backed an aluminium plant. Now the state is retreating. Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, has turned off the tap of subsidies, privatised YPF in June after it sacked 80 per cent of its employees, and is demanding provincial governments balance their books, even though local officials claim this would worsen unemployment, now topping 20 per cent. In the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz, a tenth of the population works for the government. The loss of subsidies and import barriers is suffocating the textile industry. Once-thriving fishing ports are hit by depressed prices and sheep farming is in terminal decline. Chubut, one of Patagonia's three provinces, is running a 20 per cent budget deficit. Mr Eliseo Moledo, who owns a Trelew car parts company, agrees with the market economy, but there is no local market and 'without a market there can be no economy'. Mr Jorge Conrad, Chubut's despairing economy minister, asks: 'If I had a million dollars, would I invest it in Patagonia?' Hardly pausing he says: 'No. It's better to take the resources than process them here.' Argentina is a vast country, but a third of its population of 32.4m and much of its industry is clustered around Buenos Aires. Small companies in the interior are hobbled by huge distances, poor communications and high operating costs. Bureaucrats worry that the provinces may be left behind by Buenos Aires, widening an already considerable wealth disparity. Mr Cavallo has responded by inducing the provinces (except those in Patagonia) to cut local taxes and regulations by offering bigger tax transfers from the centre. He says lighter tax and regulatory burdens will reactivate dormant economies. The government claims Buenos Aires-based companies are already relocating to the interior. Deregulation is unshackling once-moribund mining, tourism, and energy industries. In Tierra del Fuego, where a previous military government set up a consumer electronics industry, output of TV sets and VCRs has risen 500 per cent in three years. Cordoba, home to Argentina's car industry, is thriving. But supply side policies are no cure. The small northern province of Tucuman has balanced its books and cut taxes, but the government considers it a triumph to have kept unemployment flat. Malnutrition, poor education and declining industries are serious problems. Patagonia's economy has stagnated even though the rest of the country has seen 20 per cent growth in the last three years. The regional problem is emerging as one of the government's critical policy challenges. Overcoming decline in the interior could well prove harder than crushing hyperinflation.</p>

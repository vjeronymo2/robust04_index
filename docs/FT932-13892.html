			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: USAir cuts first-quarter net loss USAIR, the carrier in which British Airways invested Dollars 300m for a 19.9 per cent voting interest earlier this year, yesterday reported a Dollars 2m operating profit for the first three months of 1993. The airline, however, recorded a Dollars 61m loss after interest charges and taxes. In the same period of 1992, USAir suffered an operating loss of Dollars 48.6m and a net loss of Dollars 110.2m, ahead of charges related to accounting rule changes. The carrier's operating revenues in the most recent three-month period increased from Dollars 1.65bn to Dollars 1.72bn, although it said that the severe blizzard which hit the eastern US in March resulted in 'several thousand' USAir and USAir Express flights being cancel-led. Operating expenses, however, only edged up from Dollars 1.7bn to Dollars 1.71bn - helped significantly by the fall in labour costs to Dollars 648.7m from Dollars 665.3m a year ago. Last year, the company won some significant pay and benefit concessions from employees. USAir said the overall load factor improved from 53.4 per cent a year ago to 55.6 per cent, while yields edged slightly higher to 18.75 cents, from 18.63 cents a year ago. NWA, parent company of Northwest Airlines, reported a net loss of Dollars 99.2m for the first quarter, compared with a net loss of Dollars 106.9m in the same period of last year, excluding accounting changes, writes Martin Dickson. However, the airline said this year's loss included a foreign exchange loss of Dollars 31.6m, largely because of the strengthening of the yen against the dollar, and its operating loss had been Dollars 69.8m, compared with Dollars 120.3m a year ago. Revenues were up 1.6 per cent at Dollars 2.01bn. Operating expenses dropped 0.9 per cent to Dollars 2.08bn. The company said it had cut operating costs per available seat mile to 9.36 cents from 9.44 cents, while revenues per available seat mile rose to 9.09 cents from 9.04 cents.</p>

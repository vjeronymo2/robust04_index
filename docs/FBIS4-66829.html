			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from an interview with A. Keramane, governor of </F> the Bank of Algeria, by the APS; place and date not given:  "`Adjustment Is First of All an Internal Necessity'" -- first  paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] In an interview with the APS, Mr. Keramane explained  the agreement with the IMF; here are excerpts from this  interview.    [APS] Mr. Governor, Algeria has just signed a new agreement  with the IMF in the particular conditions that our country is  experiencing. How would you describe it, especially as far as  its implications for our economic and financial situation are  concerned?    [Keramane] You are right to mention the particular  conditions  that our country is experiencing, which refer first of all to  the current economic crisis--a crisis which, except for petty  differences between factions, has brought about a national  consensus on the need to get to the root of the problem. In  other words, it is an established fact that in order to achieve  a diversified modern economy, better equipped to open itself to  the world, adjustment is a necessity, and would be so even if  oil sold for $30 a barrel. Adjustment is first of all an  internal necessity resulting from the situation of our economy,  not from any treatment imposed upon us from the outside.    This being so, because oil does not sell for $30 and since  our debt service is one of the heaviest in the world, it is  useful, if not indispensable, that this adjustment should get  the IMF support. Especially considering that in recent years, in  the context of the new international order, the IMF has become a  kingpin in international financial relations.    Our internal social problems force us to look for the most  gradual transition possible, and therefore to try and avoid the  shock therapy which, by the way, did not always yield the  expected results in those countries that already used it. This  explains why the negotiations were long and difficult.    [APS] Will the stabilization measures that Algeria is  beginning to implement, with the devaluation of the national  currency and credit tightening, remain in force for the entire  term of the one-year agreement, or should we expect other  similar adjustments to follow?    [Keramane] In a stabilization program, most if not all  measures are taken at the start of the program.    We must define new economic parameters and then let economic  operators, the production sector and the various agents adjust  to the new context. Economic operators need stability, which is  the objective of the stabilization program; therefore, we are  not going to keep changing the rules of the game.    As far as the rate of exchange is concerned, 36 dinars to  the  dollar is a realistic rate that may provide a basis for  stabilization. It represents a reasonable adjustment, which was  necessary and, at the same time, is sufficient. Certainly, you  might say that a 40-percent devaluation is a lot, but you should  recall that, a little over two years ago, negotiations with the  IMF revolved around a rate of 32 dinars to the dollar so that,  taking into account inflation and the increasing financial  problems we have had in the past two years, it is not excessive  to have reached conclusions on the basis of 36 Algerian dinars  to the dollar.    This, we believe, is how this devaluation should be judged.    As far as interest rates are concerned, they were slightly  increased, precisely to support the new exchange rate level. In  this case too, the objective of the stabilization program is  generally to achieve positive real interest rates, i.e., a  structure with interest rates higher than those of the structure  we just agreed on.    The bank lending rates will be relatively stabilized, and  the  cost of credit to the economy should not increase appreciably.  The objective is to contain inflation and achieve a reasonable  underlying inflation rate rather than to systematically attempt  to achieve positive real interest rates. Actually, this new  interest rate structure anticipates inflation control.    In other words, the essential objective of the program is to  bring inflation under control and, by the end of the year, to  achieve a reduced inflation rate in line with the interest rate  structure we agreed on.    Borrowing rates, for their part, will increase, and the CNEP  [Algerian National Savings and Insurance Bank] also just gave  the signal. This will stimulate savings and enable banks to  allocate intermediate and long-term credits more efficiently.    To answer your question more bluntly, I can say that we are  not contemplating any additional surprise measures. This being  so, we should also not operate in a rigid context.    In such a program, you monitor the real economy, and you may  have to adjust to its evolution.    [APS] What material measures are you contemplating to soften  the impact of the current adjustments on the purchasing power of  households?    [Keramane] The problem of the household purchasing power is  linked to that of inflation control. First, we must define the  inflation problem.    At times, as was the case for instance during Ramadan, there  may be large price increases on some products, but the inflation  picture, as reflected in the annual inflation rate, is  relatively lower since, for 1993, it was estimated at about 20  percent, compared with 32 percent in 1992.    Devaluation should not translate into large price increases.  You should not make the simple reasoning of transposing the  devaluation percentage into price increases.    First, because many products are manufactured locally;  therefore, only imported products will be directly affected by  the devaluation. They will be affected somewhat later, when new  inventories are brought in. Normally, current inventories should  be sold without any price increase.    As far as industrially manufactured goods are considered,  inflation will come into play only through imported inputs that,  depending on the product, account for a varying proportion of  the final product cost and, in this case too, do so with a  certain lag.    Therefore, the effect of devaluation on prices should  normally be moderate and staggered in time.    We should recall that the objective of bringing inflation  under control is an essential objective of the stabilization  program, and one that will be achieved through a whole series of  measures.    This is the best way to protect the purchasing power of  households. Of course, for the most underprivileged the program  provides that the social safety net will not only be retained,  but also improved.    [APS] What about the impact on the operation of the  production plant?    [Keramane] As far as the operation of the production plant  is  concerned, now that the stabilization program has been adopted  the essential factor is that the production sector will find it  easier to import its raw materials, its spare parts, and all the  things that constitute the production input.    This means, in particular, that companies will have access  to  cash to buy products commonly used in their production processes.    As a result, the cost of credit will be less. Perhaps some  companies could even reduce their raw material inventories since  they will be assured to have ready access to their supplies.    Generally speaking, therefore, these measures linked to  foreign trade and import financing should have a twofold  positive effect on the production sector: reduced costs and  increased operating flexibility.    [APS] The easing of restrictions on foreign trade implies  commercial convertibility of the dinar; is Algeria getting close  to this objective?    [Keramane] The stabilization program implies an easing of  restriction on foreign trade and will provide a number of  measures to that effect simultaneously with measures that the  Bank of Algeria will take concerning import financing. We can  say, therefore, that this program will make it possible to  achieve the objective of commercial convertibility of the dinar.    [APS] Companies, both state-owned and private, might again  raise the question of exchange losses?    [Keramane] This question was raised after the 1991  devaluation and, as you said, will probably be raised again.  Today, however, its extent is reduced by the fact that operators  were able to protect themselves against currency risks through  the futures quotation system set up by the Bank of Algeria.  Certainly, the problem of exchange losses is a major problem and  the Algerian Government took it into account in their  negotiations with the IMF.    It will be possible to set up a system to soften the impact  of devaluation on the debt of state-owned and private companies.  Of course, compensation will be only partial and in keeping with  the nature of the economic activity considered.    [APS] Does the correction of internal financial balances, as  a major stage in the structural adjustment of the economy, mean  that the Bank of Algeria will follow a policy of strict  financial austerity, irrespective of the priorities of economic  recovery?    [Keramane] For an economy, overall financial austerity is  linked to the existence, or lack, of a budget deficit, which may  be big or small. As far as the budget deficit is concerned,  which amounted to 9 percent of the gross domestic product in  1993, the stabilization program will make it possible to aim for  a post-stabilization deficit of 5 percent in 1994. It will be  further reduced in 1995. The revenue increase resulting from the  devaluation and the expected effects of the rescheduling will  make it possible not just to achieve the budget deficit  reduction objective, but also to provide increased resources for  credits to the economy.    It will therefore become possible to give the necessary  importance to economic recovery without monetary laxity and  without starting again to print more money. Actually, as far as  monetary expansion is concerned, the program sets an objective  that aims to strengthen the downward trend of money supply  observed in recent year.    As you know, monetary expansion reached 24 percent in 1992  and 21 percent in 1993, whereas fiduciary money grew by 17.6  percent in 1992 and 14.3 percent in 1993, respectively.    These figures show that monetary expansion was far less in  recent years than some would say, and the trend toward a  reduction of these rates will continue under this program.    [APS] In addition to the billion dollars that the IMF  intends  to make available, what can we expect from our economic partners  in terms of financial contributions?    [Keramane] We should first point out that the IMF $1-billion  contribution is particularly large for a one-year stabilization  program and for a country like Algeria. It is a sizeable  contribution to our balance of payments, and it is also a signal  of the IMF to the international community, at multilateral  (World Bank, European Community, etc.) as well as at bilateral  level (with the various partner countries), and to the world's  financial and banking system.    There are a number of credits in the form of [word  illegible]  installments that remain available with multilateral partners,  and the Algerian Government will therefore endeavor to have  these installments made available as soon as possible,  simultaneously, with the EEC and with the World Bank as well as  with other potential multilateral partners such as the Arab  Monetary Fund and the African Development Bank.    We should also make contact to obtain other credits to  support our balance of payments or to finance projects, as the  case may be.</p>

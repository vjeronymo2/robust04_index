The bill establishes radio, television and teletext as forms  of broadcasting. Under the bill, one Estonian-language  television channel, one Estonian-language teletext channel, two  Estonian-language radio channels and one Russian-language radio  channel will be financed from the state budget.    The bill stipulates that tapes of radio and television  programs must be preserved for a period of three months.    The bill establishes the principle of political balance  under  which the national broadcasting channels must give all political  parties the same amount of air time.    The bill bans tobacco advertising and advertisements that  promote consumption of alcohol. It forbids the use of  newscasters and political commentators in advertising.    The broadcasting bill was drafted by former Justice  Minister,  attorney Mart Rask and Rein Lang, one of the owners of AS Trio  that operates the Tallinn-based Kuku radio station.</p>

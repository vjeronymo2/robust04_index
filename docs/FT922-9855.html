			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UN envoy delayed by snipers: Goulding reaches Sarajevo after being trapped at military base UNITED NATIONS special envoy Marrack Goulding reached Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, yesterday after after sniper fire in surrounding hills had stranded him for several hours at a helicopter base outside the city. He was escorted into Sarajevo by General Satish Nambiar, commander of UN peace-keeping forces, who had driven out to try to escort him into the city for talks with President Alija Izetbegovic. Mr Goulding's mission to assess the feasibility of sending a peace-keeping force to the republic coincided with an ultimatum from the largely Moslem Bosnian militias to the Yugoslav federal army to withdraw from the capital by midnight tonight. The ultimatum was issued after European Community monitors appeared to have failed to arrange a meeting between army and Bosnian leaders. The continuing violence forced 25 monitors to withdraw from Sarajevo, leaving a nine-member crew, including Mr Colm Doyle, an Irish army major and the special envoy of Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC conference on Yugoslavia. Mr Doyle called the army's bombardment of Sarajevo 'totally unacceptable'. Stepping up the mutual recriminations, the Bosnian Defence Force accused the army of 'unleashing a merciless bombardment' from its barracks in the city, and from the military hospital. The army retorted that the barracks were under siege by Bosnian forces. In an apparent effort to stave off international criticism, the presidency of the new Serb-dominated Yugoslavia ordered its citizens - Serb and Montenegrin soldiers and officers - to withdraw from Bosnia within 15 days. However, the call was rhetorical since more than 80 per cent of 80,000 federal soldiers stationed in Bosnia are Bosnian Serbs. In Sarajevo, palls of smoke streamed out of buildings set ablaze during 22 hours of continuing shelling by the federal army. Sarajevo radio said the streets were littered with corpses but casualty figures could not be confirmed. Fighting was also reported in other parts of the republic. The Moslems are backed by Croats who have joined forces against the Serbs and the federal army in a battle for control of strategic parts of Sarajevo. But the Moslem-Croat coalition which supports Bosnian independence looks fragile. Serb leaders hinted yesterday that Serbia and Croatia could reach agreement on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, leaving Moslems without a homeland. Mr Tomislav Sipovac, a member of the government of the self-proclaimed Serb republic of Bosnia, which does not want to belong to an independent Bosnia, was quoted by Tanjug as saying: 'There is very little difference between the Croat and Serb positions. . . . We can very quickly make an agreement. . . . because we have no territorial disputes.' Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, was quoted in Polityka, the Serbian daily, as saying Bosnia could survive as an independent state only if the republic was divided on a confederal basis into three ethnic units.</p>

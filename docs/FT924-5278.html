			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Britain braced for EC budget row: UK proposes 'restrained increase' to break spending deadlock THE UK braced itself for a furious reaction from its European Community partners at a meeting of ministers in Brussels today after putting forward proposals yesterday to break the nine-month deadlock over the future financing of the EC. At a 'conclave' of foreign and finance ministers, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will present proposals envisaging 'a more restrained increase' in EC spending than a recent proposal from EC Commission president Mr Jacques Delors. Britain is also refusing to yield to mainly German pressure to give up its annual rebate, worth about Pounds 2bn, from its EC contributions. While the UK will discuss reformulating the way the money is paid back, the scale of the rebate is not negotiable. Britain has proposed a seven-year agreement that would freeze the upper limit of the EC budget at the present 1.2 per cent of Community gross national product for three years from the start of next year, before raising it in stages to 1.25 per cent by 1999. According to UK Treasury figures, the British plan would lift the EC budget to Pounds 61bn or Ecu 79.3bn at 1992 prices by 1999 from Pounds 47bn this year against Mr Delors' plan to boost the budget to Pounds 64bn after seven years. Britain wants to force other member states - notably Germany - to clarify their stance on the budget well ahead of the Edinburgh summit in two weeks. British diplomats are aware that if the presidency cannot advance the debate on the EC budget, it risks an embarrassing deadlock at the summit after what many of its partners consider a disastrous EC presidency. If EC leaders cannot reach a decision on the budget at the summit, negotiations for the admission of new EC members - one of the British presidency's central objectives - will also have to be delayed. Germany and the Netherlands are expected to back the British plans for a more modest EC budget, but poorer member states will oppose any package that would leave them worse off than under the Commission's current plans for EC spending, known as the Delors II package. The British presidency is prepared to face fierce criticism from Ireland, Spain, Greece and Portugal, which are seeking funds to encourage economic convergence with the wealthier EC members. The so-called 'cohesion' funds in the Delors II proposals have been cut from Ecu15bn to Ecu12.25bn under the British plans. UK officials stressed yesterday that this would still amount to a quite substantial increase in funding compared with the 1988-92 budget period.

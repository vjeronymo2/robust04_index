			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>   [Text] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has  deactivated 25 companies of the controversial Citizen's Armed  Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) for the first quarter of this  year as a result of the continuing decline in strength of  different rebel and terrorist groups.    According to a military report obtained by BUSINESS WORLD,  CAFGU strength has been cut to 65,836 from the 67,691 militiamen  in the beginning of 1994.    The AFP said the dismantling of the units, composed of  civilians trained by the military to assist in the fight against  communist rebels in the countryside, was another proof they are  consistently gaining the upper hand in military offensives.    The CAFGU's have been tagged as notorious human rights  violators, prompting several Congressmen to last year file a  resolution for inquiry on the former's performance and abuses.  [sentence as published] Several units were identified in the  past as serving known politicians, businessmen and landlords in  the provinces, even as complaints were received by various  cause-oriented groups.    However, the AFP said that during the latter part of last  year, it had moved for the improvement in the training and  motivation of CAFGU volunteers in order to prevent similar  incidents.    The AFP, in fact, said it had received no reports of human  rights violations committed by soldiers and militiamen this  year. Sources at Camp Aguinaldo said the decline can be  attributed to the easing up of the situation in the countryside  plus the training and education.    For 1994, militiamen were instructed to provide security in  areas cleared by the AFP and the Philippine National Police  (PNP) and to limit the conduct of combat operations.    At present, there are 956 CAFGU companies with a total  strength of 65,836 deployed in 9,249 barangays [village]  nationwide. More units are scheduled to be deactivated in the  coming years under a plan that aims to reduce CAFGU's to zero  before 1999.    The same report said the decline of the threat from the  Communist Party of the Philippines and the objective of  transferring the counter-insurgency responsibility to the PNP  next year should further enhance the good performance of CAFGU's  for the remaining months of this year.</p>

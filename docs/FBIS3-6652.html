			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued  the following statement in connection with the U.S. treacherous  act [paesin haengwi] of totally overturning [chonmyon  tujiboomnun] the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact  dated 25 February.    The statement of the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign  Ministry:    The United States has committed a treacherous act of totally  overturning the agreement of the DPRK-U.S. New York contact  dated 25 February. As has been known, the DPRK and the United  States in the 25 February New York contact agreed on the present  four simultaneous action measures [tangmyonhan negaji tongsi  haengdong chochidul] for a package solution of the nuclear  issue, namely, suspending the Team Spirit-94 joint military  exercise, resuming the working delegates contact for the  exchange of the special envoys of the North and the South,  conducting inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards by  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], and holding the  third round of DPRK-U.S. talks in Geneva on 21 March.    This agreement on the simultaneous action measures was an  important turning point that would enable the process for  peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue which had been deviated  [talson toeottun] to be on the right track again.    From the serious desire to resolve the nuclear issue through  dialogue, we have faithfully implemented our obligations noted  in the agreement. We accepted the IAEA inspection team at the  scheduled date and have sincerely provided them all the  conditions so that they could conduct inspection activities of a  sufficient scope on the seven declared sites for ensuring the  continuity of safeguards.    Even in the abnormal circumstance where the IAEA side  unreasonably demanded taking samples and measurements [siryo  chaechwiwa chukchong] far exceeding the scope of ensuring the  continuity of safeguards agreed with us [uriwa habuihan tamboui  yonsoksong pojang pomwirul hwolsin chowol hanun], we showed the  utmost good will of acceding to [suyonghaejunun] the IAEA demand  as best as possible.    We have also made all the efforts we can, such as holding  the  North-South working delegates contacts several times and  proposing specific ways and proper measures to realize the  exchange of the special envoys of the North and the South.    However, since the announcement of the 25 February New York  agreement, the U.S. side made only empty talk [pinmal]. It did  not implement even one of its duties. Even though the United  States announced the suspension of the Team Spirit-94 joint  military exercise and the date for the second round of DPRK-U.S.  talks, it put forth an unreasonable precondition by saying that  it will implement these when the IAEA's inspection is carried  out satisfactorily and the exchange of special envoys of the  North and South is realized. This is a violation of the New  York agreement which regards simultaneous movement [tongsi  umjigiungot] as a principle.    The United States is instead making false charges by saying  that the IAEA's inspection we received is unsatisfactory and  that the exchange of special envoys of the North and South was  not realized. Thus, it moved toward the road of overturning the  New York agreement in which it decided to take simultaneous  action measures.    If we do not allow the IAEA's reinspection and do not  realize  the exchange of special envoys of the North and South, the  United States is saying that it will resume the Team Spirit-94  joint military exercise, suspend the third round of DPRK-U.S.  talks, and hand our issue over to the UN Security Council.    At the same time, the IAEA Secretariat is launching the game  to adopt a resolution to oppose us by convening the Board of  Governor's meeting. At a decisive important period when the  resolution of the nuclear issue is right before our eyes, the  United States overturned the New York agreement openly and  completely destroyed [homuloborida] the basis of the third round  of talks. Thus, the United States prevented the prospects for  resolving the nuclear issue. This stems from the unchanged  hostile policy toward the North by the United States.    The fact that the United States put forth an unreasonable  precondition which is not even written in the New York agreement  itself clearly shows that their intention from the beginning was  not to resolve the nuclear issue through the DPRK-U.S. talks,  but instead that this precondition was pursued under a political  goal to crush [apsal] our Republic.    The United States is distorting as if its unjustifiable  preconditions were those which were agreed with us. However,  these unjustifiable preconditions were rejected by our just  assertion when the New York agreement was discussed.    Nevertheless, after announcing the agreement, persistently  insisting on the unilateral preconditions which were rejected by  us cannot but be interpreted as an intentional scheme to  overturn the New York agreement and, thus, to create a situation  of confrontation.    In reality, using the issue of the IAEA inspections and the  North-South exchange of special envoys as the pretexts, the  United States openly has laid bare its attempt to persistently  wage the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise and to impose  sanctions against us at the UN Security Council and, thus, is  leading the international anti-Republic pressure commotion.    All facts have clearly proven that the United States has no  intent to hold talks any longer nor has it the will to solve the  nuclear issue and that it is attempting to isolate and crush us  by taking advantage [konggan] of the nuclear issue and the  DPRK-U.S. talks.    Because of such a breach of faith by the United States, a  grave situation which may drive the entire nation into an aspect  of confrontation and war is coming to the Korean peninsula today.    Because the United States is leading the situation to an  extreme [kuktan] by overturning the New York agreement and  breaking up the DPRK-U.S. talks, it has become impossible for us  to unilaterally implement any longer our duty related to the  simultaneous action measures. Proceeding from this we has  decided not to send our delegation to the third round of the  DPRK-U.S. talks.    Now that the United States and the IAEA are deliberately  distorting the results of the current inspections held to ensure  the continuity of safeguards and, thus, are abusing them as the  pretext of their anti-Republic pressure we will no longer  consider it to be our duty to guarantee the continuity of the  safeguards of the agency.    This step of ours is taken pursuant to the principle of the  New York agreement dated on 25 February that stipulates that the  execution of the agreed-upon four simultaneous actions is needed  for the overall implementation of the agreement.    As long as the United States overturns the promise made with  us, we will not be bound by our promise made with the United  States. This position of ours is firm and consistent.    In the 12 March 1993 statement issued by the Government of  our Republic, we note that the basic reason for our declaration  of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]  was the U.S. policy of nuclear threat and of crushing us,  including the Team Spirit joint military exercise and the IAEA's  partiality.    In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement issued in New York on 11  February 1993, we made it clear that we would unilaterally and  tentatively suspend the effectuation of the withdrawal from the  NPT on the premise that the DPRK and United States would  continue talks to settle the nuclear issue.    If the United States persistently avoids the DPRK-U.S. talks  and resumes the Team Spirit-94 joint military exercise, thus  increasing the nuclear threat against us, and if the IAEA  further expands its unfairness by distorting the result of its  inspection of us and takes forcible measures and pressures, we  will have to take the direction of putting into practice the  measures declared in the Republic Government's statement dated  12 March of last year in order to defend the nation's  sovereignty and the country's security.    We are not in a hurry at all even if the DPRK-U.S. talks are  not held, thus causing the settlement of the nuclear issue to be  delayed. The United States should ponder about the seriousness  of the present situation created and see it squarely.    21 March 1994, Pyongyang</p>

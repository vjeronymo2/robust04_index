			<p>BFN     [Text] [Reporter] The situation today is similar to that of  recent days. All day the whole town of Gorazde was under heavy  shelling, which has not stopped this evening. Here is what  hospital director Alija Dogovic told us about the situation in  the Gorazde war hospital:    [Begin recording] [Dogovic] In the past hour, since it  became  dark [passage indistinct] the hours of hell, the wounded in a  horrifying condition [passage indistinct] without bandages --  have been arriving. Many are in a very critical condition.  [passage indistinct] We have no more people to give blood. They  cannot come here. Those who are giving blood and those who are  receiving it are bleeding. [end recording]    [Reporter] Foreign journalists were today particularly  interested in whether the situation in Gorazde had changed after  NATO's ultimatum to the aggressor's side. Esad Ohranovic, the  president of the executive committee of the Gorazde district,  answered the question.    [Begin recording] [Ohranovic] The intensity of shelling is  not the same as during the day, but an occasional shell lands  even as I am speaking. The Serbs are firing from anti-aircraft  weapons, but not with the same intensity as before. The  shelling did not stop after 1900. We could say that the  intensive shelling stopped around 2000 or 2015. However, they  have continued shelling and firing from anti-aircraft weapons,  but with reduced intensity. [end recording]    [Reporter] Asked how many causalties there were as a result  of the chetnik attacks on Gorazde today, Esad Ohranovic said:    [Begin recording] [Ohranovic] There are fewer casualties  than  yesterday, but I have to tell you that between 0800 and 2000 59  people were killed and 143 slightly or seriously wounded.

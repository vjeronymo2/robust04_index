			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday [23 February] the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] demanded that the DPRK designate the date  of inspection of nuclear facilities before next Monday [28  February].    The statement, announced after the meeting of the IAEA Board  of Governors in Vienna that day, noted that the IAEA is  concerned with the fact that DPRK has been delaying the date of  nuclear inspection, and warned that if Pyongyang fails to  designate the date of nuclear inspection by the end of this  month, the Board of Governors would convene a plenary meeting  and would demand that the IAEA Secretary- General  comprehensively (?reexamine) the issue of North Korea's nuclear  inspection.    According to a report, the DPRK will not yield to pressure.  The DPRK representative to the IAEA said that only on the  condition that the United States make certain concessions  [iljonghan yangbo] including the cancellation of the Team Spirit  joint military exercise with the ROK, can the DPRK declare an  inspection date for the seven nuclear facilities in the DPRK.</p>

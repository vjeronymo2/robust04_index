			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Debt stalks Indonesia donors: The problems of a leading aid recipient INDONESIA'S international donors, who began their annual three-day meeting in Paris yesterday, might be forgiven for withholding their pens for a moment before signing away an expected Dollars 5bn in aid. While Indonesia has a strong record of economic growth, the pace of liberalisation has slowed and new impediments to prosperity have emerged. Among the world's largest recipients of aid, the country has been lauded by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank as their star pupil. Moving from an oil-based economy in the early 1980s, Indonesia has used its cheap labour and abundant natural resources to develop an array of labour-intensive export industries. The growth in non-oil exports, which last year totalled Dollars 21.9bn (Pounds 14.6bn), has averaged 18 per cent over the past five years, with 26 per cent annual growth in manufactures, such as textiles, shoes and timber products. Donors expect manufacturing to rise from 16 per cent of gross domestic product now to 23 per cent by the year 2000. The government has also reined back a current account deficit of Dollars 4.3bn in 1991-92 to an estimated Dollars 2.9bn in 1992-93. Public and private foreign debt grew nearly 9 per cent last year to about Dollars 87bn  -resulting in a 31 per cent debt service ratio - but as one donor executive explains, 'next year will see a considerable slowing in Indonesia's absolute debt'. Concerns surround the domestic banking sector, however, and there is a fear that many of Indonesia's conglomerates are concealing a midden of debt in their accounts. Unlikely to be participating in Indonesia's export-drive this year are more than 300 businessmen on whom the government slapped a six-month travel ban last week. Government officials say the businessmen are each at least Rp250m (Pounds 80,000)in default to the state banks and state companies. They add that the ban is coincidental with the leaking of an alleged list of the state banks' worst corporate debtors compiled by the monetary authorities. The list, not yet verified by government officials, shows 26 companies - many politically well-connected, including three led by relatives of President Suharto - not servicing loans totalling Rp6,900bn. If accurate, the list would confirm the worst estimates of the banking sector's non-performing loans. The sector's assets total about Rp130,000bn, split almost evenly between state and private banks. The government line is that non-performing loans total about Rp8,000bn, of which Rp3,500bn are considered unrecoverable. A World Bank report last month, however, stated that 'loan portfolio quality has deteriorated sharply since 1990, with conservative estimates that classified (non-performing) loans represented about 15 per cent of all bank loans in late 1992' or closer to Rp20,000bn. The travel ban may be a welcome sign of the government's determination to right the sector's wrongs. It would also go some way to placating donors frustrated by the government's apparent reluctance in the past two years to maintain the pace of economic liberalisation. A deregulation package earlier this month disappointed economists, making marginal reductions in the level of tariffs and opening up minor sectors to foreign investors. As the World Bank report made clear, with more than 9,200 categories, Indonesia's tariff system remains too complex and 'non-tariff barriers and effective rates of protection are high'. Donors believe there is increasing collusion between importers and customs officials to evade tariffs. There has been a decline in imports undergoing pre-shipment inspection (to which all shipments above a value of Dollars 5,000 are subject) from 67 per cent five years ago to just 47 per cent last year. Not only is the government losing revenue, but economists argue tariffs and import controls are stifling potential export industries. For instance, processed food, despite Indonesia's broad agricultural base, constituted less than 2 per cent of non-oil exports in the last seven years. The industry's competitiveness has been damaged by government control of the import and retail price of sugar, a key input in food processing, which has kept the domestic price more than 30 per cent above the world market. Removing tariffs, however, would damage the interests of many politically well-connected companies. And while the donors would like the pace of reform to quicken, too many demands will rile government ministers. Two decades of funding has left donors financially exposed, a fact which gives Jakarta almost as much leverage over its benefactors as vice versa.</p>

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: OLD RADIOS ARE BECOMING POPULAR  </P> <P> Question: I collect old radios and would like to get in touch with other  collectors in this area. -- T.D.  </P> <P> Answer: About a year ago, we answered a collectible question that showcased the  Southern California Antique Radio Society and its interesting journal.  Recently, we received a letter from one of the group's directors, Floyd Paul,  who wrote that the club's membership has climbed to approximately 800 members,  mostly in this area, but that it also includes about 100 members nationally  plus a handful abroad.  </P> <P> Paul says there is great interest in collecting antique radios. He writes:  </P> <P> "The club continues to meet quarterly in the Southern California area. New  members seem to relate to the '40s and '50s. Collectibles include tape and wire  recorders, TVs, solid-state radios, tube radios, horn speakers, battery radios  and test equipment, among other items.  </P> <P> "The club invites new members who share an interest in preserving old radios  and associated equipment."  </P> <P> The club's quarterly journal -- the California Antique Radio Gazette -- has  been published for the past decade, said Paul, who is the editor. He says that  the nonprofit organization currently is searching for a museum site to display  some of its more notable collectible items.  </P> <P> "Most collectors," he says, "enjoy wood/plastic radios of the '30s, '40s and  '50s, which may be worth $10 to $50 each.  </P> <P> "There are lots of old radios yet to come out of attics and garages, and the  Gazette helps identify these and give history about them."  </P> <P> Individuals interested in joining the society should write the membership  secretary, Mary Ireland, 24100-E Avenida Rancheros, Diamond Bar, Calif. 91765.  </P> <P> The group's next meeting, on May 19, will feature its annual auction, including  radio sets, equipment, magazines and books. It's a luncheon scheduled for the  Velvet Turtle restaurant, 3210 W. Sepulveda Blvd., Torrance.  </P> <P> In the May issue of the Gazette is a piece on the history of the Zenith  Trans-Oceanic radio, which generated a recent question from a collector who  thought he had one of the earliest models.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Glenview, Ill.-based firm, John Taylor, said collectors can  tell the approximate year of manufacture by checking the radio's model numbers.  </P> <P> "That was the workhorse," he said, noting that of the "tens of thousands" that  were manufactured over a four-decade period, a large number are still providing  good service.  </P> <P> "I have an original sitting in my office and it still works," he said in a  recent telephone interview. "It's one of the most long-lived products in the  consumer electronics industry."  </P> <P> In 1982, its last year of manufacture, the Trans-Oceanic -- by then produced in  Taiwan -- was battling foreign competitors, who were dramatically underpricing  it. At the time, Taylor recalled, the model's retail price was about $450.  </P> <P> According to the Gazette article, provided by Zenith, the idea for the  Trans-Oceanic was hatched by the company's late founder-president, Commander E.  F. McDonald Jr., who, in 1939, found that standard broadcast reception at his  Canadian fishing lodge was poor.  </P> <P> McDonald "asked the company's engineering staff to develop an experimental  shortwave battery-operated portable radio," the article states. "With this set  aboard his electric trolling boat, the commander was able to receive weather  predictions by shortwave from Lorain, Ohio, and, out of curiosity, even  programs from London."  </P> <P> Thus, the Trans-Oceanic was born. Succeeding sets had broader bands for easier  tuning. After more than two years of research, which included a test in the  remote Arctic, the set went into mass production before the Zenith factory had  to convert to war production.  </P></p>

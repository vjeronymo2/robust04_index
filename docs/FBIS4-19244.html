			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["pra"-signed commentary: "German-Turkish Lessons"] </F>   [Text] Anyone who says A need not say B; he may realize  that A was wrong. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has probably  realized that "materiel aid" to Turkey (tanks and ammunition  from the stocks of the GDR's National People's Army at a value  of 1.5 billion marks) was a mistake. This mistake cannot be  rectified, but one can avoid continuing it. This is, in short,  the contents of yesterday's government statement.    Turkey's promise not to use the weapons against the Kurds  was  worth little right from the very beginning. Even if it had been  kept: These deliveries would have enabled the Turks to withdraw  their own military equipment from other parts of the country and  to use it in Kurdistan. Thus, German armament aid was not  "Kurd-neutral" right from the start; by the way, this also  applies to NATO defense aid to Turkey. Therefore, the Foreign  Ministry should not try to save itself from the maelstrom of the  conflict with silly hairsplitting: Photographs from Kurdistan  do indeed show German tanks, it is admitted now, but the tanks  are not shown shooting to kill.... As if this mattered! The  arms deliveries were a mistake -- which, of course, provided  economic profit: The export was much cheaper than scrapping the  tanks in Germany.    The Federal Government now has a special obligation: It must  energetically advocate an acceptable minority policy in Turkey:  The European Union should send a commissioner to the Kurdish  area, and Turkey must understand that the association  negotiations depend on concessions in this area.</p>

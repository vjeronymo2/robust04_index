			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Ford-Werke plunges into DM469m loss after charge FADING markets and hefty restructuring costs plunged Ford's German subsidiary into a DM469m (Dollars 293m) net loss last year, the first since 1985, the company reported yesterday. Mr John Hardiman, chairman of Ford-Werke, said the charges for a rationalisation programme introduced last autumn, including provisions for action this year, added DM814m to 1992 costs. Without this burden the company would have shown a pre-tax profit of DM400m, compared with DM142m in 1991, he added. Production in the first half of this year was down 15 per cent at 459,000 vehicles, and unit sales had fallen 17 per cent to 469,000. Prospects for the full 12 months were 'rather gloomy', Mr Hardiman said. According to Mr Norbert Kuhne, finance director, 1993 results would be especially hard hit by the effects of turbulence in foreign exchange markets. In the year so far, sterling was still registering a 16 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark compared with the same period in 1991. The lire had devalued 21 per cent and the Swedish crown 21 per cent. The company expected that total German new car registrations would fall 23 per cent, he added. This compares with more common forecasts of a 20 per cent fall from other leading German motor manufacturers. At the same time, Mr Kuhne said, there was a trend among German customers to buy smaller cars which offered manufacturers smaller margins. Since 1990, the proportion of the German industry's domestic sales accounted for by these vehicles had risen to 59 per cent from 52 per cent. Mr Hardiman said a positive aspect was the introduction of the Mondeo, the company's replacement for the Sierra. About 188,000 had been built in the first half, a 35 per cent improvement on its successor. Another was that Ford-Werke had increased its European market share to 12.1 per cent from 11.8 per cent, he said. During 1992, although overall sales remained stable at DM22bn, domestic turnover tumbled 17 per cent to DM8bn while exports rose 10 per cent to DM14bn, raising the proportion of export turnover to 64 per cent, compared with 57 per cent in 1991. Manufacturing costs fell by 1 per cent to DM20bn, according to Mr Kuhne.</p>

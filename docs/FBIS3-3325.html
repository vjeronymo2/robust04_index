However, it added, if more money is owed, "any amounts  underpaid will be paid."    Clinton told reporters Friday [18 March] that any mistakes  on  his and his wife's tax returns "certainly were not  intentional.... I don't think we owe any extra taxes, but I'm  not sure yet."    His comments came amid increasing indications that the  Clintons may have underpaid their income taxes over the past 15  years. The records are being scrutinized as part of the special  counsel's investigation into the Clintons' investments in the  1980s in the Whitewater Development Corp. Inc. in Arkansas.    The Clintons' tax returns "have been professionally prepared  by qualified CPA's (certified public accountants), and we have  confidence that they were correctly done," the White House said  in a statement.    "Should any facts emerge that indicate that they owe more or  less in taxes, any amounts underpaid will be paid," the  statement added.    David Kendall, the Clintons' personal lawyer, is reviewing  the records with regard to their taxes, said a White House aide  who declined to be named. The official added that it was too  early to draw conclusions on whether the Clintons owe money.    Vincent Foster, the late deputy White House counsel and Mrs.  Clinton's law partner in Arkansas, discovered that the  Whitewater Development Corp., which was half owned by the  Clintons, had not filed tax returns for three years, according  to the March 21 "TIME" magazine.</p>

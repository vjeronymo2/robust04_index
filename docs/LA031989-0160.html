			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TOROS TAKE 3RD PLACE IN REGIONAL TOURNEY;  </P> <P> SEASON'S 20TH WIN COMES A DAY LATE AFTER LAST-DITCH LOSS TO BAKERSFIELD  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills won its 20th game of the season here Saturday night,  but it came a day too late to really matter.  </P> <P> The Toros built a 19-point lead in the first half on the strength of eight  three-point baskets to win the third-place game of the Division II Western  Regional tournament, 98-77, over Sonoma State.  </P> <P> The game was merely a season-ending formality. Both teams were eliminated from  advancing further in postseason play Friday night. Dominguez Hills (20-10) lost  to Cal State Bakersfield, 64-61, while Sonoma (17-14) was beaten by UC  Riverside, 79-63. Riverside won Saturday's championship game, 63-60.  </P> <P> For Dominguez Hills, senior center Anthony Blackmon scored 27 points, and  senior guard Derrick Clark had 15 points, nine assists and six rebounds.  Sophomore guard Robert Barksdale added 18 points and 11 assists.  </P> <P> This tournament will be remembered, perhaps, more for the tension off the floor  than for the play inside Bakersfield's month-old, 3,700-seat gym.  </P> <P> First, there were the front-page headlines, both here and out of town, that  Bakersfield officials had "bought" a spot in this tournament for their team --  which finished two games behind Dominguez Hills in the regular California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. standings -- by offering a $24,000 guarantee, the  largest in Division II history.  </P> <P> University officials vehemently denied the charge, but players from UC  Riverside, the top-seeded team, showed up here Thursday for practice with  T-shirts that said "FOR SALE: NCAA Division II Western Regional."  </P> <P> So incensed was Riverside Coach John Masi that he would not allow his players  to talk to the Bakersfield press.  </P> <P> There were a few hard feelings on the Toro sidelines, as well, when it was  learned that Blackmon, the CCAA player of the year, was not voted to the  Division II All-American team, despite being named to the all-Western Regional  team. Making the team instead was guard Maurice Pullum of Riverside, who was  also named the tournament's most valuable player.  </P> <P> By the time the championship game between Riverside and Bakersfield rolled  around at 8 p.m. Saturday, the extra tension was evident.  </P> <P> It was a game Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai thought his team should have  been in. Bakersfield defeated Dominguez Hills in two of their three meetings,  but in 120 minutes of play against each other, Bakersfield held the lead for  only 4:20. In Friday night's game, Dominguez Hills led by as many as nine  points, but much as in their second meeting, a last-second 52-50 loss in  Carson, the Toros couldn't hold on.  </P> <P> Still, the season ended on a high note Saturday. This was Yanai's fifth 20-win  season, and the victory over Sonoma State snapped a four-game regional playoff  losing streak. In addition, Dominguez Hills ranked third in the nation in  defense, holding opponents to about 60 points a contest.  </P> <P> "It's nice to come away with a taste of victory," Yanai said. "This season has  been a real positive one. These players are tremendous people. It has been an  absolute pleasure to coach them."  </P></p>

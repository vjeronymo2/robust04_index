			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Key senator urges return of Nafta to White House CHAIRMAN of the key Senate Finance Committee, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, yesterday said the North American Free Trade Agreement could be returned by Congress to the White House for further negotiation, a move which might effectively kill the pact. 'I am a free trader with free countries,' said Mr Moynihan, whose committee has jurisdiction over all trade legislation. His reservations, expressed in an interview on US television yesterday, indicate that the pact could be in as much trouble in the Senate as in the House, where it is deeply unpopular. Senator Moynihan is a long-time ally of the labour movement, which is holding anti-Nafta rallies all over the country. 'The Mexican government is an authoritarian government,' he said. 'They don't have an independent judiciary. They don't have free elections. They have lots of laws which they enforce very selectively.' This raised the question of how much the US should depend on Mexico's institutions for enforcement of Nafta, he said. In the hope of pacifying the labour movement, the Clinton administration negotiated a side agreement to ensure enforcement of Mexico's progressive labour laws. But the Mexican government refused to commit itself to easing restrictions on labour unions. American unions have made the defeat of Nafta their top priority. In the current atmosphere of job insecurity the trade agreement threatens to become as divisive an issue as any in recent memory. Mr David Bergen, a senior presidential adviser, acknowledged Nafta would lose if voted on today. But 'public opinion is very malleable,' he said.</p>

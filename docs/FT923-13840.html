			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Kodak to sell 10 non-core businesses EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment, yesterday said it planned to sell 10 non-core businesses, including its Atex and Desktop Document Imaging operations which are now in the hands of investment bankers. Kodak, which is in the throes of its fifth restructuring since 1982, said it had received offers for its Datatape, Estek and Videk businesses and for a project that is part of the company's government contract business. Mr Leo Thomas, president of Kodak's imaging group, said: 'We are still determining how to proceed with the other four (businesses). This action is in line with our commitment to exit businesses that are not well aligned with the company's long-term strategy in imaging." Kodak also said it had expanded an informal alliance with Canon, shifting the focus to office products. The earlier office imaging arrangement with Canon, which began in 1984, had concentrated on original-equipment-manufacturer supply projects and technical exchanges. The new arrangement will allow the companies to embark on joint development and manufacturing projects. Mr Thomas expects the terms of the Canon alliance 'will work to enlarge the business by providing our customers with even better products and services. The copy businesses represents significant sales and growth potential and our new 1500 and 2100 copiers represent real product leadership.'</p>

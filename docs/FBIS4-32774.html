			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 30 May (PL) -- The Cuban and Belgian  Governments have concurred on the illegality of the violent  entrance to the residence of the Belgian ambassador in this  capital by a group of people on 28 May.    Serafin Rodriguez, chief of the Cuban Foreign Relations  Ministry European Affairs Department, today told PRENSA LATINA  that this conclusion was reached during the negotiations held by  the two parties to resolve the situation triggered by those who  illegally entered the house.    Over 100 people have been inside the residence for more than  40 hours. They are attempting to pressure Belgian diplomats to  request their departure from the country.    Today, Paul Vermkirsch, leader of the Belgian delegation in  Cuba, who has refused to give statements to the media, went to  the Foreign Ministry and met with officials from the European  Affairs Department and from other Foreign Ministry departments.    PRENSA LATINA has discovered that in addition to ratifying  the Cuban position of refusing to accept the use of force  against foreign delegations in Cuba as a means to leave the  country, the purpose of the meetings was to reach a common  position on the illegality of the move.    Meanwhile, it was also agreed that once they leave the  residence, those who want to travel to Belgium, or any other  nation, must start the official procedures to obtain visas.    Rodriguez explained that the Foreign Ministry advised the  Belgian ambassador that it will not refuse to help the Belgian  legation acquire supplies needed to take care of the unexpected  guests.    Meanwhile, residents of the Havana neighborhood of Miramar,  where the Belgian ambassador's residence is located, told PRENSA  LATINA that early this morning, one person who was inside the  residence decided to leave and went home without being  intimidated by local authorities.    A discreet police surveillance is under way in the area  without interrupting the normal movement of vehicles and people,  as well as the presence of journalists and news photographers in  the area.</p>

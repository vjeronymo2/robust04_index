			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Spanish Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion by </F> Jose Maria Brunet; place, date not given]    [Excerpt] [introductory passage omitted] [Brunet] What  circumstances define the antiterrorist struggle at the beginning  of 1994?    Asuncion: We are undoubtedly faring better. A  great deal of progress has been made in the public response to  violence in the Basque Country. It is noteworthy progress for  society to reject this, and for the parties, despite the  wrenches which may be thrown in the works, to maintain their  consensus on terrorism. The purely policing aspect must be  adjusted to the responses which have to be made at each moment.  In the political sphere, we must continue as before. The fact  that platforms for peace are proliferating and organizations  whose origin lies in the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party]  political area are softening their message and daring to say  that violence leads nowhere, seems to me important. There is a  substantial change. This is undoubtedly drawing Herri Batasuna  toward a new strategy; hence the dialogue-oriented face which  those who have been protecting the crime syndicate now wish to  present. So it is a good thing that they wish to present that  image, but I have the impression that it is purely electoral  strategy; that they are going to see whom they deceive.    Brunet: That is happening while attacks are  taking place in Madrid and Barcelona.    Asuncion: Yes, but that is the inconsistency of  what is a purely electoral strategy on the part of Herri  Batasuna, with that image which they wish to present, which  concerns them. But they have not stopped. We have had attempts  and one casualty in Barcelona since I arrived at this ministry.  There have been attempts in Huesca, at a Civil Guard barracks,  bombs attached to vehicles in Bilbao, 60 kg of amonal  [explosive] in Madrid, and the attack on a colonel in Barcelona.  Hence, the activity is continuing and we must be alert.    Brunet: You have a certain reputation as a  hard-liner. Does it weary you or are you now accustomed to the  idea?    Asuncion: It seems to me that it is completely  inappropriate that a democratically elected government, where  citizens are free to express themselves, to carry out their  political plans, and to conduct politically the representation  of the people, should have to sit down with a gang of criminals.  So it is not feasible for a democratically elected government  to negotiate with a gang of killers who represent only  themselves. I believe that it is not feasible, has no chance.    Brunet: Against the raising of principles, it can  be said that this was attempted in Algiers.    Asuncion: Nobody can be accused of a lack of will  to try everything, but it was found that that did not work out,  and from that point there has been nothing, nor can there be  anything. Algiers is unrepeatable.    Brunet: Does the reputation of being a hard-liner  bother you or not?    Asuncion: Few things bother me, but I believe  that it does not reflect reality. I am a completely normal  individual. I do not know the reason for that hard-liner label.  The fact is that it seems to me that there are stances on which  you cannot compromise. I do not believe that you can compromise  with these men of violence, and that you must make appropriate  responses. If that is being hard-line, I will be, but I believe  that that is a normal reaction.    Brunet: The impression has been formed that there  were other people at the Interior Ministry, such as Vera, who  were considering the possibility of dialogue.    Asuncion: Dialogue is impossible as long as they  continue to kill. There can be no dialogue with somebody who  does not wish to have it. I do not know exactly what Vera's  personal opinion was, but I wish to make it clear that the  government does not establish channels of dialogue with  terrorists, and so I believe that Rafael Vera complied in these  matters, which are government orders which are accepted. Vera  left because he was tired -- he said so on the first day -- and  I understand that fact.    Brunet: In the event of ETA [Basque Homeland and  Liberty] relinquishing its weapons, how far could the state go  in order to promote rehabilitation?    Asuncion: It is laid down in the legal  procedures. The framework created by parliament is the scope  which we have. Those who break the code are punished. The  grounds on which you justify your crime are the least of it.  Every criminal justifies his crime, but he commits it; breaks a  rule of conduct.    Brunet: There are people in the prisons who would  perhaps like to see new prospects...    Asuncion: The people who are in the prisons are  well acquainted with the prison law and the regulations. They  know very well to whom they must turn to that effect. The  oversight judges are the ones who oversee the carrying out of  sentences, and so that is not unknown. But if you are referring  to pardons, that is not feasible. The only thing that is  possible as a reference point is the political parties'  agreements, and the framework in which that takes place is the  Ajuria Enea pacts, which were later reproduced in Madrid. The  frame of reference is what is now accepted a priori by the  political parties.    Brunet: How is the dialogue with the People's  Party viewed at the Interior Ministry?    Asuncion: Whenever there is a pre-election  atmosphere, the People's Party uses these issues. I would ask  that we keep cool heads and that the elections do not entail a  deterioration in the political consensus on terrorism. That is  undoubtedly what would would delight Herri Batasuna; for there  to be discord in the area of the Ajuria Enea agreements. Our  duty is to prevent that from happening, with cool heads and  setting aside matters which could disturb that consensus. After  June, everything will return to normal, but we must prevent this  from breaking down now. My opinion is that the Herri Batasuna  area will attempt this. The steps which they are taking are to  try to deceive the first person to approach them. [passage  omitted]    Brunet: You say that there is nothing to discuss  with ETA. What about Herri Batasuna?    Asuncion: Herri Batasuna is now bringing a bill  before parliament. Let them speak. Let us see what they say.  This is a bill out of context, publicity seeking, because what  they want is to change the general organic prison law and the  penal code. It is a very strange bill, aimed at justifying the  lack of attention which these people in the Herri Batasuna area  have for the ETA prisoners. [passage omitted]    Brunet: Recently, three Herri Batasuna members  who were going to see Antxon in Santo Domingo were not allowed  in. Does that have anything to do with these opinions which you  are expressing?    Asuncion: It seems to me stupid that those who  are killing, as in the case of Barcelona, should go the next day  to see the sanhedrin in exile in order to explain. It seems to  me totally inconsistent. They have no reason now to play any  more charades of that kind.    Brunet: Was there an explicit request to the  Dominican Republic?    Asuncion: We would say that the meeting was not  authorized.    Brunet: Through diplomatic channels...    Asuncion: Of course. [passage omitted]</p>

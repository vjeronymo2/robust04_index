			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cash crisis threatens Nigerian earnings - Debts to private sector partners stand at Dollars 750m Nigeria's failure to fund the state's 60 per cent share of the country's 2m-barrels-a-day oil production is jeopardising its only major source of export earnings. As arrears due from the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its private sector partners reach about Dollars 750m, the multinationals who produce Nigeria's oil have suspended payments to contractors at oil fields and postponed investment in big projects until the government clears the five-month backlog. When the oil companies meet head of state General Sani Abacha later this month they will present him with a stark choice: scale down production capacity or divest some of the state's assets in the oil fields. Unless the government resolves the cash crisis, within two years oil production capacity will fall by 25 per cent. 'The trouble is that the people who run the country are not thinking about two years down the line, they seem to be more concerned with the next few weeks,' says an oil industry expert in Nigeria. Although the head of state's budget speech last month set aside Dollars 3.1bn for oil exploration and production, the oil majors say that NNPC has a dedicated account for cash calls to the value of 200,000 b/d, which at the budget's assumed price of Dollars 14 a barrel, is not nearly enough. The problem lies not with the budget but with implementation and it casts doubt on the government's claim to have made its accounts more transparent. The oil industry needs about Dollars 3.6bn this year to operate and maintain capacity. NNPC's share of that is just over Dollars 2bn. NNPC's arrears were at a tolerable level until mid-1993. But 'last year's dedicated account for NNPC's payments was not enough when oil prices fell', according to a senior oil executive. 'Arrears built up, reaching Dollars 455m by end of November. From the start of this year all payments have to be approved by the presidency.' Since General Abacha took over the government in November, payment of cash calls has almost dried up. In January, two cheques in naira from NNPC to Shell for local costs were bounced by the central bank, leading to a desperate scramble to pay salaries at the end of the month. In the face of a severe balance of payments deficit Nigeria needs every petrodollar it can get. The oil fields are producing at maximum capacity of about 2m b/d a day, just over its Opec quota for crude oil, and the government plans to raise capacity to 2.5m b/d to increase its quota and allow it to benefit from any future rally in the oil price. A sale of about 9 per cent of the equity in existing joint ventures could be politically damaging, but unless the cash crisis in the industry is resolved, the government's projections will become meaningless and the economy will be threatened with collapse. Last July the government breached its 40 per cent ceiling on foreign holdings in the oil joint ventures when it sold sold 5 per cent of the biggest venture, Shell's 955,000 b/d operation, to Elf Nigeria for about Dollars 500m, taking the combined Shell-Elf-Agip share to 45 per cent. Divestment of another 4 per cent of the Shell fields and 9 per cent of the joint ventures operated by Mobil, Chevron and others would leave NNPC with a majority stake but reduce government's cash calls to a more manageable level. The rapid investment by the oil multinationals in the gas industry will soon be competing for more scarce state funds. The final investment decision on the Liquefied Natural Gas plant is due next March and will require the government to put in another Dollars 1.2bn. Moreover, it has yet to secure its share of Chevron's Dollars 500m gas gathering project at the Escravos field. Meanwhile, private sector finance is providing the impetus for the exploration of new deep water blocks, following the award of exploration and production contracts to multinational oil companies last year.</p>

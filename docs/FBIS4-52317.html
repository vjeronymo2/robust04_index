			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vu Trung Hung, correspondent of the Binh Dinh </F> Province Radio and Television Station]    [Text] Lately, particularly since early 1994, Binh Dinh  province has intensified its efforts to deal with various cases  of smuggling. The market control force, in coordination with  the public security force and the authorities at various levels,  has made arrests involving large quantities of electronics goods  illicitly imported through the port of Qui Nhon. It has also  confiscated some 400,000 packs of foreign-brand cigarettes  smuggled through the Central Highlands to Qui Nhon, from where  they would have been transported to various northern and  southern provinces.    It is especially noted that the province has dealt with some  cases of car imports which were not carried out in accordance  with the state regulations.    After sending a report to the government, on 21 March 1994  the province people's committee decided to confiscate eight cars  with steering wheels on the opposite [right-hand] side which had  been illicitly imported and put into use by the Binh Dinh  Province Marine Import-Export Corporation.    On 3 May 1994 the provincial people's committee decided to  confiscate 38 sedan cars illicitly imported and kept at a  storage facility rented from the Dieu Tri branch of the 2d  Central Agricultural Supply Corporation in Danang. These cars  were later claimed by a number of people who said they were  representatives of the Khanh Hoa Province General Trading  Corporation, the Kon Tum Province General Trading Corporation,  the Nhatrang Sea Liners Supply Service Corporation, and the Thai  Binh Duong [Pacific] corporation under the Ministry of the  Interior. But these people were unable to produce any papers --  affidavits or powers of attorney -- of the agencies they claimed  to be representing. Although some of them did produce some  papers, there were many irregular and contradicting points found  in them. For instance, an import permit issued by the Nhatrang  licensing department was found to be at variance with the  regulations of the Ministry of Trade. All the owners of these  goods were found to have no authority or no licenses in the car  import-export business. There were also wrongdoings on the part  of the Binh Dinh Customs Office. For instance, the office did  not put the cars under temporary custody pending customs  measures. It kept them in storage without informing the local  administration of this. Customs control measures were taken  before some cars involved had arrived. Cars already checked by  customs were kept indiscriminately among unchecked cars.  Although imported through the port of Danang, some of the cars  were found when they arrived in Qui Nhon to have not gone  through control procedures as stipulated.    The Binh Dinh Province People's Committee has decided to  confiscate the 38 [as heard] cars cited above. The Provincial  Market Control Steering Committee has forwarded the files of  these cases to responsible investigation agencies to clarify  violations involving a number of customs cadres, some individual  owners of goods, and some agencies.    Binh Dinh province is also taking legal action against the  province's Marine Import-Export and Shipping Company on charges  of illicitly importing 73 car chassis, 60 automotive engines,  and 35 sets of truck chassis with engines, which were originally  trucks with steering wheels on the right-hand side.</p>

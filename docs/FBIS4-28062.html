			<p>BFN     [Text] Australia's parliament has set out a proposed  timetable for a cease-fire and a peace settlement to resolve the  five-and-a-half-year conflict on Bougainville. The report of  the Australian parliamentary delegation, which visited  Bougainville in April, was welcomed by the Australian  Government. The report calls for a cease-fire negotiated by  Bougainville interim authority, local chiefs, the police and  defense forces, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA], and  the extra-legal resistant forces.    The peace timetable calls for several weeks of consultations  and community meetings, agreement on a neutral chairman and  agenda, and parallel talks with the Papua New Guinea Government  and the BRA. Pacific island neighbors could provide natural  observers and they should be a guarantee of safety for all  participants. The report said Australia should offer to host  and support talks either in Bougainville or in the north  Queensland city of Cairns. The Australian parliamentarians  strongly recommended that the Papua New Guinea Government  authority should allow relief supplies to be delivered to the  whole of Bougainville.</p>

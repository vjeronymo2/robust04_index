For example, if a debt instrument is distributed by a partnership to a partner in a liquidating distribution and the partner's basis in the debt instrument would otherwise be determined under section 732, the partner's basis in the debt instrument may not exceed its fair market value for purposes of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acquisition by gift.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this section, a donee's adjusted basis in a debt instrument is the donee's basis for determining gain under section 1015(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. Debt instrument purchased at an acquisition premium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On July 1, 1994, A purchased at original issue, for $500, a debt instrument issued by Corporation X. The debt instrument matures on July 1, 1999, and calls for a single payment at maturity of $1,000. Under section 1273(a), the debt instrument has a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 and, thus, OID of $500. On July 1, 1996, when the debt instrument's adjusted issue price is $659.75, A sells the debt instrument to B for $750 in cash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Acquisition premium fraction.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Because the cost to B of the debt instrument is less than the amount payable on the debt instrument after the purchase date, but is greater than the debt instrument's adjusted issue price, B has paid an acquisition premium for the debt instrument. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID for any day that B holds the debt instrument is reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is $90.25 (the excess of the cost of the debt instrument over its adjusted issue price) and the denominator of which is $340.25 (the excess of the sum of all payments after the purchase date over its adjusted issue price).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. Debt-for-debt exchange where holder is considered to purchase new debt instrument at a premium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On January 1, 1995, H purchases at original issue, for $1,000, a debt instrument issued by Corporation X. On July 1, 1997, when H's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $1,000, Corporation X issues a new debt instrument with a stated redemption price at maturity of $750 to H in exchange for the old debt instrument. Assume that the issue price of the new debt instrument is $600. Thus, under section 1273(a), the debt instrument has OID of $150. The exchange qualifies as a recapitalization under section 368(a)(1)(E), with the consequence that, under sections 354 and 358, H recognizes no loss on the exchange and has an adjusted basis in the new debt instrument of $1,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Application of section 1272(c)(1).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, H purchases the new debt instrument at a premium of $250. Accordingly, under section 1272(c)(1), H is not required to include OID in income with respect to the new debt instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. Debt-for-debt exchange where holder is considered to purchase new debt instrument at an acquisition premium <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of paragraph (c) of this section, except that H purchases the old debt instrument from another holder on July 1, 1995, and on July 1, 1997, H's adjusted basis in the old debt instrument is $700. Under section 1273(a), the new debt instrument is issued with OID of $150.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Application of section 1272(a)(7).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section, H purchases the new debt instrument at an acquisition premium of $100. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID that is includible in H's income is reduced by the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. Treatment of acquisition premium for debt instrument acquired by gift <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Facts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On July 1, 1994, D receives as a gift a debt instrument with a stated redemption price at maturity of $1,000 and an adjusted issue price of $800. On that date, the fair market value of the debt instrument is $900 and the donor's adjusted basis in the debt instrument is $950.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Application of section 1272(a)(7).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3), and (b)(6)(ii) of this section, D is considered to have purchased the debt instrument at an acquisition premium of $150. Accordingly, the daily portion of OID that is includible in D's income is reduced by the fraction determined under section 1272(a)(7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

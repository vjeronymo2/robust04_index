			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTAMINATED HAY BLAMED FOR MYSTERY HORSE DEATHS  </P> <P> State agriculture officials Wednesday blamed hay cubes contaminated with a  botulism bacteria for the mystifying deaths of at least 15 horses in stables  across Southern California over the past two weeks.  </P> <P> Laboratory tests confirmed that from two to three pounds of the candy bar-sized  cubes, collected at a San Bernardino County stable where three horses died,  contained remains of a rabbit that may have carried the bacteria, officials  said in a news conference at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center in  Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> It was there that the puzzling malady came to light Oct. 28, and in the space  of a few days claimed the lives of seven horses. Two other horses at the center  have been stricken with similar symptoms -- quivering muscles, difficulty  breathing and dull eyes -- but remained alive Wednesday night.  </P> <P> State officials and local veterinarians, encouraged that no new cases have been  reported since Tuesday, expressed optimism that the crisis that had alarmed  stable owners and equestrians has ended.  </P> <P> "Each day that passes with no reports of new victims is a positive sign that we  may have isolated the problem," said Irvine veterinarian John Byrd, who treated  the sick horses at the Costa Mesa equestrian center. "For the first time in a  week, we're feeling better."  </P> <P> In all, officials said that 15 horses have died -- seven in Orange County,  three in Chino, three in Los Angeles County and two in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Investigators focused on the possibility of botulism after eliminating other  potential culprits such as rabies, strychnine, heavy metals, pesticides or  infectious viruses.  </P> <P> Dennis Thompson, a state Department of Food and Agriculture veterinarian, said  hay cubes had been fed to each of the afflicted horses.  </P> <P> Early on, veterinarians had suspected botulism, a type of food poisoning. But  it was not confirmed until cubes from the Prado Park Stables in Chino were  analyzed and animal remains were found.  </P> <P> The tainted cubes, Thompson said, were processed in Utah, where the hay was cut  and then compressed into pellets by a harvesting combine. Thompson said the  rabbit may have been caught in the harvesting machinery, then shredded and  pressed into the cubes.  </P></p>

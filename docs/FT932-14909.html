			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Revenue computer staff vote for strike action INLAND REVENUE computer staff have voted to take industrial action, including a one-day strike, in protest at their division being contracted-out to the private sector. Industrial action by the traditionally moderate Inland Revenue Staff Federation could disrupt the transfer of tax payments of up to Pounds 500m a day to the Bank of England. The Revenue said its management would take 'whatever action was necessary' to maintain services so that a strike would have a minimal effect, if any, on the national taxation system. The information technology division, which employs 2,700 computer staff, is the largest division to be contracted out within the Revenue. Other smaller parts of the Revenue have been contracted out following market testing, the first step in a process that can lead to the contracting-out of services provided in-house. This year more than 44,000 civil servants are having to compete against outside contractors to keep their jobs. In-house bids are not being invited for the information technology division. Invitations to tender for what unions claim is a privatisation are being made at present with a rolling programme of contracting-out to begin next January. The federation, which represents about 2,000 of the staff, is opposed to the move and is particularly concerned that staff should not be be adversely affect. A detailed 20-point claim has been submitted to management, including demands for staff to be seconded to the new enterprise with an option to transfer back to the Civil Service. Other demands include an employee involvement scheme in the private company, full guarantees on terms and conditions and pensions to be topped up on transfer. Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the federation, said that if the contracting-out went ahead his members wanted real choices about their future and guarantees should be given about their pensions. He said that confidential information about every taxpayer and business in the country was being put at risk by the privatisation. He added: 'Every week we hear of misuse of personal information by finance companies and yet the government insists on putting everyone's tax affairs at risk by this move.' Two ballots calling for protection of terms and conditions should privatisation occur were held with 937 voting for a one-day strike with 407 opposed. Some 1,086 voted for industrial action short of a strike with 253 against.</p>

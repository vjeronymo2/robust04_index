			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Turkish current account boost Turkey's current account showed a surplus of Dollars 342m (Pounds 225m) in April, the first sign of the effect of government austerity measures. The current account deficit in the first quarter was reduced to Dollars 778m compared with Dollars 1.8bn in 1993. The figures appear to support government forecasts that the current account will be close to balanced this year, against a record deficit of Dollars 6.3bn in 1993, following the sharp contraction in domestic demand and the lira's devaluation. Official reserves fell Dollars 3bn in the first quarter, as the central bank sought unsuccessfully to prop up the lira. There was also a Dollars 1.4bn short-term capital outflow in the period, compared with an inflow of Dollars 1.3bn in 1993, as banks closed their foreign exchange positions. Tourism revenues were steady at Dollars 690m. Debt servicing in the first quarter - principal and interest - rose to Dollars 2.4bn, against Dollars 1.3bn in 1993, reflecting increased foreign borrowings last year. Orders for west German builders were up 3.8 per cent in April from a year earlier and rose 6.2 per cent in the first four months of 1994. New housing orders were up 18 per cent in April and 27 per cent in the first four months of 1994. German crude steel output rose 8.4 per cent to 20.16m tonnes in the first half this year from a year ago. Poland had a current account deficit of Dollars 30m in May after a surplus of Dollars 45m in the previous month.</p>

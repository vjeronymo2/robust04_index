			<p>BFN     [Text] Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, has said that the area to be used as  access to Famagusta's fenced-off area will remain under Turkish  control, that no territory will be returned, and that the United  Nations will be in charge of protecting access and guaranteeing  the safety of those who will use the road. The UN envoy made  these revelations in a speech on the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] at the Carnegie Institute in Washington.    Commenting on Turkish criticism that the UN document of 21  March has been modified, Clark said that rigid interpretation of  the package would give the two sides no serious benefits. The  UN envoy said the Turkish Cypriots will have the right to  communicate with the outside world through direct flights and  will be given travel documents by countries that don't do so  now. They will also be able to charter flights for passengers  and cargo.    Clark noted that the Greek Cypriot side stressed that the  CBM's package goes a long way toward lifting the embargo. In  his address, the UN envoy mentioned that the United Nations is  trying to persuade various countries, particularly European, to  begin facilitating Turkish Cypriot travel the day the Greek  Cypriots return to Famagusta's fenced-off area. It is also  asking the countries concerned to commit themselves to  negotiations for offering landing and take-off rights to a  Turkish Cypriot airline.    The United Nations is also trying to ensure that the Turkish  Cypriots will benefit earlier from international, economic, and  technological assistance.    Although three different views were expressed at the UN  Security Council [UNSC] on what must be done if no agreement is  reached on the CBM's, the five UNSC permanent members are  focusing on the success of Clark's new tour of Ankara and  Nicosia. According to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation's  correspondent in New York, diplomatic circles believe that it is  doubtful whether Clark's tour will be effective because it has  been proven that the U.S. Government is sending the wrong  messages to Ankara by stressing that the Greek Cypriot side must  accept some concessions on access to Famagusta, that it will not  press Ankara, and that it is not ready to discuss alternative  ways at the Security Council. The same circles say that  Russia's position on the dispatch of a UNSC delegation to Cyprus  to study ways to lift the embargo is more positive. But they  note that while it is a significant counterproposal to the U.S.  position, the Russian initiative does not have much chance of  being accepted now.    The diplomatic circles also noted that Britain appears ready  to discuss alternative ways but links them with the UN secretary  general's proposal that he will want to evaluate the situation  personally and that he will suggest nothing that will not be  fully supported by the five permanent members.</p>

Kerny, the first  chief editor of an independent Slovak news agency, was recalled  40 minutes after Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac, who praised  TA SR's reportage and said that it was "done well, to a high  professional standard," had left the agency's offices. Kerny  managed the editorial office during the transition period  following independence from the CTK service and organized the  first direct subscription to foreign news agencies, including  REUTER, AFP, DPA, and others.

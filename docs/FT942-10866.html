			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Israel stresses role of US as peace mediator Peace talks between Israel and Syria have reached a new level but will depend entirely on active US mediation, Mr Yossi Beilin, Israeli deputy foreign minister, said yesterday. In an interview Mr Beilin said Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, would return to the region on Saturday for a diplomatic shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem aimed at advancing the talks over the return to Syria of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in return for full peace. It will be Mr Christopher's second Israeli-Syrian shuttle in less than a month. 'I can't see any prospects for peace in the Middle East, especially peace between us and Syria, without the US,' said Mr Beilin who visits London on Wednesday. 'It's impossible to have high-level negotiations like we had with Egypt; its impossible to have a secret channel as we had with the Palestinians and I don't see any other mediator who is ready to take it upon himself.' Mr Beilin, however, said Syria had made positive responses to Israeli proposals during Mr Christopher's last shuttle which ended last Monday. 'For the first time in our history we speak about withdrawal (from the Heights) and Syria speaks about peace. It never happened before and it enables us to find a solution.' According to officials Israel has offered Syria a three-stage withdrawal from the Heights over eight years with each stage accompanied by deepening diplomatic and economic ties and security guarantees. Israeli newspapers also reported yesterday that Israel is asking Washington for Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.35bn) in special US military aid to maintain Israel's strategic advantage over Syria. Mr Beilin said until Israel reached peace with Syria, Damascus could continue to veto the establishment of official diplomatic ties between Israel and more moderate Arab states in the Gulf and Magreb. Syria could also successfully pressure Arab countries not to lift the Arab economic boycott of the Jewish state. On the Palestinian peace process Mr Beilin said the next phase - the extension of self-rule from Gaza-Jericho to the rest of the West Bank - would depend on the desire and capability of Palestinians to hold elections. If the Palestinians did not hold elections Israel would merely transfer limited autonomy or 'early empowerment' in areas such as health and education. 'It is in our interest to enlarge autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza ..but the elections are a Palestinian decision,' he said. However, Mr Beilin, normally a dove on the left wing of the Labour party, ruled out the possibility of evacuating Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank before Israel and the PLO agree a final and permanent status for Palestinian aspirations by 1998. He said the issue of evacuating the 120,000 settlers was a 'time-bomb' which should not be faced until permanent solution talks. 'Undoubtedly most of the settlements were built to prevent agreement on the permanent solution and we will have to face this issue over the next five years ...but I see evacuation of such a big number of Israelis as a big mistake which may prevent implementation of the permanent solution or make it much more difficult.' 'Evacuating settlements now,' Mr Beilin said, 'would be the biggest boomerang to the peace process.'</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (21): Busiest in south-east Asia - Hubs / Singapore Planning, planning and more planning has been the secret of Singapore's success. Over the past 30 years, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the former prime minister, and his team of technocrats and planners have turned Singapore from a neglected post-colonial outpost into one of the world's most dynamic economies, with the second-highest per capita income level in Asia. Changi airport, Singapore's international air terminus, is just one example of the meticulousness of the city state's planners. Changi, more than half of it built on land reclaimed from the sea, was opened in 1981. A second runway began operating three years later. In 1990, a second terminal was opened. Changi is consistently voted by international travellers to be among the world's best airports. According to the civil aviation authority of Singapore (CAAS), Changi handled 18.1m passengers and more than 700,000 tonnes of air freight last year, registering growth rates of 11.8 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. Changi is now served by 59 scheduled airlines linking it to more than 100 cities in 54 countries. Each week nearly 2,500 scheduled flights land at Changi, making it the busiest air hub in south-east Asia. Existing facilities at Changi can cope with as many as 24m passengers a year. But the CAAS planners are looking far ahead. Under the terms of a master plan originally conceived back in 1975, work is beginning on a third terminal and there is already talk of building a fourth terminal around the turn of the century. A frantic bout of airport construction is now taking place in east Asia to cope with a rapid rise in air traffic. The international air transport association (Iata) says only two air traffic 'hubs' in the region - Singapore and Taipei - have the facilities in place to deal with projected growth in passengers. A recent Iata report forecast that airline passenger numbers in the Asia-Pacific region will double over the next six years. By 2000, the region will account for nearly 40 per cent of worldwide passenger traffic and by the year 2010 that figure will be more than 50 per cent - representing 375m passengers. In south-east Asia, Iata predicts that passenger traffic will increase by more than 9 per cent per year up to 1995, compared with an annual growth of 3.9 per cent in Europe and 5 per cent in North America. Airport overcrowding and various infrastructure bottlenecks threaten to hold up passenger growth in the region. Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Hong Kong, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are all planning or actually building new airports. But if passenger growth continues to climb in line with Iata projections many of these facilities will be operating at virtually full capacity from the day they open. Singapore is making full use of the advantages of its superior aviation facilities to establish itself as a hub not only for the region, but for worldwide airline traffic. Singapore Airlines (SIA) has been at the centre of Changi's development as a hub. Over the years SIA has rapidly expanded both its regional and long-haul operations. At the end of last year SIA had flights to 66 cities in 40 countries with more than 400 weekly services. In the past two years alone, nine new destinations have been added to the SIA network. SilkAir, a wholly-owned SIA subsidiary, has concentrated on pioneering various regional routes out of Singapore. These services link into SIA services. Mr Michael Tan, SIA deputy managing director for commercial affairs, says the primary aim of the airline's route planning is to gain access to both key and developing markets, offering passengers and freight customers a comprehensive network with a high frequency of fast, non-stop services. 'Our scheduling strategy emphasises the integration of the long haul and regional services, SIA to SIA and SIA to SilkAir, thus building a strong hub at Changi airport, which is the ideal airport given its modern and efficient facilities,' says Mr Tan. But Changi's hub operations are not exclusive to SIA. Singapore's planners realise that if the airport is to develop to its full potential, other airlines must also use it as a hub for their flight operations. In 1989, Singapore signed an agreement with Britain which allowed British Airways hubbing rights out of Singapore. In time BA will be able to base fleets of smaller aircraft at Changi servicing regional routes, which will then link up with the airline's longer-haul flights. At the time the agreement was described as a model for other countries to follow. Mr Lim Chin Beng, SIA's deputy chairman, says the future of aviation rests on developing such a hub-and-spoke system at airports. In return for use of its facilities at Changi, SIA has pressed for increased traffic rights and hubbing at other centres. Other airlines have been approached by Singapore's civil aviation authority to use Changi as a hub, including United Airlines, Qantas and Japan Airlines. SIA recently lost a battle with British Airways for a stake in Qantas. But the Australian carrier is already using Changi as a hub or 'feeder' airport for its rapidly-expanding regional services. Qantas flights between Singapore and Hong Kong, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are being linked in to the airline's long-haul services between Australia and Europe. Last year, Singapore and Australia agreed to a 50 per cent increase in air traffic between the two countries up to 1995 in order to boost tourism and trade. In tandem with Changi's development as a passenger traffic hub, moves have also been made to increase Singapore's importance as an international freight hubbing centre. In late 1990 the air transport agreement between Singapore and the US was revised, allowing US carriers extensive hubbing rights for freighter services out of Singapore. US airlines can now operate up to 42 B747 cargo services between Singapore and other destinations in the Asia Pacific region. These services can then feed cargo to their long-haul flights. In return, Singapore secured an Atlantic routing with access to four points in the US, including New York, and onward services into Canada. Certain restrictions on the Pacific route into the US were also lifted. Increased maintenance facilities at Changi have also helped Singapore's development as an aviation hub. A large number of airlines now use Changi's sophisticated technical facilities. In a recent statement, Boeing noted that an increasing proportion of its orders came from the Asia Pacific region. Of the 226 747-400s so far delivered, 53 per cent have gone to carriers in the region. Singapore is the main location for Boeing's spares support facility in the Asia-Pacific region. A new centre near Changi will operate round the clock to service the needs of carriers using Singapore. Mr Karmjit Singh, assistant director for corporate affairs at SIA, says all these factors have helped strengthen Changi's role as a hub. 'A hub does not just happen,' says Mr Singh. 'It is the product of a strategic vision, sound long-term planning and meticulous implementation.'</p>

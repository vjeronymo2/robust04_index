			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Euro Disney still missing a trick Sir, Euro Disney may want your readers to believe prices have been reduced ('Euro Disney shares slide on fears of restructure', February 23), but there was no evidence of this when my family and I were at the resort a week ago. As I pointed out in a letter to Euro Disney's managers upon our return, we found food and gifts to be just as expensive as they were on our first visit, in July last year. Food was about double what we expect to pay in the UK; the gifts on sale which are available in Britain were at least 50 per cent dearer; the variety of food available also continues to be disappointing. Euro Disney is still magic, but the trick of encouraging increased sales has still not been perfected. Dallas Willcox, 2 Highview Road, Thundersley, Benfleet, Essex SS7 3LF</p>

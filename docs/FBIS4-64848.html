			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Western European Union: Mostar </F> Administration Set as Priority"]    [Text] (ANSA) Luxembourg, May 9 -- The Netherlands, which  takes over the rotating presidency of the Western European Union  [WEU] in July, said here today that the solution to the problems  of the martyred Bosnian city of Mostar will become a priority of  the European defense group which, in seeking to resolve the city  problems, will work closely with the European Union, which will  be responsible for the city administration.    WEU foreign and defense ministers are currently holding a  meeting here to discuss a new form of partnership with nations  in Central and East Europe.    The European Union has already chosen former Bremen mayor  Hans Koschnik to be its adminstrator in Mostar and has asked the  WEU, the future defense arm of the European Union, to work to  guarantee the presence in the city of an efficient police force.    In response to this, the WEU has already sent its own panel  of experts and came up with a number of options for the European  Union including that of training Muslim and Croat policemen and  sending in an international police force. A decision on the  matter is expected during the Dutch WEU presidency.    The discussions here between WEU defense and foreign  ministers on the new partnerships will also see the  participation of representatives from those nations slated for  the WEU partnership agreements: Hungary, Poland, the Czech  Republic and Slovakia -- the so-called Visegrad group --  Bulgaria and Romania, as well as the ex-Soviet Baltic states  Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.    The partnership agreements grant recipients the status of  "associated partners" with the WEU, the only European organ  which deals with security matters and which is slated to become  Europe's pillar in NATO as well as the future security and  defense arm of the European Union.    WEU sources pointed out how the new partnership agreements  expanded to the area of defense the association agreements which  the WEU has already reached or is currently negotiating with  these countries.    The WEU is currently composed of Belgium, France, Germany,  Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands and  Greece. It is made up of all European Union members except  Ireland, and all European Union members of NATO except Denmark.</p>

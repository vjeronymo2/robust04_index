			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU HAS ITS HANDS, NOT ITS STANDS, FULL  </P> <P> Regarding Scott Miller's article (Nov. 29) on low attendance at SDSU football  games, I'd like to offer a few possible explanations for the apparent lack of  interest.  </P> <P> First, as mentioned in the article, it is difficult to get excited about WAC  teams.  </P> <P> More importantly, perhaps, a good number of SDSU students are older, with other  interests that have higher priority than non-academic school activities.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the fact that games are played off-campus compounds the problem.  At the University of Pennsylvania, where I was an undergraduate, most students  can walk a few blocks to the stadium, so attendance of football games is very  convenient.  </P> <P> Finally, it doesn't appear that SDSU has any strong, traditional rivalries. At  Penn, not many students would pass up the chance to see Yale or Princeton  possibly go down in flames.  </P> <P> If people aren't in the habit of going to games, I don't think they can be  expected suddenly to turn out en masse, even if the Aztecs have had two winning  seasons.  </P> <P> JOHN T. AUYONG  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Observer: Restructure of private health care overdue Sir, Your article on the soaring cost of healthcare ('Losing patience with private medicine', May 11) covers the actions of insurers and corporate customers but leaves aside consideration of the overdue need for a fundamental restructuring of the private sector. At least two areas merit review. Private hospitals continue to rely upon consultants who are both part-time and effectively self-employed in the sector, having no contractual relationship with any hospital. This leads to obvious inefficiencies and perpetuates consultants' ability to charge many times more than they accept from the NHS for identical work. This state of affairs may well have been reasonable when the private sector was small and subject to political vulnerability but can no longer be so justified. Hospitals should take consultants on to their payroll. The second area is the standard mode of reimbursement to hospitals by the medical insurers - which continues to relate mainly to the in-patient 'per diem' mentality and hence rewards longevity of occupation of the hospital bed. A change to some form of pre-determined price for a full episode of treatment - incorporating the consultants' costs - would encourage the more rapid embracing of short-stay technologies by creating the incentive for hospitals to seek efficiency gains more readily. Changes in both areas would lead to gains for the patient/customer not only from the resultant direct efficiencies but also through increased transparency, and hence comparability, of medical charging practices - currently a perplexing subject indeed. Although the measures covered in your article will help abate the increases in healthcare insurance premiums, substantial inroads into the underlying cost structure await a radical restructuring of the sort now common in most industrial sectors - and, ironically, in the NHS - but from which the private health sector has been curiously immune.

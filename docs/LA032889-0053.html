			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A decade of bargaining between the Air Force Logistics Command and a federal  workers' union has ended with the military offering child care to the command's  83,000 civilian employees nationwide. The Assn. of Federal Government Employees  since 1978 had sought Air Force funding for union-operated day care for  children of civilian AFLC employees. The agreement gives control to the Air  Force, which by October will expand its existing AFLC child-care facilities and  offer them to all families of civilian workers. Families of uniformed personnel  in the Air Force, as in other services, long have had access to subsidized day  care.  </P></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Yeltsin acts to quell revolt: 21 die in battles for key Moscow buildings - Troops and tanks move on capital / Rebels prepare to defend White House TROOPS with armoured vehicles moved into Moscow streets early today as President Boris Yeltsin sought to quell the hardline rebellion that brought fierce gun battles to the city yesterday. At least 21 people were reported killed and hundreds injured in the uprising. With a troop crackdown expected, about 2,000 rebels last night strengthened barricades around the White House, the parliament building. Others gathered around the main television centre, which they had earlier attacked and briefly put off the air before being repulsed in savage fighting with pro-Yeltsin soldiers from elite units. Mr Yeltsin, who declared a state of emergency in the capital, vowed he would triumph over the 'adventurers' backing parliament, which he dissolved in a decree 12 days previously. The revolt confronted Mr Yeltsin with an agonising decision he had tried to avoid in his stand-off with defiant deputies - whether to use force to back up his decree and clear them and their weapons out of the White House. As a showdown loomed, Mr Yeltsin's rebellious vice-president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, declared an overnight 'curfew' inside parliament. He banned all movement from floor to floor or along corridors in the darkened building. Mr Rutskoi, named president by the defiant parliament in the wake of Mr Yeltsin's decree, yesterday spurred the demonstrators into their violent actions. Trouble flared as 15,000 anti-Yeltsin protesters smashed through a security cordon to link up with deputies at the White House. With passions rising and guns distributed, demonstrators attacked the mayor's office and raced to the TV complex, storming inside in a hail of bullets. Armed supporters of Mr Rutskoi, who was last night dismissed by Mr Yeltsin from his post as vice-president and from the army, also tried to take over two Russian news agencies but left without a struggle. Although gunfire still crackled around the TV centre early today, an official said: 'For the moment it is quiet.' He said troops arriving in armoured vehicles were disarming the rebels. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, said in a televised address that troops were being brought into Moscow to restore order. 'Despite all the difficulties of the situation, the government is in full control,' he said. Two divisions of paratroopers loyal to Mr Yeltsin were due to enter Moscow early today, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Shumeiko said. He said one division, normally at least 5,000 strong, was coming from the city of Ryazan, about 110 miles south-east of Moscow. Mr Strobe Talbott, the US ambassador at large with responsibility for the former Soviet states, said he had been told by Mr Yeltsin's aides that troops loyal to the president were taking up positions round parliament and the TV centre and would retake both 'very shortly'. Everything seemed to depend on the willingness of the incoming troops to join battle. After reports that some commanders were wavering in their loyalty earlier in the day, the Interfax news agency reported late last night that the chief district commanders, meeting in the praesidium of the Ministry of Defence, had agreed to back the president. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, was said to be preparing an address to servicemen - the sympathies of many of whom could be expected to be with the White House defenders. However, the determined resis-tance put up against the rebels by the few troops at the TV centre halted what looked like a serious challenge to central power. In the statement read for him on TV, Mr Yeltsin said the attacks had been 'planned in advance' and had been deliberately aimed at destroying negotiations over the weekend under the aegis of Alexei II, patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church. Mr Yeltsin said that 'from different corners of Russia came forces from pro-communist organisations carrying out their black deeds beneath red flags. . . Today, the fate of Russia and of our children is being decided. The forces of civil war will not succeed'. Mr Yegor Gaidar, deputy prime minister for economic reform, appealed to ordinary citizens to show their support for democracy at this 'hardest hour'. 'Today we cannot dump responsibility for democracy and our freedom on police and military forces alone . . . we appeal to you not to allow our country to be turned into a giant concentration camp for decades to come'. Mr Chernomyrdin has called Russia's regional leaders to Moscow this afternoon. The Democratic Russia movement, which held a rally of between 1,000 and 2,000 supporters of the president in central Moscow in the early evening, appealed for rallies to be held round the country in defence of Mr Yeltsin.

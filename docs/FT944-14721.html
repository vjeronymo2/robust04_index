			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Adscene expands print side with Pounds 7m purchases Adscene, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, is acquiring two printing businesses - Flair Press and Charles Elphick - for up to Pounds 6.98m. Mr Nigel Chevin-Hall, finance director, said that the group's current printing business in Welshpool, Powys, had seen an upturn in demand from outside customers and the board considered it 'an opportune time to expand the printing operations'. Mr Chevin-Hall said that external publishing turnover in the year to May 31 was about Pounds 17m to Pounds 18m. The annualised figure for Flair and Elphick would boost the Pounds 2m from the Welshpool operations to about Pounds 18m, balancing the group in turnover terms. He added, however, that the group's overall publishing margins were about 20 per cent, while Flair and Elphick currently had margins of 11 per cent with targets of about 14 per cent. The initial consideration for Flair is Pounds 4.35m in shares. Beeson Gregory is placing 1.53m at 271p to raise Pounds 4.15m on behalf of the vendors. Mr Charles Grant-Salmon, chairman of both Flair and Elphick, is to be issued 55,350 shares. Consideration for Elphick is Pounds 80,000 cash. There are further profit-related payments to a maximum of Pounds 2.55m in cash or shares. With Flair comes debt of about Pounds 4.5m, after a now-complete Pounds 6m capital expenditure programme, making Adscene's borrowings about Pounds 10m. Pro forma gearing, after the write-down of goodwill on the acquisition, would be 78 per cent. Mr Chevin-Hall said that should reduce to 30 per cent, with debt of Pounds 5m, by May 1996.</p>

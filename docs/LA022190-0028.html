			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG USE  </P> <P> The real story behind The Times' coverage on the 35.4% drop in high school drug  usage is that this occurred despite an all-time high percentage (58.7%) of  students who said that cocaine was "very easy" to get (Part A, Feb. 14).  </P> <P> What does that do to the political warlords of the "War on Drugs" who claim  that interdiction, not education is the answer.  </P> <P> Clearly the drop in usage of both cocaine (and cigarettes) is occurring despite  a huge, easy supply of such drugs. Stopping drugs from being available is not  only impossible but a total waste of money. To educate and treat is the obvious  answer. In this case, the figures don't lie: Stop the "war" and educate,  rehabilitate, and stop crowding the courts and prisons with wasted efforts to  stop what can't be stopped, which is the illegal sale of drugs.  </P> <P> HERBERT HAFIF  </P> <P> Claremont  </P></p>

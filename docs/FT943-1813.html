			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: NGOs - working to meet demands of the market Sir, For a newspaper which one expects to be championing the role of markets it is surprising to read Edward Mortimer's article, 'NGOs rule OK' (September 21), criticising the role of non-governmental organisations in international affairs on the basis that their role as 'do-gooders' is an unelected one. NGOs get their funds from two sources. First, from public fundraising activities. People in the UK and elsewhere are buying NGO services of their own free will. No need for elections, markets can operate in this area just as they can for other services. However, like all markets, advertising may not always be honest or accurate. If there is concern about the role of NGOs then this is where investigative attention should focus. The other source of funds, increasingly so, is from governments, as well as bilateral and multilateral institutions. The international proliferation of NGOs over the last decade or so has given these institutions more and more choice as to which NGOs they fund - which, other things being equal, is surely a good thing. Again, the main issue to focus on is the extent to which these institutions are buying quality services. Of course, quality is not always a simple matter to assess, with either business products or the services of NGOs. Capitalism is without doubt an extremely creative process, but one not without its problems. It is perhaps a pleasant paradox that capitalism allows the emergence of organisational forms that can meet a market demand to address some of those problems.

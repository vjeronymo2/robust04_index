			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Dollar remains fragile The dollar yesterday fell to its lowest level in more than six months against the D-Mark, but there was no public evidence of further central bank support for the currency, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar closed in London at DM1.6461, more than a pfennig down on its Friday close of DM1.657. Against the yen it finished at Y101.315 from Y101.485. Trade was fairly quiet, following the UK long weekend and with Japanese markets closed for most of the week. The dollar's woes spilled over into sterling, which finished nearly three pfennigs lower at DM2.483, from Friday's close of DM2.5126. Political uncertainty ahead of tomorrow's local elections is also weighing on the UK currency. Elsewhere, a controversy in Spain surrounding the disappearance of a former senior police official undermined the peseta and the escudo. While there was no repeat of Friday's Fed support for the dollar, there was talk of concerted European central bank dollar purchases at Dollars 1.6450. Since these activities are normally conducted through commercial banks, their origins are not always clear. Current market consensus on the dollar is that it is likely to weaken in the short term, in defiance of fundamentals. But Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), argues that 'the dollar is technically ripe for a large correction, were we to see co-ordinated and sustained central bank intervention.' He notes that a survey of clients, trading with 1-3 month time horizons, shows this segment of the market to be significantly short of dollars, for the first time in a year. Overall, says Mr Persaud, the market remains long of dollars, but it is the marginal investors who will determine a turn. Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the US currency 'would need very supportive comments from the Clinton administration to really turn the dollar around.' US comments so far had been too ambiguous to ease market nerves. The D-Mark was stronger in Europe, helped by the improved outlook for the German economy. The feature of European trading was the weakness of the Iberian currencies. The peseta finished in London at Pta81.84 from Pta81.46 on Friday against the D-Mark, while the escudo fell in tandem to close at Es103.1 from from Es103 . The catalyst for currency weakness was the escalating political scandal about the police chief, coming on top of an earlier embarrassment surrounding a former Bank of Spain governor, which caused a minister to resign and prime minister Felipe Gonzales to cancel an overseas visit. But political scandal comes against a background of nervous investors searching for security in European bond markets, which works against high-yielding economies such as Spain and Portugal. Ms Wendy Niffikeer, senior economist at IBJ International in London , said the scandal was 'an excuse for investors to sell the Iberian markets, because the inflation outlook was not as good as for some other European economies.' The Bundesbank will announce today the results of its weekly repo tender. Market estimates are for the central bank to allow the repo rate to fall by 5-12 basis points from 5.47 per cent currently. It dropped by 23 basis points over the past two weeks. But Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, believes the market is making the error of extrapolating from past trends. With the mid-point of German call money yesterday at about 5.55 per cent, above the repo rate of 5.47 per cent, she predicts a cut of only 2-3 basis points. In the futures market the June euromark contract closed at 94.89, down from 94.92. Sterling gave up most of its recent gains with the sterling index closing at 79.6 from its previous close of 80.3. The pound normally trades in tandem with the dollar, so the US currency's weakness is one explanation for sterling's decline. Political uncertainty is also weighing on the UK currency. Weekend press reports drew attention to the weak position of prime minister Mr John Major, and the market fears that heavy Tory losses in Thursday's local elections will aggravate matters further. In the futures market, short sterling lost ground as the likelihood of a further rate cut receded. Stronger than expected growth in April M0 was merely the latest in a string of data showing robust growth in the economy. The June contract closed at 94.59 from 94.62 on Friday. The longer contracts gave up more ground, with the December future finishing at 93.82 from 93.88. Conditions in the money market remained easy as the Bank of England removed a small Pounds 100m shortage. The guilder was unaffected by elections in the Netherlands, closing at Fl1.123 from Fl1.122. Investors also stood on the sideline in South Africa, awaiting clarity about the outcome of the election. The financial rand firmed to R4.6 against the dollar from R4.625.</p>

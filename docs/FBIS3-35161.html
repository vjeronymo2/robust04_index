The sources said that the cost of this number could  reach $560 million, while the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip  need 10,000 for the transitional phase, costing $212 million.    The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Israel, which always  uses security concerns as an excuse, is rejecting these figures  and believes they are exaggerated, demanding that they be  reduced to 5,000 or 6,000 policemen only. The source, who asked  to remain anonymous, added that the Israeli proposal has been  rejected, and that this rejection has been conveyed to the  Palestinian delegation to the Taba committee negotiations aimed  at determining the number of the Palestinian police forces and  the type of weapons they are going to use. The source pointed  out that the Israeli side is also refusing to agree to the  Palestinian police forces being armed with heavy, or even  medium, weapons.    The source confirmed that numerous states -- among them  Britain, Sweden, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Russia, and the  United States -- have submitted proposals to train and arm the  Palestinian police. But they still remain promises and  statements in the air, while the United States has recently  trained a special security team for Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat.    The source emphasized that Israel is flooding the occupied  territories with light and medium weapons and equipment in  preparation for implementing certain schemes designed to  sabotage the peace process, foment sedition, and spread panic  among Palestinian citizens, and also to show the extent of the  Palestinian security forces' competence in controlling the  Palestinian scene.    The source added that arms have spread rapidly and there are  now about 12,000 pieces. He pointed out that Israel has full  lists of those who have arms.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Brussels probes BA's Tat deal BRITISH AIRWAYS' plan to buy just under 50 per cent of the French regional airline Transport Aerien Transregional (Tat) is being investigated by the European Commission, write Andrew Hill in Brussels and Daniel Green in London. Brussels' competition authorities have decided that the deal, part of the British carrier's strategy to create a global airline, falls under its merger control rules. BA called the decision 'routine'; it had notified the Commission's merger task force on October 23 and had been expecting the announcement. British Airways, which will spend Pounds 17.25m on the 49.9 per cent stake in Tat, still expects the deal to be completed by January. It will also acquire an option to buy the rest of the airline by April 1, 1997. However, if the Commission decides after a month that it has 'serious doubts' about the effects of the deal on competition in the Community it will launch a four-month in-depth inquiry. If it is still dissatisfied at the end of that period, it could block the deal or ask for it to be amended. A Commission decision to clear the BA/Tat deal would almost certainly irritate Air France, the state-owned French airline. Brussels last year forced Air France to sell its 35 per cent stake in Tat when it took over UTA, the French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the French domestic airline.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Guo Jia (6753 0857) and XINHUA </F> reporter Zheng Guolian (6774 0948 5114)]    [Text] Guangzhou, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Addressing Guangzhou  Military Region's conference on work among grass-roots units  today, State Councillor and Defense Minister Chi Haotian  stressed that it is necessary to standardize and guide army  building in grass-roots units by resolutely adhering to the  requirements -- "All army units must be qualified politically  and competent militarily. They must have a fine workstyle,  maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate  logistical support" -- set forth by Jiang Zemin, chairman of the  Central Military Commission, so as to raise army building among  grass-roots units to a new level.    Chi Haotian said: These remarks were made by Comrade Jiang  Zemin when he spoke at the All-Army military work conference at  the end of 1990. They embody Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on  army building in the new period; reflect the objective law  governing army building among grass-roots units; spell out the  basic condition our Army must have in order to fulfill its  historical mission in the new period; and represent the general  call for strengthening army building made by the party Central  Committee -- the third generation leading collective -- with  Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and is also a general call for  strengthening army building among grass-roots units.    Chi Haotian said: The whole Army should use these  "five-point remarks" by Jiang Zemin to standardize and guide  army building among basic-level units; they should also use them  to unify their thinking and guide their work. The masses of  cadres and soldiers, especially leading cadres at various  levels, should understand them clearly and act upon them  consciously. Every grass-root unit should do its work in  observance of the requirements set forth by these remarks. In  this way, the process of army building among grass-roots units  will become a process of implementing requirements. He pointed  out: To fulfill these requirements, it is necessary to do a  great deal of hard and meticulous work on a long-term basis.  Leading organs at all levels and every grass-roots unit must be  prepared to perform first-grade tasks and build first-class  companies, to create a situation in which everyone suggests ways  and means for company building and performs meritorious deeds  for the company; to build more and better companies; and to  nurture outstanding soldiers.    Chi Haotian pointed out: In doing their work, Army  grass-roots units should act upon the requirements -- "arming  people with scientific theories, guiding people with correct  public opinion, fostering people with a noble spirit, and  inspiring people with outstanding literary works" -- set forth  by Comrade Jiang Zemin; focus on the fundamental task of  training soldiers who cherish lofty ideals and moral integrity,  and who are well educated and self- disciplined; and strengthen  the building of spiritual civilization by concentrating on  raising the ideological and moral quality of officers and men.  Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; arm  themselves with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and his thought on army building in  the new period; conduct extensive education on patriotism,  collectivism, and socialism among army units; bear in mind the  Army's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly; be firm in  their ideals and faith; and foster a revolutionary outlook on  life and values. Leading cadres should launch activities to  learn from heroes and models like Lei Feng, Su Ning, and Xu  Honggang, and strive to practice and disseminate new socialist  morality and customs. In building spiritual civilization,  leading cadres should take the lead in setting an example and  strive to influence and promote, with their good images, the  building of spiritual civilization among Army units.</p>

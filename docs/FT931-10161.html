			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh reforms may cost Pounds 154m REFORM of local government in Wales which will see the end of two-tier authorities will cost between Pounds 61m and Pounds 154m over 15 years, according to a report for the government by management consultants Touche Ross. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, is expected to decide in the next few weeks on the exact form of the reorganisation. The eight counties and 37 district councils are to be replaced by unitary authorities. A Welsh Office discussion paper last year suggested the 45 councils could be replaced by 15, 18, 23 or 27 unitary authorities. Touche Ross says the 15-council option would cost between Pounds 61m and Pounds 154m, and the 27-authority option would cost between Pounds 67m and Pounds 152m. The government's favoured option is thought to be 23 authorities although the eight counties are pressing for the number to be 15. Compensation for loss of office among the 90,000 council employees will be the main cost - between Pounds 20m and Pounds 90m. Mr Hunt said that he expected the actual costs to be 'towards the lower end of the range'.</p>

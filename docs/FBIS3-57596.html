			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Martins Kibilds: "The Custom Tariffs Are </F> Changing"]    [Text] Riga, 18 January -- According to a government  decision, the customs tariff on imported goods has undergone a  thorough change.    The main difference between the new and old tariff rules is  the complete abandoning of the zero-tariff, that is -- every  imported item will be subject to a customs duty, even if only  symbolic, said Minister of Finance Uldis Osis at a press  conference following a cabinet meeting. Besides, government  ministries will no longer have the right to exempt certain  categories of goods from customs tariffs, which has become a  rather common occurrence.    The new customs tariffs introduced by the Cabinet of  Ministers have their legal basis in Article 81 of the  Constitution, therefore they do not need to be approved by the  parliament and they are effective as soon as they are published.  Nonetheless, the government is to present the draft law  regarding import duties to parliament on 15 February. The rules  issued today will be in force until this law is approved by the  parliament.    The average customs duty will be 15 to 20 percent, and it  will depend not solely on the type good, but also on the kind of  agreement that binds Latvia with the country from which the item  is being imported. The lowest duties (0.5-1 percent) are  provided for imported raw materials, which were imported  duty-free until now. The duty on semi-finished products will  amount to 3-6 percent, and the highest tariffs are expected to  be imposed on finished products. The main criterion for fixing  the customs duty will be the demand for a particular product in  Latvia and the possibility of manufacturing that item locally.  If demand is low and the same goods are being manufactured in  Latvia, the duty will be accordingly higher. For this reason,  one of the highest duties (upwards of 50 percent) is expected on  food, which -- as is commonly known -- Latvia can produce on her  local market.    U. Osis expressed the view that the new tariffs -- in their  ideal form -- would protect the domestic market from an invasion  of outside goods. However, to achieve this, it is necessary to  provide proper customs control and a duty collection mechanism.</p>

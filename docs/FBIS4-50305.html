			<p>BFN     [Text] Bridgetown [Barbados], 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- While  speaking at the UN global meeting on sustainable development for  the developing islet states (or global meeting of islet states  for short) on 26 April, Jiang Chengzong, deputy head of the  Chinese delegation, pointed out: In history, developed  countries colonized many islet states; questions left over that  restrict islet states' economic development still have a  negative impact. China maintains that developed countries  should take the indispensable responsibility to help developing  islet states realize sustainable economic development.    Speaking of the unique situation and difficulties that  developing islet states encounter, Jiang Chengzong said: Islet  states encounter difficulties common with other developing  countries, such as debts, unfavorable trading conditions, a lack  of capital, and a low level of technology. In addition, they  are restricted to such unique unfavorable conditions as a bad  ecological situation, a lack of transportation facilities, the  small scales of their economies, and a single product. Islet  states are the first to be affected by changes of climate, the  rising of the ocean's level, and ocean and seashore pollution.  Islet states' economic development is seriously restricted by  those developed countries.    He said emphatically: Islet states' sustainable development  is an inseparable part of global sustainable development. The  international community should take feasible measures to help  developing islet states overcome difficulties and march toward  the road of sustainable development step by step.    Jiang Chengzong maintained that over the past two years  since  the conclusion of the UN environment and development meeting,  the international community and other relevant international  organizations have done a great deal in implementing the  meeting's resolutions. However, much greater efforts are still  needed. The unfavorable international economic climate which  has seriously restrained very large developing countries from  realizing their economic development and environmental  protection targets has not yet improved. Commitments concerning  capital and the transfer of technology made at the environment  and development meeting need to be carried out.    He said: To change the situation fundamentally, we need  strong political will and a complete set of concrete and  effective measures, accompanied by such things as capital and  the transfer of technology, so as to ensure the implementation  of these measures.    The global meeting of islet states which opened in  Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, on 25 April will conclude  on 6 May.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] As Nigeria's acute shortage of fuel continues in  spite of dire warnings to oil companies and the National  Petroleum Corporation to get their acts together, there've been  more deaths connected with the crisis. Petrol filling stations  have been running out of fuel, and there has been a spate of  deaths. On the latest, Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos:    [Begin Odunfa recording] At least eight persons died in a  petrol tanker fire in Lagos yesterday. Two others suffered  severe injuries. The casualties were members of the National  Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, who were in  a motorcade of about 22 fuel tankers from Yaba on Lagos mainland  to the Lagos State Secretariat, about 10 km away to protest to  the military administrator alleged harassment of their  colleagues by state officials. The lead vehicle of the  motorcade ran out of control and into the (?path) of the vehicle  behind it. The two crashed and burst into flames, trapping  occupants of their driver compartments. When the fire subsided  two hours later, eight bodies were pulled out of the debris.  Two other victims are receiving treatment for severe burns.  The deaths bring to at least 13 the number of people killed in  petrol fires in the past two weeks of severe petrol shortage in  Nigeria. The shortage itself is easing as a result of  supplementary import and consulted efforts by all agencies of  government to stamp out hoarding and diversion of supplies from  authorized outlets. In Lagos, petrol is being rationed to  motorists at 30 liters per purchase in a bid to meet the  available stock demand. Soldiers and policemen are supervising  distribution and sales.    Meanwhile, the Nigerian Labor Congress, NLC, has dissociated  itself from the call by the human rights group, Campaign for  Democracy, for its sit-at-home protest by workers and market  women on Monday [9 May]. Reacting, NLC spokesman, Malam Salisu  Muhammed, told journalists in Lagos that the planned protest was  senseless. [end recording]</p>

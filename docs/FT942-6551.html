			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Richard Branson After losing the competition last week to run the UK's national lottery and failing to persuade the Radio Authority to create a new FM national frequency for his pop station, Richard Branson probably needs a spell on a desert island. He is no stranger to desert island living. Necker in the Virgin Islands was uninhabitable when he bought it 12 years ago. Now it is one of the most exclusive retreats in the Caribbean. What would you need, apart from fax and telephone, to carry on your business? 'Thoughts of essentials for my occasional weeks of blissful isolation on Necker would be pretty similar to those I would want as a mythical desert island manager. I would plead for a global satellite TV system with Sky, CNN and the BBC World Service. Armed with all that and a stock of trusty black A4 notebooks, I think I could keep the business under control. How would you keep your sanity? 'Given that the public relations machine at British Airways wrote me off in the sanity department at least four years ago, I have long since lost interest in worrying about the question. As one diversion, I would probably use my spare notebooks to start a journal and diary of our lives. As another exercise, I would enforce some sort of physical routine, such as building a tennis court. It is my favourite sport.' You can choose one sort of food and one sort of drink, what and why? 'Assuming we have water on the island and that fruit is growing, the two unmissable essentials would be baked beans and good beer - although it would be a toss up between beer and champagne.' And one film? 'It would have to be Borsalino, starring Alain Delon and Jean Paul Belmondo, it fits the bill. It brings back memories of my teenage years and was a favourite of both myself and my first partner in business, Nik Powell.' Which person would choose to accompany you? 'I could not consider life without the family so I have to assume they are coming. My one other person would be Karl Marx. We both have beards and moustaches in common and discussions on the merits of capitalism versus communism would take on a new significance if we both had to work to survive.' Which book would you take? 'It would be James Clavell's Tai Pan. I am told it is an interesting novel and I started it just after Virgin's Hong Kong inaugural flight but have not had a chance to read it since. Branson insisted on one final condition for desert island living. 'I would immediately establish a national lottery on our island. It would be fun, help Karl to understand a bit more about capitalism and, of course, there would not have to be a competitive tender to win it.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New York, 4 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- The authoritative  U.S. newspaper the NEW YORK TIMES today presented its readers  with what it sees as a new diplomatic surprise by Moscow. It  alleged that Russia has dropped its objections to the French  draft of a UN Security Council resolution on a settlement of the  situation around Sarajevo. The newspaper claimed that Russia  was threatening to use its right of veto when the draft comes to  a vote. But after France sent a high-ranking envoy to Moscow,  Russia agreed to support this resolution with minor changes.  Voting on the issue is due to take place at the United Nations  on Friday.    Moscow, 4 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- "Things are not quite like  that," a Russian Foreign Ministry senior official said when  asked by ITAR- TASS to comment on the U.S. newspaper report.  "First, we have never been against the resolution, as such. We  favor a settlement of the situation around Sarajevo and regard  it as one of the priority areas in the general process of moving  toward peace in Bosnia. When the French were here on Wednesday  evening, we managed to agree almost everything with them.  However, in the light of yesterday's events in New York the  situation has changed somewhat. So, at the present time, work  on the text is continuing."</p>

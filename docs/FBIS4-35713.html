			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Algeria: Salvation Front </F> Accuses Islamic Group of Trying To Impose Its Influence Over It  by Force"]    [Excerpts] London -- Political sources in Algeria noted  yesterday the continuation of the confusion over the statement  issued by the Armed Islamic Group [AIG], in which it said that  the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] and the Islamic State Movement  [ISM] had been unified under its leadership. They said that no  official denial has been distributed by the groups operating  under the FIS' banner -- which increases confusion among the  ranks of Islamic oppositionists.    However, sources close to the FIS have stressed to AL-HAYAH  that the relationship with the AIG is strained and presages  clashes between the two sides. The sources complained about  what they termed "the lack of discipline among the group's  elements and their promotion of repudiationist and extremist  views threatening the unity of the mujahidin and the Algerian  people." They pointed out that the straw that "broke the  camel's back" was the AIG elements' attempt to impose their  influence by force over FIS elements. The FIS accuses the AIG  of being "infiltrated" by Algerian security organs, and of being  run from outside the country by foreign quarters promoting "an  extremist ideology combining al-salafiyah [Islamic reform  movement], political jihad, and repudiation of society,"  according to an Algeria leading figure.    The leading figure pointed out that most of the AIG's cadres  "came from Afghanistan and did not participate with the FIS in  its political action before the January 1992 coup," which was  followed by the cancellation of the elections following which  the FIS nearly assumed power.    He stressed "the existence of a scheme being implemented by  Algerian security organs using AIG elements with or without the  AIG's knowledge, with a view to introducing the AIG as an  alternative to the FIS, which peacefully persuaded the Algerian  people to espouse the Islamic plan and presented to them a  political, socialist, and economic program." He added that  security organs know that "the Algerian people will abandon the  Islamic plan if it is promoted by a group of uneducated people  promoting repudiationist ideas and who are fighting just for the  sake of fighting and who believe that an Islamic state can only  be set up by force."    He added: "The ruling clique tried to cancel the FIS'  existence when it issued an administrative decision to disband  it. But it has continued to derive its legitimacy from the  people, who have given it their confidence. And they are now  trying to cancel it by replacing it with a deviationist group."  [passage omitted]    The leading figures said the FIS is making contacts with  Islamic leaderships abroad to urge them to suspend the support  the AIG receives from some quarters. However he was pessimistic  about that. He said: "Most of these quarters are mysterious,  and the world Islamic movement itself is suffering at their  hands. They are new on the scene and do not respect senior  ulema, so it is difficult to deal with them." He pointed out  that an AIG thinker named Mus'ab al-Suri, who worked in  Afghanistan in the past and now lives in Spain, records tapes  attacking the FIS and its programs for political change and  accusing Cheikhs Abbasi Madani and Ali Behadj of deception  because they accepted the principle of democracy and of turning  to the people.    He cited an incident he described as "serious" which took  place in Tiaret province in southern central Algeria, as a group  from the AIG attacked a camp belonging to the Islamic Front and  held a number of its covert action activists.

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Lucas hampered by continental Europe - Other Companies Today, Lucas, the motor and aerospace components group, is expected to report interim profits of Pounds 15m-Pounds 19m, compared with Pounds 5.2m. Analysts still hope the Midlands-based group will make more than Pounds 80m in the full year. The first half was affected by continuing tough trading conditions - particularly in continental Europe. Most interest centres on the impact that will be made by Mr George Simpson, who is leaving British Aerospace to become Lucas's chief executive next month. George Simpson's new job, Page 16</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All-Russia Center for the Study of Public Opinion report </F> under the "Sociology" rubric: "Parting With Idols?"]    [Text] The Moscow branch of the All-Russian Center for the  Study of Public Opinion conducted on 3-5 April a snap poll among  1,620 residents of the capital. The sociologists asked them to  "name five or six prominent figures in Russia whom you most  trust." Let us remind you that similar previous polls took place  on 5 August, 27 October, and 15 December of last year. The  dynamics of the answers is characteristic:    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |              |Aug           |Oct           |Dec           |Apr           |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yeltsin       |27            |24            |19            |13            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yavlinskiy    |10            |13            |16            |11            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gaydar        |8             |15            |26            |10            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zhirinovskiy  |2             |1             |16            |6             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rutskoy       |17            |5             |2             |5             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Luzhkov       |6             |6             |5             |5             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Shakhray      |9             |12            |13            |5             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pamfilova     |-             |3             |3             |5             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chernomyrdin  |5             |4             |2             |4             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Zyuganov      |1             |2             |6             |4             |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The listed political figures enjoy a relatively greater  measure of trust than they do on the whole among Muscovites who  have been polled:    B. Yeltsin -- among pensioners, executives, and those in the  management sphere, servicemen and workers of law and order  services, technical specialists, and on the whole among persons  of 40 to 55 with a higher education who voted for Russia's  Choice and the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] in the  12 December elections;    G. Yavlinskiy -- among executives and those in the  management  sphere, technical specialists, and generally among those of 40  to 55 with a higher education who voted for Yabloko and the  Democratic Reforms Movement;    Ye. Gaydar -- among technical specialists, the military, and  workers of the law and order services, executives and those in  the management sphere, entrepreneurs running their own  businesses, and generally people above 40 with a higher  education and who voted for Russia's Choice and PRES;    V. Zhirinovskiy -- among white collar workers without  special  education, workers and men in general, persons above 40 with an  education below the secondary level and who voted for his party;    A. Rutskoy -- among white collar workers without special  education, unskilled workers, specialists in the field of  science, education and medicine, pensioners, and generally among  those of 40 to 55 with an education below secondary level and  who voted for the parties of communists, agrarians,  Zhirinovskiy, and against everybody;    Yu. Luzhkov -- among executives and those in the sphere of  management, specialists in the field of science, education, and  medicine, and generally among women, persons above 55 who voted  for Russia's Choice;    S. Shakhray -- among housewives, entrepreneurs who run their  own businesses, technical specialists, military and workers of  the law and order services, and generally among women, people of  25 to 40 with a higher education and who voted for the PRES and  Russia's Choice;    E. Pamfilova -- among technical specialists, pensioners,  while collar workers without special education, and women  generally, persons above 55 with higher education who voted more  frequently for Russian's Choice and Yabloko;    V. Chernomyrdin -- among executives and those in the  management sphere, technical specialists, women generally,  persons above 40 with secondary education who voted for PRES and  Yabloko;    G. Zyuganov -- among pensioners, military, and workers of  the  law and order services, and generally men, persons above 55 with  an education below the secondary level who voted for the  Communist Party, the Women of Russia, and Travkin's Democratic  Party.    Among other Russian political figures who are trusted by  Muscovites who took part in the poll are N. Travkin, S. Fedorov,  and A. Sobchak with 3 percent each; V. Shumeyko, I. Rybkin, K.  Borovoy with 2 percent each; S. Baburin, M. Gorbachev, T. Gdlyan  with 1 percent each; G. Popov, A. Volskiy, R. Khasbulatov with  under 1 percent.    Remarkably, an increasing number of respondents, in each new  stage of the poll on trust in political figures, either name no  leader they would trust or are generally stumped for an answer.  To compare: while there were 36 percent of such persons in  December, there were 52 percent in April. A considerable part  of Muscovites must feel unprotected today against realities of  life which appreciably affects their view of favorite leaders  and idols.</p>

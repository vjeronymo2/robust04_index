			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Labour accused of E London 'racism' The Liberal Democrats last night claimed to have received extensive leaked information about alleged racism among Labour activists in east London, Kevin Brown writes. Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat campaigns organiser, said the leaked Labour party documents revealed deep divisions among Labour workers about the party's electoral tactics. The claim follows disciplinary action by the Liberal Democrats against party members accused of racism in Tower Hamlets, the only big city council controlled by the party. Unrest over the treatment of local activists threatens to boil over at a meeting of Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrat councillors on Thursday. However, Liberal Democrat officials believe that the damage being done to the national party would be minimised by evidence of similar turmoil in the local Labour party. Mr Taylor said the leaked documents would expose a cover-up of Tower Hamlets racism by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's frontbench local government spokesman.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Malik 'Ali </F> al-Sayyani, chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, by  correspondent Mahmud al-Warraq; place and date not given--  recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Warraq] Let us talk about  the military situation at the front.    [Al-Sayyani] As you know, the fighting is proceeding well  and  is moving toward a resolution in favor of the constitutionally  legitimate authorities. The forces have made noticeable  progress on various lines along an approximately 1,000-km-long  front, breaking the secession barrier forever; and they are now  near Aden City and are tightening the blockade of the city.  Forces in the east are at the gates of 'Ataq city, seeking to  gain final control over Shabwah Governorate. Other forces also  are advancing toward their targets steadily.    [Al-Warraq] What about the other side's claims?    [Al-Sayyani] The actual situation on the battlefield answers  their claims and falsifications.    [Al-Warraq] If you were to address your forces, what would  you say?    [Al-Sayyani] God willing, victory is close. We will defeat  the forces of apostasy and secession that are trying to harm the  brightest aspect of our Arab situation, Yemeni unity, and they  will not be allowed to achieve their aims.    [Al-Warraq] How long will this take?    [Al-Sayyani] The time will be decided by the battle and the  field situation. [passage omitted]</p>

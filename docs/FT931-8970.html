			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Judge rejects KIO appeal over Dollars 5bn Spanish losses THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the external investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, was dealt a serious blow yesterday by a Spanish judge who turned down a KIO appeal against a decision not to open a criminal investigation into the actions of former KIO managers in Spain. The KIO's new management has accused its predecessors and some Spanish associates of losing more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) in Spain since 1986 and claims they stole Dollars 1bn through Grupo Torras, the KIO holding company in Spain. Last month Spain's senior judge in economic matters, Mr Miguel Moreiras, refused to allow the KIO to bring criminal charges against Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, former chairman of the KIO, Mr Fouad Jaffar, former KIO general manager, Mr Javier de la Rosa, who managed the KIO's investments in Spain and five Spanish associates. Judge Moreiras said then the KIO suit contained 'no evidence' of criminal wrongdoing. Judge Moreiras said yesterday the KIO's lawyers had no new evidence and had 'not known how to, or not been able to, focus their accusations into any known crime'. The high court in Madrid has to approve Judge Moreiras' two rulings in the KIO case so far but it would be a judicial sensation if they were overturned. The rejection of the appeal will probably encourage the KIO's new management to begin judicial proceedings elsewhere, possibly in London. Until now, the campaign against the former managers has resulted only in the collapse of the Spanish businesses. In the process, however, Kuwait's finances have been opened to close international scrutiny for the first time and, if the new management is unable to prove its allegations of fraud and conspiracy to steal, some believe Kuwait's credibility in world financial markets will suffer. Mr Javier de la Rosa, the former manager of KIO investments in Spain, said yesterday he intended to sue KIO officials for Dollars 150m for defamation.</p>

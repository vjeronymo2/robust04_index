			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULVER CITY MAYOR'S VIEW;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS MAY PAY MORE FOR SERVICES  </P> <P> Culver City residents may have to pay more if they want to continue enjoying  the current level of city services, Mayor Paul A. Jacobs said this week.  </P> <P> Speaking to a luncheon crowd of nearly 400 at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium  on Tuesday, Jacobs said that if there is to be less commercial development, as  residents seem to want, then residents will have to fill the gap in the city's  general fund budget.  </P> <P> With a fluctuating economy, the city must become less dependent on sales, hotel  and other non-resident taxes as major sources of revenue if residents expect to  maintain current city services, he said.  </P> <P> "We need to be less consumer-oriented and more service-oriented," Jacobs said.  "The sales tax is the yoke around our collective necks."  </P> <P> City officials estimate that 65% of the city's $34 million in general fund  revenues comes from businesses, raised through sales, utility user and hotel  occupancy taxes. They estimate that taxes and fees paid by residents account  for 25% of revenues.  </P> <P> Last year, the city faced a deficit and increased some fees and taxes,  including the utility user tax, to balance the budget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> User Fee Increase  </P> <P> Projected revenues for the 1989-90 are about $2 million less than anticipated  expenditures. City officials are likely to raise more user fees to balance the  budget, city officials said, although no specific fees have been identified.  </P> <P> Many other cities facing a shortage of traditional sources of revenues also are  turning to increased fees for city services to balance their budgets.  </P> <P> Last year, for example, Beverly Hills reviewed all fees for city services to  determine which ones could be increased. Increasing fees for such services as  fire inspections, recreational programs and building permits is expected to  raise an additional $1 million.  </P> <P> Don Oblander, Beverly Hills finance director, said cities are trying to  recapture the cost of city services from residents who actually use the  services instead of taxing everyone.  </P> <P> In Culver City, Jacobs said residents have been lucky to have businesses raise  most of the general fund revenues through business permits and hotel occupancy,  property and utility user taxes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Free Ride'  </P> <P> "We have been getting a free ride," Jacobs said in an interview after his  speech. "As residents, we have enjoyed for a long time a good part of the bill  being paid by non-residential taxpayers.  </P> <P> "Ideally, I would like to see the residents pay nothing and have the commercial  side pay 100%. But realistically, if and when these sources of revenues are  reduced, we must become prepared to fill that gap. I'm trying now to prepare  the community to be sensitive to the budget constraints."  </P> <P> At the luncheon were members of local civic and service groups, homeowners'  associations, social service organizations and business owners. It is these  leaders, Jacobs said, that must help prepare the community for the shift in  revenue sources.  </P> <P> "The time has come to send a message," Jacobs said. "Without that kind of  leadership we are not going to make the kind of changes we need to."  </P></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Striking French fishermen hit ports Striking French fishermen yesterday blocked several Mediterranean ports and disrupted cargoes of fish travelling from Brittany ports in support of their demands for increased aid and protection against cheap imports. Marseilles, Port St Louis and Fos-sur-Mer were among the ports blocked until the afternoon by trawlers and other vessels. Fishermen from Brittany, where the two-week strike has been centred, stopped lorries travelling to Paris to check if they were carrying fish. Several fish lorries had their cargoes dumped on the roads. The protest, which saw violent demonstrations at the beginning of the dispute, has evolved into a stand-off between fishermen and the government. Fishermen last week voted to continue their action despite a series of concessions from the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur, including two aid packages worth a combined FFr450m (Pounds 51m). Union leaders have demanded extra measures to protect the French fishing industry from cheap imports and are calling for an emergency meeting with Mr Balladur. But, since last weekend, they have also urged members to avoid violence to prevent the loss of public support. The French government yesterday ruled out negotiations or further concessions. 'There is no question of re-opening negotiations,' said Mr Jean Puech, the minister for agriculture and fisheries. 'The government has done what is necessary and the measures respond to what was demanded,' he said. In addition to financial support, the government has tightened inspection requirements relating to fish imports. French officials say that the inspection criteria are in line with EU regulations, but the measures have drawn protests from trading partners, including the US.</p>

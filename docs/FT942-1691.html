			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Patten threatens schools with closure: Ultimate sanction may be used if curriculum test results are not produced Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday threatened schools in England and Wales with closure if they did not provide results of national curriculum tests. His comments led to fierce responses from opposition politicians and teachers' unions. Most schools appear not to have taken the tests this year after a boycott by the National Union of Teachers. Under Mr Patten's plans, released in a consultative document, schools in areas which already have large numbers of surplus places may be closed. However, he aims to maintain 'choice, quality and diversity', and will use test results, among other criteria, to determine quality. He said: 'If I haven't in a certain school got any indication of quality because I don't have any test results, then it's impossible for me to say that a school deserves to be expanded.' But some schools will be allowed to expand - and new schools could be started - in areas with surplus places if they were judged to be of high quality. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities described the threat as 'outrageous' and said that Mr Patten would be open to a legal challenge if decisions on school closures were made on the basis of test results. Mr Doug McAvoy, the NUT general secretary, described the threat as 'blackmail'. The school population in England and Wales is expected to rise by 14 per cent by the end of the decade. Mr Patten's plan provoked claims that he would add to the national total of 1.3m surplus school places, which were estimated in January 1991 to cost the exchequer Pounds 313m. Government loans will be available for parents' associations that wish to promote their own new schools. Under rules announced in December the government will fund 85 per cent of the costs of setting up a new school, if promoters - such as businesses, and religious or parents' groups - produce the remaining 15 per cent. In April Mr Patten said that 700,000 surplus places could easily be shed in England and Wales. Mrs Ann Taylor, who speaks for Labour on education, said the change in policy flew in the face of 'all that ministers have said about the urgent need to reduce surplus places'. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said that growing popular schools would need funding guarantees if they were allowed to expand, while neighbouring unpopular schools would suffer a 'slow, lingering death'.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Retired General Jaime Salinas Sedo by </F> Mariella Balbi and Eduardo Guzman at Real Felipe Prison; date  not given: "Hermoza Is Afraid of Us" -- first paragraph is LA  REPUBLICA introduction]    [Text] In the following pages Gen (Ret) Jaime Salinas Sedo  states from his cell in Real Felipe Prison that discontent is  increasing in the ranks of the Army. The crisis in the barracks,  the fears of the military high command, and the prospects  looking toward the 1995 elections are the subjects covered here  by the constitutionalist military officer. This interview was  also broadcast over Radio "Miraflores" during the well-known  political program, "Doble Sentido" [Double Meaning].    [LA REPUBLICA] General Salinas, the Army Information Office  (OIE) has published a statement in which it is stated that  "freedom of information is being improperly used" and that there  is a campaign orchestrated by the media to make the Army look  like a "violator of human rights linked to the narcotics traffic  and an institution with internal problems." What do you think of  this?    [Salinas] In the Army there is a policy on the dissemination  of information. More than anything else, it is the  responsibility of the command to keep officers informed about  military developments. However, in the information bulletin to  which you refer there is a marked, political orientation.  Unfortunately, its contents are going to contribute to greater  divisions between civilians and military personnel because there  is a great deal of misinformation in it. It is being said that  the press is attacking the Army as an institution. As far as I  know, and I follow the news very closely, none of the  communications media has attacked the Army. The media have  denounced some bad elements within the Army, which is something  very different. This document to which you refer not only  mentions the Peruvian media but speaks of a national and  international campaign against the Army. The truth is that I do  not understand this. In my view this is an error. And the  principal person responsible in a vertically organized  institution like ours is the commanding general of the Army.  This document offers nothing good to civilians and military  personnel, nor does it contribute to the democratic stability  which we all desire so much.    [LA REPUBLICA] Would you say that the high command of the  Army feels threatened by news reports?    [Salinas] The prestige of the armed forces has never been as  low as it is now. In our view the person responsible for this  situation is the commanding general of the Army, not because he  has been involved in this or that matter but simply because he  holds that position. He should resign, but what is happening?  Instead of resigning, he is hiding behind the Army as an  institution. He uses it to save his skin. He misinforms the  officers, making them think that any attack against him as a  person is an attack against the Army. Anyone who has any sense  knows that that is not true.    [LA REPUBLICA] Nevertheless, the president and General  Hermoza himself state that the Army as an institution supports  the commanding general.    [Salinas] That is the version which they wish to sell to the  Peruvian people. At present General Hermoza has no support  within the Army. Military personnel obey him because  hierarchically and in accordance with the Fujimori law he is the  commanding general. We have heard, from meetings which General  Hermoza has held and from the views expressed by officers on  active duty that they are very critical of what General Hermoza  has said. I am talking about officers on active duty. That means  that the story about support for General Hermoza is a falsehood.  He maintains his position at the top of the Army because he  holds power, and that provides support for President Fujimori.  Look, I am not the only one saying this. Within the Army there  is a kind of Gestapo. Any officer who opens his mouth and who  expresses an opinion is automatically marked down by that  Gestapo. On the other hand, the man who informs on him is going  to get a promotion or will be assigned abroad. There is a great  deal of fear of speaking one's opinion freely.    [LA REPUBLICA] Then is it impossible to have a change of  commanding general?    [Salinas] In the Army, speaking of it as an institution,  there is no way in which the commanding general can be removed  from office. There would have to be a complaint that he had  committed a certain crime, and then the matter could be brought  to the attention of the military justice system. As things are  now the commanding general comes directly under the authority of  the president. He holds a political position. Therefore, any  kind of criticism within the Army is regarded as a political  attitude and looks as if the intention is to stage a coup  d'etat. For that reason General Hermoza is filled with hatred  against us and is determined to make sure that we do not get out  of prison.    [LA REPUBLICA] Then President Fujimori is not on your side?    [Salinas] I do not think so, because, however much he may be  a nontraditional politician, as they say, or that he does not  have much experience, he must understand that this is a  political problem which is doing a great deal of damage to the  image of the country. I am sure that on many occasions he would  have liked to resolve this matter, but the anger comes from  General Hermoza. He is afraid that if we are out of prison, we  could cut the ground out from under him. This is not our  intention, but everyone has his own kind of fear. What I can  assure you of is that, within the armed forces, most of the  officers are in total disagreement with this political  manipulation of the Army as an institution, which is doing so  much harm to it.    [LA REPUBLICA] Among the things which are doing the most  harm  to the armed forces are the well-founded accusations that,  basically, it is providing support for the narcotics traffic.  What is going to happen about this?    [Salinas] The worst mistake which the armed forces made was  to become involved in the struggle against the narcotics  traffic, because this would corrupt anyone. The power of money  is very great and especially so since our officers are very  poorly paid. However, in any case the guilty parties must be  severely punished.    [LA REPUBLICA] Are those punishments being handed out?  General Hermoza has stated that no Army officer is involved in  the "Vatican" case. Do you think that this is plausible?    [Salinas] The information which Major Castillo has provided  has been corroborated by officers on active duty who have made  this known to us. Regarding General Hermoza's statement they  have commented that, "Nobody believes him because all of us know  that there certainly were officers involved in the narcotics  traffic at the time when the `Vatican' was in the area." They  must be punished for the good of the Army as an institution.    [LA REPUBLICA] And why are they being provided with cover,  general? Who is protecting them?    [Salinas] I would not say that they are protected. This has  come out at a time when the image of the Army as an institution  has seriously deteriorated, and they are trying to make sure  that this image does not get worse. In my view that is an error  because if cases like that have occurred, it would be better to  resolve the problem--once and for all. That is, cutting off a  gangrenous leg so that the whole body is not affected. They are  trying to hide things, and that makes people have doubts about  the Army as an institution.    [LA REPUBLICA] Would you say that the Army has become a  political party?    [Salinas] I would not say that. Yes, there is a high  ranking,  politicized group which is politically manipulating promotions.  But the ordinary officer himself is not politicized. He wants to  be a worthy professional soldier in the service of the  fatherland.    [LA REPUBLICA] Are you afraid that in the next elections the  armed forces will participate actively in the election process?    [Salinas] The armed forces have been improperly used in the  CCD [Congressional] elections. I think that an attempt to do  this will be repeated. However, on the basis of the information  which I receive from officers in the Army they are going to  oppose that attitude. They are not going to become involved in  distributing leaflets and photographs or collecting signatures,  as they were required to do in the previous election. The  officers as a group are rejecting such an improper use of them.  As far as I know, they want the Peruvian people to understand  that the armed forces, and the Army in particular, is going to  behave in a clean, open, and impartial way. Now, it is probable  that the orders have been issued, because General Hermoza is  going to want to place the armed forces, and the Army in  particular, at the service of President Fujimori.    [LA REPUBLICA] If Fujimori does not win the next elections,  could this put the armed forces in a difficult situation?    [Salinas] The armed forces owe their loyalty to the  government elected democratically by the people and not to  President Fujimori. Undoubtedly, within the armed forces, there  are people who, because they have committed themselves  politically, have gone beyond the limits of their duties. The  next government will see what punishments apply to them.    [LA REPUBLICA] Do you think that this will create a tense  situation?    [Salinas] Certainly, that faction in the Army will try to do  what it can. Fujimori cannot be blamed. However, those who know  that he is at fault are going to join together. Nevertheless, I  think that the Army as an institution is not going to allow  these manipulations to continue merely to save the skins of two  or three people who have only done harm to the Army. However  much that faction may wish to keep itself in power at all cost,  come what may, the officers are not going to support them.    [LA REPUBLICA] Although the candidacy of Javier Perez de  Cuellar has not yet been decided, the political parties are not  much prepared to join in getting behind him. How do you see the  prospects for this?    [Salinas] For me it is a matter of concern that the election  problem has not been resolved and that Congress is postponing  debate until April [1994]. This is just a delaying action. I do  not understand how there can be people who believe that all of  that is simply the result of some kind of real, democratic game.  In fact, it is a carefully planned game to ensure that the  opposition has the least possible time to prepare itself for the  elections of 1995.    [LA REPUBLICA] Do you think that the opposition is poorly  prepared because of its lack of decision and not because of the  problem of the elections law?    [Salinas] There is a need for the leaders of the opposition  to get together and reach agreement. My concern, and I believe  that it is also yours, is that they are letting a lot of time to  go by before they define their positions. There can be a single  candidate or three or four opposition candidates. There can be a  thousand solutions to this problem. What is needed is for the  political leaders to sit down right now and adopt a strategy.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is it a matter of no concern as to whether  there is one or several candidates?    [Salinas] Look, I have not been a politician but a military  officer. I am involved in politics because I am in prison.  However, I think that if the opposition disperses its forces, it  will be more difficult to face up to Fujimori, because he is  going to use all of the resources of the state to be reelected.  If wasps attack me one a minute, I will continue to kill them  with a fly swatter. But if a thousand wasps attack me at the  same time, I am dead. In the Army that is called the principle  of mass. You have to use mass in the right place and at the  right time. It seems to me that a single opposition candidate  would be better, but a single program would be worth more than  that. You have to reach agreement on a minimum program which  must be respected by all political groups. And once everyone  believes that it makes no difference who is the candidate,  because that program is going to be followed, only then should  we decide on a specific candidate.    [LA REPUBLICA] Could you be that candidate, General Salinas,  as Javier Valle Riestra has stated?    [Salinas] I am a prisoner in jail. I can only show my face  behind the bars of my cell. No, that is out of the question. The  person who should accept that challenge is someone who is free  to move around, who can reach the people and explain to them  what real, democratic choices they have in confronting the  dictatorship. As far as I am concerned, a political decision has  been made that I will not get out of here until after the  elections. I have no ambition, nor do I wish to be a candidate.  But even if I wanted it, I would simply be prevented from being  a candidate.    [LA REPUBLICA] Are the civic movements which are appearing  in  the provinces and here in Lima the nucleus of the future  political party which you could lead within an opposition  coalition?    [Salinas] They have not been organized with that in mind.  They are very far from politics. They have been organized to  demand freedom for us officers who are unjustly in prison. They  will close down as we are given our freedom. The solution for  the eight officers who are with me could be facilitated with  this type of pressure. This would not apply to me, personally.    [LA REPUBLICA] Why do you say that?    [Salinas] There is a particular kind of anger against me.  The  signatures which are being collected, calling for my release,  are from all sectors and political parties.    [LA REPUBLICA] Finally, General Cisneros has stated that  coups d'etat are not out of the question and that another  Sergeant Huapaya could emerge. What do you think?    [Salinas] Our history is marked by a series of coups d'etat  and democratic springtimes of very short duration. However,  increasingly the armed forces throughout the world know that  they are in the service of their country and not of a  government. I would say that a coup d'etat is out of the  question.</p>

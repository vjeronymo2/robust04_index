			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: CIBC falls 24% in first quarter HIGHER LOAN losses con-tributed to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce suffering a 24 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, despite improved interest margins and an increase in assets. Net earnings slipped to CDollars 169m (USDollars 135m), or 74 cents a share, in the three months to January 31 from CDollars 221m, or CDollars 1.01, a year earlier. Return on common equity fell to 10.6 per cent, from 13.5 per cent. Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 220m, from CDollars 188m. But the bank said it expected credit losses for fiscal 1993 as a whole of CDollars 880m, well down on last year's CDollars 1.8bn setback. CIBC has been through a turbulent period recently, ranging from its heavy exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the real estate developer which collapsed last year, to a sweeping reorganisation following the appointment of a new chairman and chief exec-utive. Analysts have also identified the bank as the biggest lender to the troubled Bronfman group of industrial, property and financial service companies. Assets have risen by 10 per cent in the past year to CDollars 136.2bn on January 31, putting CIBC less than CDollars 1bn behind its chief rival, Royal Bank of Canada. But CIBC's first-quarter return on assets was 0.50 per cent, against Royal's 0.73 per cent. Total non-performing loans climbed fractionally during the quarter to CDollars 3.14bn. The bank said the recession continued to hurt its business, 'although there are signs of an economic recovery'. CIBC is focusing its operations on three core markets. They are consumer business and commercial banking in Canada, as well as large corporate and government customers throughout north America. Cost controls led to a slight decline in non-interest expenses in the latest period. CIBC is the last of Canada's big six banks to publish first-quarter earnings. Most of the others reported little change in earnings, with higher loan losses continuing to offset improved interest income. One notable exception is Toronto-Dominion, which has suffered from the heavy concentration of its business in southern Ontario. Besides lending problems, TD's earnings were hit by the costs of absorbing a recently acquired trust company.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BANK RESULTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- For quarter ended Jan 31 1993*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Net income     Return on     Return on                         (CDollars m)     equity %      assets %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Bank of Canada      254 (256)    14.8 (14.5)   0.73 (0.76) CIBC                      169 (221)    10.6 (13.5)   0.50 (0.71) Bank of Montreal          155 (164)    12.5 (15.1)   0.56 (0.65) Bank of Nova Scotia       165 (174)    13.9 (17)     0.65 (0.77) Toronto-Dominion            1 (115)    -0.7 (9.6)       0 (0.66) National Bank of Cda       45 (49.8)   10.8 (11.3)   0.46 (0.53)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Previous year in brackets  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

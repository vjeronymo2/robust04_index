			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, in &sect;&sect;192.150(b)(7) and 195.120(b)(6), while the rule has not excepted all offshore lines and related facilities, it has excepted offshore lines which are not gas transmission lines or liquid main lines 10 inches or greater in nominal diameter that transport these commodities to onshore facilities. RSPA limited the accommodation of smart pigs to these larger gas transmission and liquid main lines because we find, for the reasons expressed by the commenters, that the unique design and construction of the excepted offshore pipeline systems makes them generally impracticable for the passage of smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the rulemaking mandated by the PLSA of 1992 discussed under the heading_Future Rulemaking Involving Smart Pigs_is issued, RSPA may prescribe the circumstances for inspection with smart pigs. Such circumstances, if included in any final rule, may require the need for offshore platforms that contain risers, to also accommodate launchers and (where appropriate) receivers for the passage of smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Above Ground Pipelines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Three commenters recommended that RSPA except above ground pipelines because operators can inspect these pipelines visually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA finds that regardless of whether an operator can visually inspect a line above ground is irrelevant to the practicability of design and construction of pipelines to accommodate passage of smart pigs. Furthermore, smart pigs are capable of detecting internal defects that cannot be discovered by a visual inspection of the outside surface of a pipeline. Moreover, above ground pipelines are required to be externally coated and coating materials usually preclude visual inspection of the outside surface. So, this recommendation was not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Clarification of the Term ``Replacement'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Thirteen commenters recommended that the terms ``replacement transmission line'' and ``replacement pipeline'' be clarified to indicate the portion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an existing line that must be modified to accommodate smart pigs when replacements are made for other reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A gas pipeline operator recommended that the meaning of the term ``replacement transmission line'' be limited to the pipe and components such as valves, bends, and fittings which are added to or replaced in an existing transmission line. Another gas pipeline operator expressed support for regulations stating that replacement pipeline facilities could not be constructed which would further restrict the passage of a smart pig. RSPA cannot accept the first commenter's recommendations because if ``replacement'' is limited to a replaced valve, a joint of pipe, or other component, then pipelines with restrictive components, such as elbows and tight radius field bends (which when properly maintained never need replacement) would never be piggable. Also RSPA cannot accept the second commenter's position because it appears to mean that the operator need only to make the replacement no more restrictive than it was prior to it being replaced. The clear intent of the congressional mandate is to improve an existing pipeline's piggability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A pipeline operator and a pipeline related association, recommended that the word ``pipeline'' be replaced with ``line section'' defined in &sect;195.2. A gas pipeline association urged that ``replacement transmission line'' be changed to ``replacement transmission section'' to clearly indicate that only the portion of line replaced must accommodate the passage of smart pigs. Another pipeline related association interpreted ``replacement'' to mean either: (1) Replacement of the entire line, or (2) replacement of the line segment between two logical points (e.g. compressor stations). A gas pipeline operator also believed the term ``segment'' is appropriate because it is frequently used in part 192 and it recognizes that pipelines are segmented for different regulatory purposes. A gas transmission operator felt that the definition of ``replacement line'' should exempt the replacement of partial segments of existing gas pipelines within a valve section that are replaced because of class change or regular maintenance work because of construction restraints. A gas distribution operator stated that if the proposal was intended to apply to the replaced or relocated section only, then that limitation should be in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

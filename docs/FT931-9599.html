			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Crest returns to the black with Pounds 2m CREST NICHOLSON, the Surrey-based housebuilder, commercial developer and construction group, moved back into profit in the year to October 31, reflecting improved performances in all three divisions. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.03m compared with losses of Pounds 59.4m in the previous year when the group made exceptional provisions of Pounds 39.8m to cover the write-down of its residential and commercial land and developments because of falling property prices. At the operating level the group swung from losses of Pounds 7m to profits of Pounds 9.47m. Turnover declined to Pounds 238.2m, a fall of 27 per cent on the previous year's Pounds 324.2m. The pre-tax figure was struck after interest charges of Pounds 7.44m (Pounds 12.6m) reflecting a decline in both average borrowings and interest rates. Net borrowings at end-October of Pounds 62.7m (Pounds 54.7m) represented gearing of 59.6 per cent (50.6 per cent). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.93m mainly related to the sale of the loss-making En-tout-cas sports surface and leisure business last year. Losses per share worked through at 0.13p (55.67p) and the company is again paying a nominal 0.01p dividend. Commenting on the results Mr John St Lawrence, chairman, said the improved per-formance demonstrated the benefits of the group's determination to concentrate on core businesses. However, both he and Mr John Callcutt, chief executive, cautioned that the market remained 'extremely tough' and that the first half results this year were likely to be below those of last year. For 1991-92 the core residential division reported flat turnover of Pounds 121.2m (Pounds 120.9m) and an operating profit of Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 6.4m loss) while the absence of write-downs enabled the division to record a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 47.2m loss). The division sold a record 1,465 (1,435) units last year at an average price of Pounds 76,000 (Pounds 78,000). The margin on house sales increased from 7 per cent to 16 per cent. The property and construction divisions also recorded modest operating profits last year despite declining turnover. The construction division made an increased pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.5m) while the property division managed to substantially reduce its pre-tax loss from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds 2.3m. COMMENT The new management team has refocused the group and pointed it towards recovery, but it remains an uphill struggle. It is taking longer than expected to find tenants for the completed commercial portfolio, which will then be sold to reduce borrowings. In the meantime, bank facilities of Pounds 151.5m look more than adequate. Despite renewed signs of life in the housing market, the management remains cautious. Construction margins are under pressure and the property division remains becalmed at best. Interim results are likely to be disappointing and full year profits of Pounds 2m are likely again. The management, and the market, are looking to 1994 for any real improvement. In the meantime those looking for housing recovery stocks can find purer plays.</p>

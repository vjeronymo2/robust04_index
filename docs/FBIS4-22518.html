			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vsevolod Generalov, first deputy chairman of </F> the RF Committee on Metallurgy, by Viktor Andriyanov,  correspondent of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA; place and date not given:  "Hot Conversion in a Hot Shop"]    [Text] We introduce the person we interviewed.    Vsevolod Aleksandrovich Generalov began his labor  activity as a worker at the lead-zinc combine in  Ust-Kamenogorsk. He graduated from the Metallurgical Faculty of  the Kazakh Polytechnical Institute. He was an operator, a  smelter, a furnace attendant, a foreman, a senior foreman, and a  shop chief. In the hot shop he was molded not only as a  production manager, but also as a scientist. Vsevolod  Aleksandrovich headed the Scientific Research Institute of  Nonferrous Metallurgy and was elected general director of the  Tsvetnaya Metallurgiya Scientific Production Association. He is  candidate of technical sciences.    In the evening, on the eve of our meeting, I saw in the  first  television program the frames of an old newsreel: the  construction of Magnitka's first blast furnaces. Against their  background the affectedly cheerful voice of a huckster was  selling Magnitka's shares.    I devoted several years of my life to this city near the  Ural  River and to the celebrated metallurgical combine. The  out-of-town editorial staff of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA worked there  during the construction of the "2500" cold-rolling mill. We  published MALAYA KOMSOMOLKA. A cast plaque on a pedestal--Shop  imeni KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA--is in memory of our work.    Viktor Filippovich Tomchuk, one of Magnitka's first  volunteers, often dropped in on us, the out-of-town editorial  staff. He was building the railroad to the future combine, then  worked in its shops, and at the end of the 1960's, when we  became acquainted, he spent every leave at Magnitogorsk's new  construction sites. He "took part in unpaid mass work," as  Tomchuk liked to say. With what shares can he be paid for all  those unselfish years? And carpenter Isayev, who, according to  his proud testimony, went through all Magnitka's mills? And  thousands of their contemporaries--founders of the most powerful  metallurgical combine in the world?    Will the same that has occurred with Uralmash, with the  Gorkiy Motor Vehicle Plant, and with the industry's other  giants, which are now being pulled apart, not happen with  Magnitka?    "Magnitka," Vsevolod Aleksandrovich, having heard my tirade,  said patiently, "is one of the few enterprises, part of the  shares of which, in accordance with the government decision,  remains under federal ownership."    [Andriyanov] What part?    [Generalov] A total of 22.3 percent. In other joint-stock  companies--in the sector 75 percent of the enterprises have  already been transformed into joint-stock companies--no blocks  of shares remain under federal ownership.    After a closed subscription is conducted among members of  labor collectives, where 56 percent of the shares are bought  out, the remaining 44 are sold on the securities market,  including 29 percent of the shares, at voucher auctions.    The value of enterprises was determined at the prices of 1  July 1992, incidentally, like the nominal value of the voucher.  Therefore, I share your alarm: In practice, enterprise funds are  being distributed through voucher auctions. In many cases what  workers and engineers acquire is much less than the share that  falls to the buyers-up of vouchers.    [Andriyanov] It happens that vouchers are brought in bags.    [Generalov] They are not always bought up by those that  participate in voucher auctions. Therefore, fights, and by no  means of local significance, often are going on there. And,  seemingly, quite unexpectedly the control block of shares of key  enterprises passes to strange hands. How many criminal incidents  with directors and other workers of enterprises, if their  positions did not coincide with the interests of new owners,  have already occurred!    Foreign firms often participate in voucher auctions through  figure-heads. They do this not always in order to invest funds  in production development. Interest in the elimination of a  competitor on Russian and world markets is not ruled out.    [Andriyanov] In order to solve problems of reconstruction  and  development, many of the sector's enterprises need state support.    [Generalov] Now, according to the new privatization program,  from 25.5 to 51 percent of the shares of enterprises in a number  of sectors can remain under federal ownership for 3 years.  Unfortunately, plants of the metallurgical complex did not get  on this list.    Enterprises acutely need the block of shares, which would  remain under federal ownership, during the establishment of  financial-industrial groups and holding companies. In this case  shares are the tool for the combination of the interests of  enterprises and realization of joint investment programs. Later  the sale of shares of such associations is possible at  investment, not voucher, auctions, the winners of which will  invest real funds in the development of enterprises.    [Andriyanov] Information on protests by metallurgists in  connection with the transfer of part of the shares of nonferrous  metallurgical plants to the Roseltrans Company has appeared in  the press. What is the essence of the conflict?    [Generalov] In a number of metallurgical enterprises, in  accordance with the directive of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property, it was proposed that the block  of shares temporarily remaining under federal ownership be  transferred to the Roseltrans Joint-Stock Company, which was  being established. What is Roseltrans?    Let me try to figure it out. This is a company, which  intends  to produce electric locomotives. However, what does the  Norilskiy Nikel Concern have to do with it? Or the Krasnoyarsk  Aluminum Plant? Or the Kolchugino Plant for the Processing of  Nonferrous Metal? Or the Gayskiy Ore-Dressing Combine, which  received an instruction to transfer part of the shares to the  authorized capital of Roseltrans. This combine mines ore and  produces concentrates for nonferrous metallurgical enterprises.  It would be logical to establish an association of enterprises  connected through technological cooperation.    [Andriyanov] Why holding companies and financial-industrial  groups are being established slowly in the sector?    [Generalov] This is not quite so. Plans for the  establishment  of a number of financial-industrial groups and holding companies  in metallurgy have now been prepared. A holding company, ALKUR,  was established on the basis of joint-stock companies of the  aluminum industry in Sverdlovsk Oblast. The formation of large  companies envisages the participation of consumers of metal  products. A pilot project for the establishment of  financial-industrial groups in the aluminum industry is being  prepared.    In metallurgy the establishment of financial-industrial  groups and holding companies is more necessary than in other  sectors. First, in order to maintain intrasectorial  technological cooperation ties from ore mining to the output of  finished metal products. Second, the consolidation of material  and financial resources will provide opportunities for the  modernization of production and for a better utilization of  production capacities.    However, existing, including antimonopoly, legislation  limits  these opportunities.    [Andriyanov] Vsevolod Aleksandrovich, precisely in what?    [Generalov] People say that monopoly is arising. However,  all  over the world large corporations operate in metallurgy--in  ferrous metallurgy and in aluminum, copper-nickel, and other  subsectors. The concept of "natural" monopoly, to which  metallurgy pertains, exists there. This is due to the attachment  to ore bases and to the specific technological features of  production. The establishment of large conglomerates and  corporations, sometimes with the participation of the state,  makes it possible to efficiently utilize natural resources, to  successfully compete on the foreign market, and to establish a  strong frame for the national economy.    Our competitors abroad are increasing production and  capturing markets, while Russian metallurgy has reduced the  production volume by 40 percent. Not only the drop in demand,  but also the rupture of economic ties, has had an effect. The  situation cannot be worse.    [Andriyanov] Russia has already fallen back to fourth place  in the world in steel production.    [Generalov] Russia's proportion in world steel output in  1993  dropped from 9.3 to 8.0 percent. Japan holds first place--99.6  million tonnes. China has moved up into second place--88.7  million. Then there is the United States--87 million.    [Andriyanov] However, your metallurgy has begun to lag not  today?    [Generalov] Of course. For many years it developed  extensively. Capital investments were allocated mainly for an  increase in production volumes. Obsolete and worn out equipment  remained there. For years the coefficient of fixed capital  replacement was 0.9 to 1.2. This is lower than the technically  and economically substantiated level by a factor of 3 to 4. Now  more than 60 percent of the steel and one-half of the rolled  metal products are produced on antiquated equipment.    [Andriyanov] Where are we going?    [Generalov] Without urgent measures for the retooling of  metallurgy, protection of the domestic market, and regulation of  the rise in prices of energy resources and transport Russian  metallurgy will cease to exist.    [Andriyanov] However, we are advised to buy metal, like  grain, abroad. They say that this will be cheaper.    [Generalov] This is totally unjustified economically, not to  mention the fact that national security cannot be guaranteed  without its metallurgy. For example, in order to import 10  million tonnes of rolled steel products, 3.5 to 4.0 billion  dollars will be needed. On the domestic market the same quantity  of rolled metal products can be bought for 600 to 700 million  dollars.    U.S. experience is also significant. About 20 years ago  America made an attempt to orient itself toward the import of  metal products, abandoning large financial investments in the  modernization of its own metallurgy. However, even with its vast  export opportunities the United States was forced to return to  the revival of its own metallurgy on the latest technical basis.  It engages in it very successfully. Steel output in the United  States, having dropped from 103.8 million tonnes in 1980 to 67.8  million tonnes in 1985, began to grow again.    [Andriyanov] As is well known, the Government of the Russian  Federation adopted the Federal Program for the Retooling and  Development of Russia's Metallurgy designed until the year 2000.  RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA discussed it in detail.    [Generalov] We are grateful for this to the newspaper. There  is no modern state without metal. The consumption of finished  rolled metal products and steel pipes is sharply declining in  Russia. At the same time, metal products, which ensure the  vitality of the state economy, remain unclaimed. They include  transport metal, rails, and wheels (a 30-percent reduction in  consumption), pipes for gas lines and wells (30 percent),  bearing steel (40 percent), and cables (20 percent). The  consumption of nonferrous metals is being reduced.    [Andriyanov] As far as I know, in our country the per-capita  consumption of aluminum is one-tenth of that in the United  States. At the same time, we are reducing aluminum production by  500,000 tonnes in 1994. How to understand this?    [Generalov] We are being forced out from the foreign market,  which we have barely entered. They say that, as a result of the  increase in the export of aluminum from Russia in recent years,  its price has dropped sharply. However, this is only part of the  truth. Aluminum production has increased in a number of  countries and the "credit" for the decline in the prices of this  metal is joint.    [Andriyanov] Discriminatory practice with respect to Russian  producers continues on the world market. Nevertheless,  metallurgists have been able to increase the export of foreign  metals.    [Generalov] The export of ferrous metals has doubled,  totaling 3.5 to 4 billion dollars. One-half went to Asian  countries, 33.9, to Western Europe, and 4.9 percent, to America.  The share of finished products has increased in the export  structure.    The export of nonferrous metals has declined, totaling 2  billion dollars, that is, half a billion less than in 1992. The  reduction was due to the rise in prices of energy resources and  fuel in the second half of 1993. In the fourth quarter the  Government of Russia revised export duties, which made it  possible to partially restore the efficiency of the export of  metal products.    On the whole, however, only 10 to 15 percent of the domestic  metal products can compete on the world market. And so, there is  no end of the work to be done here.</p>

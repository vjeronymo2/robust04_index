			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Price of Sun about to rise to 22p The price of The Sun will rise from 20p to 22p on Monday, News International announced last night. The price was last reduced almost a year ago, when a cut from 25p to 20p sparked off a war in which the prices of several national daily newspapers came down. But the group said last night: 'There are no plans to raise the price of any other News International papers.' It will mean that next week The Times, at 20p, will be cheaper than The Sun for the first time. Mr Stuart Higgins, editor of The Sun, said last night that increases in the costs of paper and printing had made the price rise necessary. Last month's circulation for The Sun, the latest from the Audit Bureau of Circulation, is 4,173,699 compared with 2,501,421 for the rival Daily Mirror, which has held its price at 27p.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Kantor outlines US policy towards Japan IN A broad defence of the emerging controversial US Japan policy, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US could lead the world out of recession only if Japan reduced its huge and still growing trade surplus. 'It is our responsibility to get our budget deficit under control, invest in our infrastructure and lead global growth,' he said. 'But we have just got to do something about the Japanese trade surplus, which creates an asymmetrical economic situation in the world, costing US jobs.' In the US-Japan talks set to begin tomorrow, Mr Kantor said he would be flexible on demands for numerical indicators to measure progress in reducing that surplus. Other options would also be considered ..' 'We're not telling the Japanese how to reach these goals, how to structure their economy,' he said. 'We're trying to say we have a problem that needs to be addressed.' US concerns were shared by the EC, he said. 'We understand that the Europeans are currently in the middle of negotiating 20 different sectors with the Japanese ..' The US has proposed a negotiating framework which divides the disputes into five baskets: government procurement, regulatory reform, motor vehicle and vehicle parts, compliance with existing agreements and economic integration. Various solutions - some without numerical indicators - will be sought. Negotiators are expected to move quickly, with a comprehensive framework scheduled for completion by the Tokyo economic summit next month. The US approach arises out of the conviction that the structural impediment initiative, negotiated by the Bush administration with no measures for progress, was a failure. The new 'holistic' approach is designed 'to intersect structural and sector problems,' Mr Kantor said. A July 1 deadline for Japan to open its government procurement market on construction is likely to pass without sanctions, although, after years of negotiations and four pacts, less then 1 per cent of Japanese central government procurement has been going to foreign suppliers. The criteria could be the number of procurement opportunities open to foreign suppliers, the transparency of the process, or the foreign market share. 'We're flexible in dealing with these, but we are not flexible in looking for results in terms of measurable success,' Mr Kantor said. The US specifically will push Japan to increase its imports of manufactured goods. Even a one-third increase would bring Japanese imports up to only half the level of most industrialised countries. It is not the US approach that is managed trade but Japan's, according to Mr Kantor. 'I would say classic managed trade would be not opening your markets and protecting your industries, while you export critical high-value products to other countries.'</p>

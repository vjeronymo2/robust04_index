			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Survey of South Africa (7): Testing times for optimism - Manufacturing A DECADE of stagflation, domestic unrest and international isolation has done remarkably little damage to the famous optimism of South Africa's businessmen. The difficulties of transition offer little respite, but they remain convinced that the 90s can't possibly be as bad as the 80s. They argue that hard times have forged a lean and resilient business sector. They also identify the considerable benefits flowing from the country's readmission to the international arena, and the prospects of regional peace. Their ability to deliver, however, will be tested as never before in the years ahead. The country's real gross domestic product per capita has fallen by an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent since 1981. Nobody doubts the consequences of that trend persisting, and the responsibility for addressing it falls largely to business. The portents are sobering. The average growth rate between 1979 and 1989 was only 2.14 per cent, compared to 3.02 per cent in the 1970-79 period. By no means exempt from this was the manufacturing sector. Mr Ted Osborne of the Nedbank Economic Unit calculates that gross domestic fixed investment in the sector declined by an average 0.81 per cent per annum over the period 1979-89 - hardly the basis for sustained growth. This should not be surprising - capital sanctions limited the country to about 3 per cent growth per annum, otherwise balance of payments problems ensued. This meant that the authorities had to douse any economic recovery which threatened to gather steam, the net effect being a massive disincentive to invest. When the origins of future growth are discussed, three areas top the list. First are those who will benefit from the shift in budgetary priorities towards social spending. Infrastructural upgrading in black areas and the increased supply of schools and houses should benefit construction and related sectors. Next is the 'second world' - those in transition from a Third to a First World economy - consisting largely of black urban residents. They have enormous unmet needs. Finally, there are exports. It is broadly received wisdom that the country should follow an export-led manufacturing growth path. This coincides with the economy's shift from being import-replacement oriented to being more outward-looking. The latest manifestation of this was the report released last month by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) on the modification of the country's tariff regime. The report notes: 'South African industry has been stagnating for a long time. The country's future prosperity will be determined by its ability to play a bigger role in international trade in industrial goods.' It recommends reduced tariffs, lower import surcharges and a realistic exchange rate policy as essential elements in making the existing industrial structure more export competitive. Although the cabinet has still to consider the report, the chances of it being accepted are good, as it is consistent with government economic thinking. This should bring to an end a long and debilitating doctrinal dispute about how best government should promote export-led industrial growth: through focused 'Structural Adjustment Programmes' (SAP), in industries with perceived comparative advantages, or through a General Export Incentive Scheme (GEIS), such as is currently in place. The report favours the former, government having vacillated between the two in recent years, to the consternation of the country's exporters. A salutary aspect of the report is the line: 'These findings are supported by the results of a number of previous official investigations . . .' Sceptics wonder whether the government will do any better than its predecessors in implementing the findings. However, government's clear desire to place the economy on a structurally sound footing before political transition may provide the necessary impetus. South Africa's export performance in recent years has been mixed. Commodity prices, especially gold, but also steel, ferro-alloys and platinum, have been weak, and this has dampened revenues. What has given cause for cheer, however, has been the performance of merchandise exports. In the period 1984 to 1990, covering the height of the sanctions era, these rose by an average annual rate of more than 10 per cent. These trends are reflected in manufactured exports, increasing from 18 to 29 per cent of total exports between 1980 and 1989. In 1990 the country's exports were R60.6bn, 3.1 per cent up on 1989 (up 4.3 per cent in dollars, to Dollars 23.4bn). Mr Wim Holtes, chief executive of the South African Foreign Trade Organisation, says gold's weakness means the country will do well to achieve 2 per cent growth this year. He believes the recovery of world economies in 1992 will see a return to a 5-7 per cent growth rate. Mr Holtes says the euphoria surrounding the easing of sanctions and the opening of new markets needs to be put into context. Remembering that Europe accounts for more than 50 per cent of South Africa's trade, he suggests the combination of South Africa's political reforms and 1992 single market reforms in Europe will be the dominant trade dynamics for the country in years ahead. Eastern Europe, where South Africa has established an extensive trade and diplomatic presence over the past year, has been largely a political and media event. 'Economically the opportunities have been modest,' says Mr Holtes. The breakthrough into Africa has been more substantial. South Africa's trade with the rest of the continent increased by 40 per cent in 1989, 22 per cent last year, and currently stands at the level of about R8-9bn a year. The prospect of South Africa, Mozambique and Angola reaching political settlements will create positive business synergies for South Africa. Local businesses have a head-start when it comes to understanding the environment, and are sure to be participants in the infrastructural development the area will embark on, as well as in the satisfaction of long neglected consumer needs.</p>

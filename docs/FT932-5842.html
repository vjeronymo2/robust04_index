			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / President ousted in Guatemala amid celebration PRESIDENT Jorge Serrano of Guatemala was ousted yesterday by a combination of military and opposition leaders. General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, defence minister, took over temporarily but a government communique later said Vice-President Gustavo Espina Salguero would assume presidential duties until a new election. It also said Congress and the Supreme Court would remain dissolved. Congressman Fernando Linares Beltranena and other congressmen said the military was meeting legislators to prepare for an extraordinary session of Congress today and to elect a provisional successor. But, after the communique, it was not clear whether the session would occur. Mr Linares said that, although Gen Garca had taken charge, he believed the military 'wants to keep aloof' and that there would be a civilian successor to Mr Serrano. The presidency in a general's hands could mean a return to the full military rule which Guatemala knows well. A government statement said the president's departure had arisen from a consensus but Ms Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan indigenous leader who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, called it a military coup 'with a civilian facade' and walked out of talks about the succession. A group of union leaders went with her. Early yesterday members of Guatemala's Congress were summoned to the presidential palace. Hundreds of people outside the palace were shouting pro-democracy slogans as the Congress members began to arrive. 'Serrano has fallen, Serrano has fallen,' they cheered as they let off fireworks. The Mexican television station ECO reported from Guatemala City that Gen Garca had asked Mr Serrano, who snatched authoritarian powers last week when he suspended Congress and the Supreme Court, to step down. Business and labour groups were also pressing for the president to quit and there had been much unrest in Guatemala City during the past week over declining living standards. Business had jitters about losing trading benefits under the generalised system of preferences - a possibility raised by the US State Department - which could affect Dollars 200m (Pounds 129.8m) of exports. The US, the European Community and Japan blocked tens of millions of dollars in aid to Guatemala. Mr Serrano was elected in 1990 to a five-year term which he began in January 1991.</p>

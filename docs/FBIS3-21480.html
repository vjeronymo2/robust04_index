Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor  of Riyadh Province and chairman of the Higher Council for the  Collection of Donations for Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims, has  decided to open a permanent council office in Sarajevo, in  addition to an office in Zagreb, to deliver aid to  Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims.    Observers have pointed out that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  is just about the only country in the world that adheres to  providing aid to Lebanon, whereas other countries continue to  procrastinate in implementing their commitments to advance  meaningful aid to Lebanese reconstruction projects.    Observers added that King Fahd's decision on Lebanon  confirms  that aid to brothers is a constant principle of the Saudi  strategy, which adheres to King Fahd's ideas based on constants  derived from the heart of the orthodox religion.    King Fahd has instructed the Saudi authorities concerned to  disburse a sum of $100 million to the Lebanese Government in  order to help Lebanon move forward to achieve the benevolent  goals to which everybody aspires.    An official source said that these instructions come within  the context of the interests of the custodian of the two holy  mosques to see Lebanon move toward security and stability in  accordance with the stipulations of the al-Ta'if accord and on  the basis of the king's ceaseless eagerness to contribute to  whatever is likely to aid Lebanon; to help its people overcome  the consequences of the Lebanese war in various vital fields;  and to enable Lebanese development agencies to perform an  effective role in serving the Lebanese people.    The instructions were given after the king had received  Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri at al-Salam Palace in  Jeddah. Upon returning to Beirut, al-Hariri thanked King Fahd  for his ceaseless aid to Lebanon and its reconstruction.  Al-Hariri said, "Saudi Arabia has gotten us accustomed to the  special attention it always devotes to the conditions in  Lebanon. In addition to the ceaseless political support for the  national concord procession, this grant comes as a new  expression reflecting the love and care King Fahd harbors for  Lebanon and its people under all circumstances. The Lebanese  people will not forget the aid the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, led  by the custodian of the two holy mosques, has offered Lebanon  during its ordeal, and now the kingdom is leading the  reconstruction and development procession."    Within the framework of Saudi Arabia's efforts to keep pace  with the steps to restore security and stability in Lebanon,  informed sources expect that the Saudi Embassy in Beirut will be  reopened shortly and that Saudia [Saudi Airways] will resume its  flights to Lebanon.  <H5>  To Bosnia </H5>   Within the context of the same principles, the king himself  has issued instructions for the disbursement of 50 million  riyals to provide additional aid for the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Saudi Council of Ministers has expressed  its profound regret and deep pain at the continued Serbian  attacks and unjust actions against the unarmed Bosnian people,  who lack all means of self-defense. The council renewed its  appeal to the Security Council and international circles to  "continue their efforts to put a stop to the Serbian attacks; to  establish a cease-fire immediately; and to enable aid  organizations to treat the wounded and save whatever can be  saved under the poor conditions that are worsening day after  day."    King Fahd instructed the authorities concerned to disburse  50  million riyals to secure more in-kind aid, food, and medical  supplies and to ship them immediately to the victims and the  sons of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people who have been evicted from  their towns and villages, and to also transport a number of  wounded sons of the Bosnia-Herzegovina people for treatment in  Saudi Arabia. King Fahd also urged citizens to continue their  customary humanitarian activities by making financial  contributions to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina through the  Saudi Higher Council for the Collection of Donations for the  People of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is headed by Prince Salman  Ibn 'Abd-al-Aziz, the governor of Riyadh Province.    The council's permanent office in Sarajevo, on agreement  with  a certain company, has secured seven trucks to ship wheat and  flour to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In this connection, Prince Salman appealed to all citizens  and residents and all companies and establishments to extend a  helping hand to our afflicted brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina so  as to console them and bolster their steadfastness in the face  of their enemies and rescue their old men, children, and women  from the murder, displacement, desecration of honor, and mass  annihilation to which they are being subjected.  <H5>  And Somalia </H5>   Persevering in the course of helping Muslim victims of  natural or human catastrophes anywhere, King Fahd explained in  the latest cabinet session the mission of the Saudi force  dispatched to this country [Somalia] to participate with the UN  forces in facilitating the delivery of food supplies and aid to  the besieged and the victims in all parts of Somalia and to  cooperate with the UN forces constantly in whatever serves  Somalia's interest.    King Fahd said, "The reports we are receiving confirm all  the  time that the Saudi soldier is liked and appreciated by  everybody in Somalia."    Under the supervision of Prince Salman, the Higher Council  for the Collection of Donations has distributed 31,200 copies of  the Koran, translated into the Somali language, as a gift from  the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques Complex for Printing the  Venerable Koran to Somali emigrants in Nairobi.    A source at the council said that this gift pleased the  emigrants because of the desirable benefit it yields and because  it helps Muslims morally and preserves their faith in a country  where misguided religious and denominational movements compete  to attract these emigrants and exploit their poverty and need in  order to steer them away from their faith.    The source said that supplying Somali emigrants with the  venerable Koran in their own language makes it easier for them  to understand it; strengthens their adherence to their faith;  and fortifies them against their enemies. Victimized and needy  Somalis are helped, moreover, with various foodstuffs. The  council is eager to make sure that these foodstuffs are of the  highest quality, a fact that has made the emigrants view  materials supplied by the council as foodstuffs that include all  necessary ingredients. The council office provides material aid  to mosque imams and supervisors of Islamic schools. Moreover,  the council office also takes care of orphans at six centers for  a period of six months. The cost of these centers amounted to  1,619,880 Kenyan shillings.    The office distributes food supplies to needy families  according to number of family members. A survey is made of  families in camps, centers, and poor villages so cooperation can  be established between the working team assigned by the council  office in Nairobi and notables in these places, such as quarter  imams, mayors, and teachers. In the past four months this food  aid cost 1,370,541 Kenyan shillings.    The council office in Nairobi also distributed the meat of  livestock sacrifices made on al-Adha Holiday to deserving  people. At the end of the pilgrimage season, the government of  custodian of the two holy mosques shipped this meat to Islamic  countries so it could be distributed to the needy in these  countries according to the directives of the government of  custodian of the two holy mosques, which seeks to help the needy  and afflicted in all parts of the world.  <H5>  Islamic Concept </H5>   A diplomatic source said that the monarch, government, and  people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believe that Muslims in  all countries are like one body and soul or like one structure  in which each part supports the other. To embody this great  Islamic concept, the custodian of the two holy mosques has  instructed the kingdom's official and popular circles to exert  the utmost efforts to aid and provide relief to their brothers  in faith who are confronted by terrible tragic circumstances as  a result of aggression, war, and blind domestic sedition. The  kingdom's monarch, government, and people have risen to help the  brothers in Afghanistan and, previously, the brothers in  Palestine. Lately they have risen to help the brothers in  Somalia and the brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, who are being  subjected to the most heinous forms of oppression and  annihilation by the malicious Serb militias.    The source added that in view of these painful ordeals,  catastrophes, and tragedies, which are afflicting Muslim peoples  with their woes, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has responded to  the call of duty, donating everything valuable and priceless and  following in the footsteps of the custodian of the two holy  mosques, who was the first to contribute his own money. He has  also directed that air corridors be established so as to ship  aid, food, medicines, and tents, plus doctors and medical  equipment, aboard Saudi planes flying from the kingdom to the  afflicted Islamic countries to aid their peoples, ease their  grief, and alleviate their suffering.    Moreover, the kingdom's relief organizations, which are  headed by His Royal Highness Prince Salman Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz,  governor of Riyadh Province, have been actively collecting  donations from the Saudi people, who have been contributing most  willingly and generously out of awareness of their duty toward  their brothers in the faith.    Observers said that these charitable efforts and noble  humanitarian positions emanating from the heart of Islam, which  have been taken by King Fahd Ibn 'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the  two holy mosques, and his government and people, are the best  proof confirming the kingdom's ceaseless eagerness to embody  cooperation, solidarity, and unity among Muslims everywhere.    Observers said that this is nothing new to the Kingdom of  Saudi Arabia, which represents strong support for Islamic  causes. Throughout its history the kingdom has been the  sanctuary and strong support for its sisters, Islamic states,  especially in times of tribulations and ordeals. This is  dictated by the kingdom's Islamic faith and its genuine Arab  character.    The observers added that the kingdom offers material and  moral aid to Islamic states and peoples needing aid and  assistance out of the dictates of its Islamic faith and because  it seeks to please God, may He be praised and exalted, and to  gain His reward. The kingdom does not offer this aid because of  political or propaganda considerations or out of hollow,  glittering, and misleading slogans. This is the kingdom's course  and its constant policy toward its Muslim brothers everywhere.  When all groups of Saudi people rise to contribute, sacrifice,  and aid and help their Muslim brothers, they reaffirm their  adherence to their faith, to the teachings of their religion,  and to their genuine Arab traditions. They follow in this regard  the footsteps of their leader, the custodian of the two holy  mosques, who spares no effort to support Islam and Muslims and  to embrace the Muslims' just causes at every level.</p>

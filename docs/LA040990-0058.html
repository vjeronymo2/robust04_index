			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS  LITIGATION DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE WEEK OF APRIL 26:  </P> <P> Suit Claims Defective Seat Belts in Hyundai Excels: The parents of a woman  killed in a car crash in July filed a wrongful-death suit against the  manufacturer of the Hyundai Excel in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday,  claiming the car's seat belt was inadequate.  </P> <P> James E. and Jeanine L. Mettee said their daughter, Lisa, had her seat belt  fastened when she was hurled from her 1988 Excel in a roll-over accident. The  "two-point seat belt in the car does not . . . restrain the pelvis and prevent  the driver's ejection," the suit said. Hyundai declined comment. (Filed April  3, 1990. Case No. C757210)  </P></p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Labour leftwing purge continues LABOUR'S purge of left-wingers in Merseyside constituencies continued yesterday with the suspension of 27 party members. The party's national executive committee suspended 13 members in Birkenhead, 10 in Liverpool Broadgreen and four in Liverpool Riverside, accusing them of working against the party. It said the suspensions focused on allegations about a campaign of non co-operation against the executive and regional officers. The executive has fought a long battle against alleged Militant Tendency supporters in the Liverpool area. It has expelled more than 100 people on Merseyside in the past two years.</p>

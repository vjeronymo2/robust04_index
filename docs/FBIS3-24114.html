			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Answers to reporters' questions by Minister of the Interior </F> Vano Siradeghyan at press conference in Yerevan on 25 January]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted]    [Question] What is your opinion regarding the dissolution of  the SANS and the appointment of Davit Shahnazaryan [as acting  SANS chief]?    [Siradeghyan] I know one thing with certainty: The  dissolution of that agency can at least help the investigative  bodies. The investigation of the assassination of [former  Armenian KGB chief Marius] Yuzbashyan will now probably move  forward. That agency was supposed to help in the investigation  of that assassination but did nothing--indeed it "put it to  sleep." An investigative team has been created which  incorporates the Ministry of the Interior, the SANS and the  prosecutor's office. One day after Yuzbashyan's burial, his  wife--who was a SANS major--fled to Moscow. She is the last  person who saw Yuzbashyan alive. It is still not known whether  the wife offered any assistance. That investigation was frozen  one day after Yuzbashyan's burial. I am deeply convinced that  that "soyuzni" [allied] KGB (I do not say Armenia's KGB) purged  its own former chief who knew much about the beginnings of the  Karabakh movement and who knew many people. Let me also mention  that Yuzbashyan was killed by a single shot, but several empty  shells were left at the assassination site to give the  impression that there were several shots. They killed Ashot  Sargsyan with a single shot with the same skill, the same  boldness and the same cowardice. Thus the dissolution of the  SANS was essential. As for the appointment of Davit  Shahnazaryan, let me say that for this work it was necessary to  appoint a man in whom the president has full confidence. There  was no other alternative.

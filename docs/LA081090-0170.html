Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CHEMICAL SPRAY SETS YOUTH AFIRE  </P> <P> An emotionally disturbed youth burst into flames when police sprayed him with a  chemical used like Mace to subdue dangerous people, and the police department  today suspended use of the chemical.  </P> <P> The spray, known as Captsun, was determined to be flammable after tests  following the Thursday incident in which a Brooklyn youth suffered first- and  second-degree burns, department spokeswoman Suzanne Trazoff said. When he  didn't react to the spray, police said, a Taser was fired at him, an electric  stunning device, and he burst into flame.  </P></p>

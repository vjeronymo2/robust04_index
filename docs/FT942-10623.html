			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Commons warns of Scottish drug crisis Drug-related crime could be costing Scotland up to Pounds 936m a year, a Commons committee said yesterday. The cross-party committee of MPs said official figures on the drugs problem represented 'the tip of the iceberg' and called for anti-drugs education to start in primary schools. One Glasgow GP told the Commons Scottish affairs committee that nearly half the children at one secondary school class in his area had injected drugs. The MPs' report calls for the painkiller Temgesic to be added to the list of drugs of addiction notifiable to the Home Office. It also calls on the Scottish Office to take a more active role in fighting drug abuse, suggesting a wider use of 'needle exchanges' and crisis intervention centres. But it would be 'foolhardy' to adopt any policy that encouraged the use of cannabis. The report from the committee adds that the Scottish Office estimates that about 20,000 people in Scotland inject illicit or prescribed drugs. The committee based its estimate of the cost of drug-related crime on Glasgow's 8,500 injecting drug users each spending Pounds 300 a week on drugs. Much of the cash came from the sale of stolen goods for about a third of their true value. Projecting this Scotland-wide would imply a total of Pounds 936m.</p>

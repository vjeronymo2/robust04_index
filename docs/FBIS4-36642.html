			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, the vice chairman  of the Presidential Council, accompanied by Mr. Sulayman Nasir  Mas'ud, the member of the Presidential Council, today fulfilled  the Friday prayers in al-Aydrus Mosque in crater. After the  prayers, the vice chairman delivered a speech to the  worshippers. He said:    We had tried before entering the authority to rectify the  matter, and the Arabs and Muslims had also tried their best, but  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refused. We had only to fight that group  in order to defend our homeland. The vice chairman indicated to  the strange decision made by Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Daylami last  Monday [6 June] over Sanaa radio, in which he allowed the  killing of all of us with our women and children -- not only the  rulers. He said that his decision included the weak people, and  we have tape recordings to prove the issue of this decision over  Sanaa radio.    Mr. al-Jifri told the audiences that we have nothing  remaining except to fight on all battlefronts and here in the  capital, Aden, in order to refute the false rumors. He said:  You must know that our sons are fighting on all battlefronts,  and we must know about their fate.</p>

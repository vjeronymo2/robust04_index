			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taipei won't rule out the  possibility of setting up ties or an official channel of  communication with Pyongyang while it tries to develop a  substantive relationship with Seoul, Prime Minister Lien Chan  said Friday. [13 May]    Lien, answering a question put to him by Legislator Parris  Chang of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party during an  interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, said ties with  North Korea would still be considered although the ROC and South  Korea have been trying to rebuild their relationship since they  broke off formal ties in 1992, when Seoul switched recognition  to Beijing.    Meanwhile, in a bid to respond to the market diversification  policy set by the goverment, the China external trade  development council has decided to send a trade delegation to  North Korea to enhance bilateral economic ties, the Ministry of  Economic Affairs said.    Bilateral trade between Taiwan and North Korea totaled just  U.S.$7 million last year, with Pyongyang enjoying a surplus with  Taiwan. Taiwan exports to North Korea are mainly shoe parts and  metal molds, while North Korean imports here are largely  agricultural and textile products, Lin Yi-fu, deputy director of  the Board of Foreign Trade, said.    Currently, Mainland China and Cuba are the only two markets  with which local traders are not allowed to do business since  the government lifted the trade ban with North Korea in 1992,  Lin added.</p>

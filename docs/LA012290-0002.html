			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL GOING PUBLIC WITH DUMP DEBATE;  </P> <P> LANDFILL: THE SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL WILL HOST A FORUM ON THE PROPOSED  ELSMERE CANYON DUMP. FEEDBACK COULD INFLUENCE THE CITY'S STAND AS WELL AS THE  UPCOMING ELECTIONS.  </P> <P> For more than a year the Santa Clarita City Council has remained cautiously  quiet about plans by the city and county of Los Angeles to open a garbage dump  just outside Santa Clarita in Elsmere Canyon.  </P> <P> Santa Clarita cannot officially oppose or endorse the dump, council members  have said, until the city reviews the environmental impact report on the  project.  </P> <P> But in an unusual move, the council will put the issue before citizens  Wednesday night at a public forum, which could influence not only Santa  Clarita's posture toward the dump, but the outcome of City Council elections  three months away.  </P> <P> "I think the dump issue is going to be a big campaign issue," said Marsha  McLean, co-chairman of the anti-dump Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee.  </P> <P> Council members acknowledge that Elsmere Canyon is a volatile issue and that  taking an unpopular stand on the dump could lose them votes in the April 10  election.  </P> <P> "We know we're vulnerable," Councilman Dennis Koontz said.  </P> <P> Koontz is facing reelection along with Councilman Carl Boyer III and Mayor Jo  Anne Darcy, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. So far,  six challengers have filed to run against them.  </P> <P> Darcy said the aim of the forum is to give the council a sense of the  community's feelings on the proposed landfill about two miles northeast of the  interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways.  </P> <P> The city and county of Los Angeles reached tentative agreement on a proposal to  operate a dump in Elsmere Canyon late last year, but an environmental impact  report on the project is not due until this spring. The earliest a dump could  begin operating at Elsmere would be 1995, officials said.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's forum, the public will be asked to respond to two draft  resolutions outlining Santa Clarita's options on the dump. In a sense, the  citizens are being asked whether the council should take an idealistic approach  or a pragmatic one.  </P> <P> One resolution says flatly that Santa Clarita will fight a landfill in Elsmere  Canyon or anywhere else in the city's watershed.  </P> <P> The other says Santa Clarita would endorse a dump only if it is environmentally  sound and if Santa Clarita receives 18 concessions from the city and county of  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Among other things, the resolution demands a share in the dump's profits and  the right to annex about 100 square miles of unincorporated territory  surrounding Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> It demands that the city of Los Angeles, which owns the defunct 583-acre Saugus  Rehabilitation Center inside Santa Clarita, give that property to Santa  Clarita. The resolution also demands that Los Angeles agree to provide Santa  Clarita with fresh water in case the dump fouls Santa Clarita's wells.  </P> <P> The complete list of concessions contained in the resolution will be detailed  at the forum, which will begin at 6:30 p.m. in the Hart High School auditorium.  At the request of the City Council, a local cable television company, King  Video, will videotape the forum for broadcast at a future date.  </P> <P> All five council members privately say they oppose the Elsmere Canyon landfill.  But the city's attorneys have advised the council to delay officially endorsing  or opposing the dump because it could open up the city to litigation.  </P> <P> "City councils have to tread cautiously," Darcy said.  </P> <P> "Now is not the time to declare oneself," Koontz added.  </P> <P> Koontz said the forum might give the council the chance to explain to a  skeptical public why it has remained silent on the Elsmere Canyon dump proposal  for so long. "I think that's what people are getting frustrated about," he  said.  </P> <P> Indeed, members of the Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee have said the  council's silence has done the city more harm than good. By remaining neutral,  "they are stacking the decks against us," McLean said.  </P> <P> Darcy said many citizens mistakenly believe the council has already agreed to  let the dump proceed in exchange for land and money. "I think there have been a  lot of rumors floating around," she said.  </P> <P> City Manager George Caravalho said the forum is just one step toward developing  the city's position on Elsmere Canyon. It could take weeks or months before the  council is ready to adopt either of the resolutions. The council also could  revise the resolutions or continue its current course.  </P> <P> The Elsmere Canyon Preservation Committee has greeted the public forum with  skepticism. Jill Klajic, a committee member and a council candidate, likened  the forum to "putting up a smoke screen."  </P> <P> She noted how the committee collected 1,600 signatures on petitions asking the  council to fight the Elsmere Canyon dump. "They know how the community feels,"  she said.  </P></p>

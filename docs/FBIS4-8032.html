			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime ministers of Poland and the Czech Republic  have met in Czocha Castle in the Jelenia Gora province near the  frontier.    At a news conference following their informal meeting,  Waldemar Pawlak and Vaclav Klaus described their talks as very  concrete. They concerned, above all, economic cooperation, but  not exclusively, because they also talked about European  integration and the Polish minority in the Czech Republic.    It is not true that Polish-Czech relations are not good,  declared Vaclav Klaus, and added that there was no other country  whose politicians he was meeting as often. He recalled his  talks with Waldemar Pawlak at the Visegrad-U.S. summit, with  Aleksandr Kwasniewski in Davos, Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy's  visit to Prague, and announced a meeting with President Lech  Walesa next week.    Prime Ministers Pawlak and Klaus agreed, among other things,  that the Polish debts would also be paid off through ecological  investment projects. We would be most willing to provide coal,  but the Czechs also have problems in this branch of the  industry, and that is why the agreement finally was for ecology  and a border infrastructure.    For Waldemar Pawlak, the most important matters in relations  with the Czechs are agreements concerning the Central European  Free Trade zone and border cooperation.    Vaclav Klaus appealed to Polish journalists not to put a  political slant on the matter of reduced subsidies for Polish  organizations active in the Czech Republic. The prime minister  explained that his government had given up lump-sum subsidies in  favor of supporting specific undertakings. Vaclav Klaus  announced a financial shot in the arm for Polish minority  organizations in the second half of the year.</p>

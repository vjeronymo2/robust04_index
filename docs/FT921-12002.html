			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: S&amp;P cuts UTC debt rating STANDARD &amp; Poors, the US credit agency, yesterday lowered its rating on United Technologies' debt, citing the group's recent Dollars 1.5bn charge for restructuring moves and environmental costs. The agency cut its rating of UTC's senior debt from double-A-minus to single-A-plus. It said the charges reduced the near-term financial flexibility of the aerospace and diversified manufacturing company and highlighted the increasingly competitive nature of its core businesses.</p>

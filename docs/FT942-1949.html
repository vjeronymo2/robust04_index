			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Threat to kill Mexican kidnap victim The kidnappers of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, joint head of Mexico's largest bank, have threatened to kill him unless his family and partners agree to pay a ransom by tomorrow, according to letters sent to Mexican newspapers. Mr Harp Helu, the president of Banamex-Accival and one of Mexico's wealthiest men, was abducted in March. His kidnapping sent Mexico's stock market tumbling, and heightened concerns about political and social instability this year. The latest letter from the kidnappers, if authentic, contradicts recent reports that the family of Mr Harp Helu had already agreed to pay a ransom. The kidnappers wrote that his representatives had refused last Monday to pay the ransom demand, reduced from an initial Dollars 90m (Pounds 59.2m) to a reported Dollars 60m. The kidnappers promised to kill the captive financier unless his son, his lawyer and a representative of the Catholic Church appear on Mexico's main TV news programme and declare their willingness to pay the ransom, and agree not to involve the police.</p>

But local  Palestinian leaders have ordered no celebrations and they have  made it clear that the gesture is not enough to bring the  Palestinians back to the peace talks. On this, Mark Weiss  reports:    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [break in reception]  [Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, broadcast in progress] ...approaching a  reluctant conciliatory attitude. I mean Rabin cannot always  approach issues by trying to carry out cosmetic changes and by  doing too little too late. We are not looking for appearance.  We are looking for serious substance, and therefore I think  that moves or steps that appear to be steps of appeasement  rather than drastic or genuine dealing with serious issues would  not achieve results.    [Weiss] What specifically do you want Israel to do that is  realistic, that could possibly bring the Palestinians back to  the talks?    ['Ashrawi] I think what is very realistic is to accept an  international presence, not by putting limits on what is in the  DOP [Declaration of Principles] and saying international  civilians are unarmed, but rather by making the international  presence of a serious international force that would be able to  play the role of a buffer zone to observe and to monitor, to  prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and to change the  whole atmosphere. I also think that disarming the settlers is  not unrealistic at all. It's a genuine requirement which would  serve both sides, because they are also challenging the rule of  law in Israel. I think beginning the removal of the settlers  from the populated areas, particularly in al-Khalil and Qiryat  Arba', would also show seriousness of intent and a genuine  commitment to deal with these issues.    [Weiss] Other Palestinians noted that today's release is  only bringing forward the release planned for later this month  to mark the end of Ramadan. [end recording]    The view from the Likud is that the release of Palestinian  prisoners encourages and solicits terrorist activity against  Jews. Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav accuses the government  of surrendering and ingratiating itself in front of Yasir  'Arafat. The Moledet party, claiming the release complicated  Israel's security situation, said the government had not learned  from the experience of the prisoner exchange with the Ahmad  Jibril organization.</p>

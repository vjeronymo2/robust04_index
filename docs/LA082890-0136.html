			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SKIPPING THE ALCOHOL TO DRIVE HOME A POINT  </P> <P> No need to skip the suds  </P> <P> What's this? The president of Orange County Mothers Against Drunk Driving  sipping a beer at the organization's 10th anniversary gala Sunday night?  </P> <P> "It's non-alcoholic, of course," Julie Newell explained. "And it tastes pretty  good, too."  </P> <P> Guests at MADD's Main Event, held at MainPlace/Santa Ana mall, sampled three  brands of alcohol-free beer, several varieties of Ariel Vineyards'  non-alcoholic wines, mineral water and soft drinks as well as gourmet food  offerings from a dozen area restaurants.  </P> <P> "I just heard that Ariel is one of the fastest-growing vineyards in the state,"  said chapter executive director Janet Cater, whose own beverage preferences  lean toward raspberry-flavored mineral water.  </P> <P> As several MADD members pointed out, Ariel's success and the fact that  companies such as Heineken, Miller and Anheuser-Busch now offer non-alcoholic  alternatives is in its own way a testament to the organization's success in  changing attitudes toward drinking and driving.  </P> <P> "It's just not socially acceptable anymore," Newell said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Just for fun  </P> <P> The event may have been a sober one, but it wasn't nearly as sobering as most  other MADD get-togethers. "This is the first time we've ever put something  together just for fun," said Sherry Metcalfe, former Orange County MADD  president, who chaired the event. Except for a table of brochures and bumper  stickers off in a corner, MADD kept its message off the menu for this one  evening. "I think there are a lot of people out there who support us but don't  need to hear the message. They're already on our side." About 200 guests paid  $35 each to show their support.  </P> <P> To ensure fun for all, Metcalfe made sure there was entertainment for every  imaginable taste. While a ragtime band held court outside Nordstrom, an Elvis  impersonator gyrated down by Robinson's. In between, jugglers, magicians,  caricature artists, clowns and other entertainers worked their way through the  crowd.  </P> <P> As did State Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) and Assemblyman Curt Pringle  (R-Garden Grove), both staunch MADD supporters. "I'm carrying a bill right now  for Orange County MADD," Royce said. That bill would make it impossible for a  drunk driver to sue a victim or a victim's estate, as happened in one Orange  County case." If the bill passes, it will join the dozens of others in  California and thousands nationwide that have made it onto the books thanks to  MADD.  </P> <P> "MADD shifted the balance of power in the Legislature," Royce said. "For years,  the prevailing attitude was one of solidarity with the defense bar. But that  isn't the case anymore. Now when MADD backs a bill, you know there's going to  be a lot of noise made about it."  </P> <P> Orange County MADD members, the legislators said, are particularly vocal.  </P> <P> "They write lots of letters," Pringle said, "And when you get a letter from an  individual, it really has an impact."  </P> <P> "They're also willing to come to Sacramento and testify, again and again,"  Royce said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Did you bring the handcuffs, dear?  </P> <P> Also on hand were gravel-throated soap star Jeanne Cooper (Katherine Chancellor  Sterling) of "The Young and the Restless" and fellow cast members Michael  Gregary (Clint), Quinn Redecker (Rex Sterling) and Kate Linder (Esther the  housekeeper).  </P> <P> "Here's Michael, who kidnaped me, and Quinn, who betrayed me, and Kate, my  maid," Cooper said. "So I kidnaped them and brought them here for this.  </P> <P> "I am very much behind Orange County MADD. I became aware of their work when I  did a public appearance here, and I was very impressed. They're a very strong  voice in the state. They've banged their heads against the wall for so long,  and it's really made a difference."  </P> <P> A silent auction of items donated by mall merchants and others brought the net  proceeds of the event to more than $3,000, Cater said.  </P></p>

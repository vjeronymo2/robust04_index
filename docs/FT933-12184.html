			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Management: Perceptions of leadership - New findings that examine the way the sexes rate male and female managers Women prefer a female boss; men would rather work for men. Female managers are not seen by their male subordinates as acting in an authoritative manner. Both male and female managers are considerably less effective in the way they manage than they would like to imagine. Evidence that all these provocative-sounding assertions may be true comes from research carried out over the past few months in Britain's National Health Service but with implications for managers of both sexes and in all sectors. The unpublished study is believed to be one of the first of its kind. Trent Regional Health Authority covers one of the largest geographical health regions in the UK - South Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire - and a population of 4.5m. There are 75,000 staff in the region, 85 per cent of whom are female. In common with the rest of the NHS, Trent is staffed mainly by women but run by men: just 11 per cent of general managers and chief executives in the region are female. As part of the employer-led equality drive Opportunity 2000, the health service overall has a government target of increasing its proportion of female general managers from 18 per cent in 1991 to 30 per cent by 1994. To meet these tough targets (some would say they are unrealistic, given the recession and low staff turnover) specialised training for potential women managers is being examined throughout the NHS. Trent asked Hay Management Consultants in January this year to investigate what women's training needs in the region might be, first establishing whether there are any differences in the way men and women operate as managers. This hotly debated area is normally characterised by generalisation and anecdote - scientific research on men and women as bosses is thin on the ground. What Hay did was to question male and female managers about how they thought they operated and then, revealingly, to ask those managers' subordinates what they thought of the way their bosses managed. At the same time, the 'organisational climate' - perceptions about the quality of the working environment - was charted and linked to the findings on management style. Climate takes into account the strength of working relationships, pride in the organisation, how far individuals feel they are given real responsibility and rewarded for performance, and the extent to which challenging but clear and realistic goals are set. Previous research has shown there exists a strong link between a positive climate and good individual performance. A total of 15 male and 20 female middle managers completed questionnaires about how they saw their own styles, while 191 staff, male and female, answered questions about their bosses. About the same number of staff filled in the organisational climate survey. All managers thought they were high on authoritative, affiliative, democratic and coaching styles - a view not matched by their subordinates, who perceived them as being more coercive and pace-setting than the managers imagined themselves to be. The styles which produced the highest-quality climates were authoritative, democratic and coaching; pace-setting and coercive styles produced the worst. As Hay concludes in its report to Trent 'in practice, managers are using the least effective styles more than they think'. Another finding was that reporting to a manager of the same sex appeared to produce a more positive climate for both male and female subordinates. There were only marginal differences in the way male and female managers saw themselves. However, the picture was entirely different when it came to the way subordinates of different sexes rated male and female bosses. Most strikingly, men did not rate their female managers as acting in an authoritative manner, although women did see their female bosses as using this management style. What the men saw was their women managers using the pace-setting style. To compound matters, pace-setting had a more negative effect on organisational climate when used by women than when men employed it. As Hay points out, this difference may be accounted for by differing male and female perceptions of women managers, or it may be that the women were treating male and female subordinates differently. Whatever the reason, concludes the research, 'the styles that female managers use are not working as effectively with their male subordinates. The men do not see female managers doing such things as giving clear directions, explaining decisions and monitoring task performance. The authoritative style is an effective and important one. If women are not seen as using it by men this may not only affect their team's effectiveness but could influence their visibility with colleagues and bosses'. Specialised management training for women, using the Hay findings, may now be developed by Trent. The research has also revealed the scope that there is for managers of both sexes to increase their repertoire of management styles and, for men in particular, to learn from their female colleagues more about how to be effective in coaching their subordinates.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONG TARGET IN THORP VS. BEAM?  </P> <P> The lack of responsibility that the alcoholic Candance Thorp demonstrated both  before and after the birth of her Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-afflicted son was  disturbingly sad. By her own admission she sometimes drank herself unconscious  during her pregnancy. It is apparent that a warning label on the drinker's  whiskey bottle would not stop such irresponsible and reckless behavior.  </P> <P> DAVE and JOANN MOINE, Rolling Hills  </P></p>

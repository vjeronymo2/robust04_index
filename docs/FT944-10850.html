			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Subsidy urged for 'green' power Many types of renewable energy are too expensive to qualify for subsidies, the industry regulator has warned. Professor Stephen Littlechild said the government should choose the cheapest forms of 'green' power for its forthcoming round of subsidies rather than try to promote particular technologies. This would mean dropping hydro schemes and projects which burn agricultural and forestry waste, or energy crops such as coppicing. He also warned that combined heat and power schemes would add extra costs. Instead, emphasis should be given to wind, landfill gas and waste combust-ion. Prof Littlechild's advice comes as ministers are finalising a new round of subsidies for 'green' energy projects. They intend to choose about 300MW-400MW of schemes which will be allowed to charge premium prices for their electricity. Ministers have said they will put bidding projects into various technology 'bands' and select those that look most promising. Prof Littlechild challenges this approach because it would lead to expensive projects qualifying. Instead, he says, ministers should select the 70 cheapest projects out of the 520 submitted. This would ensure that prices would be 30 per cent below the last subsidy round in 1991, although even these would be 50 per cent above long-run free-market prices and will require a subsidy of Pounds 400m over 15 to 20 years. Prof Littlechild's report provoked a sharp response from the renewables industry, which is trying to promote a wide range of technologies. The Department of Trade and Industry, which is vetting the bids, said that it had taken note of Prof Littlechild's report. Ministers hope to announce the new subsidies next month.</p>

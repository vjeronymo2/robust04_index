			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MONTANA CLOSE TO SIGNING NFL'S BIGGEST CONTRACT: $13 MILLION  </P> <P> Joe Montana indicated he may be close to agreeing to the highest contract in  the NFL, a deal that reportedly would bring the San Francisco 49ers quarterback  $13 million over four years.  </P> <P> Montana's contract was one of several that dominated the opening of the 49ers'  training camp Wednesday at Sierra College here.  </P> <P> He was typically nonchalant about his contract as he emerged from the first  team meal at camp.  </P> <P> "It's not finalized," he said of the proposed deal, believed to pay him $4  million this season and decrease by $500,000 each of the next three years.  </P> <P> If the figures are correct, Montana's new contract, averaging $3.25 million  annually, would surpass the paychecks of the two quarterbacks who now top the  league. Jim Kelly of Buffalo and Randall Cunningham of Philadelphia average  slightly more than $3 million a year.  </P> <P> Montana, who turned 34 in June, signed a contract extension in 1988 that would  have earned him $2.5 million this season. But after he led the 49ers to their  fourth Super Bowl victory in January, owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. hinted that he  would redo Montana's contract.  </P> <P> Montana said he would like to have the contract formalized before the season  starts.  </P></p>

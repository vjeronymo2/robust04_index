			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- Yasushi Akashi, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special envoy for the  former Yugoslavia, arrived in Belgrade this morning for a  meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan  Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, immediately upon  his arrival, we have learned unofficially. The meeting of the  three in Belgrade is attracting a great deal of attention,  particularly because of the Gorazde drama and the latest NATO  threats to the Serbs in Bosnia. Only a few days ago Akashi told  Butrus-Ghali that he would not talk to Slobodan Milosevic and  Radovan Karadzic unless, as he said, the attacks on Gorazde were  to cease and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] members were to be  released.    Akashi also made his meeting in Belgrade conditional upon a  total cease-fire in and around Gorazde. At the moment the only  thing that is certain is the fact that the Serb Republic has  declared a unilateral cease-fire, so the question now arises as  to whether this move was sufficient for Akashi to change his  mind.

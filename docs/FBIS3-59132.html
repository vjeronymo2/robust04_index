"Today is a historic day because a grand project is taking  shape," Segni claimed at a press conference. All potential  candidates from various parties are welcome to run under a Pact  ticket in coming elections, he said, as long as they accept the  party's programs, which will be "along alternative lines to  those of the left-wing caucus, and will indicate Mario Segni as  candidate for prime minister."    The Pact, Segni went on, is a "great alliance between  secularists and Catholics, a liberal-democratic and reformist  alliance that is a credible alternative to the caucus of the  left," referring to potential alliances between the Left  Democrat, Green, Network, Republican, Socialist and Communist  Refoundation parties.    He said candidates will be chosen by local committees among  those who obtain at least 300 signatures in their favor.    Segni claimed that the Christian Democrat Party, which will  not use its name or symbol in first-past-the-post majority  elections, will also join the Pact for Italy at the next  elections. Some Christian Democrat members of parliament, along  with some Liberal and Republican Party officials, flanked Segni  at his press conference.    Segni said the party's program will be announced on January  15, and the first national assembly will take place February 5.    Among his various political comments, Segni reiterated his  request that Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi make it clear  once and for all that "he is not a candidate of the left."    Segni again urged media mogul Silvio Berlusconi, who has  announced plans to create his own conservative party, not to  enter politics, because "his candidates would split up the  liberal-democratic front."    Christian Democrat Party Secretary Mino Martinazzoli reacted  to Segni's claim that many Christian Democrats would join the  Pact by saying that the so-called neo-centrists, who make up one  of the minority wings, "seem to have taken their leave" of the  party.    Martinazzoli said: "When they behave like a party, with a  program, an executive and their own strategy, holding talks with  other political bodies, I acknowledge all this."</p>

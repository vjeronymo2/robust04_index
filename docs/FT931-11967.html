			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Output cut rouses zinc market THE LONDON Metal Exchange zinc market was roused from its torpor on Thursday when Pasminco, the Australian natural resources group, announced plans for substantial production cuts. It said market conditions were forcing it to restructure its loss-making lead and zinc operations at Broken Hill - immediately closing the inefficient northern operations, which had been scheduled for closure in 1995, and raising production at the southern operations. Analysts calculated that the net result would be falls of 25,000 tonnes a year in zinc output and 32,600 tonnes a year in lead output. The announcement brought an immediate Dollars 52-a-tonne rise in the LME's three months zinc price and three months lead gained Pounds 6.25 a tonne on the day. Zinc's rise continued in early trading yesterday, when it gained another Dollars 10.50 to an eight-week high of Dollars 1,137 a tonne. But profit-taking then emerged and by the close the price had been trimmed to Dollars 1,118 a tonne, up Dollars 41.75 on the week. The lead price eased back 75p yesterday to Pounds 294.75 a tonne, up Pounds 6 on the week. But the rise illusory - in terms of the US currency, against which sterling was very weak, the price was down about Dollars 6.50. Some analysts were surprised at the violence of the two markets' initial responses to the Pasminco cuts, which they said looked pretty modest when set against stock levels of 1m tonnes for zinc and 640,000 tonnes for lead. Mr William Adams of London trader Rudolf Wolff doubted that the higher price levels would be maintained 'unless there are more cuts'. Mr Nick Moore of Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, pointed out, however, that the Pasminco move had increased this year's prospective zinc supply deficit from 50,000 to 75,000 tonnes and wiped out the expected lead surplus 'at one stroke'. Furthermore he expected other producers who were finding present price levels hard to live with to follow Pasminco's lead. Copper prices also appeared firm, with the LME's cash position gaining Pounds 46 to Pounds 1,497.50 on the week. But the rise was entirely attributable to sterling's weakness. A sharpish dip on Monday was reversed the following day as Chinese buying reappeared and dealers covered against a threatened strike at Enami of Chile's Ventanas smelter. The Enami fears were softened later in the week, however, when El Teniente, also of Chile, said it would be able to process concentrates from Enami if the strike took place. Oil prices staged a substantial rally this week: first on signs that determination was growing among members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to take positive action at the February 13 ministerial meeting to shore up their depressed market; and then on news that a US senator was proposing the imposition of a Dollars 25-a-barrel price floor on the US's oil imports. The London International Petroleum Exchange's April crude oil contract was quoted at Dollars 18.50 a barrel in late trading yesterday, down 19 cents from Thursday's close but Dollars 1.04 up from the end of last week. Talks held this week by Mr Alirio Parra of Venezuela, the Opec president, with Middle Eastern oil ministers are reported to have revealed a much more constructive attitude on the need for effective control of production than was evident previously. In particular the market was encouraged by indications from the Kuwaiti minister, Mr Ali al-Baghli, that his country would be prepared to cut output as part of a concerted effort to reduce the cartel's daily production by about 1m barrels to 24m barrels. The market's reaction to the proposal by Democratic Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana for the imposition of a variable fee on US oil imports at under Dollars 25 a barrel was, at first sight, paradoxical. Although they did not believe the legislation would ever reach the statute books they regarded its proposal as distinctly bullish. 'When the biggest consumer and importer of oil says it wants to push the price up to Dollars 25 a barrel the natural reaction of the exporters may be to say 'let's do it for them',' explained Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the robusta coffee market began with a continuation of last week's sharp price fall, but then staged a quite spirited rally. The initial fall took the March futures position, which last week fell Dollars 71 to Dollars 904 a tonne down to Dollars 801 a tonne at one stage. Dealers blamed pessimism about the International Coffee Agreement talks being held in London and chart-based selling in New York. While the price was still falling, however, dealers were warning that the market had become heavily oversold . 'This market is not trading on fundamentals, but is being moved by the weight of money wielded by the (investment) funds,' commented Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with London Futures broker GNI. The bounce, when it came was equally technical and almost equally sharp. An Dollars 18 rise yesterday took the March position to Dollars 895 a tonne, down just Dollars 9 on the week. Cocoa prices also came under pressure from selling by investment funds in New York, but the sterling-denominated London market was cushioned by the pound's slide. The May futures price closed yesterday at Pounds 716 a tonne, down Pounds 23 on the week, but had it not been for the currency factor the fall would have been nearly Pounds 50.  ------------------------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------------ Aluminium  +6,300   to   1,623,200 Copper     -4,975   to     311,325 Lead       +2,500   to     235,025 Nickel       +732   to      78,804 Zinc       +5,175   to     519,500 Tin          +400   to      16,075  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

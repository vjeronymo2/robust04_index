			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP CALLS FOR BAN ON NEW HOTELS AT BEACH  </P> <P> A group of Santa Monica slow-growth activists is seeking support for an  initiative that would ban the construction of hotels, motels and large  restaurants along Santa Monica Beach.  </P> <P> Representatives of the newly-formed "Save Our Beach Committee" said they hope  to gather 10,000 signatures backing the initiative, enough to place it on the  ballot for a special election this year.  </P> <P> Sharon Gilpin, a film maker and veteran of past slow-growth initiative  campaigns, said she and a handful of activists began the drive because of a  "flood" of hotel and motel construction in her beach neighborhood in the last  two years.  </P> <P> "The views from Palisades Park, the open beaches, these are valuable  resources," Gilpin said. "We need to protect these resources for all  generations."  </P> <P> The proposed initiative would be an amendment to Santa Monica's Comprehensive  Land Use and Zoning Ordinance and would create a "Beach Overlay Zone" from the  center of Ocean Avenue east to Santa Monica Beach. Construction of hotels,  motels and big restaurants would be prohibited in the zone, which would extend  from Santa Monica's northern border along Ocean Avenue and along Nielson Way to  the city's southern border. Santa Monica Pier would be exempted from the zone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Failure Predicted  </P> <P> Those close to the development community predicted the initiative would fail or  would be challenged on legal grounds.  </P> <P> "It's inconsistent with the California Coastal Law, which encourages hotel and  visitor services in beach areas," said Christopher Harding, an attorney for the  Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce. "I don't think there's a significant  chance it would pass."  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Christine E. Reed said the initiative, if passed, would  hamper city efforts to revitalize the beach. "(The initiative) would have an  adverse impact on the economy of the beachfront," she said.  </P> <P> "It would certainly stop the development approved by the council for the Sand  and Sea Club site," she said. Last year, the City Council approved a 148-room  hotel and community center for the site, which is owned by the city but leased  by the private club.  </P> <P> Gilpin said the initiative's supporters include Douglas Badt, manager of the  Sand and Sea Club. Badt could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The committee submitted the proposed initiative to the city clerk's office  Thursday. City Clerk Clarice Johnsen said the signatures of 15% of the  approximately 56,000 registered voters in Santa Monica -- about 8,400  signatures -- would be needed to call a special election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hotel Construction  </P> <P> At least two hotels are under construction along the beachfront -- the  196-room, six-story Park Hyatt Santa Monica Beach Hotel at the end of Pico  Boulevard, and the 349-room, four-story Lowes Santa Monica Beach at 1700 Ocean  Ave.  </P> <P> City planner Wanda Williams said she has received numerous complaints from  residents near the sites of the two hotels.  </P> <P> "They've expressed a lot of concern about the hotels going up around them,"  Williams said. "They are concerned that sunlight will be blocked and that  traffic and noise will increase."  </P> <P> Last year, Gilpin supported another petition drive, a comprehensive slow-growth  measure that would have placed restrictions on commercial construction. The  initiative was denied a place on the ballot when a Los Angeles County Superior  Court judge ruled that the petitions were invalid, in part because they did not  include the names of the sponsors.  </P> <P> According to the city clerk's office, the last petition drive to succeed in  placing an initiative on the ballot was in June, 1986. Proposition M, an  amendment to the city's rent control law, was defeated.  </P> <P> The last successful initiative placed on the ballot by petitions passed in  June, 1984, when Proposition Y changed the date of general municipal elections  from April to November.  </P> <P> The city attorney will complete a review the initiative within 15 days, Johnsen  said. The activists will then have 180 days to gather signatures, she said.  </P></p>

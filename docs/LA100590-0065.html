			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURY COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GIFTS TO MIDDLE EAST MUST BE SENT SOON  </P> <P> Family and friends planning to send holiday packages to those in the Middle  East will have to start gift-wrapping well before Halloween this year.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service routinely requires October and November deadlines for  international holiday mail but with extra troops in Saudi Arabia it moved  deadlines up one week to ensure prompt delivery, said Felice Cook, director of  marketing and communication for the Postal Service.  </P> <P> Heavy packages sent to the Middle East by ship, the least expensive route of  travel, must be sent this week. Airmail deadlines range from Nov. 3 to Nov. 26,  depending on the type of package. Deadlines for other international packages  are available in area post offices.  </P> <P> The Middle East crisis should have no effect on domestic holiday mail, Cook  said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "enn": "DIW Does Not Expect Fast Upswing"] </F>   [Text] Berlin, 6 Jan -- The German Institute for Economic  Research (DIW) has made a forecast for 1994 that is clearly more  pessimistic than those of all the other German institutes. The  Berlin-based research institute does not expect a quick economic  upswing. On Thursday [6 January], the DIW said that a gradual  upward trend can be expected to start in summer, at the  earliest. The recession has not yet been overcome. German  economic policy is characterized by illusions and wrong  assessments in this area, the DIW said. In western Germany, the  GNP is expected to decline by an estimated 0.5 percent this  year. The number of unemployed in eastern and western Germany  will go up to a total of some 4 million. In the DIW  researchers' view, the debate about Germany as a business  location overrates the alleged crisis of costs faced by German  companies. No study has yet been able to prove that German  industry has a severe lack of international competitiveness.  The decline in profits is a "phenomenon exclusively due to  economic cycles." Some impetus from abroad is possible; but  export hopes can refer only to overseas markets. Besides, the  European countries can only overcome the recession "marching in  step." The role monetary policy plays in the development of  recession is underestimated. Relaxing monetary policy is the  key to an increase in investments. In the DIW's opinion,  short-term and long-term interest rates should be approximately  2 percentage points apart.    According to the DIW, the economic policy debate  concentrates  too much on wage policy. "Cutting wages" alone is a defensive  strategy that is unlikely to succeed. This year, the institute  expects moderate wage settlements "in the region of 2 percent."  In 1996, wage increases could return to some 4 percent, a rate  that will be appropriate in the medium term. Private  consumption will go down by some 1.5 percent in 1994, which will  have an enormous effect on the economy. The government's  envisaged austerity measures will also have a restrictive impact  on the economy. Considering this, 1994 is an unsuitable time  for consolidating public budgets, the DIW said.</p>

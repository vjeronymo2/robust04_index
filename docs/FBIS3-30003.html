Zhu, who  arrived in Tokyo Wednesday for a nine-day visit to Japan, made  the request during morning talks with BOJ Governor Yasushi Mieno  at a Tokyo hotel.    The chief economic planner of China as head of the central  bank briefed Mieno on Beijing's efforts to shift to a "socialist  market economy," the officials said.    The officials did not reveal the details of the Mieno-Zhu  talks, but Zhu is believed to have clarified his bank's policy  of keeping a tight grip on credit, at least for the time being,  to calm an overheating Chinese economy.    Mieno reportedly told Zhu the Japanese central bank will  continue to support China's attempt to shift to a market-driven  economy.</p>

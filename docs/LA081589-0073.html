			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> An experimental program to bring arts to troubled teen-agers in San Francisco  has been praised as a success, but there is a problem: money. The California  Arts Council renewed a $11,000 grant for the project, in which three artists  work part-time with youths in the city's juvenile jail and with the privately  run Charila Home for abused girls. However, there is no city money to help  finance the program. Sponsors are now looking for private funds to match the  state grant.  </P></p>

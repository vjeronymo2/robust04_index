			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: Cheaper calls on the horizon - Worth Watching Although competition between telephone companies has slashed the prices for digital telephone lines, many business exchanges, or PABXs, are unable to connect to the services. Gandalf, the Canadian communications company, has developed a device to enable companies with 15 phone lines or more to reduce their bills by switching to ISDN (integrated services digital network). The Access ISDN links analogue and non-ISDN digital PABXs - which account for 90 per cent of all private exchanges in the UK - to ISDN networks. The device, developed for the UK's Post Office, also makes it easy to switch between different phone companies to take advantage of the cheapest rates. Gandalf: UK, 0344 860272.</p>

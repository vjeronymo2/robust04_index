			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 5 CHALLENGERS' FINAL SHOTS AT KORENSTEIN HAVE FAMILIAR THEME  </P> <P> Challengers, who after weeks of campaigning have finally polished their pitch  to voters, Thursday seized their last opportunity to criticize Los Angeles  school board member Julie Korenstein face-to-face before the election Tuesday.  </P> <P> The five challengers, who are seeking to replace Korenstein as the West San  Fernando Valley representative on the seven-member Los Angeles Board of  Education, continued to voice criticism of district policies such as bilingual  education, voluntary busing and a counseling program for gay and lesbian  students.  </P> <P> And Korenstein, who is seeking a full four-year term after 20 months in office,  continued to defend those programs. Although she told the 30 people who  attended the candidates forum at the Germain Street Elementary School in  Chatsworth that she is "starting to shake things up" at the district,  Korenstein acknowledged that when she sought the office in 1987, she made  criticisms similar to those her challengers now voice, attacking the status  quo.  </P> <P> "It's getting wearing," Korenstein said of campaigning as an incumbent.  </P> <P> But the often harsh words and criticism are a sharp contrast to the joking and  small talk that the candidates share among themselves before the forums and  during breaks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speaking Skills Honed  </P> <P> After speaking at panels together over the past weeks, the candidates have  honed their messages to fit the three minutes given for introductory remarks.  Once nervous and inexperienced speakers, the challengers now, for example, have  come to recognize that criticism of Project 10, the gay counseling program,  will almost always win applause from West Valley voters, and they pause with  precise timing for the expected reaction.  </P> <P> Candidates Barbara Romey and Gerald Horowitz are appealing to conservative  voters and say they are hopeful that they will force Korenstein into a run-off.  </P> <P> Romey, a former accountant, lost to Korenstein in a 1987 run-off election to  fill the two years remaining in former school board member David Armor's term.  </P> <P> Horowitz, formerly principal of Frost Junior High School in Granada Hills, has  rallied parents there who were angry over his transfer last summer to a school  in Sun Valley.  </P> <P> Korenstein has outspent all of her challengers and will likely raise more than  $100,000 before election day. Much of her support comes from teachers and the  United Teachers-Los Angeles, the teachers union.  </P> <P> UTLA sponsored an open house at James Monroe High School in Sepulveda Thursday  night, an event where parents were invited to meet their children's teachers  and were then asked to vote for Korenstein.  </P> <P> "We definitely want to win over the parents," Monroe math teacher Jenni Marple  said.  </P> <P> Also running for the West Valley seat are Cliff Stadig, Dauna Packer and  Michael Kaliczak.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Azerbaijani peace plea fails to halt conflict FRESH fighting broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani combatants struggling for control of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday despite a plea for peace from Azerbaijan's interim president, Reuter reports from Moscow. Armenia said Azerbaijani forces were still massed around the town of Askeran and engaging in running skirmishes with the town's Armenian population 24 hours after some of the worst fighting in the four-year conflict in the region. The Karabakh Committee in the Armenian capital Yerevan said Armenian defenders had destroyed one Azerbaijani tank. The committee also reported fighting near Hathrouth in the south of Nagorno-Karabakh and said Azerbaijani forces had rained shells on several towns inside and outside the enclave after an early lull in the fighting. Azerbaijan reported overnight shelling of Agdam, one of its chief towns just outside Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr Vahan Shirkhanyan, head of the Karabakh Committee, put the Armenian death toll in the battle in Askeran at 200. He said 26 Armenians, many of them women, had been killed when Azerbaijani forces overran the village of Kazanchi. The battle for Nagorno-Karabakh, administered by Azerbaijan for nearly seven decades but populated mostly by Armenians, has intensified in recent weeks, despite a welter of peace initiatives. Azerbaijan's interim President Yagub Mamedov yesterday called for new efforts to bring both sides to negotiations. 'We have to step up diplomatic efforts and get negotiations going quickly,' he said. But the 51-year-old former university rector, who succeeded President Ayaz Mutalibov two days ago, may face domestic pressure to take a hawkish stance on the conflict. Mr Mutalibov was forced out of office last week by demonstrators who said he had been soft on Armenia and had staked too much on a negotiated settlement. Up to 2,000 people have died in four years of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, making it the bloodiest conflict in scores of ethnic feuds that helped to tear the Soviet Union apart. The struggle also threatens to undermine the newly-formed Commonwealth of Independent States. Turkey yesterday issued a new call for peace in the region, with Mr Hikmet Cetin, foreign minister, asking the US to use its influence for a solution. Mr Cetin has been touring several former Soviet republics, including Azerbaijan. Turkey has urged Azerbaijan to adopt a tougher stance in the conflict, drawing charges from Armenian politicians that it is meddling in the dispute to win the support of Moslem former Soviet republics. Former Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze, back in his native Georgia to pursue a political career, appealed to the west yesterday for aid for the Transcaucasian republic. After 36 hours of talks with government leaders, he said: 'I'll be straightforward: without aid from our friends - real democrats in all states of the world - we will find it difficult to solve all our problems.' Mr Shevardnadze, who steered the foreign policy of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, says he will probably run for a seat in the Georgian parliament once new elections are held. He has also not ruled out standing for the presidency. Mountain to climb, Page 14</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: Nana Vasconcelos - Queen Elizabeth Hall The Brazilian percussionist describes his music as 'organic' and most of the instruments on the platform certainly seem to be derived from animal or vegetable matter. There are multifarious objets - shells, shakers, earthenware pots and various sticks to beat them with. Playing to a full house on Monday Vasconcelos shuffled on, grinning broadly, scratching at the berimbau. Hemmed in by this curious paraphernalia he looks like a very happy market trader. The berimbau, a long bow with a gourd for a soundbox, is his main instrument and he makes the most of its component parts and its abrasive whispering quality. But, following the growling and chanting of 'Let's all go to the jungle', where the percussionist seems to have raided the BBC sound-effects cupboard, Vasconcelos' berimbau was upstaged (visually at least) by the arrival of Tunde Jegede and his koras. The 19-year-old Londoner's chosen instrument is a gourd topped by a four foot mast onto which two grab handles are attached. It is plucked, placed phallically on the knees, with the thumbs and forefingers. In Jegede's hands, rhythm and melody played simultaneously in 'The cycle of reckoning', it sounds deliciously like harpsichord and classical guitar in one. The second half, Vasconcelos flouncing on with talking drum tucked under one arm, brought the inevitable - the dreaded audience participation. Divided into 'this half' and 'that half' for a trip down the Amazon we were directed to imitate the river and the rain. In my experience an audience divides into those that quiver at the thought of 'joining in' and those who relish direct involvement with a zeal which overwhelms their ability. It was with some relief therefore when the squeaking from the wings turned out to be Vasconcelos' old sparring partner, saxophonist Andy Sheppard, bringing us back to the more familiar sound of the tenor and a bout of circular breathing on soprano. Relaxing as this casual coming and going was, we really needed more percussion from the north-east of Brazil and the master himself. Eventually Vasconcelos did take to his shakers, earthenware pot and cowbells with more conviction: but too briefly and we were soon entreated to join in again.</p>

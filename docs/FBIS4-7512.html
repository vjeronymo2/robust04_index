			<p>BFN     [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has received a  U.S. delegation, which included Madeleine Albright, U.S.  ambassador to the United Nations and member of the U.S.  Government; Charles Redman, special envoy of the U.S. President;  General John Shalikashvili, commander of the U.S. Joint Chiefs  of Staff; and Peter Galbraith, U.S. ambassador to the Republic  of Croatia.    They discussed the political and military situation in the  region, as well as the U.S. role in further efforts aimed at the  settlement of the crisis. Mrs. Albright thanked President  Tudjman for his special contribution toward the settlement of  the crisis in former Yugoslavia, praising at the same time the  overall policy of the Republic of Croatia regarding peace  efforts toward the settlement of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Special emphasis was laid on U.S. support for Croatia's  territorial integrity and sovereignty and for the cease-fire  agreement signed with local Serbs. The U.S. delegation  reiterated U.S. readiness to help in the process of the peaceful  reintegration of the occupied territories.    President Tudjman expressed gratitude to the United States  for its crucial role in all positive steps and asked for support  in connection with the acceptance of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection  Forces] new mandate, i.e. that the United States should accept  Croatia's demand regarding the total control of Croatia's  borders, the opening of roads, and the return of refugees as  soon as possible.    The two sides expressed satisfaction about the application  of  the Washington agreement on the ground and hoped that the  constituent assembly in Sarajevo would accept the new  constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    They also discussed all future steps in the negotiating  process and said that regular contacts would continue between  representatives of the United States and the Republic of Croatia  at all levels.    After the talks, President Tudjman gave a luncheon that was  also attended by Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic.    On the Croatian side, the talks were attended by Mate  Granic,  deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Jure Radic, head of  President Tudjman's office, Defense Minister Gojko Susak,  Tudjman's National Security Advisor Hrvoje Sarinic, Gen. Janko  Bobetko, chief of the general staff corps, and Maj. Gen.  Zvonimir Cervenko, head of Tudjman's military department.    Foreign Minister Granic also held talks with the U.S.  delegation. He told the U.S. ambassador that the Croatian  Assembly also accepted the Washington agreement.</p>

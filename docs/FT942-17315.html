			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Rutskoi vows to topple Yeltsin Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former Russian vice-president and recently released coup plotter, said yesterday he would fight to remove President Boris Yeltsin by legal means. His voice joins a growing opposition to Mr Yeltsin's efforts to achieve consensus. In an interview in the pro-Communist Pravda, Mr Rutskoi said: 'We must stop playing with consensus or agreements and get down to work - to change the authorities by legal means.' Mr Rutskoi is positioning himself to run for president in the next elections. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Liberal Democrat leader who is also a declared candidate for the presidency, has said he sees Mr Rutskoi as his greatest challenge. Mr Yeltsin has been trying to get an agreement with the parliament on a 'Memorandum on Civil Accord'. But Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist party, last week dismissed the accord, saying he could not accept its moratorium on changes to the constitution.</p>

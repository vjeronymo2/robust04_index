			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Fast track extension backed The US House of Representatives voted yesterday to extend the Clinton administration's fast track authority to complete negotiations on a global free trade agreement, AP reports from Washington. The fast track authority - which would give the president until April 16 1994 to enter into trade agreements worked out under the Uruguay Round - allows the administration to negotiate a deal without subsequent congressional amendments. The Senate must now vote on the issue.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Spain set to approve tough budget SPAIN'S minority socialist government is today set to approve a tough 1994 budget, having been unable to secure full agreement on important wages talks with the unions or on regional tax concessions with opposition parties whose support it needs in order to be able to pass it. The uncertainty surrounding many of the suppositions in the budget - on pensions, civil service pay, unemployment benefits and tax revenue distribution - means that the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, could continue horse trading with the unions and Catalan and Basque parties until the end of the year, by which time the budget, legally, has to be in place. Ministers and senior officials insist that the government, which has been punished for its past fiscal indiscipline by three peseta devaluations in the last year, intends firmly to stand by its pledge to halt the rapid growth in its central deficit. Madrid had hoped, in negotiations started with the unions earlier this month, to have agreed - and included in the budget - consensus on a new formula for calculating pensions, on cuts in unemployment benefits, and on a wages freeze for the civil serve next year. But these talks - regarded by many as a success simply because no party has yet walked away from them - have not been able to reach firm conclusions and the cabinet is set to impose a civil service wage freeze and a public pension increase next year of 3.5 per cent, which the unions argue is too low. These sums will then form part of the budget. The figures are not, say officials, necessarily set in stone. The government has said that if the unions agree to a moderate pay over the next three years, it then might be prepared to consider revising its targets on pensions and civil service pay as the budget is debated through parliament for the next three months. This loose arrangement, where deadlines are flexible and final positions are negotiable, suits the government. It desperately wants to appear to be tough fiscally while also engineering a global incomes deal with the unions. Madrid has its eye on the international financial market which, it fears, may again attack the peseta if it is perceived to be losing control of the economy. Talks between the government, unions and employers on a global wages deal - which the government wants to last for three years - will start in October. At about the same time the government hopes to have finalised its controversial proposals for granting the country's autonomous regions the power to spend 15 per cent of the income tax collected in those regions. This is a political concession demanded by the Catalans in return for helping Mr Gonzalez pass the budget. A scheme, hastily cobbled together since the June 6 general election, has however run into opposition from both the economically strong Catalans and poorer states such as Extremadura and Andalucia. The Catalans say the government is refusing to spell out, exactly, how it plans to make the transfers and that it does not trust Madrid's willingness to actually transfer money. Poorer states say they are likely to progressively lose to the richer regions because of the way the transfer is being designed. Despite the threat implicit in this opposition, officials believe that Catalan support for the budget is assured by the end of the year, despite complaints from the region's government. 'We are close enough to agreement to be able to work out the details in the next few weeks,' said one.</p>

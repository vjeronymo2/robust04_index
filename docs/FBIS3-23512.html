			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Voynov under the rubric "Military Reform and </F> Higher Educational Institutions": "A Union of Science and  Practice"]    [Text] A prestigious delegation arrived one sunny day at  the Kachinsk Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots [KVVAUL]  in Volgograd. It included two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and  Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR Lieutenant-General of Aviation  (Retired) G. Beregovoy, RAO [Russian Academy of Sciences]  Academician and Major-General of the Medical Service (Retired)  V. Ponomarenko, Honored Test Pilot of the USSR V. Tsuvarev,  writer A. Markusha, and staff members of the Institute of  Aviation and Space Medicine (IAKM) candidates of medical  sciences Colonel A. Vorona and Lieutenant-Colonel S. Aleshin.    That same day the guests visited the museum of the storied  school, made entries in the Book of Honored Visitors, visited  the library, where they left gifts appropriate to its purpose,  and then met at a roundtable with cadets, flight personnel and  the instructors and command of the KVVAUL. Far from all of those  wishing to be invited to the discussion were so invited--only  cadets and officers taking part in the scientific-research work  (NIR) under the name of Banan, which has been underway at Kacha  under the aegis of the IAKM since September of 1990. The theme  of the work is "Elaboration of Methods for the Development and  Evaluation of the Intellectual Capabilities of VVAUL Cadets."    Without going into detail, we will clarify that the  discussion concerned a fundamentally new approach, based on  contemporary scientific ideas and experimental data, toward the  selection and training of future military pilots, an approach  oriented toward the contemporary and future level of development  of combat aircraft. Ideas of the intellect as the ability of the  person to adapt to various situations, learn and successfully  resolve tasks in various types of activity are at the basis of  the Banan NIR.    The authors of the NIR distinguish practical and theoretical  types of intellect, singling out three factors in the structure  of the intellect of a practical type: logical-symbolic,  reflecting an ability for the analytical processing of  information; spatial, reflecting an ability for the synthesic  processing of information; and, working memory, typifying the  properties of the brain as a biological processor. Intellectual  abilities (IS) are assumed to develop in the following  directions: the formation of a high intellectual level by means  of intellectual training; the incorporation into professional  training of the principles of evolving training; and, the  effective application of technical means of training (TSO).    The experiment has been underway at the KVVAUL since 1990.  One of four groups of cadets--average according to initial  data--is being trained using the IAKM techniques oriented toward  the development of the memory, logical thinking and the ability  to perceive information quickly. Video and audio technology were  used in purposeful fashion with this group for the development  of professionally important IS for the first time.    An IAKM--KVVAUL practical-science association was created in  the course of the experiment. It includes instructors from the  departments, specialists from the psycho-physiological  laboratory, a professional-selection group and officers from the  flight-instruction department (LMO). A special department for  the fundamentals of flight training organized at the school  acted as coordinator of the experiment.    The reporting on the stages of the Banan NIR shows positive  results. They became the foundation for all cadets, starting  with the incoming class of 1991, to be shifted to training  according to the techniques recommended by IAKM. The discussion  at the roundtable was about what this has given the cadets in  the experimental group, how they feel and what they have  achieved, a group that has now been transformed into a leading  one in composition, tasks and results of training. We offer you  a record of the discussion.    Candidate of Medical Sciences Lieutenant-Colonel of the  Medical Service S. Aleshin, senior executor of the Banan  NIR:    --The increase in the intellectual capabilities of the  cadets  in the experimental group (EG) surpassed the analogous values  for their classmates by twenty-nine percent for the spatial  factor and by more than nine percent for the logical-symbolic.  The EG achieved better values of progress in studies, and had  better characteristics of the distribution of attention, spatial  orientation, and nervous-emotional stability in flight. The  dual-instruction program was completed at higher quality. There  were six times fewer cadets dismissed from flight work owing to  poor progress in the EG than in the control group. The results  obtained, as well as the data from prior research, made it  possible to recommend the adoption of the techniques for  evaluation and purposeful intellectual development into the  training practices of the Kachinsk VVAUL.    Colonel G. Cherkovskiy, chief of the flight-instruction  department of the school:    --The technique of flight training has remained virtually  unchanged since the beginning of the century. The hardware and  tactics, however, moved far ahead long ago. The IAKM  technique--the methods of evolving training and the formation of  a mental image of the flight using TSO before the start of  practical flight work--is having a palpable effect. The EG  cadets are demonstrating a clearly pronounced desire to fly.    The successful incorporation of the new system is being  slowed by the lack of TSO. We would have been able to accomplish  little without the help of IAKM. The new is being perceived  equivocably by the flight personnel--"I will teach the way they  taught me..." There are enemies of the innovations at the  school. We know about that, and are dealing with it. We plan to  conduct the centralized retraining of instructors this year.    Lieutenant-Colonel V. Timofeyev, squadron  commander:    --Two conditions are important for success in training--a  healthy cadet collective oriented toward flights, and  instructors who can and are ready to teach. We felt the results  of the work that was carried out under the Banan program in the  training section. This was manifested first and foremost in a  clearly pronounced motivation of the cadets for flight training,  and in an increased mutual understanding between them and the  instructors. The lack of contemporary TSO, meanwhile, had a  negative impact on the results of the work. All we have in the  regiment is a slide projector--yesterday's equipment. Modern TSO  is vitally necessary. They took the last MiG-21 from us here as  late as 1990. The flight training has been conducted since that  time exclusively on L-39 aircraft. A "psychology of the subsonic  aircraft" is being formed here regardless of our efforts. After  the L-39, far from everyone can master the MiG-29--the  difference is colossal. The training detachment, making use of  all available TSO, should provide as much information as  possible about the aircraft our graduates will be flying.    Major-General of Aviation V. Nabokov, chief of the  school:    --Let us take a look at who is studying at Kacha today.  About  sixty percent of those in the first and second years are the  children of servicemen. There are virtually no representatives  of the peasantry or the intelligentsia. Both we and the  scientists have something to think about there. When we were  analyzing the results of the work in 1992, it became clear that  the cadets were sometimes better trained than the flight  personnel in a theoretical regard. Those who go into the  training regiments this year will be stronger than the  instructors in theory. But our cadets understand that only the  instructor pilot "teaches the sky." Cases of conceit and  conflicts on these grounds are not known to me.    The regiments lag the training detachment for objective  reasons. The techniques being employed do not reach the flight  personnel, and are being incorporated with difficulty. This is  largely explained by the uncertainty of the status and prospects  of the instructors, and the reduction in motivation for  conscientious flight work.    Modern TSO is essential--both video and audio systems, along  with personal computers at levels down to the squadron inclusive.    Last year was unusually difficult in a morale, and not only  a  logistical, regard. Having received the appropriate authority, I  told the cadets frankly from the rostrum that they have no  prospects here, let whoever wants to go out and find himself  another place in life. Today I can state with all certainty that  whoever wanted to leave has done so, and we will work with those  who have remained.    Cadet A. Ustinov:    --Has the new technique helped us in the experimental group?  The impressions are ambiguous. It is difficult to judge for  oneself the use of a method of strong points or static slide  films. The video films were undoubtedly of use for landing, the  practice zone, pattern work. But the videos that were shot at  the school are not distinguished by their high quality. They do  not reflect the specific "nuances" that the cadet needs. The  impression is created overall that there is some benefit from  the technique. But I cannot speak for everyone. We are all  different, after all...    Colonel V. Kryuchkin, chief of the flight safety  service of the school:    --There is no need to draw far-reaching conclusions--it is  too soon. Yes, there are some results: the EG looks better off  than the others. But perhaps that is the result of an unstable  dual-instruction program? Half of the cadets who were dismissed  for lack of progress in the other squadrons, by the way, could  have stayed. The question of dismissal was resolved personally  at the highest level for each cadet in the experimental  squadron. Who else could boast of such attention? No one. I  would have let go just one of the three who were dismissed from  the experimental group, by the way. The Banan program must be  continued and improved. The image of the flight on the basis of  a homemade video film gave cadet Ustinov from ten to fifteen  percent harmful skills. And he could not have avoided them until  he was looked after. Then he understood everything.    Colonel A. Shirokov, deputy chief of the school for  personnel work:    --It really is too soon to draw conclusions. We urged people  to be discharged, we repeated the lack of prospects. But today  we are talking about a particular type of intellect  characteristic only of the pilot, about a tendency toward flight  work. And the fact that there is still anybody to hear it is the  main result. Our cadets have not broken, have not despaired of  their choice. They want to fly and learn. That, in my opinion,  is the chief result of the NIR.    A few observations. The work, having in mind the NIR, is  undoubtedly useful and necessary. But it seems to me that it is  oversaturated with an unjustified academism, it is  overscientific. Success is assured with more popular  accessibility and understandability. Provided, of course, a  system of appropriate selection and training of instructors is  instituted.    Lieutenant-General of Aviation (Retired) G. Beregovoy,  two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and Pilot-Cosmonaut of the  USSR:    --They want to make Nesterovs, pilots of great prospects,  out  of you with the aid of the IAKM techniques, through the  development of the intellect, through the personality of each.  When we evaluate an aircraft today, we have the average pilot in  mind. You will not be average if you make conscientious use of  the opportunity you have been granted.    I am sometimes asked, How did you survive the war? I will  try  to explain. First of all, I always noticed the enemy faster than  the escort fighters, and I targeted them myself, trying to force  my will onto the enemy and anticipate the development of events.  I tried to learn from the mistakes of others, and never blindly  trusted instructions--real life is so varied that you can't  always envisage everything. It is very important to feel the  aircraft, to understand what is happening and what will happen  if you do this or that. You have to think and predict the  situation.    When I was shot down once, I had to land my aircraft in a  forest. The instructions recommended using it as an underlying  surface. I knew that a pilot had recently died in an Il-2 by  making a forced landing in the woods according to the  instructions. I did not want to repeat his fate, and I decided  not to "shave" the crowns but to slash to the roots. It did not  work out too badly. The wings and tail disappeared. But I was  left alive!    A. Markusha, writer:    --An example for my generation was Valeriy Chkalov. It can  be  seen distinctly today, however, that some writers and  commentators of the times, most likely out of opportunistic  considerations, have created an image of a diminished intellect.  Yes, Chkalov had no education. And so what? Chkalov was not  simply an outstanding pilot, but also a highly gifted and  intellectually refined individual. I have had occasion to read  his letters. Chkalov had neat and legible handwriting, and he  wrote without errors!    There is no profession in the world that would give one such  a feeling of freedom as the flight profession. And if you have  decided to refute slavery with all of your life, you are in the  right place. I see the sense of life in seeing that it is not  wretched.    V. Tsuvarev, honored test pilot of the USSR:    --It becomes clear in a detailed analysis that not one  normal  test pilot does or could conform to the optimal professional  requirements and handle his duties anyway. In what way, through  what is he able to do this? The fact is that a person who is  very imperfect from the standpoint of the requirements of  professional selection adapts and compensates for his  uncorrected shortcomings, developing and improving his merits.  The test pilot Anokhin, for example, as is well known, flew with  one eye. What you are given is thus directed toward the  development of those qualities that will later allow you to  become true pilots.    Major-General of the Medical Service (Retired) V.  Ponomarenko, Academician of the RAO and scientific supervisor of  the Banan NIR:    --You have met with some prominent people today. Understand  that you are future military pilots. And the pilots are the  flower of the nation, the bearers of the traditions of good,  decency and culture. Pilots are a special world, a special  atmosphere. A feeling of personal dignity, not self-importance,  can exist only in a professional. So move toward it through  professionalism, through intellectual development.    The personality of the pilot starts with self-evaluation:  where do I stand, what can I do and what can I not? You have to  be honest to the utmost, answering these questions for your own  self.    It is very important to raise the level of training of  instructors today. An instructor who has never in his life flown  a modern combat aircraft cannot give a cadet true purpose, and  does not know what a MiG-29 or an Su-27 is. A higher school for  instructors is needed. An instructional center could be created  at the school as a start, and then a school could be opened. We  will not be able to move forward if we do not solve this  problem. And do not grow conceited as you are working, let  people surround you who meet good with good...    * * *    The next day all who wished were invited to a meeting with  the guests at the school's club. The meeting was warm, the  climate was relaxed. And you had to see the agitation, the  embarrassment with which the young lads in their cadet's  epaulets brought up their record books with the addresses of  their relatives and the telephone numbers of girls, so as to  leave in their memory the confident stroke of the pen of  two-time Hero of the Soviet Union and three-time pilot  Beregovoy... There were many revelations that day that give me  grounds to assume that Kacha will remember this visit for a long  time. And if that is so, then it may be asserted that its aim  was achieved.    Before the war, as is well known, Kacha was located in the  Crimea near Sevastopol. There was also a branch there of the  predecessor of the IAKM--the IAM [Institute of Aviation  Medicine] imeni I.P. Pavlov. The school and the branch worked  closely together to their mutual benefit. Then fate separated  the scholars and the practitioners. The IAM has since been  disbanded, resurrected and had "space" added to its name. And  now they are together again--the storied school and the unique  scientific-research institute of the Air Forces. Their  collaboration, directed toward the future, is having results  even today. That is indisputable. A delegation from the French  Air Force that visited Kacha at the end of March admired the  intellectual level of the IAKM projects that had been  incorporated into the training program. The French frankly  admitted that they did not yet have anything of the sort.    There is no need, by the way, to hold absolute the opinion  of  the representatives of the French Air Force. We have our own as  well, after all--the IAKM and the KVVAUL are pursuing a  necessary, useful and undoubtedly promising cause hand in hand.    COPYRIGHT: "Aviatsiya i kosmonavtika", 1993.</p>

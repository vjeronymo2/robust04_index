			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / People: Hewlett joins Lonrho board John Hewlett, chief executive of Lonrho's Mozambique agricultural, mining, hotel and motor distribution interests, and an associate director of the international trading group since January 1991, has been promoted to the main board. A graduate of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, 45-year-old Hewlett joined Lonrho in 1979. He worked as general manager of the Kalangwa Estates which, according to Lonrho, is its 'showpiece' farm in Zambia. At a time when the east Germans and Romanians no longer regarded Mozambique as a viable business proposition, Hewlett, who until then had spent his working life in Zambia, attracted attention by moving there and establishing four estates to grow cotton and food stuffs. Part of the job entailed recruiting a security force some 1,500 men strong. Hewlett has also presumably had several recent visits from Lonrho chief executive Tiny Rowland, who has played a part in negotiating the peace agreement in Mozambique.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a recently concluded national conference of  provincial and regional justice departments directors, justice  bureaus chiefs, reform-through-labor bureau chiefs, and  reeducation- through-labor bureau chiefs, the state ministry of  justice and some central leaders highly praised Hunan's justice  work.    A total of 10 advanced reeducation-through-labor  institutions  across the country, two of which are in Hunan, were commended at  the national conference. Hunan now ranks third among the  country's advanced reeducation-through-labor institutions.    At a national conference convened eight years ago, Hunan was  criticized for its poor reeducation-through-labor work. Since  then, the province's reeducation-through-labor bureau party  committee has summed up lessons, readjusted leading bodies, and  improved management with the result that the province's  reeducation-through-labor work has made significant headway:  The province's reeducation-through-labor bureau has formed a  highly trained special police unit, the first of its kind in the  entire country, has summed up experiences, has mapped out a  "three grades, six levels" reeducation method, and has built a  reeducation campus, a reeducation barracks, and a reeducation  garden. At a result, the province's prisoner escape rate has  dropped from 31.7 percent eight years ago to 0.25 percent at the  moment.    Thanks to a series of successful internal reforms, such as  the labor system reform, personnel system reform, and  distribution system reform, the province's  reeducation-through-labor institutions have made unremitting  efforts to improve product quality and raise economic  efficiency. Over the past few years, they have developed a  total of 56 new products, 10 of which have been awarded  scientific and technological progress prizes by the state,  ministries, or provincial departments. In 1993, Hunan's  reeducation-through-labor institutions realized a total output  value of $120 million yuan and a total profit of 12 million  yuan, up by 70 million yuan and 8 million yuan respectively over  1988.</p>

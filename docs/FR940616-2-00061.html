			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7) One commenter stated that the USEPA must actively solicit all interested parties for information on which to develop a section 303(d) list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations governing the solicitation of public comment may be found at 40 CFR part 25. The USEPA believes that the publication of the proposed list in the December 8, 1993, FR notice fulfilled those requirements, and served as adequate solicitation of comment of all interested parties. In response to that publication the USEPA received four comment letters, one by a State agency and three by public interest groups. These comments have been thoroughly considered in the development of the final list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) One commenter stated that the proposed list does not meet the requirements of section 303(d) because it does not contain specific, calculated TMDLs for each waterbody listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 303(d)(1)(A) requires the development of a list of waterbodies for which technology-based effluent limits are not stringent enough to achieve water quality standards. Section 303(d)(1)(C) requires the development of TMDLs for the waters listed pursuant to section 303(d)(1)(A). The USEPA has interpreted the Act to require the development of the section 303(d) list prior to actually establishing TMDLs. The USEPA believes that to delay listing until the TMDLs are all completed would either lead to deceptively short lists of waterbodies, or would delay the process indefinitely. Because TMDL development can be a complex activity, involving many years of effort particularly in cases where specific stream conditions must be analyzed, or model development and calibration must be achieved, only a few TMDLs can be developed at any particular time. Even so, it is also recognized that remedial actions can take place before a TMDL is developed, therefore the Agency believes that the listing process should go forward as the initial step in order to encourage action even though actual TMDL development may take place later. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that development of individual TMDLs must follow list development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) One commenter stated that the proposed list does not contain any schedule for TMDL development for the next two years, and that the criteria by which the USEPA prioritized waters on the proposed list should focus on the protection human health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December 8, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice announced as being available for public review and comment a proposed section 303(d) list for Minnesota consisting of 447 water quality-limited segments. The notice further provided that the priority for TMDL development reflects that contained in the September 16, 1993, section 303(d) list submitted by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. In that submittal, the TMDLs identified for development through April 1994 were the Minnesota River and the Redwood River. These waterbodies continue to be listed as high priority for TMDL development. Because the prioritization of TMDLs as well as the resources and personnel to develop them are largely under the control of the State, the USEPA believes it is appropriate to defer to this State prioritization. It should be noted that these priorities are subject to annual review by the USEPA and the State in the annual program planning process under 40 CFR part 130 and as a result of the biennial updates of the 305(b) lists required under 40 CFR part 131 and section 305(b) of the CWA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) One commenter stated that the Mississippi River from the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area downstream to the Iowa border should be listed as high priority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USEPA agrees that this waterbody is an important resource. In compliance with requirements of an National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit issued to the Metropolitan Waste Control Commission (MWCC), studies of phosphorus, the identified pollutant of concern, are being conducted by both the MWCC and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on the waterbody to define better the sources of the impairments and to ascertain needed remedial actions. Current information suggests that much of the loading of phosphorus is originating in the Minnesota River basin, which is high priority for TMDL development. It is anticipated that remedial actions in the Minnesota River basin will have significant positive impact on magnitude of impairments in the Mississippi River. It is anticipated that upon the completion of the studies and implementation of additional controls required through the NPDES permit and the results of the TMDL being developed for the Minnesota River, downstream impacts on the Mississippi River will be reduced such that this portion of the River does not meet the requirements for listing under section 303(d). Therefore, this waterbody continues to be listed as low priority on the section 303(d) list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) One commenter questioned why only two waterbodies were listed on the section 303(d) list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the December 8, 1993, FR notice, USEPA proposed a list of 447 waterbody segments. This was in addition to the two waterbodies which the State of Minnesota has identified as appropriate for TMDL development. While the USEPA agrees with the State of Minnesota, that those two waterbodies warrant listing pursuant to 303(d), the USEPA also believes, that additional waterbodies should be listed, and for that reason has proceeded with today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) One commenter recommended that the following waterbodies be listed on the section 303(d) list as high priority for TMDL development.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

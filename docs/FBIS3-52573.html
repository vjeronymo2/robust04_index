O great people, O stalwart men in our valiant Armed Forces, O  glorious Arabs, O honest men and those have faith in justice and  right wherever you may be: Greetings. On this blessed day, the  6th of January, the anniversary of the birth and founding of  Iraq's Army in modern times, important meaning and values  glimmer here, and in the life of the nation and mankind every  year. The first nucleus of Iraq's modern Army; the Musa  al-Kazim Regiment was founded on 6 January 1921. On that date,  the old colonialist powers, with Britain at their forefront,  which used to control major parts of the world, exploited  hundreds of millions of the sons of mankind, plundered their  resources, and resorted to force and repression against those  who called for freedom and justice.    A scientific comparison of the potentials of the poor and  weak people of the world, including the people of Iraq, against  the armies, fleets, aircraft, and other huge material potential  of Britain and the other colonialist countries was not in favor  of our people and others like us. Such a comparison may instill  despair and result in capitulation to the will of the oppressive  and colonialist tyrants. However, in spite of the difficult  circumstances and the meager technical and material potential in  general, the people of Iraq rebelled against these oppressive  tyrants. Our people did all that they could do under those  circumstances and affected the plans and the stands of the  leaders of evil, achieving certain results on the road to  freedom and independence, including the establishment of the  nucleus of a national army, which is this great Army whose  anniversary we celebrate today after 73 years. This Army stands  loftily, crowned with pride, capability, and honesty. This is  because the people's will is second to God's will; stronger than  all circumstances and state of affairs. All that leads to a  better life, therefore, stems from this will.    In those days, the stalwart Iraqis imposed their will on  the colonialists by founding their national Army. Afterward,  the sly colonialists and their stooges tried to make this Army a  tool in their hands against the people and their national  objectives of freedom and independence and against pan-Arab  objectives and genuine faith, honesty, and loyalty.    However, the then budding Army, which now has great  experience, is the righteous son of Iraq and the descendant of  Iraq's great armies known by this land for more than 5,000  years. This Army has disappointed their malicious hopes and  remained the way the unyielding people of Iraq wanted it -- an  Army for Iraq and the nation. As time went by, the Army became  a bulwark for nationalism and pan-Arabism and a school for the  brave men who advocate Arabism and champion Islam.    This was the history of the Army in the 1930's; in the 1941  revolution; the revolution of 14 July 1958; the Ramadan  revolution in 1963; and also under the leadership of the party  of the people and the nation, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, in  the 17-30 July 1978 revolution.    This is the role played by our valiant Army in defending  Iraq  and Arabism against the racist anti-Arab expansion that came  from the east for eight fierce years in successive epics of the  glorious al-Qadisiyah. Finally, manifest victory was scored on  the day of days, 8 August 1988.    This is its role, which is unprecedented in the history of  mankind, in the immortal Mother of Battles, when it withstood  the aggression of 28 armies and more than 30 states, including  three super powers. There were other supporters who were among  the people of a superpower that was a friend of the Arabs and  Iraq until part of its leaders conspired against the great  people of Iraq.    O brothers, O brave fighters, the elite of the nation's men  and the slogan of its glory:    The deluded colonialists have tried for more than 70 years  to  strike at this Army and to turn it into a tool in their hands  against the people, homeland, and the nation. Following the  criminal aggression -- in which they used all manner of weapons  of killing and destruction in their arsenals, including the  banned weapons -- after launching large-scale propaganda  campaigns full of lies and falsehood and on which they spent  large amounts of money from the treasuries of the renegades who  stole the wealth of the Arab nation; after the unjust blockade  through which they aimed at starving the people; and after  imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south, those  colonialists imagined that they could achieve today what they  failed to achieve in the past. The lowly ones were  disappointed. The Army of the nation, the brave and great Army  of Iraq, which was a national and pan-Arab bastion throughout  its glorious history, remained, even after the aggression,  Iraq's lofty Arab bastion to defend dignity, sovereignty,  independence, and the homeland. It also remained a school of  sacrifices, giving, and creativity in the times of peace and  construction as well as on the fields of combat.    O brothers, armies and nations, which exist on the same  surface, live their values and follow basic criteria in terms of  seriousness and nonseriousness toward principles and stands.  And when a nation or an army retreats from its course and  remains under the effect of this setback, not trying to stand  up, the other party will follow suit. Whenever a nation rises  up and holds on, the Army will also rise up and hold on.  Anyhow, in this era of the history of nations, armies and  nations exist on the same surface, see each other, and interact  with each other. They live with a common conscience and  historical sense. If any of them represent both at the  beginning of a historical era in a situation like this, then,  everybody will follow the party that represents all even if  certain factors have placed one of them in the position of the  initiator and the other in the position of a follower because it  is burdened by responsibilities that prevent it from taking the  lead position.    This is exactly how the relationship has been between our  people and Army throughout history. If the people or the Army  take a step forward on the road to historical achievement, and  both are part of the nation's conscience, this step encourages  the adoption of another one and both interact and form a great  historical era. This relationship has been clearly embodied in  the details and picture of what happened whether in Al-Qadisiyah  battle, which our comrades have named Saddam's al-Qadisiyah, or  in the Mother of Battles with all its arenas and chapters.    The people during al-Qadisiyah and the Mother of Battles  have  been the backbone of the Army, the secret of the great sense of  national and pan-Arab affiliation, and the source of the  conscience of history and the aspirations from which the Army  gains its readiness for sacrifice and optimism for the future.  The Army, with its ideological, psychological, and professional  training has always been the people's support when ill winds sap  the determination of some, or when the march does not equip them  to complete the march.    We experienced circumstances in al-Qadisiyah during which  the  people took the initiative to give another chance to the Army to  enable it to portray the image it wishes to portray. When the  major fighting began in the glorious Mother of Battles, when the  fighting intensified and pressures were brought to bear from all  sides, and after the first chapter of the 30-state attack, when  the action of the evildoers and the treacherous took place  within the framework of the Iranian conspiracy that complemented  the comprehensive aggression and when the chapters of the  conspiracy, treachery, and treason intensified, some were shaken  and feet slipped from the right course. The Army, and we mean  the knights of the Armed Forces, those who have a principled  historical stand and enjoy excellent values, have been those who  entrenched the banners on lofty hills so that every eye would  see the banner of God is great and so that this banner would  announce to the four corners of the earth that right is here,  that honor is here, that the present is here and the future  passes through here, that capability and impregnability are  here. May evil befall all the weak, and accursed be the  treacherous, those who assist the foreigner. Nationalism and  pan-Arabism are here. Woe to the foreigner when he crosses the  borders and commits crimes. The sublime meanings are here. Long  live Iraq and our glorious Arab nation. God is great. Long  live Iraq. God is great. Long Live Palestine, free and Arab.  Long live Palestine.    Brothers, by what we have said, we meant to tell our dear,  valiant, and militant Army and our great, glorious people that  sincere, principled, and historically perceptive leaders may  commit mistakes as regards what should be done. Only God is  infallible. Some may recall part of the mistakes in isolation  from the circumstances of the comprehensive situation. They may  think that it would be right to feel angry or imagine that it  would be legitimate to react angrily. However, as long as  leaders do not commit historic mistakes that will be regretted  by the people or the Army, or the people and the Army together,  God forbid, the traits and meaning of historic leadership will  continue to be associated with them. If remorse affects the  Army and the people in general--any people and army--then this  means that a mark of disgrace has been recorded against them in  that particular era. Thus, they will lose an historic  opportunity to have a record of great honor. Despite all the  injustice and humiliation that affected the great Iraqi people  and valiant Armed Forces by the opponent's technical force and  the broad enemy front, your leadership has not pushed you to  remorse and disgrace. Most often, it has saved some from their  own selves, having pulled falsehood from under their feet and  supported their backs with right.    Brothers, these lessons are not only meant as a source of  pride, but they lead to important conclusions in our daily  struggle and steadfastness in the face of tyranny and the  embargo imposed on our people and country.    The steadfastness of the Iraqi Army and the fact that it has  maintained its defensive capabilities and bright national and  pan-Arab traits is a prominent, shining aspect of the  steadfastness of Iraq, in all its sectors and among its zealous  sons, in the face of aggression, tyranny, malicious plots, false  propaganda, and the embargo imposed by the forces of evil and  darkness since 6 August 1990.    The Army of the people has maintained its steadfastness; the  people of Iraq have also remained steadfast, in the face of all  plots and wagers at a stage when U.S. tyranny is dominating the  world in alliance with world Zionism. During this stage, many  armies were humiliated. Also, many peoples and countries, some  of them big, were disgraced. However, the enemies, before the  friends, have acknowledged publicly and secretly that their  wagers on Iraq, its Army, people, and leadership have failed  utterly. May God disgrace them, make their sides bleed, and  throw them in hell.    Zealous brothers and glorious sisters: Among the prominent  facts about the outcome of the Mother of Battles and its  continuation until this day in various forms and methods, we  feel confident that steadfastness, adherence to the principles  and values of freedom, justice and right, as expressed by the  Mother of Battles in their highest meanings, and pursuing  reconstruction and creativity, represent the right course.  There is no other course to remove injustice, tyranny, the  unjust embargo, and any weakness that besets the followers of  God.    These lessons have so far, with God's help and blessings,  facilitated Iraq's steadfastness and the capabilities to pursue  reconstruction. They also ensure the necessary requirements for  safeguarding our dear homeland, making it free, lofty, and  capable of awakening and continued reconstruction and progress.    Brothers, honorable people of the world: We have always  been inspired by our noble religion and the traditions of our  Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and blessings be upon him. We  have also been inspired by the noble principles of the Ba'th  [Party]. We have always been advocates of peace and  brotherliness, believing in right, justice, and equality and  struggling for our rights and principles without encroaching on  the rights of others. We in Iraq and as free Arabs in the Arab  nation want to have in this world a respectable position, which  we deserve due to what the Iraqis and Arabs have contributed to  human civilization and to upholding the principles of right and  justice throughout history. Today, the tyrants and the  oppressors who are hold sway over the world's destiny cannot--no  matter what they do--prevent the great people of Iraq from  occupying the sublime status for which they are struggling, nor  can they prevent the world nations from realizing their freedom,  progress, and right to choose their way of life through their  free, dignified will.    Glorious Iraqi men and women: A few days before the third  anniversary of the 30-state aggression, we are confident that  the wicked objectives the sought by the wicked ones before,  during, and after the aggression are collapsing one after the  other. The remaining chapters of aggression will also collapse  the way many of them collapsed in the past, God willing. They  will collapse with the determination of the zealous Iraqis and  the support of the free people and faithful ones in the world.  Regarding this issue, I would like to say that some rulers in  the region--rulers who betrayed the trust, lost honor, plotted  against Iraq, and took part in the sinister schemes against it  and in aggression against its people--are still trying with all  their means to maintain the embargo imposed on the Iraqi people.  They are spending what has remained of the funds to this end.  They are also supporting the illegal interests of those laying  traps and the polytheists at the expense of the wealth of their  peoples and the poor sons of the nation. They are paying bribes  here and there to stop the growing trend that is calling for the  lifting of the unjust embargo imposed on the Iraqi people. May  God disgrace and uncover them.    Those who lost their honor, independence, and money to fund  the intrigues against Iraq will lose more of what has remained  with them of the money of the poor. They will waste the wealth  of their peoples and nation. However, they will not be able to  harm Iraq's steadfastness and ability to forge its way ahead  over the debris of the wall of the blockade and injustice,  protected by the banner of God is great, which has been  maintained by the most gracious, most compassionate. Those who  are wallowing in treason and are blinded by evil imagine that  lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq is a wicked political game  or a dirty diplomacy that can be obstructed by illegal payments  and bribes. They do not know that the basic reason that will  lead to the ending of the blockade is the steadfastness of Iraq  and the Iraqis, their adherence to faith in their principles and  their rights, their clinging to honor and virtue, and their  loyalty to their noble nationalist, pan-Arab, and human  objectives. These bases, which cannot be shaken or changed by  funds, evil intrigues, or the meanness of the wicked ones, are  the Iraqis' ammunition in facing the embargo and their path  toward ending it and any ordeal.    Dear Iraqis, brave men of our national valiant Armed Forces,  the Army of July 1958, Ramadan 1963, July 1968, al-Qadisiyah,  and Mother of Battles: In this new year, like the previous  years, we are looking forward to more work, training, vigilance,  efficiency, and more creativeness and innovation of methods,  through which we will defeat the enemy of both God and you.  Through such methods, we will defeat the unjust blockade, hold  fast in the face of the arrogant ones and henchmen, and prove to  the enemies that their blockade is useless, that their intrigues  will be defeated, and that the values and rights of our nation  and people are well protected and that God is their protector  and defender.    Greetings of love and pride. Peace be upon our victorious  Army, the descendent of the great armies of Iraq and the holder  of the banner of Arabism and the message of good, justice, and  right. Peace be upon the Army of Iraq, the Army of the Arab  nation. Peace be upon the martyrs. Peace be upon the martyrs.  Peace be upon Palestine. Peace be upon every Arab who has  rejected and rejects wrongdoing. Peace be upon everyone of you  and your families. May God preserve you and protect you. God  is great. Accursed be the lowly.</p>

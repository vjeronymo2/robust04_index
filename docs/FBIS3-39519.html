			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Writing in the 29 January Lisbon weekly  SEMANARIO, Jaime Nogueira Pinto accuses unidentified Portuguese  government officials of ignoring the fact that Jonas Savimbi's  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) can  resist "indefinitely" the Angolan Government's attacks, and also  of believing that the South African elections can significantly  modify the situation in Angola. Such an attitude, Nogueira Pinto  contends, "cannot stand up to serious and objective analysis."  In fact, the responsibility for continued warfare must be  attributed to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola  (MPLA) and the so-called military bourgeoisie, the hardline  nucleus of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  (FAPLA), which is earning huge commissions on military  purchases, Nogueira Pinto maintains. In fact, this is the  faction that rejects a negotiated peace with UNITA--since it  would mean a loss of power--even as it is loath to lose the  "respectability" laboriously won in the Washington talks. Hence,  the continous "provocations" against Savimbi in spite of U.S.  warnings to Luanda about renewed military escalation. Lisbon's  interests in Angola will obviously be served by the  reestablishment of a just and fair peace, to be achieved only  through compromise and power sharing, Nogueira Pinto concludes.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (24): UK body steps into the breach - The Single Market Compliance Unit is resolving a large number of complaints while others may not yet have come to light - Illegal trade barriers / The SMCU BRITISH exporters who feel their European sales are being hampered by illegal trade barriers have a white knight to turn to at the Department of Trade and Industry. Any company that believes its products have been rejected by an invidious application of 'national standards' or some other unfair ploy, can appeal to the Single Market Compliance Unit (SMCU)*, set up by the department to resolve difficulties caused by breaches of EC rules. The unit, created four years ago, has recently been expanded to deal with increasing numbers of complaints about alleged breaches. Its caseload has risen from five in 1989 to 19 in 1990, 28 in 1991, 58 in 1992 and to more than 60 so far this year. The unit believes many other cases may not yet have come to light. 'The problems brought to us appear to be fairly typical of those that UK business faces, although the extent of those problems can be hard to judge,' a spokesman for SMCU said. Because exporters often find a way round particular problems and are reluctant to complain, these problems are not exposed and resolved in the long term. Even those companies that do take their troubles to the unit, do not want publicity. 'Everything we do for the exporter is treated confidentially,' says the DTI. As a result, SMCU triumphs rarely make the headlines. As the unit gains experience in tackling certain issues, its success rate is expanding. But it recoils at the idea that it might be seen as a 'quick fix' body and points out that results are rarely swift and cases are seldom clear cut. Often, the SMCU is seen as a place of last resort. Cases are referred to the unit by MPs, MEPs, ministers, embassies and trade associations. When a complaint is taken to the unit, the evidence is assessed and, if the unit feels a case exists, it calls on other Whitehall departments or British embassies for the technical and regional expertise needed to confirm whether a breach has occured. Thereafter a course of action is agreed upon with the exporter. Actions open to the unit include taking the matter up with a member state through Brussels, getting ministers to contact their counterpart in the member state concerned and asking ambassadors to raise the issue with the ministry concerned. If these bilateral approaches fail, a case can be referred to the European Commission by the complainant, with the SMCU acting in an advisory role. The Commission may then initiate 'infraction proceedings' but these can take two or three years to reach a resolution. Complaints include failure to recognise common standards, refusal to comply with public procurement rules, an exporter not being given a test date for a product and delays in receiving the test results. The question of national standards being used to block trade is particularly vexing at a time when the Community is moving towards spreading the use of its own harmonised mark of conformity: CE marking. Any product bearing the marking will have met criteria laid down by the relevant EC New Approach Directive - regulations concerning standards for each sector - and will be acceptable in any country within the EC. The idea is that national standards must be withdrawn when they conflict with European standards. This, however, is a minefield when it comes to compliance and a quarter of the cases the unit has taken on this year concern standards. In spite of the increase in complaints, the SMCU says deliberate breaches of Community law by member states are rarer than is commonly believed. 'Most problems come about through difficulties caused by the very different systems across the Community,' it says. 'There is little evidence of deliberate, wide-scale, illegal practice by other member states' authorities, but problems do occur through different interpretation of the rules or patchy enforcement. Although the SMCU has several contacts in other EC countries willing to assist in resolving difficulties, the only other European country to have a similar body is Denmark, whose industry ministry has set up what is called the 'Hoovergang'*. While SCMU and Hoovergang have met to exchange experiences, their contact is infrequent because few problems arise between the UK and Denmark. *Single Market Compliance Unit: 44-(0)71-215-6730; Hoovergang: 45-31-851066</p>

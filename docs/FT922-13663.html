			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / UK Company News: Whatman knocked by US recession THE US recession was blamed by Whatman, the specialist paper and filtration equipment maker, for a 16 per cent fall, from Pounds 11m to Pounds 9.2m, in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. More than 60 per cent of the group's Pounds 49.6m (Pounds 44.6m) turnover is US-based. The UK accounts for just 17 per cent with the rest in continental Europe and the Far East. A strong performance from miro-filtration products in North America shielded the group from the worst effects of the US downturn. Mr Hugh Perrott, finance director, said: 'A worst economic background than we had experienced was partly offset by gains from our new focused products where we had increased investment.' Reorganisation costs of Pounds 300,000, relating to the discontinuation of manufacturing filter systems, was taken above the line. A net interest charge of Pounds 378,000, compared with net interest income of Pounds 733,000, mainly due to tax increases in Japan and the US. Earnings per share fell from 33.1p to 26.6p. While capital expenditure fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 4.7m, marketing and product development expenditure is expected to rise as a proportion of sales over the current year. The final dividend is increased to 5.8p making a total of 8.7p compared with 7.75p. Mr Perrott said the group aimed to increase the dividend steadily.</p>

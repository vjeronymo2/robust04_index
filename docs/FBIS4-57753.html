			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "180 Minutes of News" Newscast] </F>   [Text] The National Executive Committee [CEN] of the  Democratic Action [AD] Party this morning decided to  exclude--listen carefully: it decided to exclude, which is not  the same as to expel--Carlos Andres Perez, and it urged the  National Directors Committee [CDN] to issue an opinion on the  case. Maria Lilibeth Aponte has the story:    [Aponte] Following a seven-hour debate, which ended after  2300 on 19 May, the AD CEN decided to exclude former President  Carlos Andres Perez from the party. Some 21 [number as heard]  CEN members voted in favor of the move, seven voted against it,  and three others voted for another proposal. The decision was  made after AD Secretary General Luis Alfaro proposed the  enforcement of Article 134 of the AD statutes. This article  stipulates that a lack of moral values or ethics is a serious  offense and can lead to the permanent expulsion of any member  who commits one of the crimes listed in the Public Patrimony  Safeguard Law [ley de salvaguarda de patrimonio publico],  regardless of whether a domestic court has tried him.    Two-thirds of CEN members were required to vote in favor of  this decision because Perez was a CEN member. Although the word  expulsion is stipulated in Article 134 of the AD statutes,  Secretary General Alfaro noted that the former president was  excluded, not expelled, from the party. The CDN will review the  CEN decision before making a final decision on the case.    [Begin recording] [Alfaro] The statutes stipulate two  actions.    [Unidentified reporter] Could you expand on this? [words  indistinct]    [Alfaro] There are two actions here. The CEN lacks the  authority to expel, but it can make exclusions. The CDN, which  will make its own decision in due time, is the body that decides  whether to expel. [end recording]    [Aponte] Lewis Perez, Aristides Hospedales, Adelso Parra,  Pedro Tabata Guzman, Oscar Celli, Humberto Celli, Miguel Otero,  Ixora Rojas, Liliana Hernandez, Carlos Calachin Mata, Armando  Sanchez Bueno, Octavio Lepage, Lilia Arvelo, and Luis Beltran  Vallejo all voted in favor of the AD secretary general's  proposal. Pedro Paris Montesinos, Claudio Fermin, Hector Alonzo  Lopez, Aura Loretto de Rangel, Luis Emilio Rondon, Antonio  Ledezma, and Luis Pinerua Ordaz voted against it. Meanwhile,  union leaders Gaston Vera, Cesar Gil, and Federico Ramirez Leon  proposed the temporary suspension of Perez, thereby failing to  compromise their votes.</p>

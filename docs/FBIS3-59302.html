A provincial official in charge of transport said that this  south-east China Province had already spent about 700 million  yuan on laying 400 kilometers of roadbed this year.    "The high-grade highway in the province will be extended by  241 kilometers by the end of this year," the official said.    Fujian is one of the provinces which piloted in the reforms  and opening further to the outside world, and its economy has  developed more rapidly over the past decade and more.    But its economic development has been hampered by poor  transport facilities due to historical factors and geographic  conditions.    To solve the bottleneck problem, Fujian last year decided to  invest more in highway construction.    According to the decision, the province would build a 400-  kilometer-long expressway running from Fuzhou, capital of Fujian  Province, to Xiamen, one of China's special economic zones, and  Zhangzhou in the southern province, and upgrade and expand five  national and one provincial highways and a number of trunk  highways to form a transport network.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Spices SPICES Prices of black and white pepper continued to ease this week, reports Man Producten, as falling demand and accumulating selling pressure from some producing countries resulted in a softer undertone. Prospects that prices will soon recover seem poor. Big producers like Indonesia (white pepper) and Brazil ( black pepper) will soon be coming to the market with their new crop and though production is expected to be lower than in previous years on a very good supply can still be counted on. Muntok white pepper is available at Dollars 1,125 a tonne, cif, and black fair average quality at Dollars 825 a tonne, cif, prompt shipment from origin.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Building societies' outflow at Pounds 184m BUILDING societies fared poorly on both sides of their business last month, according to figures published by the Building Societies Association yesterday. There was a Pounds 184m net outflow of savings in November as depositors found better interest rates elsewhere. November's figures reversed October's net inflow of Pounds 281m and mean that there were net outflows in five of the past 11 months. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said the November outflow was not surprising 'against the background of a generally disappointing pattern of savings this year'. He said the November figures reflected recent cuts in savings rates but thought that savings rates would go no lower. 'Potential competition from longer-term investment products means that building society savings rates are close to their effective floor,' he added. There is some evidence to support this. National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth-largest society, this week announced it would be raising rates by 0.25 of a percentage point on amounts of more than Pounds 25,000 on some of its investment accounts from Monday. It is also increasing the rate paid on its two Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts. Mortgage lending was also down. Net new commitments decreased to Pounds 1.85bn from Pounds 2.17bn in October - a drop of just more than 14 per cent  -while gross mortgage advances increased slightly to Pounds 2.09bn in November from just under Pounds 2bn the month before. In spite of the fall, which was attributed to seasonal factors, Mr Boleat expressed relative optimism about the housing market next year. The BSA also released regional house price figures for the third quarter, based on a 5 per cent sample survey of building society completions. The sample included Abbey National, the UK's second largest lender, which is a bank. The average UK house price was Pounds 62,265 in the third quarter, down by 5 per cent compared with the same period last year. The greatest fall was in Greater London, where prices were down 11 per cent.</p>

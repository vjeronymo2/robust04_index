			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=18 g=1 f=1 -->  <USBUREAU>Federal Railroad Administration Petition for Waivers of Compliance</USBUREAU> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with Title 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has received a request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations. The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Southern California Regional Rail Authority (SCAX)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Due to the devastation caused by the January 17 earthquake  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Los Angeles, California area, a transportation emergency now exists. To alleviate this situation SCAX has arranged to lease 25 bi-level passenger cars and 7 power cars from GO Transit of Toronto, Ontario. The SCAX presently operates 94 bi-level cars over Metrolink, a regional rail network which links downtown Los Angeles and surrounding counties. The GO Transit cars are nearly identical to the 94 cars purchased by SCAX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SCAX seeks waivers of compliance from certain sections of the Federal Railroad Administration regulations which are described herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> FRA Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SCAX is requesting that it be permitted to operate 25 GO Transit bi-level commuter passenger cars and 7 power cars which do not fully comply with the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR part 231). Section 231.14(b)(2) (``Passenger-train cars without platforms'') requires that the top tread of the sill step have a minimum clear depth of 8 inches. Section 231.14(c)(3) requires that the side corner handholds be located specifically in relation to the center line of the coupler. SCAX says that these safety appliances may not be properly configured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> FRA Docket Number RSGM&hyph;94&hyph;3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SCAX seeks a temporary waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Safety Glazing Standards (49 CFR part 223) for 25 GO Transit passenger cars and 7 power cars. The glazing material installed in the equipment is manufactured to CSA-D263&hyph;1972 (ANSI Z.26.1) standards, laminated safety glass suitable for locomotives and railway cars. The side facing and end facing glazing material is not in compliance with 49 CFR 223.15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> FRA Docket Number RST&hyph;94&hyph;1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SCAX is requesting a waiver of compliance from the requirements of &sect;213.57(b) of the Track Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213). Section 213.57(b) limits the operation of trains on curved track to speeds which produce no more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three 3 inches of underbalance. SCAX requests a waiver to operate their passenger equipment at curving speeds producing no more than four 4 inches of underbalance. SCAX maintains that curving speeds producing 4 inches of underbalance still provides a large measure of safety for passenger train operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the transportation emergency existing in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Los Angeles area, FRA has, on a temporary basis, conditionally waived compliance with the relevant portions of the rail safety regulations. FRA has, however, reserved the right to withdraw such approval upon receipt by FRA of public comment raising substantial issues of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;94&hyph;3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before March 29, 1994, will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC on February 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Phil Olekszyk,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Deputy Associate Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4415 Filed 2&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

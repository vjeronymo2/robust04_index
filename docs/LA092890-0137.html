			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 CSUN PLAYERS FACING CHARGES AFTER SCUFFLE  </P> <P> Two Cal State Northridge football players will be arraigned Oct. 10 in San  Fernando Municipal Court in connection with a brawl at an on-campus apartment  complex.  </P> <P> Ken Jackson and Tom Berry were arrested Sept. 14 on suspicion of felony battery  after an altercation with campus police and security officers outside the  University Park Apartments.  </P> <P> Police said that Jackson, 21, a junior from Stockton, allegedly punched Marlin  Hines, a campus security officer, and pushed Mike Kaufman, a resident dorm  adviser, in an incident that started when Kaufman asked the two players to stop  drinking beer in front of the apartment complex.  </P> <P> Berry, 23, from La Palma, also wrestled with Hines and resisted attempts by  police to break up the altercation, according to police.  </P> <P> Jackson, a 6-foot-4, 245-pound reserve defensive lineman, has been suspended  from the football team by Northridge Coach Bob Burt. Berry, a 6-4, 260-pound  senior starter at defensive tackle, remains one of four Northridge team  captains. He started in the Matadors' 17-6 victory over Central (Okla.) State  last Saturday and will be in the lineup again Saturday when Northridge plays  host to UC Davis at North Campus Stadium.  </P> <P> Lt. Michael Sugar of the State University Police said an investigation of the  incident determined that Berry made no attempt to strike Hines while the  security officer wrestled with Jackson.  </P> <P> Burt declined comment on the arrests, but sources close to the team say Berry  was not disciplined because school officials, after interviewing some of the  witnesses, expect that no charges will be filed against him.  </P> <P> Jackson could not be reached for comment and Berry was unavailable, a  Northridge assistant coach said.  </P></p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Property Market: Scene set fair for a turnround - Sentiment is buoyant, but concerns persist about the availability of suitable properties Few sectors have more cause to celebrate this week's first anniversary of Black Wednesday than the property investment industry. Sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, which eventually led to a 4 percentage point reduction in UK interest rates, paved the way for a strong recovery in investment demand. Lower interest rates took the pressure off property companies' balance sheets, easing the need to sell property. The high yields offered by property and the falling cost of finance attracted overseas buyers and private investors into the UK market. Growing confidence in the property recovery, together with its high yields, prompted institutions to return to the market. The scale of this recovery is underlined in a report just published by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property consultants, which states that current potential demand is the highest for at least five years. 'The retreat in the flow of money into property over the past three years has reversed,' it says. The report draws parallels with previous periods of heavy buying such as the mid-1970s and the mid-late 1980s. 'The current bout of heavy buying fits the cyclical pattern of property investment over the past 20-25 years,' says the report. Periods of heavy buying have tended to be sporadic occuring when values do not take sufficient account of the strength of expected demand, it adds. Different components of the market have been affected by the changed conditions in different ways: The institutional sector has experienced the biggest change in sentiment of any sector. Its gross investment potential over the next 12-18 months could exceed Pounds 7bn. This represents a sea change in attitude. Last year, the combined institutional net purchases of just less than Pounds 1bn was half the 1991 total and one of the lowest recorded over the past 12 years. As a percentage of new investment, property has slipped from about 15 per cent at the start of the 1980s to 5 per cent at the start of this year - 'a level that is barely acceptable for a mainstream asset class', according to DTZ. The abrupt change in outlook stems from increasing confidence in the market's recovery, together with a greater appreciation of the attractions of property's high, secure income as bond yields fall. DTZ Debenham Thorpe Research surveyed 50 fund managers, who control Pounds 35bn of property or 60 per cent of total institutional property holdings. DTZ found that investors were taking a 'very positive' view of future performance, with nine out of 10 respondents saying that expectations of a recovery in values over the next 1-2 years were an encouraging factor in their investment decisions. Property is viewed as a means of maintaining the performance of a portfolio, given pessimistic expectations of future dividend growth and an over-supplied gilts market. The funds' total potential spending power could reach an annual peak of Pounds 7bn over the next 12 months and remain at about Pounds 6bn through to the middle of the present decade. The DTZ survey suggests that about half the funds intend to raise investment and maintain it at a high level for several years, 23 per cent propose a short-term increase in purchases at some point over the next three years, and 17 per cent are net sellers which intend to wind down their acquisition programme. But there are caveats. With so much money available for so few suitable properties, values may rise to a point where they are no longer considered as offering good value. Moreover, property sales are expected to increase over the next two to three years. About 55 per cent of funds expect to raise the turnover of their portfolios this year, although only 10 per cent could be classified as heavy sellers. Another concern for some funds is the possibility of legislative change which could affect the security of rental income. Enthusiasm for property is stronger among insurance companies than among pension funds, says the report. A quarter of pension funds doubt whether they will be positive investors over the next 12 months, compared with only 10 per cent of insurance companies. Pension funds' appetite for property is restricted by the squeeze on their cashflow and the run-down of funds for the large pension schemes. Property companies are also playing an important role in the revival of the property investment market. Share prices of property companies have nearly doubled over the past year, providing excellent opportunities for companies to tap the equity market. Property companies have raised about Pounds 1.2bn in the six months to July through rights issues, largely to reduce debt and fund new acquisitions. Prospects for smaller companies are, however, more subdued, as most lack the financial muscle to exploit the opportunities. The knowledge that large property companies are no longer forced sellers has increased confidence in the market. 'Whereas concern about the scale of property company disposals has depressed the market in recent years, the position is now almost reversed. The prospect that property companies are becoming net buyers is widely seen as a positive influence on capital values,' says the report. Overseas investors have reduced their spending on UK property from Pounds 3bn at its peak in 1989-90, to an estimated Pounds 1 1/2 bn-Pounds 2bn for 1993. However, this level of investment may prove more enduring than the investment pattern of the late 1980s, which was characterised by many one-off mega-deals. 'The fall in volume represents a shift in the focus of overseas demand from the mega-deals and developments of the late 1980s to a broader and potentially more secure investment pattern.' The majority of deals over the past 12-18 months have been struck by German investors, although Asian and Middle Eastern investors have increased their presence in the past 12 months. Banks, unlike other sources of finance, are generally reluctant to increase funds earmarked for property. 'For the forseeable future, possibly into the mid-1990s, most banks are likely to be too preoccupied sorting out their existing problems to enter into substantial new lending to the property sector,' says the report. Bank loans to UK property, which peaked at Pounds 41bn in May 1991, fell to Pounds 36bn in mid-1993. Property debt is about 11 per cent of the banking sector's commercial loan book, which despite being 1 percentage point lower than in 1992, remains one of the highest exposures on record. The banks' reluctance to lend to property may prevent the recovery from spreading through to the entire market. But in some respects, the shortage of bank finance is likely to add to the stablility of the market, since it will prevent a surge in development from adding to the supply of new buildings. So long as interest rates and bond yields remain relatively low, the scene is set fair for a continued surge in demand for property. The main concern is that there are insufficient sellers of the right type of property at current prices. This could force yields down below the level that buyers are prepared to tolerate at this early stage in the cycle. Although sentiment towards property has been transformed, it may take longer than investors expect to translate enthusiasm into deals.</p>

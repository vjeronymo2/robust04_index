			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures advanced strongly on speculation over a cut in interest rates in both the UK and the US, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract opened at 2,530 on the expectation that Friday's fall on Wall Street was overdone. With only a brief reversal to 2,528 at around 9am, buying of March continued and moved up a gear as the view of a possible cut in interest rates spread from the money markets and into FT-SE futures. The strong opening on Wall Street only served to increase interest, with buying of the contract by US clients a notable feature. One trader commented: 'It was a one-way market, all the way up from the opening.' That was not strictly true; profit-taking before the markets closed caused March to relinquish earlier gains. March closed at 2,560, around 11 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 10. In the LTOM, turnover was a poor 21,513 lots. Hanson was the busiest stock option with 1,927 lots traded. The May 220 calls were the busiest series. Thames Water traded 1,100 lots, with one house reported to have sold a straddle, trading the May 360 calls and puts at the same exercise price and expiry date.</p>

Enterprises are closing down one after the other. Tens of  thousands of workers are out of a job, and more still have been  forced to take unpaid leave. The budget deficit has hit 100  billion karbovantsy.    The budget planned by the government for this year does not  even have sufficient funds to pay miners' wages. Because of the  total bankruptcy of the city coffers, the socioeconomic program,  which requires, according to the most modest calculations, 4.5  trillion karbovantsy, has been ruined. Thus the city deemed the  world's most flourishing young industrial center by UNESCO 20  years ago is falling into decline.    Now the sole hope left to the Donbass is for implementation  of the president's edict granting economic autonomy to the four  oblasts of southeast Ukraine, which will open the way to revive  links with Russia and cut contributions to the state budget.  But for now, unfortunately, owing to existing laws restricting  self-management in the localities, the oblast administrations  are unable to make use of the edict.    And Kiev's legislators have no particular wish to modify the  laws. So Oblast Soviet deputies decided during the  parliamentary elections to conduct a consultative poll of the  population asking the questions: "Do you support a  federative-regional structure for Ukraine?" and "Are you in  favor of Ukraine joining the CIS as a full member?" Although  the poll has no legal force, it will serve as another reminder  to the authorities of the view of the inhabitants of the most  industrialized region. Moreover even today, to judge from  sociological polls, it is clear that 90 percent will respond to  these questions in the affirmative. And there is nothing  surprising in this. If the industrial Donbass were offered full  autonomy in the quest for markets and raw material suppliers, if  it were to be rid of at least part of the excessive yoke of  customs duties, then it would, experts believe, succeed quite  quickly in stabilizing its economy, which would ultimately have  a beneficial effect on Ukraine as a whole.    One more vital question for voters is included: "Do you  agree that Ukraine should have a second state language --  Russian?" All oblasts in the southeast of the republic, without  exception, favor bilingualism. And they are awaiting an  appropriate amendment from the new parliament on this issue.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pentland declines sharply to Pounds 21.6m Lower interest rates hit annual pre-tax profits at the cash-rich Pentland Group, owner of the Speedo and Berghaus clothing brands, which yesterday announced a 22 per cent decline to Pounds 28.3m before exceptional items. After exceptional items, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 83.6m to Pounds 21.6m. The previous year had been boosted by the Pounds 47.3m gain on the sale of the group's stake in Adidas, the sports shoe group. Interest gains fell by Pounds 10m to Pounds 16.1m, resulting from the decline in interest rates over the past year and a reduction in net cash balances from Pounds 337.3m to Pounds 185.3m. The cash decline arose in part from the payment of a special 12p dividend in April, reflecting the profit from the Adidas sale. Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said Pentland was taking its time finding the right acquisition following its disappointment over Adidas in 1992. The group pulled out of its agreed Pounds 215m bid in October that year after preliminary investigations. 'It is easy to acquire something which is earnings enhancing in the first year,' Mr Farrant said, 'but we have got to have something with growth potential.' In the absence of 'the big one', Mr Farrant said, Pentland expected to spend up to Pounds 75m on smaller acquisitions this year. Some Pounds 60m had been spent in 1993, including assumed debt. Acquisitions such as the electrical cablemaker, Woods Wire, and the outdoor clothing company, Berghaus, helped to fuel the 45 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 471.8m for the year to December 31. Stripping out purchases, sales were 13 per cent higher at Pounds 366m. Operating profits in continuing businesses were 10 per cent lower, however, at Pounds 8.8m. This was because of heavy losses in the US footwear business and at Pony, the sports shoe operation. The group also withdrew from trade finance, which incurred losses of Pounds 2.8m at the operating level. Pentland took an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.7m to wind up the division. Total operating profits for the group were Pounds 9.2m, including Pounds 3.2m from acquisitions. The dividend was increased by 12 per cent with a proposed final of 1.64p making a total of 2.8p. The Pounds 54.3m in dividend pay-outs and a Pounds 58m write off of goodwill on acquisitions, depressed shareholders' funds by a net Pounds 93m to Pounds 310.1m. Earnings per share fell from 15.79p to 2.74p.</p>

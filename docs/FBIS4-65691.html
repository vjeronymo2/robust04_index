			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by Marco </F> Nese in Rome; date not given: "Biondi: If the Skinheads Do Not  Commit Criminal Offenses, We Must Grant Them Freedom of Speech"  -- first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- What does the government intend to do to  stop the skinheads? "We have laws which allow us to take  action," [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi asserted. "In the  first place we must evaluate the phenomenon. If we consider it  an attempt to reconstitute the Fascist Party, or even as a  dangerous subversive faction, there are ad hoc norms regulating  this kind of activity. If, however, we regard the phenomenon as  an episode indicating the attitude of a minority group, however  raving the latter may be, one has to accept it, because freedom  of speech is sacred, even when it manifests itself somewhere  between folklore and cretinism."    [Nese] But can we agree to skinheads marching in the  streets?    [Biondi] In civilized countries people who are considered a  bit freakish also have the right to express their views. In  front of the White House, for example, you always find the  strangest kinds of people, who protest for ideological,  political, or even personal reasons. Nobody would dream of  silencing them.    [Nese] A law has been passed in Germany condemning anyone  who  denies that the Holocaust took place.    [Biondi] This means hindering freedom of speech. We have no  reason to pass repressive laws. There is no need for them.  Rather, inside our country there ought to be a moral and civil  rejection of the skinhead phenomenon. What they do, and what  they believe in, must make us reflect and lead our consciences  to reject them.    [Nese] Are you not concerned that a neofascist movement may  cluster around these subversive groups?    [Biondi] I believe Italy is mature enough to rule out any  fascist danger. A movement of this kind would have no  following, people are not nurturing any revanchist furor.    [Nese] How can these groups be stopped, then? How can they  be prevented from causing any harm?    [Biondi] I believe that if the late Bassaglia were still  alive, he would gladly reopen the lunatic asylums so as to lock  up these weird characters in them. From a legal point of view,  I think that we ought to be strong enough to allow them to have  their say too. If there is the right to freedom of speech, then  it must apply to everybody. The right to freedom of speech  involves a risk. If we grant this right, then we cannot  discriminate against anyone in particular. We are used to  considering the things we like good, and the things we dislike  unfair. This is making things too easy for us.    [Nese] What if the skinheads carry out acts of violence?    [Biondi] Then it is a different story. If their actions  constitute an offense, then of course we must intervene. But  what I would like to stress is that, as long as they limit  themselves to folklore, this cannot lead to a reaction. An  offense must first have been committed. Once I defended a judge  according to whom Jews could not be convicted because they had  committed deicide. I took up his defense because, although his  views were aberrant, he had the right to express them. He  deserved to be rebuked, not convicted. And the charges against  him were dropped.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET, U.S. PANELISTS TRADE GAGS IN SUMMIT TALKS ON POLITICAL WIT  </P> <P> What's in: bureaucrats, punks, pollution, stone-washed jeans, Stalin. What's  out: Gorby, glasnost, Americans.  </P> <P> What's fair game for roasting nowadays in the Soviet Union was the hot topic at  a symposium aimed at assessing the state of the wit in the two countries and  how humor reflects social and cultural values.  </P> <P> "This is one more step in demystifying the 'Evil Empire,' " said American  stand-up comedian Paul Krassner, who sat on a discussion panel recently at  Antioch University Southern California in Marina del Rey. Also on the panel  were American professors of humor and visiting Soviet humor magazine editors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2-Day Visit  </P> <P> The Soviet editors stopped on the Westside for two days as part of the second  Soviet-American Exchange of Humorists. The traveling humor summit, which also  ventured to Virginia, Nebraska and New York state in its two weeks, was  sponsored by the semi-satirical International Assn. of Professional  Bureaucrats, a Washington-based organization that, according to its president,  Jim Boren, is dedicated to dynamic inaction. The exchange also was held at UCLA  with another panel featuring George Carlin. Next year, Americans will head to  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The first such round of visits, in 1987 and 1988, included Americans Art  Buchwald and Jim Berry.  </P> <P> Political satire is the primary form of humor in the Soviet Union, and the  Soviet delegation reflected that. Represented were three official publications  that conferees likened to National Lampoon and England's Punch and Private Eye.  </P> <P> Moscow-based Krokodil (crocodile), the largest humor magazine in the Soviet  Union, is published every 10 days; its circulation is 5.3 million, out of the  country's 287 million people. Editor Leonid Florentiev said the magazine, like  its namesake, "bites, as a humor magazine should."  </P> <P> The two other magazines have equally pointed names: Peretz (pepper), from the  Ukraine, and Pikker (a lance), from Estonia.  </P> <P> Glasnost, or openness, has affected almost everything in Soviet life including  what gets a laugh, said Florentiev, at 35 among the youngest of Krokodil's 16  editors. Florentiev said censorship exists only "inside our editors in chief, .  . . and that decides whether the magazine is brave or not brave." But, he said,  "your psychology cannot change overnight."  </P> <P> Current targets for roasting include individual politicians -- dead and alive  -- and the Communist Party, the visitors said, and their magazines snipe at  certain ministers for incompetence and the Central Committee for its posh  headquarters.  </P> <P> The Soviet government's penchant for secrecy provides fodder as well. One joke  making the rounds recently has former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko asking  Leonid Brezhnev, "What do we do about these foreign correspondents, who lie  about us?"  </P> <P> Brezhnev replies: "If they're lies, they're OK. But if they start speaking the  truth, get them out of the country in 24 hours."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fertile Fields  </P> <P> Satirists also aim at corruption, vice, alcoholism, crime and environmental  problems as well as the black market, Florentiev said.  </P> <P> A recent Krokodil cartoon shows devils stirring a vat of stone-washed jeans,  the latest craze in the Soviet Union. Harvey Mindess, an Antioch professor of  psychology of humor who coordinated the visitors' Westside stay, said he sees a  difference in what gets a laugh among Soviets just since the last conference  two years ago. Discussing Playboy's bawdy humor, for example at that time made  the Soviet delegation uneasy. This time, they roared. And Kaido Liiva,  editor-in-chief of Pikker, showed some risque cartoons from his own magazine.  </P> <P> These Soviet humorists -- except for editor Andrey Benyukh -- were not the same  delegates that attended two years ago. According to Krassner, even the body  language this time was looser. "They kept whispering to each other the last  time, to make sure they were following party line," he said.  </P> <P> As in America, the Soviets have some old standards.  </P> <P> An old woman is sitting on a Moscow street corner, with an empty shopping bag.  "I've become so old, I don't remember -- did I go to the store, or am I going  to the store?" Benyukh, Krokodil deputy foreign editor, said the joke is  decades old but "now the (shortage) situation is so bad, that (it) is up to  date."  </P> <P> Underground jokes have sprouted above ground. Liiva told of a Soviet emigre  waiting at an airport. As he waits for his flight, he hears an announcement:  "The party delegation is leaving for abroad." A bit later, there's another  announcement: "The delegation from the Youth Communist League is leaving." The  man waits some more; the next announcement is, "The trade union delegation is  leaving." The man turns to another would-be emigre and says, "Now it makes  sense to stay here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Range of Topics  </P> <P> Recent Krokodil issues show the range of humor in Russia: everything from  cartoons to poetry to articles, poking fun at aging politicians, the Soviet  drug problem, rock music, artists and liubers, gangs of hooligans from the  suburbs who beat up Muscovites.  </P> <P> A punker has a scrub-brush for a Mohawk. A long-haired hippie with beads and a  peace-sign chain meditates -- picturing a cooked chicken. There is even a Gary  Larson cartoon of two fleas on a dog's back, checking a map of the dog that  tells them, "You are here."  </P> <P>  Glasnost has made some humor passe. Benyukh gave as an example the tale about  three Russians sitting on a park bench. The first one sighs; the second one  says, 'Oh," and the third says: "Are you crazy? You have to really be more  careful in expressing your political views."  </P> <P> Anti-Western attacks have stopped, Florentiev said. "Our readers are pretty fed  up with that kind of stuff," he said, adding that if the magazine wants to take  stabs at the West, it now uses American cartoons for that. Ethnic jokes are  out, because of the y situation with the various nationalities in the Soviet  Union that have increased their calls for autonomy, he said.  </P> <P> The editors say their job has become more difficult in some ways because under  glasnost, newspapers also are doing satire. "The competition is much greater  than we had before," Florentiev said.  </P> <P> Before, the humor magazines stood alone, and "it was easy to be on top of the  interests of the audience. Now, everybody seems to be very sharp," he said.  </P> <P> Glasnost-era humor does have its sacred cows, however, among them glasnost  itself. "I don't feel any euphoria about the situation," Florentiev said.  "We've got a long way to go before we consider ourselves a real democracy. But  the change is dramatic, and Mikhail Gorbachev has done a great job." He added  that the parliament is considering a proposed law that would increase freedom  of speech, and he thinks it will pass.  </P> <P> Attacking glasnost, therefore, would be suicidal, he said. "If we attack  glasnost and perestroika, it can be used by the conservatives to undermine  Gorbachev's influence."  </P> <P> Likewise, Gorbachev has been spared, though even that is changing. Benyukh  related this one-liner: Gorbachev was just a party leader before, but now is a  party leader and president -- "because he understood the impossibility of  surviving on one salary in our country."  </P> <P> Panelists exchanged jokes about each other's countries. They generally hit the  other country's funny bone, but some missed. Such as an obscure Soviet story  about Brezhnev and poet Alexander Pushkin. And an American joke about various  groups of Soviet citizens waiting for a share of a phantom shipment of oranges.  The visitors politely laughed but later said it was only "so-so."  </P> <P> Stand-up comics of the American sort are not found in the Soviet Union, said  the Soviet humorists. Instead, satirical writers read their work -- and fill  1,000-seat auditoriums, earning 5,000 rubles (about $8,000 on the official  exchange in the devalued Soviet economy, $500 on the black market) a  performance, according to the Soviet humorists.  </P> <P> And as for movies and television comedies, Florentiev said, "watching the  Soviet parliament in session on TV is enough humor."  </P> <P> American comedians known in their country, the Russians said, include Billy  Crystal (whose recent visit to Moscow was a success, they said), Eddie Murphy,  Bill Cosby and Art Buchwald (whose articles have run in Pikker and Krokodil).  Woody Allen has God-like status.  </P></p>

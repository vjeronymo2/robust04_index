			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Italian politics left in turmoil as President Cossiga quits ITALY'S political system has been thrown into disarray following the resignation of Mr Francesco Cossiga as president. Mr Cossiga's decision to step down, announced live on national television on Saturday evening, increases the political uncertainties following the April 5 general election. The result delivered a sharp rebuff to the established parties and caused further fragmentation of the already complex party system. The timing of Mr Cossiga's move now leaves the country in a political limbo as the president normally would have been expected to nominate a premier to assemble a new government. Hence the first task for Mr Cossiga's successor, who must be elected within 15 days by members of the upper and lower houses of parliament as well as regional representatives, will be to pick a prime minister. The choice has become particularly complex in view of the fact that the previous four-party coalition led by Mr Giulio Andreotti, who resigned on Friday, will probably need the support of at least one other party to ensure a stable majority in parliament. Mr Cossiga said he had decided to resign just over two months before his term formally expires in July because Italy now needed a strong president to ensure the formation of a 'strong and authoritative' government. In an emotional 45-minute address to the nation, he presented himself as a lonely figure trying to force change on an ossified political establishment, which had shown itself unwilling to read the signals for reform from the general elections. The problems faced in electing leaders for the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, when members of the new parliament met for the first time last week in Rome, illustrated how difficult finding a political majority has become. Mr Cossiga had threatened to resign more than once in recent months. He may have been finally swayed by the election on Friday of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro as leader of the Chamber of Deputies and Mr Giovanni Spadolini as leader of the Senate. Both men had opposed Mr Cossiga's calls for a stronger presidency. Mr Cossiga said the single European market, the crisis in state finances, the need for economic recovery and the fight against organised crime were the main challenges facing a new government.

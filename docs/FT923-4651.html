			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Brundtland fires third of cabinet MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, yesterday purged a third of her cabinet in a move designed to emphasise reduction of unemployment as the government's priority, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo. Most significant is the appointment of Mr Gunnar Berge as local government minister in charge of labour issues, which had been the responsibility of the ministry of labour and administration. Mr Berge is Mrs Brundtland's closest Labour party ally and has strongly backed her strategy to lead Norway into the European Community. Norway's unemployment rate is running at 7.6 per cent.</p>

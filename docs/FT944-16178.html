			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins holds back Alexandra Workwear Alexandra Workwear, the leading UK supplier of civilian work clothes, saw a small increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 2.16m for the half-year to August 13. Sales rose 4 per cent to Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 31.9m) and market share improved, the group said. But gross margins slipped from 44 per cent at the year-end to 43 per cent and trading profit fell to Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 2.48m). Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said the Glasgow factories had underperformed because of the training of 50 new staff. The opening of two shops and refurbishment of others had added to costs, without an incremental increase in volumes. There had also been a lower proportion of higher margin sales, and hired work clothes had suffered because they were less attractive to customers at times of low interest rates. 'The first quarter of the first half was much more encouraging,' Mr Budd said. 'Trading conditions are still tough.' ' Earnings per share increased to 4.3p (4p) and the interim dividend to 2.3p (2.1p). Borrowings have been further reduced to Pounds 4.4m and gearing was 18 per cent, against 34 per cent. 'We should eliminate borrowing by the year-end and our major capital expenditure is over,' Mr Budd said. Two shops had been opened at York and Cardiff, bringing the total to 37. Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said orders were at encouraging levels but uncertainty remained over proposed raw material price increases.</p>

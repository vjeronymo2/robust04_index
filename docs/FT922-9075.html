			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead NEXT week should provide some much-needed first-hand evidence about whether the UK is finally pulling out of recession as some of the most influential retailers report. On Tuesday, Marks and Spencer, which has been riding the rough trading better than most, is likely to edge profits 2 per cent higher to Pounds 635m. The company is expected to make an announcement about the future of its loss-making Canadian operations. M and S's solid cost base and proven management skills should have enabled it to combat a loss of market share. But clothing margins will have been hit by widespread discounting elsewhere and the food business will have felt the force of furious expansion programmes of the big supermarket chains. One of these, J. Sainsbury, is likely to boast of a more buoyant trading picture the following day as annual profits are likely to surge by more than 20 per cent to the Pounds 610m mark. However, Burton Group, the ill-starred fashion retailer which has seen two chief executives depart in as many years, is only likely to confirm the pattern of its recent grim trading fortunes when it reports on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley suggests interim profits will be near Pounds 20m - with only a token dividend. Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, is expected on Thursday to lay the foundations for the further 'year of progress' promised by Sir Allen Sheppard, the chairman. A 3 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 390m is forecast with IDV, the drinks division, leading the way. British Gas is expected to report a drop in its first quarter net income on Thursday to Pounds 630m from Pounds 729m in the same period last year. The company saw profits eroded by warmer winter weather and lower gas production at its Morecambe Bay field. Royal Dutch-Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil company, is estimated to have made a profit of Pounds 685m in the first quarter on a replacement cost basis which strips out stock losses and gains - half the level made in the same period in 1991. The company is expected to be hit by a weakening in refining margins, particularly in the Far East. Two UK composite insurers report their first-quarter results next week, with both are expected to show some improvement. Analysts expect Royal Insurance to lose between Pounds 35m and Pounds 60m compared with a Pounds 63m deficit in 1991. General Accident's losses are expected to be between Pounds 35m and Pounds 50m (compared with a Pounds 75m loss).</p>

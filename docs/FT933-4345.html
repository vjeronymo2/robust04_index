			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television We are assured that ITV's substitute for 'This Week', the half-hour current affairs programme The Big Story, which is launched today at 7.30, will be hard hitting, popular, and 'searching out the often shocking truth hidden behind the headlines'. Thanks to the character of Victor Meldrew, 'One Foot In The Grave' has attracted more attention than the other oldie comedy, Waiting For God, which begins a fresh batch on BBC1. Yet Waiting For God seems to me the better series, particularly strong on dialogue and in the superb acting partnership between Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden (8.30). Crimewatch UK is back with a mouth-watering menu. There's a reconstruction of the last day in the lives of a 64-year-old man and his 67-year-old wife who were shot dead in their Welsh farmhouse (sounds super]) a young woman telling us all about how she was raped (yummy yummy]) and reports of a woman being spied on as she changed after a game of squash (cor]). Drooling over this is quite OK because it's all in the name of crime prevention (9.30).</p>

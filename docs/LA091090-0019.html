			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> More Minority Writers at Fox: An aggressive search for minority writers for Fox  television programming has begun, Fox Inc. said Friday. Fox Chairman Barry  Diller said the goal will be to increase the number of minority writers, and he  pledged that at least one minority writer trainee will be assigned to each  series produced by 20th Century Fox Television and for those series aired by  Fox Broadcasting Co. Like the recent minority writers hiring program announced  by the Walt Disney Studios, Fox is working with the Writers Guild of America  West and various minority organizations. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

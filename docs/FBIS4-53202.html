			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, May 16 KYODO -- A Thai political activist  vowed Monday [16 May] to go on a hunger strike to pressure the  government to make further steps toward enacting true democracy  in Thailand.    Chalat Worachat [spelling of name as received], 51, told  KYODO NEWS SERVICE he was determined to start a hunger strike on  May 25 and would not stop until the government starts the  process of writing a new constitution stipulating direct  elections for provincial governors and members of municipal  councils, or resign or dissolve the House of Representatives.    Chalat went on a hunger strike two years ago which triggered  a mass protest that led to a bloody political crackdown in May  1992. The then military-dominated government was toppled after  dozens of people were killed or went missing during the Army's  suppression.    "I'll go on the fast to continue the cause of my struggle  two  years ago," Chalat said. He fasted for 47 days in 1992 and  stopped on may 24 after the resignation of the then Premier Gen.  Suchinda Kraphrayun.    Chalat, serving his second term as an elected member of  Parliament, has gone on four hunger strikes during the past 10  years and has been on a lone demonstration in front of  Parliament since April 8.    Chalat made public his decision to go on a hunger strike  last  week, prompting a number of politicians and political activists  to try to dissuade him.    A group of leading politicians and academics, led by  Chamlong  Simuang and two rectors of leading universities, met Monday and  issued a resolution calling on Chalat to postpone his hunger  strike. They said the four-point demands he is making need more  time and that his hunger strike might trigger another political  upheaval in the country.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai warned Sunday against  unrealistic demands when he laid a wreath in remembrance of  victims of the may 1992 uprising. He called on Thais to respect  the principles of democracy and avoid repetition of the 1992  unrest.    The present five-party coalition government, derived from an  election after the upheaval, has been widely criticized by  pro-democracy forces of inadequacy in moving the country forward  on a democratic path. The government's attempt to amend the  constitution was defeated in Parliament in March.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAYMAIL, SECRETS AND THE NORTH TRIAL;  </P> <P> LAW ON CLASSIFIED DATA MAKES VAST DIFFICULTY FOR ALL PARTIES  </P> <P> The charges swirl around the blond-paneled courtroom in Washington where the  Iran-Contra case is being readied for a jury. Is the independent counsel  unfairly trying to prevent Lt. Col. Oliver L. North from showing that he is the  "white hat" hero of the Iran-Contra affair and many other clandestine  intelligence missions? Or, instead, is North trying to "graymail" his country  by threatening to expose the nation's deepest secrets if he is forced to trial?  </P> <P> The posturing on both sides tends more to obscure the underlying issues than to  illuminate them. The judge himself has, until quite recently, seemed baffled,  if not befuddled, in deciding which side to believe.  </P> <P> To understand the dispute, it is important to recognize that both sides are  playing for high stakes. (Witness, for example, North taking the extraordinary  step of subpoenaing the President, the President-elect, the secretary of state  and other high officials to testify on his behalf.) The independent counsel,  former federal Judge Lawrence E. Walsh, is seeking to persuade a jury that  North is a felon who conspired to "defraud" the United States by depriving the  public of its right to have government officers and agencies perform their  duties properly.  </P> <P> The prosecutor charges that, by arranging the secret sale of arms to Iran and  then even more secretly using the profits to finance the Nicaraguan Contras,  North was perverting the governmental process, misusing government assets and  frustrating Congress' desire -- however clumsily expressed -- to distance our  government from the Contras.  </P> <P> In response, North contends that his role in orchestrating this international  arbitrage fell well within the scope of the vital and shadowy missions that he  had regularly been entrusted to perform with approval at the "highest levels"  of government. He was commissioned, he contends, to exercise the kind of  bravado and ingenuity that the staid bureaucrats in the more traditional  intelligence services could not duplicate.  </P> <P> To prove his point, North wants to lay before the jury highly classified  documents -- about 30,000 pages worth -- that he claims would show the range of  authorized (or implicitly sanctioned) anti-terrorist missions that he  conducted. These records also would illustrate his regular -- and approved --  practice of using unorthodox and "off-the-books" ventures (like Swiss bank  accounts and dummy corporations) to keep the nation's enemies in the dark.  </P> <P> As the trial judge recognized early in the case, North and other potential  witnesses "operated from secure locations in the White House with full access  to the most sensitive information and most critical national-security  intelligence methods and sources available to the government."  </P> <P> The crunch comes because the intelligence agencies want a tight lid clamped  onto this information. They also want to suppress the super-secret information  that North carries around in his head and has pledged -- or threatened -- to  disclose if he is forced to exonerate his conduct at a trial.  </P> <P> The problem is not new, even though the Iran-Contra case portrays it on a  grander scale. For many years a bizarre paradox confronted prosecutors, spies  and renegades in the national-security apparatus -- the more sensitive and  important the crime, the less likely it would ever be prosecuted. In our  system, not only is the accused entitled to an open public trial, but even  members of the press and ordinary citizens can demand the right to sit in the  spectators' gallery as the evidence unfolds. Thus the prosecution must prove  its case with evidence placed on the public record. The accused in turn is  entitled to bring out all facts that may explain his actions or mitigate his  culpability.  </P> <P> This phenomenon became known as "graymail" -- the prospect that the stakes  might be raised too high if the government proceeded with a prosecution  relating to national security because a public trial would inevitably disclose  even more secret information. Offenses involving national security thus  acquired a kind of practical immunity from prosecution.  </P> <P> In 1980, however, Congress tried to fashion a compromise that would respect the  legitimate interests of prosecution and defense while protecting the public  interest in allowing courts and juries to resolve criminal charges involving  security-related activities. That statute, the Classified Information  Procedures Act, imposes limits on a defendant's ability to discover classified  information in the government's files. The statute also regulates the process  for using classified documents or testimony at trial.  </P> <P> The basic premise of the statute is that a federal trial judge, using flexible  and creative alternatives, can help forge substitutes for detailed classified  information that will leave the defendant in substantially the same position as  if the classified details themselves had emerged. Thus, when the government  responds to pretrial demands for classified documents, the judge may permit the  government "to substitute a summary of the information for such classified  documents, or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the  classified information would tend to prove."  </P> <P> More sticky is the control of information already in the defendant's possession  -- including documents not only in his possession but also information in his  head -- as well as the testimony of witnesses. The statute addresses these  concerns by imposing on the defendant the obligation to give advance warning to  the government and the court if he "reasonably expects to disclose or to cause  the disclosure of classified information in any manner in connection with any  trial or pretrial proceeding."  </P> <P> If the judge concludes that the information is relevant and permits either  pretrial discovery or potential disclosure at trial, the government then can  invoke the judge's power to approve substitutions for the "specific classified  information." The alternatives include a statement in which the government  admits the relevant facts that the information would tend to prove, or submits  a summary of the classified information. The test to be applied is whether "the  statement or summary will provide the defendant with substantially the same  ability to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified  information."  </P> <P> For example, if the accused seeks to defend his conduct by claiming that he was  acting to protect highly classified nuclear targeting plans, the judge might  simply require the prosecution to acknowledge before the jury that there are  such plans without publicly disclosing the actual classified target assignments  themselves.  </P> <P> The statute has real teeth. It forbids a defendant to disclose any information  "known or believed to be classified" in connection with his prosecution until  he has given the required notice and afforded the government the opportunity to  challenge his plans or at least to persuade the court to allow unclassified  substitutions for the information said to be relevant to the defense. If the  defendant fails to honor this obligation, the statute authorizes the judge to  "preclude disclosure" of any classified information not covered by the  screening procedures and to "prohibit the examination by the defendant of any  witness with respect to such information."  </P> <P> Since 1980 the government has used the statute successfully in espionage and  counterintelligence cases. The process that it requires, however, can be  time-consuming and cumbersome. It was not really designed for a case in which,  as in Iran-Contra, the prosecution concedes that perhaps 30,000 pages of  classified data may be relevant to the charges but insists that they cannot be  used in their raw form in a public trial.  </P> <P> In addition, defendants including North vigorously challenge the  constitutionality of the process itself. As North argues -- and the  constitutional issues remain open -- these procedural requirements raise  difficult questions under the Fifth Amendment (self-incrimination) and the  Sixth Amendment (effective assistance of counsel). By requiring the defense to  make pretrial disclosures of the information that may be used at the trial,  including the testimony of defense witnesses and perhaps even of the defendant  himself, the statute also implicates the due-process clause. That clause  generally limits the government's power to force the accused to lay bare  defense claims in advance of trial, at least where the prosecution does not  assume a reciprocal burden of full disclosure before trial.  </P></p>

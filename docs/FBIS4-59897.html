			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Gaza -- In a statement distributed yesterday,  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] denounced the policy of  deception that the Palestinian side is pursuing with regard to  the agreements that are being reached and the fact that it is  not telling the truth to the people. This, in contrast to Rabin  and his government who are proudly informing their people about  the agreements reached with 'Arafat.    This statement came in response to the meeting held last  Wednesday in Cairo, the day of the signing of the agreement [4  May], between Muhammad Dahlan and Jibril al-Rujub with the head  of Shin Bet.    In its statement, Hamas criticized the reported cooperation  between the two sides in the security sphere and the exchange of  information about the activities of Islamic forces in Gaza.  [passage omitted]    The statement added: During the meeting, the Shin Bet head  forced Dahlan and al-Rujub not to prosecute collaborators, and  al-Rujub confirmed this to the news media.    In its statement, Hamas denounced the fact that those at the  meeting permitted themselves to aid in the liquidation of a  large sector of their people for rejecting the occupation and  its consequences. At the same time they committed themselves  not to prosecute collaborators, who played an important role in  the establishment of the special units and the protection of  settlers.    In its statement, Hamas stressed that it will continue the  march regardless of the cost.</p>

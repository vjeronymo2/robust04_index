			<p>BFN     [Text] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup hopes that  the Bosnian Serbs learned a lesson from the clash between Serb  artillery and Danish tanks on Friday [29 April]. The Serb  troops have announced that nine of their soldiers were killed  when the tanks -- belonging to the Nordic UN troops -- shelled  Serb firing positions near the town of Tuzla. Speaking prior to  the meeting of defense ministers, which has opened in Korsoer in  Denmark, Haekkerup said that the UN troops must not be passive  targets but they have at least the right to fire back.    The meeting in Korsoer is discussing the Nordic countries'  peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. The meeting is also attended  by the UN commander in Bosnia, Michael Rose.</p>

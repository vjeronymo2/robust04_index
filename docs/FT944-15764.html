			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / The modern face of an ancient city: Central Beirut has been razed in order to revive it as a financial capital There is a gaping hole where Beirut's heart used to be. Gone are the ancient markets, art deco cinemas, coffee shops and bordellos that made the Lebanese capital the Middle East's most glamorous playground and vibrant financial centre. The remnants of the city's heyday remained until two months ago. But in recent weeks 150 buildings have been demolished, with another 150 due to follow. From the city's ring road there is now a view of the Mediterranean over a wasteground of tarmac: 1.8m sq m of city-centre land that is to be the site of Beirut's revival. Solidere, the Dollars 1.8bn property company set up through a flotation earlier this year, has begun its task. It is rebuilding central Beirut. For 10 years, Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, has cherished a scheme to recreate Beirut as the financial capital of a newly peaceful Middle East. Solidere is his creation, and with a 7 per cent stake in the company, he is its largest declared shareholder. Solidere will now oversee the building of offices for the multinationals, banks and companies that Mr Hariri believes are keen to re-enter a region opening its borders and economies. Hotels will go up for the tourists, who he hopes will now return to the region. The Lebanese people's traditional talents for trade and brokerage will be harnessed. And an economy based on financial services, traditionally worth some 70 per cent of Lebanon's GDP, will be revived. But even as Solidere is demolishing central Beirut, Mr Hariri's motives in launching the project, its substance, and its wisdom, are all being questioned. Many Lebanese are deeply suspicious that Mr Hariri, a man who made a multi-billion dollar fortune as a contractor in Saudi Arabia, should have created a big contracting company to redevelop the centre of Beirut. Some of the landowners in central Beirut, who were forced to exchange their land for shares in Solidere say their property was heavily undervalued at about Dollars 1,500 per square metre. Land prices on the fringe of Solidere's allocated land are already at Dollars 3,000 per square metre, and rising, they say. 'Hariri is going to make lots of money from the downtown project,' says Mr Adnan Iskander, a political scientist at the American University of Beirut. 'This is not all just for the public interest.' Mr Hariri maintains, however, that the prime minister's Solidere shares are held in trust and all profits will go to his charitable foundation, which has paid for the education of thousands of Lebanese in recent years. Whether or not Mr Hariri stands to gain personally from the redevelopment, many are questioning the need to raze so much of the city in order to revive it. Mr Assem Salaam, an architect in Beirut for more than 30 years and one of the hard core of vocal opponents, believes Solidere has destroyed the 'social tissue' of downtown Beirut. 'Central Beirut had tradition and a memory. It played a role in being a meeting point of Lebanon's various communities. It played a role in the fusion of social classes. It had an enormous richness,' he says. He believes that no more than 20 buildings in the city centre were truly beyond redemption and can see no justification for the scale of Solidere's redevelopment. Landowners should have been allowed to create smaller property companies to redevelop the city centre organically from its ruins, he says. 'You are not developing from scratch an Abu Dhabi or a Jeddah or a Riyadh,' he says alluding to Mr Hariri's background as a Gulf contractor. 'You are touching a medieval, Mediterranean city.' Solidere has adapted its plans in response to these criticisms, says Mr Nasser Chammaa, Solidere's chairman. The number of old buildings to be retained and restored has been increased to 266 from just over a hundred to begin with - and the company is canvassing architectural opinions on ways of recreating some of the old souqs. 'All of a sudden a portion of our memory has disappeared,' he acknowledges. 'For the public it's slightly difficult - but that will have to continue.' Mr Hariri and his staff at Solidere believe that only through ambitious, comprehensive redevelopment can Lebanon succeed. They liken Beirut's rebuilding to west Germany's reconstruction after the second world war - an unmissable opportunity to build an expanded and modernised infrastructure virtually from scratch. Mr Hariri is seeking to create the kind of momentum necessary to bring back the skilled, Lebanese middle-class that fled the 15-year civil war  - and revive the flows of private Gulf Arab wealth to the city. Both ingredients require confidence. Like Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, the project is an investment designed to generate confidence. It is that confidence that will then lead to the city's revival. But in selling the new Beirut, even senior members of Lebanon's government differ over quite what a revived Beirut's economic role would be. Some, such as Mr Hariri, believe that Lebanon has a future as a regional financial hub, despite competition from Israel, which, with an economy 10 times larger, has its eyes set on the same target. Gulf Arabs would much rather invest in Lebanon, they argue, and Syria intends to use Beirut as a catalyst for its own gradual economic opening. Others, including Mr Riad Salame, the central bank governor, see Lebanon's future as in complementary development with Israel. 'We have different vocations,' he says. 'Israel is a predominantly industrial, high-tech country, but we will address the role of an intermediary. It is like the relation between, for instance, Japan and Singapore in the Far East.' There are also political uncertainties over the scheme. Mr Hariri and his hand-picked team at Solidere are identified with the project to such a degree that many doubt whether the country's rehabilitation could survive his departure - in a land where the tenure of political leaders has been as precarious as anywhere in the world. Similar fears revolve around the future of Syria. Mr Hariri recently called Syrian President Hafez al-Assad the 'unknown soldier' of the reconstruction project. Few believe Lebanon, and its economy, could survive a turbulent succession in Damascus unscathed. Neither Mr Hariri nor Solidere can afford to be troubled by such concerns. Instead, they are hurrying to complete the basic infrastructure within the next two and a half years. 'We will have the critical mass of central Beirut in place in five to seven years,' says Mr Salame. It will be a long time before anyone can tell whether Beirut can revive itself as a financial capital and become 'the ancient city of the future' of Solidere's slogan. There are some hopeful indicators. In the last two years, Gulf Arabs are believed to have pumped Dollars 1bn into the city's real estate market and some 40,000 Lebanese expatriates have returned. Buying by Gulf Arabs has also pushed Solidere's share price from its issue price in June of Dollars 100 to nearly Dollars 170. The only certainty for the next couple of years is that Beirut is becoming the biggest building site in the Middle East, but Mr Hariri's supporters argue that there is no better alternative. 'None of our critics have come up with a project for rebuilding the centre which is different from ours,' says Mr Chammaa.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Odds shorten on Racecourse win Racecourse Holdings Trust, owned by the Jockey Club, remains the favourite to win the race to own Epsom, home of the Derby. But yesterday Mr Stan Clarke, who has turned round Uttoxeter racecourse from losses five years ago, confirmed that he was putting in a private bid, along with Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, and Mr Andrew Cohen, managing director of Betterware, the home shopping company. Also in the running is Sunset + Vine, which makes sports television programmes. Epsom is being sold, along with Sandown Park and Kempton Park, by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory body that acquired the courses more than 20 years ago in order to protect them from possible property development. All three courses lie within the M25, London's outer ring road. Estimates of their total value run up to Pounds 30m. The bids must be submitted to Lazard Brothers, the merchant bank handling the sale, by the end of this week. The winner is expected to be announced at the end of March at the earliest. Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation, the shipping and property company, which was also shortlisted, said that it would not be submitting a bid. Also out of the running is the Racehorse Owners' Association, which feels aggrieved that it did not make the final list. The association, which has 4,500 members, is thought to have put in an indicative bid of well over Pounds 20m last month. Mr David Hillyard, managing director of Racecourse Holdings Trust, said his group had a good track record for managing large racecourses. The trust owns nine, including Cheltenham and Newmarket, and ploughs all its profits back into racing. Mr Clarke, owner of Uttoxeter, said he had served his apprenticeship in racing over the past five years, turning the course from losses of Pounds 36,000 in 1989 to Pounds 400,000 profits this year. 'We are committed racing men', said Mr Clarke, who sold his housebuilding business for Pounds 51m in 1986. He believes he can transfer to racing the management expertise learnt in building up two businesses. Mr Gerry Buckland, of Sunset + Vine, said the company specialised in sports and horse racing television programmes, and believed it could use its skills to enhance the potential of the three courses. 'The Derby has not had the crack of the whip it might have had', he said. Meanwhile Mr Bill Gredley, chairman of the Racehorse Owners Association, feels that the association's bid was unfairly dismissed. Its committee, which included Mr David Sieff of Marks and Spencer, and Sir Eric Parker, former chief executive of Trafalgar House, felt the bid timetable, squeezed between Christmas and March 1, was too tight. 'Nevertheless we put in a very competitive bid and we feel that we need some answers', Mr Gredley stated.</p>

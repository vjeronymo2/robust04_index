			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT PANEL'S FUTURE  </P> <P> The Pomona City Council has delayed until Oct. 9 a decision on whether to use  $198,000 in redevelopment funds to restore a city subsidy to the Pomona  Economic Development Corp., which promotes the city's economic growth.  </P> <P> The development panel had been financed by a 30% surcharge on business license  fees until the council decided in June to terminate its subsidy, effective  Sept. 15, and use the revenue instead to hire more police officers.  </P> <P> The new budget proposed by the agency outlines specific tasks that it would do  for the city, such as gathering demographic information and persuading  businesses to establish new facilities in Pomona.  </P> <P> Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said the agency is providing worthwhile  services, but Councilwoman Nell Soto said the agency needs to broaden its goals  and revamp its board to better represent the community.  </P></p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Long march to a private bathroom: China's crumbling infrastructure When Xin Xiao, a Beijing housewife, wanted a telephone installed it proved no simple task. After paying a deposit of nearly USDollars 1,000 she waited in vain for more than six months. Exasperated, she followed the advice of friends and showered phone company officials with gifts. 'It worked,' she said. 'Within a short time a phone was installed.' Madam Xin's story is familiar in China these days. Growing affluence is bringing with it an insatiable demand for services taken for granted in the west. Not long ago, a private telephone was an almost unimaginable luxury for all but the most privileged. A hard-pressed official at the Beijing Telephone Bureau said that the crush of orders for phones in some areas was so great that the company had closed the books on new applications temporarily. China's economic boom is exerting huge pressures on a crumbling infrastructure. Its roads, railways, ports and airports are proving inadequate, and plans unveiled this week to spend Dollars 140bn by the year 2000 on a crash programme to upgrade facilities will scarely ease the difficulties. The authorities are also having to grapple with the rapidly rising expectations of consumers, who long ago ceased to be satisfied with the so-called 'three bigs' (big luxuries) of the Maoist era - a watch, sewing machine and bicycle. Even the 'three bigs' of the Dengist period - washing machine, refrigerator and colour TV set - are now almost standard in many urban households. For millions of city-dwellers housing (or lack of it), remains their greatest problem. China's 2m newly-wed couples annually are obliged in some cases to wait years before being allocated dwellings. Construction of low-cost housing lags far behind demand. It is an extraordinary statistic, but in Shanghai, China's largest city, not one floor of additional housing was built in the Cultural Revolution years of 1966-76. And during this period the city's population grew by several millions. According to a report prepared for China's Commission on Economic Restructuring, there were, in late 1992, 8m families which had no houses or were having housing problems. 'After acquiring enough to eat and wear, the people have developed a strong desire to improve their housing conditions. The increasing demand has made the problem . . . more acute,' the report said. Simple requirements such as a private bathroom are at a premium for many Chinese families, including government employees holding responsible positions. Work units provide bathing facilities several times a week and, failing that, public bath houses are available. Among the myriad frustrations for Chinese households - from overcrowded buses and trains to poor facilities for schooling - power shortages are one of the worst. Areas of Beijing suffer frequent black-outs, and in some suburbs power supplies are too feeble to fuel appliances like microwave ovens. The World Energy Council, a body monitoring the power sector, reports that electricity demand in China exceeds supply by about 20 per cent. With China's economy growing this year by 13 per cent, and with projected growth of 8-9 per cent annually for the rest of this century, there is little early prospect of the problem being solved in spite of heavy investment in the power sector. Telecommunications is a priority but the case of Madam Xin and her problems with the telephone bureau reveals how far there is to go before China's 35 main urban centres, let alone far-flung areas, are blessed with an adequate telephone system. China's ratio of people to telephones exceeds 100, compared with 1.6 in Hong Kong, 2.2 in Singapore, 2.8 in Taiwan and 2.8 in South Korea. The ratio in the UK is 1.9. China has about 17m phone lines, and aims to increase this to 100m by 2000. Difficulties in securing a private telephone have proved a bonanza for manufacturers of paging machines and cellular phones, such as Motorola. In Beijing alone, according to a Motorola executive, there are 600,000 pagers, equivalent to about one for every 15 people. Cellular phones in the Chinese capital number more than 20,000. If the telecommunications system is overstretched, stresses on the transportation sector are hardly less severe. China's hard-pressed railways rank first internationally in terms of utilisation, with load intensity averaging 25.79m tons per kilometre. Likewise, China's roads are barely adequate for a country a fraction of its size. Road coverage is only about one-sixth that of the US. Less than 6 per cent of China's 662,500 miles of roads are rated above 'second class'. It has no trunk highways linking east and west, north and south, and existing roads are clogged with trucks, cars, animal-drawn carts, bicycles and pedestrians. Average speed on the main roads is between 19 and 25mph. Nearly 60,000 people died on the roads last year. According to the Beijing Review, a weekly news magazine, fatalities per 10,000 vehicles (China has 7m vehicles) is '20 to 30 times that in developed countries'. China's airports and ports are also severely stretched. Demand for aircraft seats far outstrips supply - passenger traffic is expected to grow by 25 per cent this year - and airports are ill-equipped to cope with the boom. Only a small proportion of China's airports are equipped with sophisticated instrument landing systems, which means flights are often cancelled due to bad weather, throwing an overburdened system into further chaos. A rash of accidents has drawn attention to lax safety standards. The airline industry estimates China will need to import 50 to 100 passenger aircraft annually to the year 2000 to keep pace with demand. But this is placing a huge strain on staff training. Last year, China acquired 56 aircraft, which created positions for 500 new pilots, but training facilities produce just 100 pilots a year. Ports are also heavily congested. Plans to double capacity by the year 2000 will go some way towards easing pressures but, if China's economy continues to grow at projected rates, long delays are set to continue. Beijing Review reported recently the ratio between ships in port and those waiting outside was 1 to 1.2. In 1992, grain carriers were obliged to wait at anchor for 26 days on average, incurring total compensation for delays of Dollars 55m. Traffic jams outside China's ports, like those at its airports and on its roads, are a symptom of an economy undergoing an extraordinarily rapid transformation. The situation is likely to get worse before its gets better. As Mr Cheng Yongde, a senior engineer at Beijing's Institute for Urban Design, said of congestion on Beijing's roads. 'We haven't encountered the real challenge yet: when the masses start to drive their own cars, then we'll have a real mess.'</p>

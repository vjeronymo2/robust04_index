			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Mohammad Javad Larijani: "Legal Behavior"] </F>   [Text] 1. At the initiative of U.S. Senator Kennedy and  with the extensive cooperation of the propaganda machinery, the  anniversary of the Pan American explosion over Lockerbie,  England [as published], was marked by a pompous ceremony, the  major objective of which was to justify the pressure by the  United States and the West on Libya or, in a broader sense, to  show the so-called fight against state terrorism. During this  propaganda show, there were also some who tried to criticize  Iran--probably because of the West's anger over the visit by the  foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Tripoli.    2. A live television program with a large number of viewers  aired questions and answers on the incident and the legality of  the United States' demands that the Libyans accused of the  incident be handed over.    One listener asked: "If it is true that the United States  has the right to demand that a person it thinks is responsible  for the explosion be handed over to it, then the Iranian  Government can also demand that those responsible for the  downing of a civilian Airbus by a missile in the Persian Gulf,  which resulted in the deaths of its passengers, be handed over  to Iran to be tried and sentenced in Iran."    The person to whom the question was asked, who was  apparently  caught off guard, hastily said: "No, no. These are two  completely different issues."    The correspondent, who found the entire scene disgraceful,  said sarcastically: "Yes. There is a great difference. An  Iranian mother apparently doesn't love her children as much as  an American mother does!"    Inevitably, a philosopher who was with the person being  interviewed, commented:    "Well, the U.S. Government's actions are all based on law  and  we have always behaved in a legal manner in the world.  Therefore our situation is very different from the situation of  others."    3. The above is not the only example of the emptiness of the  West's political-humanitarian thoughts in justifying its  behavior. Those who consider the perpetration of any crime to be  permissible on the pretext of fighting fundamentalism or for the  sake of human rights display the ugliest examples of behavior in  history. Every day, the people of the world see dozens of  examples of this kind of "logic" and "law." But why are they  facing a problem? Why are modern technology, supreme economic  power, and spectacular military might unable to offer a logical  justification? Undoubtedly all their problems have to do with  "being righteous." Bad can be disguised as good for some time,  but the truth will ultimately surface. Even though we, the  Islamic ummah, do not have supreme military might or advanced  technological capabilities, we can safeguard our grandeur and  our respect if we support justness and right.</p>

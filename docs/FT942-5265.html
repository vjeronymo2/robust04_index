			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Defence unions voice job worries Unions representing workers in the defence sector are trying to use the European election campaign to focus attention on the prospect of tens of thousands of job losses. They are challenging the government's claim that support services can be trimmed without affecting defence capacity, and accusing ministers of delaying the announcement of sweeping changes in an attempt to reduce the political cost. Mr Jack Dromey, national secretary for public services at the TGWU general union, said: 'Ministers are concealing catastrophe until after the elections.' He believes job losses in the defence sector could be a crucial issue in at least one Lancashire constituency, and throughout the south-west, a Conservative stronghold with strong military and naval associations. The unions hope that raising the jobs issue during the election campaign will deflect the government from postponing a controversial announcement until just before the summer recess. Mr Dromey said: 'They must not be allowed to frustrate parliamentary scrutiny and proper consultation by announcing major cuts to Britain's defence capacity, and tens of thousands of job losses, just as MPs are disappearing to Tuscany.' Mr John Clark, head of the Ministry of Defence section at the NUCPS civil service union, said the unions wanted a 'proper strategic review' of military spending. He said: 'The government is trying to carve out a new imperial role for itself by interfering in wars across the world, yet no consideration is being given to the infrastructure of our economy or Britain's own defence needs.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has promised a statement soon on the results of the Defence Costs Studies, an effort to trim Pounds 750m from the ministry's budget without compromising military capability. At least 33 studies are in progress, and the proposals are understood to include closing several ministry buildings in London, shutting Royal Navy and Royal Air Force staff colleges and cutting the forces' in-house capacity in areas such as transport, medical care and weapons maintenance. The MoD trade unions expect 15,000 civilian and 10,000 military posts to be shed as an immediate result of the DCS, and they are urging members to raise the issue with all European election candidates.</p>

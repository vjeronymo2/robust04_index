			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 28 (XINHUA) -- China's ongoing  reform of the labor system, centering on labor, wages and social  insurance, has had great success in more than 200 cities and  counties nationwide.    Some 40 percent of country's total workforce are now under a  contract system.    This was disclosed at a news conference here today by Liu  Guanxue, a spokesman of the central government's Labor Ministry.    Liu predicted that the framework for a brand-new labor  system  suitable for the country's socialist market economy would take  shape in five years.    According to the spokesman, the government's major  achievements in reforming the labor system lay in the fact that  all sorts of enterprises throughout China have got expanded  autonomy in hiring people, especially in the distribution of  wages.    Liu said that almost all the workers employed in recent  years  have been subjected to contracts, adding that the market  mechanism is playing a decisive role in the distribution of  wages.    In China the idea of selecting freely a job meeting one's  own  interest and needs is prevailing. A job offered by the  government is not necessary a life-long job. On the other side,  work units enjoy greater freedom to select their employees.    He noted that more than 2,000 enterprises across China have  been singled out as pioneers in the change to decide their own  wage levels, adding that the practice will be introduced to the  whole country.    The spokesman said that China has set up more than 17,000  job  introduction agencies to help jobless people find work. The  agencies nationwide have found jobs for more than eight million  people annually in recent years.    In addition, the country's labor markets in different types  have become the main channel for providing job opportunities for  jobless people.    To expand the labor system reform, Liu stressed that the  government was pooling efforts to tackle "bottlenecks" affecting  this reform, such as the country's under-developed social  insurance system, loose management and the heavy financial  burdens for the government and the enterprises.    According to the spokesman, the Labor Ministry will  introduce  a reform package for the social insurance system. It is aimed  to establish a unified social insurance system, with unified  insurance payment rates and unified insurance treatment,  regardless of the ownership modes of enterprises and their  employees' status. The insurance fund is to be shared by all  under unified arrangements.    The spokesman said the Labor Ministry will grant enterprises  the right to lay off redundant personnel. This will first be  tried out in groups of pilot enterprises, he added.    Liu stressed that enterprises, once relieved of the burden  of  massive numbers of redundant workers, would find it easy to take  up the labor system reform.</p>

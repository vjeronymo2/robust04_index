			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Baghdad, Feb 7 (INA) -- A recent report by a Food  and Agriculture Organization (FAO) mission has confirmed earlier  conclusions by another FAO/WFP survey that warns of a rapid  deterioration in food supply situation throughout Iraq. The  present mission report, issued in December last year, notes with  deep concerns the prevalence of several commonly recognized  pre-famine indicators. These conclusions, based on observations  and interviews in several areas of the country, confirm the  presence of such indicators as very high food prices, collapse  of private incomes, depletion of personal assets as well as  rapidly increasing numbers of the destitutes. Following is the  fourth part of the FAO mission report:    The shortage in water supply has led to severe problems in  hygiene. According to health authorities outbreaks of lice,  typhoid, and cholera continue to be serious public health  problems in al-Basrah and throughout the country (department in  al-Basrah, personal communication).    Moreover, sanitation has become a common problem in schools  that now have 2-3 shifts a day leading to facilitated  transmission of water-borne diseases amongst the primary age  school children. Care International reported that in 1954 [year  as received] it plans to rehabilitate school lavatories.    Although the extensive vaccination supply system and the  cold  chain broke down completely immediately after the war,  immunization rates are back well above 80 percent, better than  pre-war levels in certain areas (UNICEF 1993, personal  communication). The Ministry of Health has received substantial  assistance from UNICEF/WHO in maintaining the cold chain and in  the provision of vaccines for immunization. The mission noted  adequate stocks of vaccines in Maysan and Irbil Governorates.  In addition, many mothers when asked, knew about the BCG  vaccination.    Although little is known about the incidence of acute  respiratory factions (ARI), drugs to treat infections in  children remain inadequate. The mission noted that several  cases of ARI in the pediatric wards of Saddam City Hospital in  Baghdad. These cases were receiving antibiotic treatment but  physicians complained of shortages, especially during the later  winter months when ARI is a more frequent occurrence. WHO does  provide drugs and other medical supplies, but the total amount  is insufficient to meet the needs of the population. In July to  March 1993, 780,000 U.S. dollars worth of drugs were provided  under the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance Programme. However,  drugs to treat chronic diseases, anesthesia to perform basic  surgical procedures, nitrous oxide for birthing facilities as  well as antibiotics to control infection after surgery are  virtually unavailable as reported by several hospitals and the  minister of health. This was offered as the explanation of why  hospitals are now functioning at 40-50 percent of their original  capacity in spite of the reported increase in infectious disease  and severe malnutrition.    Only severely ill cases are now being treated. Even when  drugs are available, their price on the free market may be 200  times greater than the government rationed price, thus making  them virtually unobtainable for the poor.    In summary, food insecurity at the household level,  inadequate water and sanitary system, and the shortage of drugs  to treat infections are likely to result in more serious  malnutrition.

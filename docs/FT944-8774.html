			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Budget 1994: Personal finance banks on tweaks to the system  -How the Budget might affect savers and investors Savers and investors have had little joy from recent Budgets and will be hoping for some this year when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, stands up on November 29. But few insiders expect personal finance to be in the spotlight this time. Most anticipate little more than tinkering, though no one rules out surprises. One problem the chancellor may wish to minimise is the threat of an outflow from building societies when Tessas - tax exempt special savings accounts - mature. These five-year deposit accounts were the brainchild of Mr John Major, the prime minister, when he was chancellor, and interest on them is tax-free on a maximum investment of Pounds 9,000. More than Pounds 21bn is invested in Tessas, of which about Pounds 15bn will mature at the beginning of 1996. Rules state savers can only reinvest Pounds 3,000 in a new Tessa in the first year. Competition in the retail savings market has been fierce in recent years, and building societies, which hold two-thirds of Tessa money, are concerned that equities are being given an unfair tax advantage through the existence of tax-free Peps. These allow an annual Pounds 6,000 to be invested in a general plan - with a further Pounds 3,000 in a single company plan. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said: 'There is no reason why the government should give greater tax incentives to invest in equities rather than deposits. We are calling for level playing fields.' One possibility is to postpone the problem by extending the life of Tessas to perhaps seven years. A more radical move would be to shake up the entire industry by giving savers and investors a single, tax-free allowance to be divided as they wish between deposit and equity-based investments. A married couple could have sheltered more than Pounds 100,000 of shares in Peps since they first began in 1987. They have proved so popular that fears abound that a cap could be put on the total amount which can be invested. Yet Mr Nick Nichols, secretary-general of Pepma, the Pep managers association, doubts the industry is in for a shock. 'I do not want to seem complacent but I do not think there will be any drastic measures. We are too entrenched an industry.' He believes there may be some tinkering aimed at using Peps to encourage the flow of money through industry, possibly with measures such as allowing investment trusts, which invest in unlisted securities, to be eligible for a Pep. Mr Philip Warland, director-general of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, also doubts the chancellor will wish to target Peps for adverse treatment and hopes to see their parameters widened to include bonds. Mr Ernest Fenton, director-general of the Association of Investment Trust Companies, said his main request to the chancellor was for a change in Pep rules to allow investment trusts to qualify for the single company Pep allowance. 'Investment trust companies are the only type of company that does not qualify for single company Peps, which seems to us rather odd,' he said. At present, the whole Pounds 6,000 general Pep allowance can be used to shelter investments in collective schemes, such as investment and unit trusts. But the Pounds 3,000 single company Pep allowance can only be used to buy shares in any quoted company except investment trusts, which are also quoted on the London Stock Exchange. The association argues that investing in single companies is a high-risk activity unsuitable for many private investors, so they should be encouraged to choose lower risk collective funds. The association has also lobbied the chancellor to change the rules slightly so that more venture capital investment trusts qualify for Peps. A recent rule change, which said at least half a fund's assets should be in ordinary shares, was meant to block trusts investing in gilts and bonds. But it had the side effect of disqualifying many venture capital trusts, which often have substantial holdings in preference shares. Getting rid of this anomaly would also prevent existing venture capital trusts from being disadvantaged in tax terms when the new-style venture capital trusts - which are intended to focus on the smallest start-up companies - appear next year. According to brief details in last year's Budget, these new capital trusts will automatically have tax-free status comparable to Peps. This year's Budget may also introduce some additional tax relief for them, possibly in the form of roll-over relief on capital gains from other investments. The pensions industry is the subject of a pensions bill - expected next month - which will deal with equalisation of the pension age, and changes to occupational pensions law as recommended by the Goode committee. Further wide-ranging measures are not therefore expected in the Budget, and even the fear that pensions may lose some tax benefits have not surfaced as prominently as in previous years. Instead, the chancellor is expected to bring forward a measure due to be implemented in 1997, giving holders of personal pensions the flexibility to delay purchase of an annuity until the age of 75, instead of immediately on retirement.</p>

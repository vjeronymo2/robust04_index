			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (CNS)--According to the latest  information from the Mainland authorities, China now has nearly  300 million smokers, 30 million of them female. The annual  consumption of over 150 billion cigarettes accounts for 30  percent of the world's total.    Because many of them are closet smokers, the actual number  of  the female smokers may be much bigger. According to surveys, 33  percent of female smokers said they smoked as a way of asserting  their equality with men while 40 percent of them said they  smoked because of the influence of other smokers. A middle  school class in Beijing saw 32 percent of its students smoking  because of fun. Other reasons for the bad habit by women  include the failures in love, novelty-seeking and a way to kill  time.    Women smoking in recent years has not only become a problem  harmful to health but also an increasingly serious social  problem, creating new obstacles for the anti-smoking campaign in  the country.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Arts: Stylish it may be, but art it is not This year the Hunting/Observer Prize and the Barclays Young Artist Award again coincide. Each was established in the early 1980s and each is worth a considerable sum of sponsor's money. And again their coincidence raises many questions on the nature and value of such things. The student or young artist has often proved attractive to the sponsor: the hard time he has of setting himself up in the harsh world, finding a decent studio, getting a show and all that apparently softens the hardest commercial heart. The Barclays Award is reserved specifically to the young artist of the year 'at a crucial stage in his career', to be drawn from among his peers in the previous summer's final exhibitions at London's post-graduate schools: only the Slade, Academy Schools, Royal College, Chelsea and Goldsmiths' need apply. The work of the final short-list of candidates for the current Barclays Award is now on show at the Serpentine Gallery (Kensington Gardens W2, until March 8). There are nine artists in all, of whom all but the winner take an equal share in Pounds 10,000, while the winner has Pounds 10,000 to himself. The process, as I understand it, is one not of application but of invitation, the panel of selectors visiting the shows to make its initial choice and so winnowing it down by degrees. That there may also be an element of nomination, or at least discussion with the school itself, remains unspoken, though the nature of the work that has come through on recent occasions, given the known catholicity of interest of the panel, suggests this may well be so. Now this is to cast no aspersions, nor is there a case to be made for any cynical exploitation of student or position. And yet it must be said on the strength of this exhibition, following so hard upon last year's award, the Serpentine's subsequent Broken English show in the summer and then the whole Turner Prize farrago of the autumn, that an orthodoxy has emerged and become established, compounded of the banal, the stylish and the empty. Here, the Award is saying, is the outstanding young artist of his generation. Yet why, with so wide a range of work to choose from, is it work only of a certain kind that is admitted for consideration at this critical level? We are often told that we live in happily pluralistic times, post-avant-garde, post-modern. If that means anything in this connection, it can only be that what is good of its kind across the board has a legitimate claim on our critical interest, whether it is the severest minimalism or the most rigorous conceptualism on the one hand or, on the other, the most beautifully understood and realised still-life. Is there no figurative work, no work from life or nature or the imagination being done in these schools? Of course there is, only not to be taken seriously at this level, let alone considered for the prize. Certainly there is no whiff of representation in this exhibition, save for the toy-town Meccano archness of Joanna Lawrance (RA Schools) with her spindly cranes and trolleys, set out on shelves. What we get is Andrew Kearney (Chelsea) with his grandiose installation that fills the entrance gallery, a featureless block some 10 feet high on the plan of a medieval stronghold, square with rounded turrets at each corner and clad entirely in corrugated iron sheeting. It is not so much the self-importance in carrying through such a futile imposition that takes the breath away, as the thought that he has been so positively encouraged in his self-importance as to believe its expression significant. And there is Yinka Shonibare (Goldsmiths'), whose great leap of the creative imagination has been to take a number of African batik fabrics, as may be bought at any craft bazaar, mount them on a stretcher and then paint one or more of the surfaces a flat and even grey. They are nicely stretched and the paint put on well enough: and again the artist has somehow been persuaded of the cosmic significance of the simple trick. Oh, but it is a metaphor for exploitation and appropriation, perhaps; how poignant and politically correct. But yet the cliche never made the art of itself, or every rhyme of 'moon' with 'June' would produce the greatest poetry. And here is Gabriel Klasmer (RCA), who has reduced his art to the simple practice of painting a surface with dark, thick, fat grey paint, and then modifying the surface by direction, as one may brush with or against the nap of the cloth on a billiard table. The light catches the surface, which shifts accordingly, and no matter that Ad Reinhardt was doing the same and more 40 years ago, to far more point and with far more painterly wit. But why go on? No prize exhibition can be better than the work submitted or otherwise eligible. The Hunting/Observer Prize exhibition, meanwhile, is at the Mall Galleries (until February 15, then on to Leicester in March). It is worth Pounds 20,000 to the winner, with minor prizes in addition, two of them reserved to students. I can say little about it critically, being, as one of the judges, parti pri, but I whole-heartedly support it, both in principal as an entirely open exhibition and as it stands. It is predominantly figurative, but not as a policy, for far too little abstract work was sent in. Similarly, surprisingly few students chose or were advised to send in, though what we got was very good and Ishbel Myerscough's double nude outstanding. The main prize went to Dick Lee for his painting of a wood-pile in a farmyard. Now in his 60s and retired from Camberwell, where he taught, he is the best painter of landscape now working in this country.</p>

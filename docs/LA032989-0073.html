			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Mayor James P. Moran said Alexandria, Va., will begin evicting suspected drug  dealers from public housing now that the city has become the first in the  country to be exempted from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's  grievance procedures. Moran said the city would pursue evictions in cases where  they have evidence of criminal activity either being committed or condoned by  the leaseholder. In a shoot-out at an Alexandria public housing development  last week, a police officer and a gunman, who had entered a building to demand  crack cocaine, were killed, and a second officer was wounded. Without the  exemption, HUD rules permit appeals for tenants threatened with evictions.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: 'CROCODILE' STAR SNAPS UP HOME  </P> <P> LINDA KOZLOWSKI, who co-starred with Paul Hogan in the "Crocodile Dundee"  movies, has purchased a house in the Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> Sellers were CRAIG NELSON, star of the new ABC-TV program "Coach," who also  played the father in the "Poltergeist" movies, and his wife, Doria. The Nelsons  had lived in the house for four years when they decided to move to Malibu.  </P> <P> Kozlowski paid the Nelsons about $725,000, and the Nelsons bought a 2-acre  estate for nearly its $1.5-million asking price.  </P> <P> Kozlowski's new house was described as "light and airy, with a lot of French  doors and windows, but very private." It is behind gates in the Sunset Plaza  area above the Sunset Strip. Built in 1957, it was updated recently and has  four bedrooms and a lagoon-like swimming pool with a black bottom and a spa.  </P> <P> Kozlowski apparently bought the house sight unseen, except in photos; she was  in Australia when her business manager negotiated the deal.  </P> <P> "She had seen the area enough to know that the house was a fabulous buy," said  Ronna Brand, the Beverly Hills real estate broker who represented the Nelsons  in their sale and purchase. She also represented them when they bought the  Sunset Plaza house.  </P> <P> The Nelsons bought in Malibu, "because Craig had visions of fairways when he  saw the property there. He is such a golf fanatic," she explained.  </P> <P> "And it is the perfect house for them, because ever since I've known Doria, she  has taught tai chi chuen (a Chinese system of meditation and self defense).  She's even producing a documentary (film) on it. The Malibu house was built for  the previous owners using feng shui, the Chinese technique for arranging a  floor plan."  </P> <P> British rock-star GEORGE MICHAEL'S new, three-bedroom home in Santa Barbara,  which is believed to be his first home in California, is modern with 5,669  square feet on 5 acres with a swimming pool and tennis court. He paid about $3  million for it and a half-acre next door, which he bought for added privacy.  </P> <P> Brooks Barton of Coldwell Banker was involved in that transaction as well as  the sale of 5,669 acres of Oregon timberland for another Brit -- SIR JAMES  GOLDSMITH, the corporate raider. Goldsmith sold the land to a Chicago  industrialist for an estimated $5 million. Southern California real estate  sources say Goldsmith has been looking for a house in the Los Angeles area for  some time.  </P> <P> Still up Santa Barbara way, the house of the late actor RONALD COLMAN, is back  on the market for $5.5 million, says Paul O'Keeffe of Gibb Realty, who has the  listing.  </P> <P> The 1941 country house was sold in 1987 to a psychologist and his wife, who  turned it into a Mediterranean villa. Investor Jon Sorrell, who sold the place  to the psychologist, designed and supervised construction, preserving Colman's  gated entrance to a driveway framed by olive trees.  </P> <P> The Montecito Inn, opened by CHARLIE CHAPLIN and ROSCOE (FATTY) ARBUCKLE in  1929, has been sold for $6.45 million.  </P> <P> New owners are De Wayne and Kathy Copus, a Montecito couple who have managed  the recently renovated 52-room hotel since last December.  </P> <P> "We sold three apartment complexes of theirs, and then they bought the Inn,"  said Jim Slaught, a commercial broker with the Beaver-Free realty firm, who  handled the sale. Jim Taylor, a developer of shopping centers all over  California, and Rob Barrett, owner of the Pineapple Beach Club in Antigua, were  the sellers.  </P> <P> Real-life designer GAIL CLARIDGE, who recently appeared on "Designing Women,"  is getting ready to air her own TV show, on a cable network. "It will be like  'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' but will focus entirely on decorating,  featuring celebrities' homes and interviews of other designers," she said from  her Northridge offices.  </P> <P> Claridge just sold her Tarzana estate, with a house she restored and named  "Cranberry Knoll," for $2.9 million, minus 2.2 acres. She subdivided the  3.5-acre property and now has the remaining parcel for sale at $1.7 million.  </P> <P> The buyer, a stockbroker, was represented by Chris Summer of Mike Glickman  Realty. Claridge was represented by Jim Pascuci of Merrill Lynch and Cecelia  Waeschle and Joyce Rey of Rodeo Realty.  </P> <P> QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Will director STEVEN SPIELBERG and his actress wife, AMY  IRVING, sell their remodeled and expanded Pacific Palisades dream house now  that they plan to get a divorce? "No, not that I'm aware of," Rob Friedman,  their spokesman, said after the divorce announcement last Tuesday.  </P> <P> The house, which is featured in the May issue of Architectural Digest, was  purchased by the Spielbergs in '85, but they didn't move into it until January,  1988, because of the extensive work, which included doubling its size -- to  20,000 square feet.  </P> <P> Among other famous former owners who also remodeled the house, built at the  turn of the century, were actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and singer Bobby Vinton.  Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton rented the house from Fairbanks, and David O.  Selznick purportedly lived there while producing "Gone With the Wind."  </P> <P> Talk about hot property -- If you think home prices are astronomical here, get  this: Beverly Hills realtor Stephen Shapiro returned the other day from  Australia, where he had gone for the opening of a Hard Rock Cafe, and he said,  "Little old houses on the beach in Sydney are going for (U.S.) $5 million to  $20 million each."  </P></p>

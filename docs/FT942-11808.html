			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Investment thrives on instability Sir, Barry Riley's concerns at the instability in markets created by US mutual funds flows ('American money brings new risks to markets', April 27) ignores real life and common sense. He reports that the financial economist Mr Henry Kaufman has 'worries' about this instability - I would suggest that Mr Kaufman is pointing at the dragon in the cave but ignoring the gold it is sitting on. In the words of the billionaire investor Warren Buffet in his latest annual report: 'True investors welcome volatility.' The risks of instability create opportunities for those prepared to take advantage of them - the forced buying or selling by mutual funds coping with customer money flows is confronted in the marketplace by those with the nous to anticipate and capitalise on it. I find Mr Kaufman's suggestion of a 60-90 day withdrawal notice period from mutual funds laughable. First, he wrongly assumes that mutual fund managers have no ability to anticipate redemptions and take appropriate action. Second, the market would move to discount the ending of a particularly choppy period by looking at fund flows - and could create the sort of volatility Mr Kaufman is seeking to diminish. Third, his concerns presuppose a 'correct' level of volatility to which the notice period would encourage reversion. I would love to see his suggestions as to what this level should be. Perhaps Mr Riley's next article should be to examine how much money investors could have made recently by actively taking advantage of market conditions, rather than sitting around fretting about them like Mr Kaufman.

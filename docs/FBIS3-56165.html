			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A significant number of the inhabitants of  Kutaisi [Georgia's second city] have remained without electric  power and water. Naturally, inhabitants of rayons in western  Georgia are unable to watch television. However, the situation  has become even more complex during the last four-five months.  Last night, for almost six hours, Kutaisi and its environs were  transformed, as they say, into a "dead" zone. Electricity was  cut, all work came to a halt, and telephone communications were  severed. In short, the city and its 300,000 inhabitants are  experiencing the most difficult conditions. There is, in  general, no natural gas; it is not possible to supply the  minimum amount of electric power; water is being supplied barely  once a week. [passage omitted]    In spite of the situation yesterday, all municipal police  employees are honorably fulfilling their duties. They are  displaying particular vigilance in such extreme conditions.    One can state that Kutaisi's No. 1 and No. 2 bakeries have  diesel generators on permanent standby and, as a result, the  city is being supplied with bread. Work has not stopped at the  bread mill.    In short, Kutaisi is in an extremely difficult situation.  [passage omitted]    Kutaisi has submitted a request to the Cabinet of Ministers  that it nevertheless be supplied with electric power according  to the schedule and that the city receive natural gas once a  week. It is impossible for such a big city to remain paralyzed  throughout the entire winter.</p>

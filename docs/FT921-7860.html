			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (11): In search of value  -Insurance PREMIUMS were increased during the past year in line with the predictions of brokers and insurers. Although the recession means that claims are down overall, claims costs per vehicle mile are still moving upwards. Several factors contribute to this trend, including rising repair costs for vehicle damage, rising court awards for personal injuries, higher value of equipment inside vehicles and increased incidence of theft and fire. Coming at a time of poor general underwriting results, these trends have forced insurers to impose premium increases of 25 per cent or more on some policyholders, though competition remains fierce for what John Pegnall, of Norwich Union, calls the 'blue chip' fleets with the best loss records. Most insurers report a substantial difference in claims experience between the good and bad risks. Premium levels for the good ones have been pegged more or less to the rate of inflation, but overall, according to Mr Pegnall, the market is less concerned about market share and more determined to charge realistic rates. Royal Insurance, the market leader, has taken a very hard line this year. After some years of unprofitable business in this sector, its stance has been that there is a correct premium for each risk, based on underwriting for a profit. As a result, Royal has lost a significant amount of business. The hardening of the insurance market has led, according to Chris Palmer of Zurich International (UK), to a switch in the debate from premium levels to value added and guaranteed service standards. Independent market research for Zurich suggests that fleet operators place service standards marginally ahead of price in their criteria for selecting insurance cover. The finance director of one haulage company described the claims handling service as 'absolutely vital'. When repairs take several days to be approved, the lost revenues from vehicles off the road far outweigh some of the premium discounts on offer from less efficient insurers. Larger insurers see their nationwide, and even international, spread of offices with authority to settle claims as a key element in what they have to offer. 'Cheapest is not necessarily best,' says Ray Morley, of Commercial Union. 'If I charge half as much as another company, but keep your vehicles off the road twice as long, that would be a very poor deal for you.' Nevertheless, insurers cannot afford to ignore the financial pressure that their customers are under. They are therefore looking for ways to help keep the costs down. Few are recommending a switch from comprehensive to third-party-only insurance, except for the largest fleet owners, who can afford to carry much larger risks on their balance sheets. For small fleets, third party cover would be very poor advice, according to Mr Morley. Instead, Commercial Union, like many of its competitors, is looking to risk management and larger excesses or deductibles, to control policyholders' costs. There has been a general trend to move from 100 to 250 excesses per claim, with excesses of 500 and more among larger fleets. Some companies require drivers to pay these excesses wherever a claim arises, to concentrate their minds, although one broker fears that this could lead to drivers not reporting all accidents. One of the UK's largest fleets, NFC, which self-insures its fleet of 12,000 vehicles under a government bond, last year doubled the deductibles it imposes on the individual companies in the group. These now stand at 5,000 third party and 10,000 damage, for heavy vehicles, and at 20,000 third party and 100 per cent self-insurance for damage, for cars. Graham Lee, of NFC, sees a clear message in this: 'The closer you can get the manager writing the cheque to the accident, the better your cost control.' On the risk management side, Mr Lee emphasises the need in a recession to keep vehicles in A1 condition, to keep claims costs down. With the weight of legislation, he feels that 'running a fleet of vehicles is getting like running a fleet of aircraft. Maintenance has to be 100 per cent; 99.9 per cent is not good enough.' Derick Perkins, of Fleet Management Services, points to another aspect of cost control, arguing that policyholders should watch out for insurers offering deflated prices for vehicles that are written off, and that many operators are still paying well over the odds for insured repairs. General Accident has increased its training grants for advanced driver training, extended the scheme indefinitely into the future and opened it to people not initially insuring through GA. Other insurers have put more emphasis on providing information to policyholders, seeing this as crucial to loss control. Dudley Brown, of brokers Alexander Stenhouse, argues that some of the fleets which carry only catastrophe level insurance are not properly measuring their losses. 'If you can't measure it, you can't manage it,' he says. Better use of databases can help operators to identify the causes of accidents and make informed judgments about the cost effectiveness of prevention measures, like controlling who is allowed to drive the vehicles in leisure periods, drivers' minimum ages and technologies such as anti-theft devices.</p>

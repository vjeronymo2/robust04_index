			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Holiday spending 'will top Pounds 17bn' SPENDING by Britons on holidays this year is expected to exceed Pounds 17bn, a report from research analysts Mintel International Group says. But the total number of holidays that will be taken will fall to an estimated 81.2m compared with 90.4m in 1988. The report says that nearly one in three adults did not take a holiday last year. The recession has caused more than two in five adults to have fewer holidays, a shorter or cheaper holiday or to cancel holiday plans.</p>

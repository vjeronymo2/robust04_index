			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> JUSTIFY SEIZING ASSETS OF NORIEGA, U.S. TOLD  </P> <P> A federal judge in Miami demanded that prosecutors in Manuel A. Noriega's drug  case justify their seizure of all his assets, saying failure to do so violates  the deposed Panamanian leader's constitutional rights. U.S. District Judge  William Hoeveler rejected the government's claim that the seizures, which  involved treaties with third countries, were not subject to judicial review.  "The government has not only placed defendant's assets out of his reach without  affording him any meaningful opportunity to be heard, but has indeed done so  without showing that the assets are tainted by illegal activity," the judge  wrote.  </P> <P> That violates Noriega's constitutional protections against illegal search and  seizure and effectively deprives him of his right to counsel, he said. Hoeveler  set a hearing for Wednesday on the matter.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign troops are starting to leave Rwanda.  [passage omitted]    This morning, fierce fighting started up again in Kigali,  the  capital. One of our special correspondents, Christophe  Boisbouvier, reports:    [Boisbouvier] The battalion of paratroopers commanded by  Major Tabakunze is still trying to resist the advance of the RPF  [Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces of Paul Kagame. But the RPF  vise is tightening round the town, and there is confirmation  now, at midday, that the rebel forces who have come from both  the north and south have managed to link up with the pocket that  had been holding out for six days; they are now attacking the  gendarmerie camp between the town and the airport.    This link-up has two consequences. First of all it has cut  the Rwandan Armed Forces in two, one part in the town and the  other at the airport, and then it has also cut the road between  the town and the airport used for the evacuation of foreigners.  Nevertheless, it appears that the last Belgian convoys going to  fetch the last foreign nationals in Kigali are able to get to  the airport without too many problems.    As for the French soldiers, they may all have left Rwanda  before the end of the day. After three years of more or less  active French military presence in Rwanda, a page is being  turned.</p>

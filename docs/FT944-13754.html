			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Bradford Property down 30% Bradford Property Trust, the UK's largest tenanted property company, reported a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.3m, against Pounds 17.5m, due to lower dealing profits. The company raised Pounds 8.7m from property sales in the six months to October 5, against Pounds 19.3m. Bradford specialises in buying residential properties let at low rents under regulated tenancies, usually at a discount to reflect the sitting rights of the tenant. When vacant possession is achieved, the properties are either sold or re-let at market rents. The company said that decisions to sell or re-let when properties became vacant were driven by the quality of properties available. This results in fluctuations in the level of dealing profits. Gross rental income increased from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 10.4m. Costs of sales, including repairs, refurbishment and the cost of properties sold were Pounds 6.38m (Pounds 10.7m). Interest charges dropped to Pounds 188,000 (Pounds 641,000). The interim dividend is increased by 10 per cent to 3.2p, payable from earnings of 5.75p (8.11p). Mr Philip Warner, chairman, said that quality residential investment properties were realising higher prices in the market than earlier in the year and that the company was accelerating its purchasing programme as a result. In common with most other property groups, Bradford does not revalue its portfolio at the half-year. At the full year it owned properties with a market value of Pounds 287m, some 60 per cent of which are in London.</p>

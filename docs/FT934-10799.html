			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (10): 'Upstart' airline has cause to celebrate - Profile: Emirates 'WHAT are they doing in Dubai?', a senior official at the Gulf Co-operation Council secretariat in Riyadh asked in October 1985, shortly after Emirates Airline had made its maiden flight to Bombay. The question was put with more than a hint of exasperation, and the inference was clear; that Dubai, through its upstart airline, was in some undefined way breaking ranks within the UAE - and by extension with its GCC partners - by injecting an unwanted element of competition among Gulf Arab states confronted with the Iran-Iraq war. After all, the misconception was widespread that it was the UAE as a whole, and not just Abu Dhabi, which was one of four shareholders in Gulf Air - then, as now, the main regional rival to Emirates. So what business did Dubai have in starting another airline - its own - when there were enough airlines to go around? Last month, the 'upstart' airline celebrated its eighth anniversary by implementing a marketing agreement with United Airlines, one of the three biggest US carriers, in a further move to expand its international network. This now directly spans 30 destinations in 24 countries. And far from undermining the GCC, Dubai's airline has brought more and new business into the region, and competitors have been forced to improve their own services to keep up. The marketing alliance with United, in effect a code-sharing agreement, means that the two airlines can use each other's flight identification code to book passengers in computer reservations systems. The logic of the arrangement is that Emirates' network, which has focused on the Middle East, the Indian sub-continent and Asia, can now dovetail with United's transatlantic and US domestic routes. To link with United, Emirates now has two daily flights to London's Heathrow, which replace a previous service to Gatwick. Emirates has never received subsidies from the Dubai government, which continues to insist on an open-skies policy and looks with equal favour on the 61 airlines which now fly into the emirate. The government does not regulate fares. Emirates' start-up capital was used to buy two second-hand Boeing 727s from Dubai's Air Wing. Emirates shares head office premises with Dubai National Air Travel Agency to which it pays a cross-charge for rental. 'That is all Emirates ever received in government investments or grants,' according to Mr Dermot Mannion, the airline's corporate treasurer. And Emirates gets no guarantees from the government when negotiating bank financing for new aircraft leases or acquisitions. In the western context of the distinction between the private sector and the public-state sector, Emirates is an anomaly, for it is simultaneously in both of these. In common with all seven emirates forming the UAE, as well as with other member countries of the GCC, the Dubai government is 'private', consisting of the ruling family and, lower down, its nominees and officials. In this sense Dubai Inc is a private company. At the same time it is very much the State. The airline is thus the private sector commercial extension of the government and its campaign to promote the emirate of Dubai, as part of the UAE, as the predominant regional business centre and transit point between Europe and Asia. Not for nothing is the airline's chairman, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Said Al Maktoum, a member of the ruling family, also chairman of Dubai's Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, an autonomous government agency, as well as president of Dubai's Department of Civil Aviation. But to finance the leasing of its fleet of 13 aircraft, the airline has had to rely on its own resources and return on capital. The fleet consists of eight Airbus A310-300s, and five A300-600Rs. The average age of aircraft in the fleet, including the two original 727s, is less than 3 1/2 years. The airline releases figures on a selective basis only to institutions involved in loan negotiations. But according to the journal Airline Business last April, Emirates, based on fleet size, a 1992 kilometre total of 5.52bn and a load factor of nearly 70 per cent, had 1992 revenues of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 450m. The airline has been profitable for six out of its seven full financial years, according to Mr Mannion. In the period April 1992 - April 1993 capacity increased 54 per cent and six new routes were added. All of its fleet of 13 Airbuses have been financed by commercial bank borrowings, including the first-ever Islamic lease - for one Airbus - arranged by Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Banking and Investment Corporation. To do this, Al Rajhi set up a special purpose company which owns the aircraft until the expiry of the lease, at which time Emirates has an option to buy the aircraft. Western commercial bank arrangements also allow for the banks to own the aircraft until the revenue is generated which pays off the loan plus the interest. There is, says Mr Mannion, a pool of liquidity available in Islamic banks. The only hurdle has been regional investors' reluctance to commit liquidity for as long as 10-15 years instead of the five to seven years they prefer. Al Rajhi is one of the institutions Emirates is approaching to finance the purchase of seven Boeing 777s which are on order and due for delivery starting in March 1996. The airline also has an option on a further seven 777s. Discussions have already started with Eximbank over airframe financing and with Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department over a Dollars 400m contract which Emirates signed last July for 35 Rolls-Royce Trent engines. After the heady expansion of its fleet and new routes since the beginning of last year, the airline could be looking for a period to build up its cash reserves in advance of the delivery of the 777s, and to continue to streamline some of its existing routes. For example, Rome, a recent addition as a stop-over point to Zurich, is now a stand-alone destination, drawing both tourists and businessmen to Dubai. On existing routes, flights to Hong Kong and Singapore now leave daily, while the frequency to Manchester has been increased. Emirates generates 40 per cent of total traffic movement through Dubai's international airport. Renovation and modernisation plans have been on the books since 1988 when Bechtel prepared the first studies. The Dubai government is considering, but has not yet decided, on the scale of the proposed redevelopment.</p>

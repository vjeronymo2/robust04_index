			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Slow start on bad debts: Japanese banking body buys up few loans THE JAPANESE banking body set up to clear the mounting pile of problem loans, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, bought only one loan last month, raising doubts about its ability to restore public confidence in banks and the property market. In the weeks before the fiscal year ended in March, banks pumped Y681.7bn (Pounds 4bn) in bad loans into the CPCC, which bought them at a generous 66 per cent of face value, enabling the banks to get the loans off their books and write off a relatively small loss. But in April, the CCPC bought only one Y100m non-performing loan from a second-tier regional bank, suggesting its main purpose was to enable banks to get their books in order for the close of the financial year. The CCPC bought the loan for Y80m, allowing the unidentified bank to record a loss of Y20m. Officially, the leading 21 banks had Y12,300bn in property-related problem loans in September and an estimated Y13,500bn at the end of March. However, that figure does not count affiliates' problem loans or those on which interest rates are cut to almost zero to support a collapsing company - a generally accepted unofficial estimate is Y30,000bn. Japanese banks' problems arise from their lending to property developers and their acceptance of overvalued property as collateral during the late 1980s. Increasing fears of a bank collapse prompted the industry to establish the CCPC, which values the property and other collateral and buys the loan credit. Under the CCPC's guidelines, banks wanting to sell loan credits have to provide the company with the necessary funds, and they remain responsible for selling the property, even though they have theoretically sold the collateral to the company. The real effect of the transaction is to allow the banks to take a write-off for tax purposes. It was also hoped that the company would help to put a floor under property prices through its valuations, but in the first three months of operation the CCPC has recovered only Y410m of the Y452.1bn in loan credits purchased. Only two properties held as collateral have been sold. CCPC officials yesterday said the rate of purchases should increase in coming months, and 100 loans were under review, but the slow pace of debt collection and banks' waning interest in the body have limited its effectiveness. A recovery in Tokyo stock prices and indications of increasing demand for some residential property have encouraged banks to resume property-related lending, which rose 6.3 per cent in February, compared to a year earlier, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. Japan's Finance Ministry has an informal rule that a warning should be issued to banks when property lending growth is more than 3 per higher than overall lending growth for two months, as was the case in January and February. But the ministry said 'there does not seem to be a need to issue warnings' at present. It is expected the leading banks will announce individual problem loan totals this month, showing that, officially, these range from 9 per cent of outstanding loans at one trust bank to under 2 per cent at the strongest commercial bank. Mr Paul Heaton of Smith New Court Japan said the official ratios would be far lower than the real burden, and the slow pace of loan purchasing at the CCPC suggested the banks would 'take a very long time' to shed bad loans.</p>

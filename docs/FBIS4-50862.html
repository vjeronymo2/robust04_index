			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Huang Kun-huei, chairman of the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC], Executive Yuan, pointed out yesterday [22 May]  that in order to conclude the tasks related to dealing with the  aftermath of the Qiandao Lake incident, Mainland China should  respond quickly to the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] proposal  made in early April for a special meeting between the SEF and  the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS].  Chairman Huang Kun-huei added that whether the two  nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the strait hold a  special meeting on safety in the near future is not directly  related to the convening of the second round of the Ku-Wang  meeting. However, if the special meeting cannot be held for a  long time, it will have an impact on arrangements for activities  related to the Ku-Wang meeting.    Chairman Huang Kun-huei made these remarks when answering  reporters' questions on whether MAC and SEF have started  coordinating and having contact to push forward the second round  of the Ku-Wang meeting. As for SEF chairman Ku Chen-fu and Vice  Chairman Chiao Jen-he advocating to push forward the second  Ku-Wang meeting based on the agreement on institutionalized  contacts and talks between the two organizations, Chairman Huang  Kun-huei said MAC and SEF have not yet discussed the issue.</p>

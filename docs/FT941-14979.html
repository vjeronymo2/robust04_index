			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Business groups welcome Bank's initiative Lobby groups broadly welcomed Mr Eddie George's call for banks and smaller businesses to work on improving their understanding of each other's needs. The Confederation of British Industry, which has 250,000 members, mostly small companies, said the Bank governor's study would raise the quality of debate on an issue which was of crucial importance to the economy. The CBI agreed with the Bank's assertion that smaller companies were far from blameless and needed to look beyond the traditional overdraft for long-term financing. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, which represents 21,000 smaller companies, said Mr George was acting like a 'super-ombudsman' for smaller businesses. 'The governor has changed the relationship between banks and their smaller business clients.' Mr Ian Peters, CBI deputy director for small companies, said surveys of CBI members showed banks were becoming more responsive to small businesses but had some way to go. 'The banks have concentrated too much on security-based lending and they have not based it sufficiently on future cashflow and business plans,' he said. But smaller businesses were too often comfortable using overdrafts as a source of long-term finance, and needed to be more willing to issue equity, and raise finance through factoring, leasing and term loans. The lobby groups said the government had already gone some way towards increasing the supply of equity to unquoted companies with the launch of the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Investment Trusts announced in the November Budget.</p>

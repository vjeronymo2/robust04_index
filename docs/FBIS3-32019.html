The Banking Association joined the strike by offering its  services only three days a week during this period, even though  they did not attend the meeting where the private sector  organizations decided to step into the political scene by  staging the strike.    "If we do not close now, for several days, they will impose  on us a definite shutdown. We must demonstrate that we are  decided on playing an important role in our country," one of the  strike's promoters declared. The strikers explained: "This is  not a political action, we only want to express our indignation  for the international community which has imposed on us an  unfair embargo."    The Industrialists Association that did not respond to the  first strike call continues to keep its distance. Nevertheless,  some of its members were present at an assembly that was held on  the first day of the strike, 28 January. The Association  leaders said they do not understand what this movement is  seeking, as according to them, no clear goal has been set. The  politicians in charge are asked to reach a settlement but the  strike's promoters do not indicate with whom that settlement  must be made.    The Chamber of Commerce as well as the great majority of  those who participate in the meetings, supported the coup d'etat  staged in 1991. Nevertheless, according to explanations given by  participants in the meeting that prepared the strike, some of  these have changed their position and currently they criticize  the Army, accusing it of being corrupt and incapable of  negotiating the Haitian political crisis.    The supermarket owners agreed today to open their stores  four  days a week while the pharmacies work normally. Hotels have  decided to "make the foreigners feel the weight of the embargo"  by closing down the bars and reducing electricity supply.    Meanwhile, the nation's five most important union  organizations have rejected the private sector strike. "They  have made a unilateral decision. The businessmen only want to  dodge their responsibilities with the workers," declared a union  leader.</p>

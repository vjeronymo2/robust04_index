			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mitsui abandons merger proposal The Mitsui Group, the oldest of Japan's keiretsu, or corporate families, has called off a proposed merger designed to expand its pharmaceuticals interests, an area where it feels underweight. Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, a unit of the group's main chemicals company, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, yesterday abandoned its merger with Toyama Chemical, a medium-sized pharmaceutical group, because of liabilities inherited by Toyama from a now defunct affiliate's failed property investments in the late 1980s. The three companies cited a court case against Toyama, in which Sanyo General Capital, a financial institution, is seeking Y5bn (Dollars 51m) compensation for loans to Yuho Chemical, the former Toyama affiliate. The collapse of the merger highlights how far corporate Japan still remains from clearing the damage left by the investment excesses of the so-called 'bubble era' preceding the recession. Toyama has also been a victim of a growing trend among Japanese companies to take court action to settle disputes, rather than resolving rows in private. The merger plan, announced in April 1993, was heralded by the Mitsui Group as an opportunity to build a pharmaceutical arm to rival those of the Mitsubishi or Sumitomo keiretsu. Until yesterday, Mitsui appeared ready to take on Toyama's legal problems, so that it could pursue its pharmaceuticals strategy. Japan's pharmaceuticals industry is ripe for mergers and takeovers because the government is cutting prices on medicines covered by national insurance in a deliberate attempt to put pressure on companies to restructure. The pharmaceutical companies announced a delay last October when it emerged that Toyama was facing legal action over Yuho Chemical, which went bankrupt four years ago with debts of Y40bn. Like many Japanese industrial companies, Yuho was tempted to diversify from its main business into property development during the boom in asset prices in the late 1980s. The merger partners were hoping by the end of this month to agree fresh conditions for the accord, originally planned as a share exchange to be followed by the creation of an equally-owned company controlled by Mitsui Pharmaceuticals. However, by yesterday they were forced to conclude that a deal was unworkable.</p>

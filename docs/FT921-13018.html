			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Observer: Guru glut It seems only yesterday that young Treasury economists were regularly deserting to the City, doubling their salaries as they went. But now I hear that Donald Franklin, Schroders' chief economist, has voluntarily moved the other way to become a mere Treasury indian, or economic adviser, salary range Pounds 24-37K. Why? Boredom, he says; after nine years of churning out forecasts (a Nintendo-like activity these days) he hungers for the red meat of policy. Well, maybe; but real-life markets take little notice of economic forecasts these days. As David Morrison of Goldman Sachs sourly remarked this week: 'It seems like an inefficient use of time to try to assess 'economic pressures'.' Perhaps soon redundant, too.</p>

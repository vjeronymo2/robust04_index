			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament President Marut Bunnak's bid to defuse  political tension yesterday foundered when his proposal to set  up a 21-man "Committee for Democratic Reform" was rejected by  hunger striker Chalat Worachat.    Immediately after Mr Marut's unsuccessful attempt, the  democracy alliance announced it would call another major rally  in front of Parliament on Wednesday to push lawmakers to endorse  a Phalang Tham MPs' motion calling for a special House panel to  redraft the Constitution as demanded by Mr Chalat.    The hunger striker rejected Mr Marut's proposal, saying it  was not entirely related to his demand for the setting up of a  House committee to draft a new constitution.    Claiming the Democrats' sudden about-turn on their previous  plan to support a motion to form the House constitution  redrafting committee was the cause of new tension, the  Organisation of Political Reform [OPR] said:    "The Government must take responsibility for the problem and  the crisis that may follow. The OPR hopes no untoward incidents  will take place."    The democracy alliance, formed on June 2 at Thammasat  University and comprising members from democracy groups,  academics and elements of some coalition parties, met yesterday  to discuss the latest developments.    Dr San Hatthirat, a prominent OPR member, claimed the  planned  rally was not aimed at applying pressure on the lawmakers and  Parliament but stemmed more from the group's concern for Chalat.    The OPR has scheduled a major meeting at Thammasat  University  on Sunday to ask members for its support for the rally on  Wednesday. All MPs will be invited to attend.    "We are confident a large number will turn up because we are  concerned about Chalat's life," Dr San said.    The OPR urged Mr Marut put before the House a motion  sponsored by 21 Phalang Tham members which was included on last  Wednesday's House agenda for immediate deliberation.    The MPs submitted a motion calling for the formation of a  special committee to redraft the constitution in defiance of the  party's resolution after the Phalang Tham leadership joined the  Democrats in reversing its previous stand to support the motion.    The OPR called for all Lower House members to support the  MPs' motion.    Mr Chalat, who begins his 17th day of fasting today, said Mr  Marut's proposal was irrelevant to his call for setting up of  the extra House panel to pave way for a truly democratic charter.    It was high time the Democrats pushed for the setting up of  the panel since it had all the power necessary to get such  things done, he said.    The House Speaker and prime minister are Democrats.    Mr Marut visited Mr Chalat at the hunger striker's caged  shelter outside Parliament and told him he had set up the  Committee for Democratic Development which would include  renowned physician Prawet Wasi, deans of political science and  law faculties of Chulalongkon, Thammasat, Ramkhamhaeng and  Sukhothai Thammathirat universities and representatives of all  10 political parties.    Dr Prawet and Mr Chalat apparently shared the ideal of a  more  democratic rule and the nomination of the physician was expected  to satisfy the hunger striker, according to the Speaker.    The committee, the chairman of which will be appointed by  its  members, has the duty to compile and study all aspects of the  Constitution and to lay the groundwork for developing a  monarchical democracy, according to Mr Marut.    Mr Chalat and Mr Marut exchanged views for about 15 minutes  before Mr Marut crossed back to Parliament and said Mr Chalat  needed a little more time to think.    Mr Marut said he had not consulted any Government leaders  about his new committee. A House committee scrutinizing the  charter would amend Article 211 to allow major changes by the  new committee.    Mr Marut said the committee he had set up and that demanded  by the hunger striker could be the same as Mr Chalat's call for  a new, more democratic charter would be considered by his  committee.    "Mr Chalat did not accept the committee (for Democratic  Development) at the moment because he's such a resolute man who  will not change his mind easily. He needs a little more time to  think it over. If Mr Chalat consults other people about this new  committee I've set up, he will change his mind."    Mr Marut said his committee would not only improve the  content of the charter but also pave way for election of  provincial governors and correct all various laws.    Mr Chalat said the Democrats' ideology was to create greater  democracy.    "The Democrats have the ideals of opposing all kinds of  dictatorship and of strengthening and developing democratic  rule. This is the only chance for the Democrats to do it. Only  the democrats have displayed this ideology and have fought  dictatorships"    But he said he was feeling desperate about the Democrats and  other politicians.</p>

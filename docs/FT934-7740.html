			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (17): Unthinkable achieved - Stock market structure 'YES, the PAC needs some good investment advice,' said a senior cadre of the most militant grouping involved in South Africa's multi-party democracy process as he shook hands with a broker last week in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) building. The meeting, unthinkable three years ago, may suggest to some that the Pan Africanist Congress is mellowing. It could also be read merely as a sign of how politicised everything in South African commerce has become. Arguably it always was: investors prospered under apartheid and a claim by the JSE, in a booklet aimed at blacks, that its record is 'one hundred years of creating wealth for all South Africans' will be found by many to be tendentious. But stockbroking firms, in a business as divorced as is conceivable from the daily realities of most people, now eagerly court all the main black movements in the hope that they will be smiled on after next April. The very structure and operation of the JSE threatens to develop into a political issue. Indeed, if it does, this will at least in part have been at the instigation of the exchange itself, which set up a sub-committee 18 months ago to examine its workings 'on the basis that South Africa is going through changes,' says Mr Roy Andersen, JSE president. The sub-committee was charged with examining the market's old-style system of individually liable brokers, trading on fixed commissions and only on their clients' behalf rather than also on their own account. Its report is in its final stages and due in February. Most local brokers think Johannesburg will not have a Big Bang - but there may be a 'phased phut' in which many of the market's traditional practices will be overturned and new entrants allowed in. The problem for an administration headed by the African National Congress will be that most of these would-be entrants are the country's big banking groups, which have extensive equity links in industry and other financial sectors. Should a transitional government sanction a further concentration of economic power, which leading ANC members have long wished to diffuse, or should it give its blessing to what others will call a cosy club of vested interests? There are further questions. If banks, brokers, insurers and industrial companies are allowed all to come under one corporate roof, in a small financial community what prospect is there that Chinese walls will be impermeable? And if black workers are to be given a stake in their employment future, say through share option schemes as a means of promoting productivity gains, how will it look if dealing costs for small investors suddenly rise relative to those of the big financial houses? Though Mr Andersen is coy about the contents of the report, leading stockbrokers think some sort of change is inevitable. The best guesses circulating in broking firms' offices above the Diagonal Street trading floor are that the JSE will at least initially remain an agency market but that a sliding scale will replace the 0.5 per cent standard commission - becoming freely negotiable for trades over a certain size  - and that firms will be able to sell a stake of perhaps 30 per cent to a corporate shareholder. Suggestions that the banks, if dissatisfied with the pace of change, might set up a screen-based dealing system for the biggest and most liquid stocks are largely discounted on regulatory grounds. But it is a stick which has at least been waved in the distance, and the JSE is believed ready to open up a gap or two in the laager of its trading floor to ease pressure. Changes are likely to come gradually, starting next year, and the mood will not be one of the Eighties London bonanza. Although a large number of the 50-odd brokers will sell out to banks, the lesson has been learned from the fancy price/earnings ratios paid to City firms before the 1987 crash, says a partner in one Johannesburg securities house. He adds: 'Those with the means or the products can survive' - as independent entities if they wish. This also appears to be the wish of many of the country's fund managers. They are by no means convinced that, in a thinly traded equity market, commissions on buying good lines of stock would fall - even for them. At the same time, they are concerned that any squeeze on brokers' margins might force JSE member firms to cut research output which they commonly use in tandem with in-house analysis. And they see their choice of broker potentially narrowed because some would have tied up with a rival financial institution. 'We want quality of service - in dealing skills and research input - and we are more inclined to accept higher commissions to get it,' says one. Whatever the outcome, as free elections approach and the country's reconstruction needs are thrown more to the fore, black political groups are setting aside their old hostility to the exchange as an institution. While they are likely to have much to say in the coming year about how the JSE should conduct itself to the benefit of all South Africans, even the PAC's slogan seems to be changing slowly from the notorious 'One settler, one bullet' to something which may be more like 'One settlement, one bull market'.</p>

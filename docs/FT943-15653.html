			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Fans are opening their wallets The World Cup is generating heavy extra tourist spending in the nine cities where matches are played, according to business leaders. A spokeswoman for the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau said: 'The games (and opening ceremonies) were worth more advertising dollars than we could ever pay.' In Boston, organisers are confident that the World Cup will generate Dollars 255m worth of extra retail spending. In Orlando, retailers were 'very, very happy,' said a spokesman. Stadiums have been sold out for virtually all games, with ticket sales especially strong in Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington and New York. In Dallas, tomorrow's quarter-final between Brazil and Holland is a sell-out, with scalpers asking Dollars 175 to Dollars 250 for Dollars 55 tickets. Not everyone is happy. Hotels in some World Cup cities were left with empty rooms when organisers over-projected sales. In San Francisco, John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, said hotel bookings were well below those expected. Orlando hotels near the city's theme parks reported a slight slow-down last month, apparently caused by people waiting for the soccer crowds to leave. 'We've all been a little nervous about the domestic market backing off,' said Phil Wright, president of the Central Florida Hotel and Motel Association.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Parliament's agenda Ready itself to help shape new European Commission MEPs have won the right to be consulted over the appointment of the new Commission president. Parliament must also approve the make-up of the 1995 Commission before it can take office. MEPs are seeking to hold confirmation hearings for proposed commissioners. Intensify involvement in EU law-making Already, 2,000 parliamentary amendments, mostly to Single Market law, have been passed, and MEPs now have co-decision rights with the EU Council of Ministers in many policy areas. These include services, education, culture, health, multi-annual R&amp;D and environment programmes, consumer protection, and workers' freedom of movement. Co-decision means parliament can veto most measures passed by qualified majority voting in the Council; a conciliation committee has been set up to find compromises with the Council on contentious issues. Increase the transparency of MEPs' links to business With Parliament's growing power in important policy areas, the need increases for greater disclosure of members' private involvement in commerce and industry. Press its case to achieve more legislative power Parliament will step up its campaign during preparations for the 1996 Maastricht review, in which pressure will emerge, especially from Germany, for an increase in MEPs' supervisory and legislative roles. Prepare the campaign to win more budgetary control Parliament is able to reject the EU budget and ask for it to be revised. MEPs are seeking more involvement on the revenue side, where it currently has no decision-making power. Pool forces to reduce the secrecy surrounding Council and Commission decisions</p>

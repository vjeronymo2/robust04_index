			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Redland It is hard to fault Redland's long-term strategy in the light of yesterday's 11 per cent decline in interim earnings per share. The merger benefits from Steetley so far are greater than anticipated at the time of the bid, even if the results from France will be disappointing this year. Redland stands out from some of its more pussy-footing peers in the way it is tackling overcapacity in UK building materials. While one can quibble with the way it has chosen to revalue certain Steetley assets, the balance sheet is solid and well structured. As with Blue Circle, however, the market is obsessed by Redland's dividend. Yesterday's 19p fall in the shares to 343p was prompted by new fears that the 1993 payout will be cut. It certainly looks touch-and-go on current assumptions as to whether a maintained dividend will be fully covered, but so much depends on the resilience of Germany and the outlook for the UK when the decision is taken in March 1994. That is an awfully long way off. If the dividend is then maintained, the 9.7 per cent yield makes the shares an attractive bet, not least because of the gearing impact of any UK recovery. Redland's ACT position will ensure that any profit increase flows quickly through to the bottom line.</p>

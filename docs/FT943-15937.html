			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Baby Bells open legal campaign Four of America's 'Baby Bell' local telephone companies yesterday launched a legal battle aimed at freeing them from a 10-year ban on competing in the long-distance telecommunications market and from manufacturing telecommunications equipment. The campaign ran into strong opposition from consumer groups and long-distance telephone companies, arguing that the ban should not be lifted because the Baby Bells remained local monopolies. Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex and Southwestern Bell filed a motion asking Judge Harold Greene of the federal district court in Washington, DC, to give up the powers he wields over the seven Baby Bells under the Modified Final Judgement This is the legal settlement of an anti-trust case which led in 1984 to the spin-off of the Baby Bells from AT&amp;T, which was left with its long-distance operations and equipment manufacturing. Because of their local monopolies, the Baby Bells were banned from these markets. The Bells said changed telecommunications market conditions made the MFJ contrary to the public interest. They produced evidence from 47 prominent economists who argued that lifting the judgment would increase price competition in the long-distance market and promote the invention of better telecommunications equipment. They also claimed that they faced local competition from other telecommunications companies. However, opponents of the Bells' entry into the long-distance market pointed out that they still account for some 98 per cent of telecommunications traffic in their local regions. The Bells said the court case was a parallel initiative to their push for favourable congressional legislation.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BICC buys east German cables maker for Pounds 22m BICC, the cables and construction group, is buying one of the leading cable businesses in what used to be East Germany for DM63m (Pounds 22m). KWO, which has four factories in the Berlin area, is being bought from the Treuhand, the government agency responsible for privatising former state-owned concerns. It makes power cables and metallic and optical telephone cables. Last year KWO had turnover of DM310m and it lost DM32m pre-tax. That excluded 'excess employee costs' of DM70m, which BICC said it was not assuming. BICC has agreed to a DM80m investment programme over the next two years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Central Bank Governor Yaman Toruner in Ankara </F> on 11 April 1994 -- recorded]    [Text] The Extended Administrative Council of the Turkish  Union of Banks, the Central Bank, and the Treasury and Foreign  Trade Undersecretariat held a meeting yesterday, 10 April 1994.  At the meeting, they stressed that they share the view that the  economic stability program is the guarantee of the future of  Turkey's economy.    They also determined that there is no liquidity problem in  terms of either the Turkish lira or foreign exchange in the  Turkish banking system. They decided to make the system  liquidity permanent by means of measures to be determined by the  Turkish Union of Banks and the Central Bank and to be carried  out by all the banks that are members of the union.    The participants at the meeting agreed that publishing the  recent speculative and unfounded reports in connection with  certain banks is, to say the least, immoral. They stressed that  both the Treasury and Foreign Trade Undersecretariat and the  banks concerned will take legal action in connection with these  reports.</p>

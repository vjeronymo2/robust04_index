			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> An Associated Press report published Sunday incompletely described the verdict  in the court-martial of Marine 1st Lt. Allen Lawson. He was convicted of  dereliction of duty, of appearing drunk and of disobeying an order. The charges  stemmed from the death of Lance Cpl. Jason Rother, who had been left behind in  the Mojave Desert during a training exercise.  </P></p>

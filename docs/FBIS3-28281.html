[Takemura] Politicians, as well as political parties, will  make a new start with a feeling of uncertainty. If they fail to  take a careful look at a new political system and discuss ways  to embrace the new political system, they will place their  interests ahead of the new political system, leaving the system  distorted.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will the political parties lead  future elections?    [Takemura] Contesting among candidates from the same party  in  single-seat constituencies will disappear. Although the  conservative-reformist structure will disappear, there will be a  situation wherein conservative candidates with their different  party affiliation fight each other in elections. Their fight in  elections will create a complex situation. In future elections  in which party affiliation and party platform are regarded as  important factors, only one candidate will be chosen in a  single-seat constituency and voters will be given more room than  now to study "their choice" in elections. I believe it is  highly possible that personal ties, acquaintances, and the  conventional support groups will remain intact.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is talk that ruling coalition  parties will field unified candidates in future elections and a  new party will be formed. How would you respond to this  prospect?    [Takemura] I do not know. Frankly speaking, what I am  vaguely assuming is that in principle, there should be moves  toward a realignment of the established political parties,  including the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. In the  course of realigning the established political parties, we need  to closely watch how they would split in the future. They might  split into two, three, or four parties or groups.    It is a principle that the established political parties  should be realigned not by an agreement reached between party  leaders and party interests, but by party platforms, policies,  and ideologies. I think that in elections, voters will choose  their candidates taking into account how the parties are run and  how the parties handle personnel affairs and money. If parties  with different policy platforms merge, their merger would run  into contradiction.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Then, will it not be possible for  Shinseito [the Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito to merge?    [Takemura] The two parties have shared each other's  hardships for half a year and they now feel friendly toward each  other. They aim for reform and share many aspects unlike other  parties that are complacent about the old political system.  Nonetheless, they have many different aspects because of the  history of their growth.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Will the political parties start  their second realignment when the demarcation of single-seat  constituencies is completed?    [Takemura] Yes, they will move toward realignment at that  time. The political parties will make brisk moves toward  realignment after this summer when the Diet passes a bill on the  demarcation. Although Sakigake is in a position to shore up the  Hosokawa government, if it fails to keep pace with moves that  other parties make in response to a new electoral system, it  would face a contradiction. Any discord within the ruling  coalition parties would weaken the coalition government's  foundation and there are very difficult aspects.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Prime minister special assistant  Tanaka has resigned. Did the prime minister dismiss him?    [Takemura] The prime minister did not dismiss him at all. I  have heard some people say Mr. Tanaka has fled from the prime  minister, but Mr. Hosokawa absolutely did not dismiss him. At  the same time, Mr. Tanaka has not fled from the prime minister.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do the prime minister and you have  any disagreement over merging Sakigake and the New Japan Party?    [Takemura] I believe that there is no change in our feelings  toward merging the two parties. As for the question of how and  when the two parties should be merged, its interpretation has  been varied by us. I and the prime minister have decided to  merge our two parties and announced our decision. Our two  parties have played an active part in the Diet as a unified  group for half a year. Our understanding is that conditions  have been created everyday wherein the two parties can be  merged. We intend to merge our parties without failing to seize  a good opportunity.    [Takemura] It has been reported that you have been feuding  with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa.    [Takemura] There has been no feud between us at all. I have  never publicly criticized Mr. Ozawa or spoken against him. The  differences between our blueprints for Japan's future and in our  ways of getting things done have prompted such a report. It is  all my fault.    (NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP] has managed to avoid another split. What do you  think of moves by a reformist group led by LDP Deputy Secretary  General Masayasu Kitakawa?    [Takemura] Our Parliamentary Dormitory rooms are next door  to each other and, in the past, we belonged to the same LDP  faction. Mr. Kitakawa is a politician I know very well. I  believe that we have maintained a good private and official  relationship. I hope that as a reformist, he will play an  active part in the LDP.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not hope that he will break  away from the LDP?    [Takemura] I think that he will probably do so some time in  the future. I think that he is one of my most credible  colleagues.</p>

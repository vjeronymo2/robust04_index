			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Generators back nuclear sell-off The privatisation of the nuclear power industry yesterday received qualified support from rival electricity generators as the consultation period for the government's nuclear review closed. The Association of Independent Electricity Producers, which includes former state-owned generators National Power and PowerGen, urged the government to 'make every effort' to privatise the nuclear power industry. However, it said nuclear power should be given 'no special advantage over other privately owned generating businesses'. National Power and PowerGen have not published their submissions but it is understood they are sympathetic to privatisation. However they are thought to have said that privatisation of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear would only be acceptable if 'subsidies', including the fossil fuel levy, were phased out. The Pounds 1bn a year levy is scheduled to last until 1998. The producers' association said the government 'must make quite clear that investment in any new nuclear power stations should be on a full commercial basis with investors judging the need for capacity'. It pointed out that Nuclear Electric's own submission 'makes it quite clear that electricity from new nuclear stations would not be competitive in today's market'. It adds: 'Intervention in the electricity generation market to protect the interests of one technology may damage the interest of those who have to compete with that technology.' That could damage the interests of the electricity consumers. The association also questions the electricity industry's grid code which treats nuclear plants as inflexible. The code 'means that when it is necessary for stations to be turned off for grid management purposes, nuclear stations are turned off last'. Although the submission says this may have been appropriate before electricity privatisation, its justification in the new market place should be re-examined. The association argues that uncertainty about the bill for existing nuclear liabilities has made the nuclear debate more complicated than it should have been. It says the government should clarify what the fossil fuel levy was intended for.</p>

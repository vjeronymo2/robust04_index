The Turkmenistan Assembly, without procrastination, ratified  the recent agreements with Moscow on mutual guarding of the  border, the status of Russian servicemen, migration and defense  of migrants' rights, and dual citizenship. President Saparmurat  Niyazov stressed that the institution of dual citizenship cannot  be considered a concession to the 400,000 Russians living in the  republic alone. The agreement is also extremely beneficial to  Russia's 700,000 Turkmens.    There were around 40 questions on the Tajik parliament's  agenda. Premier A. Abdulladzhanov resigned. Political circles  in the republic think that the head of government has resigned  under pressure from the incontrovertible evidence of corruption  among and embezzlement of public funds by his entourage. The  new premier is 44-year old Abduzhalil Samatov, the former vice  premier. He is known as an experienced contemporary economist  and the successful head of a commercial firm.    Head of state I. Rakhmonov's speech at the session was the  crucial one. He admitted that the Pamir economy is on the verge  of catastrophe. Civil war has cost the republic too dear. Over  400 enterprises have been looted and destroyed and whole sectors  paralyzed. Around 300 major plants, factories, sovkhozes, and  kolkhozes are on the brink of bankruptcy.    The present Uzbekistan Supreme Council has probably met for  its last session. By unanimously adopting the law on elections  to the new legislative organ -- the oliy madzhlis -- the  parliamentarians signed their own sentence.    President Islam Karimov addressed the session and  regrettably  once again returned to the idea that Russians living in the  republic cannot be granted dual citizenship owing to their  possibly interfering in internal affairs and the danger of  "lessening the patriotic spirit."</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Degussa trims board at end of restructuring Degussa, the Frankfurt-based metals and chemicals group, is to round off its two-year restructuring and decentralisation programme by thinning top management. The board is to be reduced from eight to six members, and the responsibilities of two second-tier executives are to be taken over by the main board. Mr Henning Bode, 53, and Mr Alexander Mentz, 49, will leave the board at the end of the current financial year in September. Mr Bode's responsibilities for technical matters, including quality and engineering, will in future be spread around the group's operating divisions. The responsibility for base metals, formerly Mr Mentz's job, will be taken on by Mr Gunter Wohlenberg, the main board member already in charge of precious metals. Degussa's interests in non-precious metals will be considerably reduced on completion of the sale, agreed last year, of its Leybold subsidiary to Oerlikon-Buehrle of Switzerland. A company spokesman could not say whether the departing directors would remain with the company. Other changes include the main board assuming control over the industry and speciality chemicals division and the inorganic chemicals business currently headed by Mr Fritz Hahn and Mr Heinrich Wolf, both 60, and who will retire at the end of the financial year. The Degussa management, which yesterday announced an unchanged dividend of DM7 for 1992-1993, has been widely praised for the efficiency and speed of its rationalisation plans.</p>

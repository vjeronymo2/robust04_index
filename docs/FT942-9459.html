			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / People: Saenz poaches from BBV After its takeover two weeks ago by Banco Santander, wits said that Banco Espanol de Credito, Banesto, should more properly be called Banco Santanderino de Credito and known as Bansanto, writes Tom Burns. But perhaps it ought to be identified as Banco Vizcaino de Credito, Banvito; and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, the bank that was outbid in the auction, should simply be referred to as Banco Bilbao. The key to all the playing with name-tags is Alfredo Saenz, 52, chairman of Banesto, former vice-president of BBV and former heir apparent to Banco Vizcaya before the latter merged with Banco Bilbao in 1988. Saenz, an acknowledged troubleshooter in the domestic banking business, was 'lent' by BBV to rescue Banesto after the Bank of Spain's intervention at the end of last year. Santander duly scooped Banesto and immediately asked Saenz to run its prize. Saenz not only accepted the offer but also persuaded eight colleagues to leave BBV and join him on Banesto's management board. To a man, the Saenz-picked team has an emphatical Vizcaya pedigree. The most senior defector, after Saenz, is Banesto's new managing director, Victor Manuel Menendez Millan, 53. He was Vizcaya's treasurer at the time of the merger with Bilbao and went on to be a member of BBV's management board with responsibility for information systems. The Saenz-inspired stampede of Vizcaya managers into Banesto is likely finally to pare BBV down to its Bilbao bone. Three years ago Francisco Luzon, once Saenz's rival first at Vizcaya and then at BBV, became chairman of Argentaria, and has since lured some 70 one-time Vizcaya employees away from BBV to the state-controlled bank.</p>

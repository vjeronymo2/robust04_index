In 1993 Qinghai comprehensively implemented macrocontrol and  regulatory policies, and as a result it made progress in  production and construction. Last year the GNP amounted to more  than 10 billion yuan, an increase of 10.5 percent over the  previous year. Industrial production showed signs of speedy  growth and there was a change for the better in output value and  economic results. Heavy industry grew at a double-digit rate  and thus stimulated the development of other industries. Large  and medium-sized industrial enterprises still occupied an  important position in the province's industrial economy and  their output value accounted for 66.1 percent of the province's  gross industrial output value.    Last year the province continued to see improvement in the  position of agriculture as the foundation. Agricultural  development and construction yielded results. According to  statistics, last year the total output of grain and oil-bearing  crops broke previous records. It was the seventh consecutive  year of increase in grain production and the 10th consecutive  year of increase in oil-bearing crops production. The scale of  fixed assets expanded, the increase in productive investment was  faster than that in nonproductive investment, and investment in  tertiary industries grew. A number of key projects including  the Qinghai oil field fulfilled or overfulfilled the annual  investment plan.    Last year transportation improved, postal and  telecommunications service grew, market sales remained stable,  local revenues increased, the monetary and credit field saw  improvement in controlling willful loan releases and arbitrary  spending, and bank deposits continued to grow, thus ensuring  funding for key economic construction projects.</p>

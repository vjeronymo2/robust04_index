			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRIME, TRAFFIC FEARS CITED AT HEARING ON SPORTS ARENA  </P> <P> A handful of neighbors in the area of the proposed Santa Ana indoor sports  arena said Monday that the 20,000-seat facility will cause traffic, crime and  other nuisances.  </P> <P> "Santa Ana needs an arena like it needs a hole in the head," said Shirley  Gates, who owns property in the area.  </P> <P> Gates was one of four people who spoke against the proposed arena at a public  hearing Monday night before the Santa Ana Planning Commission. Gates and her  husband, Niles, who manages several industrial buildings near the Edinger  Avenue and Lyon Street intersection where the arena is proposed, said rock  concerts at the facility will chase away local businesses.  </P> <P> Other business owners also said the arena would increase traffic and attract  unsavory characters to the largely industrial area.  </P> <P> The environmental report prepared for the arena's private developers, Spectacor  Management Group and MCA Entertainment, projected that Santa Ana's arena would  create significant traffic congestion when events begin or end during rush  hour. But the $75-million facility will provide 244 more jobs and "visually  attractive" new buildings, the report said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana and Anaheim each hope that building an arena will lure a professional  basketball or hockey franchise.  </P> <P> Although the National Basketball Assn. has no plans for expansion in the near  future, the National Hockey League's board of governors decided last weekend to  add up to seven franchises by the end of the century and three teams by the  1992-93 season.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana arena is projected to open in August or September, 1992.  Construction is scheduled to begin on June 1, 1990, on 17 vacant acres at the  southeast corner of Edinger and Lyon.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Anaheim officials estimate that ground can be broken for their own  20,000-seat, $85-million arena in January and construction completed by fall of  1991. It is to be built on land purchased by the city next to a mobile home  park on Douglass Road, north of Katella Avenue.  </P> <P> But the environmental report for the Anaheim arena has drawn criticism for  downplaying traffic, noise and pollution effects of that city's arena.  </P> <P> Residents opposed to noise and traffic were instrumental in defeating previous  proposals for sports arenas in Santa Ana and Anaheim.  </P> <P> Jack Stanaland, president of Campanula Properties, owner of the Orangetree  Mobile Home Park on Douglass Road, northwest of the stadium, criticized the  Anaheim report and said he is prepared to go to court to challenge the  document.  </P> <P> He said the city rushed the report in order to begin construction before the  Santa Ana arena.  </P> <P> California Angels Executive Vice President Michael Schreter also maintains that  Anaheim's environmental report does not adequately consider increased traffic  that will occur when events are held simultaneously at the stadium and arena.  </P> <P> "The traffic in the vicinity of that intersection (Katella and Douglass) and  backing up onto the 57 (Orange) Freeway, will be terrible, if not gridlocked,"  Schreter said. "We are concerned . . . for the safety and convenience of our  fans."  </P> <P> The Anaheim City Council is scheduled to consider approval of the report  Friday. The report must be approved before construction can begin.  </P></p>

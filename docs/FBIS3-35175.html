Also stating in his report  that Pakistan has not abandoned its nuclear program, the U.S.  President has suggested that if Pakistan and the PRC consent to  prevent the proliferation of nuclear arms, talks will be held  with them, and the sanctions imposed on them will also be  lifted. As is reflected in the contents of the report, the U.S.  President has leveled allegations against Pakistan and India on  the manufacture of nuclear weapons but has overtly exempted  India from committing itself to nuclear nonproliferation and has  maintained pressure on Pakistan. This indicates that the United  States is openly biased on the India-Pakistan matter. Our  politicians and policy makers should take note of this, and  while formulating future policies, they should bear in mind that  we need not look to any side or take orders on our national  affairs; we should adopt a clear stand on them. Despite our  repeated assurances, knowing all this full well, the only  superpower has rejected our legitimate and clear stand.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Open science Mr David Hunt, who makes his first public appearance as science minister at the British Association meeting in Loughborough today, could do one thing to please all sections of his new constituency without committing the cabinet to an extra penny of public spending. He should announce an initiative to open up to public scrutiny the scientific committees that advise the government on a vast range of subjects, from genetic engineering to nuclear waste. At present all meet in private. In future, their meetings should normally be held in public, with appropriate arrangements to protect commercially confidential information. Such a move would be overwhelmingly popular with all sections of scientific opinion. The advocates of open scientific advice include not only academic researchers and environmental and consumer groups but also the biotechnology industry. Companies complain that the present system gives the false impression that they have something to hide. Instead of the slow and secretive British system, the industry would prefer a quick public assessment of applications to carry out genetic engineering experiments, along US lines. A model is the US Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. The first meeting of the Rac, as it is known, attracted 150 journalists in 1990; now a handful of reporters and other outside observers monitors its deliberations. Mr Hunt could make a modest start with a co-ordinated effort to open up the expert committees advising on biotechnology, such as the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, Advisory Committee on Releases into the Environment, and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee. But there is no reason to stop there. All committees giving independent scientific advice to the government, outside the specific field of defence and national security, should meet in public, as their US counterparts do under the government in the Sunshine Act. Meanwhile, the policymaking committees of ministers and civil servants would, of course, remain closed as at present. The opening-up process should also extend to advisory committees on the civil nuclear industry, where the history of secrecy has left a legacy of public distrust which the young biotechnology industry rightly sees as an awful warning. As in the US, arrangements can be made to protect genuinely sensitive information without shrouding the whole procedure in secrecy. The scientific community was sad to lose Mr William Waldegrave, the most popular science minister for many years, to agriculture in the July cabinet reshuffle. An open advice initiative would be an ideal way for Mr Hunt to establish his credentials as Mr Waldegrave's successor with the scientific world. At the same time, it would send a strong message that momentum has not been lost on another of his responsibilities: open government.</p>

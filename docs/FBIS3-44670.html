More than 100 people attending the meeting reviewed  the international situation in the past year and warmly  discussed future trends.    The experts held that peace and development remained the two  major themes of the contemporary world. In the past year, some  tendencies are noteworthy: First, the economy in the East Asian  region rose, and the center of gravity of the world economy was  moving toward the Asia-Pacific region. Against the background  of extensive recession in the world economy, East Asia was  becoming the locomotive of the world economy. Second, some old  regional hot spots eased, but new hot spots emerged, and  turbulence will continue to spread. In the past year,  breakthroughs were made on some old hot-spot issues, and the  most important event was the conclusion of the  Israeli-Palestinian agreement. However, from the Outer Caucasus  to the Balkans, a large number of territorial, ethnic, and  religious conflicts were emerging. The Russian situation and  its future strategic tendency also attracted serious attention.  Third, there was a multitude of contradictions within the  Western world, and the leading position of the United States was  being continuously weakened. The contradictions among the  United States, Japan, and Western Europe developed further. The  process of multipolarization in the world was accelerating. The  domestic and foreign policies of the United States were still  undergoing adjustments. Fourth, the world was in a period of  adjusting military strategies, and the main tendency was: The  strategies mainly aimed at major wars were being replaced by  strategies mainly aimed at minor wars; preparations against  enemies in reality were shifted to preparations against  potential rivals in larger numbers; the building of large strong  forces was being shifted to the building of modern crack troops  able to react rapidly. Fifth, China's economic development and  social stability enhanced the nation's international status.    When looking to future tendencies in the international  situation, people expressed the following opinions:    First, hegemonism and power politics remain in the world,  but  the process of multipolarization has been quickened. In  particular, Germany and Japan are seeking the status of world  powers, and this tendency will become more obvious in the future.    Second, the danger of "neo-interventionism" will increase.  Because regional conflicts will occur frequently, international  interventions and peace-keeping actions will substantially  increase. This will provide opportunities for some big powers to  seek hegemony. The struggle against interventionism will be a  major aspect of international struggle in the future.    Third, the strength of the developing countries will  continue  to grow. The regional economic organizations in Asia, Latin  America, and Africa will further develop. Economic cooperation  will bring about political coordination and will give rise to  some regional dialogue organizations. They will share common  interests in safeguarding independence, opposing power politics,  and striving for the establishment of an international political  and economic order.    The comrades attending the meeting unanimously agreed that  in  the contemporary world, comprehensive national strength will  form the foundation for a country's strategy, and that economic  strength is the foundation of comprehensive national strength.  Therefore, we must continue to carry out the party's basic line  of taking economic construction as the central task, properly  handle our own affairs, and join the people throughout the world  in striving for the establishment of an international political  and economic order characterized by peaceful coexistence,  equality, and mutual benefit.</p>

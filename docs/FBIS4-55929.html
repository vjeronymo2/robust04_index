			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 24 -- Defence Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk on Tuesday denied the report by the  "SLOWO-DZIENNIK KATOLICKI" Catholic daily alleging that he plans  to resign over misunderstandings with President Lech Walesa. In  his opinion, the news items have nothing to do with reality, are  "outrageous and directed against the state's interests."    Kolodziejczyk added that this is not the first time when  such  a thing happens prior to his important foreign visits. He  recalled his meeting with the German minister of defence. Now,  Kolodziejczyk is going to leave for Brussels to meet NATO  defence ministers and talk with the U.S. secretary of defence  and the Baltic states' defence ministers.</p>

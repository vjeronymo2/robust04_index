			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   SACP Influence in ANC Unknown, Confusing Factor -- The South  African Communist Party (SACP) has "been thrown on the defensive  by charges that it is a dominant -- and manipulative --  influence in the ANC [African National Congress]," states a page  14 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 25 January.  "SACP spokesman Jeremy Cronin, attempting to neutralise the  propaganda, says only 34 of the 200 candidates are SACP  members." THE STAR believes, however, Cronin's explanation  "will not spike his opponents' guns as long as the dividing line  between SACP and ANC remains blurred. It is difficult to know  where the SACP ends and the ANC begins, in regard to policy as  well as membership." "Those who favour the ANC have to  recognise that a vote for the ANC is simultaneously a vote for  the SACP, that the endorsement of bourgeois capitalists in the  ANC is at the same time endorsement of the SACP's `democratic  socialists'. The sooner the SACP campaigns under its own  manifesto and stands or falls under its own banner, the better  for South Africa."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC, Government `Obsession' To Close Radio Pretoria --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 January in a page 4  editorial says the National Party and the ANC's "obsession with  closing down Radio Pretoria and other right-wing radio stations  calls into question their political judgment, and highlights  their similar approach when it comes to dealing with political  opposition." The courts have ruled that Radio Pretoria is  operating unlawfully, but this "legalistic approach," is  "inappropriate," and "a transparent attempt by government to  evade responsibility for its own decision." BUSINESS DAY hopes  it is a matter of time "before the airwaves are deregulated  sufficiently to render unlawful the operations of quaint  right-wing groups and others. In the meantime, given that the  regulations are something of an ass anyway, it would make sense  to turn a blind eye to technical contraventions."  <H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>   To End Township Rent Boycott Not Easy -- The call by ANC  President Nelson Mandela for an end to the "decade-long rent and  service charges boycott would well provide the incoming  government of national unity with one of its most intractable  problems," points out Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 23  January in a page 14 editorial. To upgrade townships to  acceptable levels is going to require "billions of rands and  decades to achieve. And therein lies the trouble: While these  grievances remain, some people will feel inclined to continue  with the boycott. The culture of non-payment is now deeply  ingrained among residents and no matter how popular Mandela and  the ANC might be, persuading people to end the boycott is not  going to be easy."  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Concern Over Number of `Communists' in ANC Election List --  Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 24 January in its page 8  editorial focuses on the ANC's strategy in its selection of  parliamentary candidates. "There are the expected  representatives of the internal, as well as the external wings  of the ANC. The internal wing is further divided into two --  the so-called 'Robben Island factor' and those that conducted  the struggle from within structures of the national government."  What is "disturbing," however, are the number of members from  the South African Communist Party, who, "according to some  sources, represent 13 names of the top 20 names on the list."  "Should the ANC get what opinion polls indicate, the major part  of ANC representation in the cabinet will therefore be  communists." They will be able to hold key portfolios such as  labor matters, information and security. The editorial further  focuses attention on the implications and dangers of having so  many communist members in government, and concludes: "That  there are several potential sharks in the ANC's wave of  candidates rolling toward us must not be doubted."</p>

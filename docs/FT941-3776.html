			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Gatwick airport adds 13 scheduled flights Gatwick airport's efforts to expand scheduled air services were yesterday given a strong boost with the announcement of 13 additional scheduled flights this spring and summer. BAA, the airports operator, has sought to develop Gatwick's role as London's second-biggest international schedule airport after Heathrow and transform its image as a charter holiday airport. The new services include the launch by American Airlines of flights to Nashville, Tennessee, and Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina, in May bringing to 19 the US destinations served from Gatwick. Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, is returning to Gatwick with a new service to Abu Dhabi. Emirates, like many other Gatwick-based international carriers, had moved to Heathrow following the government's decision three years ago to scrap London's air traffic distribution rules. Other new routes include Gatwick's first scheduled link with Johannesburg to be operated by Flitestar this summer. Southeast European is returning to Gatwick at the end of this month with services to Athens, while British Airways, which has significantly expanded its presence at the airport following its takeover of Dan-Air, is launching services to Stavanger in Norway, resuming services to Nice and increasing service frequencies to Tel Aviv and to Malaga. The new services will bring the total of scheduled airlines operating from Gatwick to 50 flying to more than 120 destinations. Provision for the domestic market is also set to expand with new services to Birmingham, Bristol and Cardiff by Community Express from next month. BAA said yesterday traffic at its seven airports had continued to show strong growth last month. The seven airports handled 5.3m passengers last month, an increase of 5.9 per cent on February 1993. Passenger numbers at Stansted were 27 per cent higher while passenger traffic grew by 0.4 per cent at Gatwick.</p>

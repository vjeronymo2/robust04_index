			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Arts: Firm grip of Hollywood - Cinema THE FIRM (15) Sydney Pollack ANCHORESS (12) Chris Newby A PLACE IN THE WORLD (12) Adolpho Aristarain THE LIE (15) Francois Margolin WHEN a black street urchin does a series of impromptu somersaults on a sidewalk in Memphis, Tennessee, the hero (Tom Cruise) does a matching somersault alongside him. This majestically daft moment comes in The Firm, a tale of corrupt lawyers who do laundry work - and we are not talking of shirts and underclothes - for the Mafia. Master Cruise plays the initially bushy-tailed, obedient trainee who finally exposes the rotters after 2 1/2 hours, several murders, his wife's walkout and enough chases to sate you for the year. We are not spoiling surprises for you. In this airport bestseller turned multi-million-dollar movie, who could doubt that Cruise will triumph; any more than we doubted that he would jump up and pour moral cleansing fluid all over Colonel Jack Nicholson at the end of A Few Good Men. Cruise's role in modern Hollywood is that of a jack-in-the-box Mr Clean. When Cruise somersaults in a street during a film, it is not for the hell of it. He is acting out his own coat-of-arms as a modern superstar: a rampant boy-reformer leaping over the corruptly couchant body of corporate/military/legal/political America. The Firm is ludicrous but enjoyable. We scent 150 minutes of Hollywood delirium from the first thumping chords of Dave Grusin's piano score over a lateral tracking-shot along Memphis' skyscraper-lined river. The film already plays like The French Connection and we have not yet had the credits. After that, as directed by a peak-form Sydney Pollack, it never stops or slows. Gene Hackman is the Chief Baddie in the firm Cruise joins after it wins the bidding war for his Ivy League talents and Hackman's high-class slime provides the trickle-down histrionics allowing supporting players to snarl and emote with elan. We have Hal Holbrook as the firm's white-haired patriarch; Ed Harris as the no-haired FBI sleuth, his pate as dazzling as an interrogation lamp; Jeanne (Basic Instinct) Tripplehorn as Cruise's pretty redhaired wife; and Holly Hunter as the friendly detective-agency moll with the rinky-dink voice and the explosion of platinum curls. As is appropriate in a story of the good and evil things that issue from people's heads, in this film by their hair ye shall know them. What pleases is the movie's impudent predictability. The 'surprises' are ripples in a sea of see-it-coming. How will Cruise escape from an office full of men who want to kill him? (We just know that he will). What plot twist will return Miss Tripplehorn to Cruise's arms? (We just know that something will). As for the final ingenious gambit by which Cruise gets the baddies without compromising his code of honour as a lawyer, that could be second-guessed by mentally riffling through gangster history. The Anchoress is the kind of film the British Film Institute Production Board gives us when it fears we are consuming too much junk food like The Firm. In 14th century England an illiterate peasant girl (Natalie Morse) declines to marry the local reeve and attracts the attention of the village priest, talent-scouting for anchorites. Soon she has been immured for life inside a church wall, there to commune with God and to eat the scraps of food pushed through a hole by her understandably distressed mother. The film looks like Tarkovsky and plays like Monty Python. Director Chris Newby has an eye touched by divine grace. Marvel at those filter-darkened skyscapes, those rhymings of shimmering corn with fluttering birdwing or falling hair, those elastic contrasts between long shot (silhouette procession on skyline) and close-ups (giant locust, giant eye). But Newby's ear is a different matter. Or perhaps the script by Judith Stanley-Smith and and Christine Watkins was delivered as a fait accompli and he had no veto over lines like 'Don't you go 'anging around those back fields, my girl'. 'The film is about a poetic eye at work in a barbaric landscape,' Newby has said of his first feature film. The poetic eye in this instance is Newby's. The barbaric landscape is the dramatic material on which he is required to exercise that eye. BEING 12 is tough enough without having to deal with the added distraction of living in a police state, especially when your parents are radical agitators who have been banished to the wilderness, writes Steven Amidon. Writer / director Adolpho Aristarain's A Place in the World is one of a host of Argentinian films dealing with that country's troubled recent past, though this one grounds itself more firmly in reality than most by employing a heartfelt coming of age story to make its political points. Ernesto (Gaston Batyi) is a serious child whose parents are trying to fight the good fight in the backwater to which they have been exiled. Aristarain's plot concerns a hazily defined struggle between farmers and a hydroelectric company which quickly becomes a familiar tale of greedy bastards versus salt-of-the-earth folk. The film distinguishes itself in its meticulous attention to character, not just Ernesto's proud family but also a troubled nun and a cynical geologist. And while the story's leisurely pace and occasional moral worthiness may alienate some, it remains one of the more accessible of recent portraits of South America. The deception at the heart of The Lie is a deadly one. Francois Margolin's first feature concerns a seemingly happy French couple whose life is torn apart by the HIV virus. Emma (Nathalie Baye) appears to have everything - a good job as an arts writer, a cute eight-year-old son and a dashing, foreign correspondent partner. When she suspects that she is pregnant she goes for a test, only to learn she is HIV positive. Knowing that she could only have contracted the virus from her partner, her horror turns to anger as she investigates his life, learning that he has been doing more corresponding than his job requires, particularly at gay bars. Heterosexual Aids is a bold, timely subject, yet just because Margolin tries to tackle big topics does not mean he gets a grip on them. Having assembled a promising group of characters and some combustible dramatic material, he fails to set it all ablaze. In the end, it is hard to tell whether this is a cautionary tale or simply melodrama hiding behind immunology. In spite of some perceptive moments and a steady performance by Baye, The Lie poses more questions than it has the power to resolve, and introduces more dilemmas than it has the sagacity to define.</p>

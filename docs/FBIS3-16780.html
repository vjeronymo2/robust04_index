Five Ways of  Finding the Trillions"]    [Text] Unfortunately the grotesque word "nonpayments" has  now become firmly established in the vocabulary not just of  economic managers but of Joe Public too and has afflicted all  spheres of the economy like a cancerous growth. In his speech  to the Federation Council session, Viktor Chernomyrdin cited the  following figures: As of 1 March, the debt owed to enterprises  was 25 trillion rubles [R] whereas the debt owed by them was R32  trillion. This means that there are R7 trillion missing from  the equation: Even with mutual offsetting of debts throughout  all production chains and all types of economic ties, there  would still be a colossal amount owed -- many consumers will not  have the actual resources with which to settle their debts.    I think that, in these extremely difficult conditions,  Viktor  Chernomyrdin has offered some quite effective methods of  overcoming the crisis.    Method one. Clear the budget debt to enterprises (R4.6  trillion). The method: direct payments, the issue of  promissory notes (over R1 trillion), and the reduction of taxes  on enterprises equivalent to the amount owed.    Method two. The granting of centralized credits to end  consumers to facilitate targeted payment for supplies along the  entire production chain.    Method three. The introduction into circulation of  commercial promissory notes, which would signify a property  liability for financial commitments assumed.    Method four. A rigorous procedure for bankrupting  enterprises which are not viable, are merely a drain on  financial resources, and do not yield a return.    Method five. Rigid taxation discipline, which ensures that  the revenue sections of the budget are properly topped up.    So, it seems, the premier's team has finally rolled up its  sleeves. There is just one question here: Why has it taken so  long? Let us recall that back on 23 February our newspaper  published an extract from a memorandum of the Russian Federation  President's Analytical Center dedicated to the problem of  nonpayments. The center's recommendations are very close to the  premier's proposals. Furthermore, in our view they include a  number of additional measures not yet taken into account which  would make it possible in principle to prevent similar crises in  the future. Once again there is cause to blame the extremely  complex social and political situation in the country, which is  diverting the government from the solution of the most urgent  problems.</p>

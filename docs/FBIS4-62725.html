			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy article: "Yeltsin Will No Longer Be </F> Just a Guest at the G-7 Meeting in Naples"]    [Text] World news agencies have reported that the world's  seven leading industrial powers have finally consented to  Russia's full and equal participation in the political part of  the next G-7 summit to be held in Naples in July.    This means that President Boris Yeltsin will be able to  partly cast off the status of a guest, which he had at the  previous meetings in Munich and Tokyo, and to start feeling that  he is on equal terms with the members of the prestigious world  club.    As much as a year ago, before the last G-7 meeting in the  Japanese capital, Moscow had advocated that Russia should take a  full and equal part in the political debate and that a common  statement by the eight leaders should be adopted on its results.  But there was insufficient time then to work out a new formula  for our involvement in the work of the summit, and the scheme  was not realized.    Moscow has now advanced the same initiative in good time,  and  it has been supported, in principle, in the capitals of the  seven most developed states. In fact, however, there is no full  coincidence of opinions among the members of the club concerning  the form of Russia's admission to it.    Different opinions exist in respect of the formula for  Russia's participation in G-7 conferences: "Seven plus one" or  "eight," Japanese Foreign Minister K. Kakizawa declared  recently. But, in any case, Tokyo believes that Russia must  play a constructive role as a member of the world community.  This politely streamlined wording conceals, in actual fact, the  special position of the Land of the Rising Sun.    A whole number of Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata, say that it is "too soon" at present to speak of  granting the Russian Federation full and equal membership of the  group of seven leading industrial powers and that they should  confine themselves at this stage to the "seven plus one"  formula, on whose basis Moscow has been admitted to regular G-7  summits since 1992. Tokyo's main argument here is that the  Russian Federation is a recipient of international aid, which is  being given to it precisely by members of the G-7 club.  Therefore it would allegedly be strange to see donor states and  a recipient state sitting at the same table on equal terms.    This logic is far from impeccable, however. Russia, as our  top government figures emphasize, occupies a special position  because, on the one hand, it needs support for the reforms  while, on the other hand, it is a donor itself in respect of the  CIS republics and some developing countries. The burden of this  aid is no less than that of the G-7 in respect of Russia. In  order to prevent unnecessary debate and misunderstandings  arising in this sphere, it is necessary to record Russia's  credits to the republics of the former Union as credits of  international financial organizations. This position is held  both by Moscow and by the IMF leadership.    While acknowledging Russia's leading role in world affairs,  particularly in settling the conflict in the Balkans,  nevertheless Tokyo would not like to admit it yet to full and  equal participation in G-7 meetings even in a curtailed form, in  other words only in the political part of the debate, until it  has secured some concessions on the issue of the "northern  territories."    Moscow, for its part, certainly is not seeking to force  events, realizing that conditions are not yet ripe for  full-scale participation in meetings of the seven leading world  powers -- this requires more serious market transformations in  the economy. But, at the same time, Russia cannot wait, as in  former times, for all the chief issues to be discussed without  it and for them to invite its leader only afterward and to brief  him on the decisions adopted.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Fewer businesses likely to fail The number of business failures in the second quarter of the year will fall 19 per cent from the first three months, the specialist trade credit insurer Trade Indemnity predicted yesterday. It forecast 835 failures for the quarter, down from 1,037 in the first quarter of this year and from 1,433 in the second quarter of last year. The figure is expected to be the lowest quarterly total in the past three years. Mr William Simpson, chief economist, said the drop was above expectations, but companies were paying off their debts before embarking on further domestic investment. He said this could threaten their ability to increase productivity because the cost of borrowing would increase significantly when businesses finally do decide to invest.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Approval close on assisted areas BRITAIN AND the European Commission are 'close to agreement' on proposals to redraw the map of areas eligible for UK government assistance following high-level talks in Brussels yesterday. Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, met Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, to discuss the government's regional aid plans. Mr Sainsbury presented a controversial draft map of British regional aid, which it is understood would transfer some aid from the north-west of England, Wales and Scotland towards the traditionally more prosperous south.</p>

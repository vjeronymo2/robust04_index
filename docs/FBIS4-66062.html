			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Ph. E." report: "Nuclear Accidents: Franco-Russian </F> Simulation"]    [Text] At a time when shutting down the Chernobyl power  station is once again in the news because of Ukrainian blackmail  aimed at ensuring its closure, the French and Russians have just  engaged in the simulation of a large-scale disaster of the same  type as that of Chernobyl. The objective was to test, with the  help of the French Nuclear Protection and Safety Institute  (IPSN), the Russian organization in the sphere of protecting  populations and administering contaminated areas in the case of  radioactive contamination of extensive areas. The former Soviet  Union's experience is unique in this sphere with the nuclear  disasters of Chelyabinsk in 1958 and Chernobyl in 1986.    The exercise, which required one year's preparation, was  held  from 21 to 25 June 1993 in the Kaluga region, a Russian  territory already strongly affected by the effects of the  Chernobyl explosion. The scenario and the facts are, moreover,  directly inspired by the Ukrainian tragedy and the reaction of  the local public authorities and the population at the time.  Representatives of the administration, experts, representatives  of the population and the media took part in the operation.  They had to face the problems which arise not only immediately  after the accident but also 16 days, then one year, and five  years afterwards. A satellite link with the IPSN center in  Fontenay-aux-Roses enabled French experts to participate  directly in the operation.    The analysis of the results of the experiment, which was  carried out last week, demonstrated the split which exists among  the three main protagonists, namely the experts, the  administration, and the media. The first complain in particular  of not always being heeded by civil servants who, often fearing  panic among the population and the spread of rumors, tend to do  nothing. This response is found again in their relations with  the media. The French and Russians were able to broadly examine  their decisionmaking processes, and their crisis management  techniques, an exercise which was sufficiently productive for  the two partners to decide to repeat the experiment in summer  1995 in Chelyabinsk, the other unfortunately famous site of the  Soviet nuclear industry.</p>

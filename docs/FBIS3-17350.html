Eduard Shevardnadze said the  initiator of the combat activities was the Abkhazian side,  attempting for the third time to dislodge the Svan population  from Kodor Canyon. As a result of previous attacks, the  Abkhazians had succeeded in advancing and occupying the  so-called [words indistinct]. The Georgian Defense Ministry  told us today that the Abkhazian side opened artillery fire this  morning on villages in Kodor Canyon, leading to casualties among  the civilian population. Regarding the armament of the Georgian  population, Shevardnadze said:    [Shevardnadze] The equipment there is not in fact in working  order. It is the equipment that was withdrawn following the  evacuation of Sukhumi. It is not capable of carrying out combat  tasks. If something is being done there, it is only  self-defense, nothing more.    [Correspondent] Eduard Shevardnadze called the beginning of  combat operations an attempt to disrupt the political settlement  of the Abkhazian conflict.    [Shevardnadze] The question of beginning a new round of  talks  is now under discussion. The UN secretary general, his personal  representative, is calling for it. I think this is the latest  act [designed] to disrupt [the talks]. [passage omitted]</p>

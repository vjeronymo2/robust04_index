In Kyrgyzstan the meeting with  President Askar Akayev was a demonstration of mutual affection.  "Boris Nikolayevich regards you with affection, and there is no  concealing this," the Russian minister remarked to the Kyrgyz  president. "You are a refined, highly intelligent person with  firm democratic convictions, and this brings you close to Boris  Nikolayevich." Kozyrev had brought to Bishkek a message from  Yeltsin, which, we were to understand, gave high marks to the  official program for stabilization of the position of the  Russian-speaking population overseen by Akayev himself. Russia,  in turn, promised "as much economic assistance as possible" to  support the enterprises at which this Russian-speaking  population is employed. The actual expression of the assistance  will be determined at the time of the future visit to Kyrgyzstan  of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Meanwhile, the fact that  Kozyrev's first trip in the new year began in Bishkek  immediately prior to the referendum on confidence in President  Akayev could have served as a kind of pointer to how the  Russian-speaking population should determine its sympathies at  the time of the ballot. Kozyrev declared that Akayev's approach  to the problem--"respect for citizens who have to live where  they live and work there also--is working for the sovereignty of  Kyrgyzstan and its prestige." The minister disapproved, on the  contrary, of the position of the former Soviet republics which  believe that "they are asserting their sovereignty" (which,  according to him, no one disputes) "by pushing out the Russian  population. We will not be insensitive to this."    The parties signed a consular convention, and Askar Akayev  described the relations of the two countries as a "strengthening  of the Eurasian connection" and defined their three main sources  and ingredients: the strengthening of sovereignty, the  preservation of the "spring of Russian culture and language,"  thanks to which "Kyrgyzstan arose" (he proposed making the  Slavonic University, which opened last year, a regional  university and retaining Russian as an official language), and,  finally, the choice of Russia as principal ally--"Russia has  always had interests here, and they should be preserved." "Who  said," Kozyrev observed in response, "that we have to choose  between East and West? We are in both places, we have no  inferiority complex."    The president of Kyrgyzstan identified his position on the  question of dual citizenship as follows: As a constitutional  provision, it would signify the disintegration of a country in  which 80 nationalities, including 20 major ethnic groups, live.  The matter can be resolved on the basis of a bilateral  interstate agreement. Kozyrev confirmed that a treaty basis,  which would help determine the balance of rights and obligations  in order to avoid a "dual burden," was needed for a solution of  this question. No state, he observed, should fear damage to its  sovereignty, and citizens on its territory should be subordinate  to the laws, although they could have supplementary rights also.  Dual-citizenship status could give rise to uncertain cases for  Russia also.    As far as can be judged, a legislative initiative in the  parliament of Kyrgyzstan on the question of citizenship could  evoke an ambivalent response. The arrangements with Turkmenistan  and Kyrgyzstan, which were arrived at relatively painlessly, are  assets for Russia, but it is in these countries that the  position of Russian speakers is for various reasons the least  acute. In addition, the intentions of the leader of the country  could to a certain extent also adjust the position of his  closest neighbors--Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan--which occupy a far  tougher position on this matter and would hardly receive with  enthusiasm a breakthrough on the "Kyrgyz flank." Kozyrev  himself, for that matter, is not inclined to consider this  position insurmountable. Responding to a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  question as to what principle could be made the basis of dual  citizenship for Russian speakers--ethnic or linguistic--he said:  "This question is extraordinarily complex, and it should not be  oversimplified but decided in each specific case--with regard  both to our national legislation and treaties with the  corresponding states. In some republics the agreements would  have their own specific features, and the approach would not be  ethnic, of course, but, if you wish, a `human-rights' approach.  It is quite complex to resolve this problem with any republic,  but no one is now refusing to discuss the question of  citizenship altogether because there could be various versions  of a solution. A delegation of Uzbekistan headed by the acting  chairman of the Supreme Council has just been in Moscow, and I  have had a very detailed telephone conversation with Nazarbayev.  In a week I plan to visit Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The main  thing is that there be no hysteria over the problem: The task is  to prevent passions becoming inflamed. A demonstration of our  'heroism'--we stick to our guns--would give rise only to a  reluctance to talk on their part. This stage has been  negotiated, we are now at the stage of actual work on what the  balance of rights and obligations should be. Insofar as the  problem of dual citizenship has, truly, absolutely not been  settled."    Before the start of his visit to China, the minister of  foreign affairs conducted a regional conference with the heads  of the border oblasts, at which he promised them that he would  open up Russian regions for relations with their neighbors, but  "intelligently, not recklessly." He confirmed that the problem  of the mass entry and "settlement" of Chinese in Russia had  created a tense situation, and for this reason the 1993  agreement had radically reduced the number of persons entitled  to non-visa entry. But the minister proposed that border trade,  which has helped the population of the Far East resolve to a  large extent the problem of what to eat and with what to clothe  itself, be switched from the tourist-bag to the interregional  and interstate level. The surplus balance in trade with China  (Russia's second largest trading partner) has amounted to $2.5  billion and has surpassed in terms of volume the peak of the  trade of the whole of the USSR in 1990. True, the Far East  authorities are complaining that they are trading mainly with  China's northeast provinces, from where goods of inferior  quality to those produced in the south are being "palmed off" on  them. Nonetheless, as Amur Governor Polevanov declared, "Chinese  expansion in the Far East is a reality with which we are forced  to reckon." According to him, there is no legislation that  determines the legal position of foreigners under the conditions  of the "nonforcible settlement" of the region by the Chinese. He  supported the idea of the creation of a free trade zone here and  gave as an example his neighbors, who have made provision for  concessionary taxation for potential investors. The governor  proposed that up to 70 percent of customs payments going to the  treasury remain in the oblast and also handed over an appeal to  President Yeltsin consenting to the construction of a cosmodrome  in Svobodnyy, at the former place of deployment of a missile  unit. In Beijing Andrey Kozyrev held talks with the Chinese  leaders. After a meeting with his colleague, Qian Qichen, he  declared that the two countries' relations could be raised to  the level of constructive partnership, which signifies, if not  allied relations, close interaction, in any event. Agreement was  reached on the continuation of top-level contacts--PRC Chairman  Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow, and before this, Viktor  Chernomyrdin will make a trip to China. The heads of the foreign  policy departments also discussed questions of a border  settlement. Since the end of the 1950's, Kozyrev observed,  negotiations on territorial demarcation were the main irritant  in Soviet-Chinese relations. Today an agreement on the eastern  sector of the common border, and this is 4,300 km from Maritime  Kray to Mongolia, has been concluded between Russia and China  and ratified. The parties have agreed to maintain the status quo  until the completion of its demarcation. "The demarcation will  be undertaken on the basis of the incontestable criteria of  international law," the Russian minister said, and although  discussion of the problem continues, Russia and China have  deemed it possible, with the participation of the border  regions, to undertake joint economic activity on the disputed  territories. Negotiations on border issues will continue also on  the western sector of the border between China and a joint  delegation of four states--Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and  Uzbekistan. Understanding was reached on an easing of the  border-crossing conditions for inhabitants of the border areas,  but also on undesirable "side occurrences" being taken under  control (according to Jiang Zemin, "when a door is opened, flies  also may fly in together with the good people"). At the end  of the visit Andrey Kozyrev described the present relations as  follows: "We have passed the stage of inheritance of the Soviet  Union and, after a long normalization of relations, we have  switched to normal cooperation." The specific forms of this  cooperation should be determined during the visit to Beijing of  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Kozyrev termed his tour of China's  provinces, on the other hand, preparation for a favorable  climate. In, particularly, Shenzhen, a special economic zone,  and in Shenxi, where the lion's share of enterprises built with  the participation of the Soviet Union is concentrated and in  whose reconstruction, in the minister's opinion, there would be  no harm in Russia participating. The minister evaluated the  experience of the special economic zone in the south of China as  a regional version of China's reforms, "a very specific  experiment under very specific conditions," and proposed that  there be no illusions as to the possibility of it being copied,  even less "idealized and ideologized." The prospects of  relations with China afforded the minister a reason, for that  matter, to call this country also the "near abroad" inasmuch as,  according to him, "there are no first-and second-class foreign  countries, and China is our neighbor. I am trying to introduce  this concept in its healthy meaning: The near abroad means all  our immediate neighbors." Nor, in this connection, did the  minister overlook domestic problems: "Talk about Russian  neo-imperialism merely diverts attention from the real problems  connected with Russia's special role in the CIS. Maintaining  stability there is in the interests of the entire Eurasian  region. I propose that those in the West who have an interest in  this help our efforts. Those, however, who think that they could  not reach agreement with me and will find someone else are  mistaken. They do not know our internal situation or the  composition of the State Duma--I invite them to make themselves  acquainted."</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SOVIETS TUNE IN DEBATES, OUTPUT OFF  </P> <P> So many Soviets were glued to televisions and radios, enthralled by the  unprecedented open debate of the new Congress from May 25 to June 9, that  industrial output dropped 20%, Tass press agency said today.  </P> <P> That is why officials decided to halt live coverage of the smaller, full-time  legislature, the Supreme Soviet, Tass quoted Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov as  saying.  </P> <P> "The most important meetings will be broadcast in full, but on tape, in the  evening, when the working hours of most people are over," Tass said. News  programs will broadcast highlights.  </P> <P> During the inaugural session of the Congress of People's Deputies, which met  for 2 1/2 weeks from May 25 to June 9, repairmen disappeared.  </P> <P> Shoppers could hear their newly elected deputies criticizing Politburo members  and demanding control over the dreaded KBG everywhere.  </P> <P> As they moved out of earshot of the broadcast at a checkout stand, they could  walk outside to hear the words coming from a car radio.  </P></p>

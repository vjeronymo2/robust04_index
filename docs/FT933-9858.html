			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Bosnia air strikes disarray ALLIED threats to carry out air strikes against Serbian positions in Bosnia were thrown into fresh confusion yesterday when General Francis Briquemont, UN commander for Bosnia, strongly criticised the proposals. Gen Briquemont warned in Sarajevo that the strikes would complicate the situation on the ground and could endanger the lives of the UN troops in Bosnia. His concern was echoed by Lord Owen, international mediator, who said independent Nato action to lift the 16-month siege would destroy any future co-operation between the UN and Nato. 'I am totally and absolutely opposed in the circumstances of Yugoslavia to be trying to work outside the framework of the UN and the UN Security Council and the secretary general,' Lord Owen said, adding that the threat of air strikes had contributed to the breakdown of the Geneva peace talks this week. The criticism came as Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, met Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, at the Aviano allied air base in Italy to discuss logistics for the air strikes. After the talks Mr Christopher again threatened military action if the Bosnian Serbs did not stop 'strangling' Sarajevo. 'The international community cannot accept the bombing of citizens and the laying of siege to cities,' he said. He did not spell out what would be sufficient to halt Nato strikes. The Nato council of ambassadors is to meet in Brussels on Monday to finalise the plans. Last Tuesday, it threatened to bomb Serb artillery positions around Sarajevo if Bosnian Serbs did not lift their 'stranglehold' on the city. Logistical plans for the air strikes are being finalised at meetings of Nato officers at allied military headquarters in Mons, Belgium, this weekend. In an apparent attempt to defuse the allied threat and take the moral high ground in the peace negotiations, Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday repeated their offer to withdraw from two strategic mountains they seized this week. Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has said he will not return to the Geneva negotiations, scheduled to resume on Monday, unless the Serbs carry out their promise to withdraw. But after Gen Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb military commander, and Gen Rasim Delic, head of the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, met for talks at Sarajevo airport on the Serb withdrawal from the two mountains, they failed to agree on a handover of positions. In Geneva, Lord Owen said he still hoped the peace negotiations would restart on Monday, and re-presented a proposed constitution for tripartite division of Bosnia. But he warned that although there had been progress over a map for the country's ethnic division, negotiations over the future status and division of Sarajevo were deadlocked. 'It remains the biggest obstacle,' he said, adding: 'There is not at the moment any sight of agreement.' He said Serb and Croat leaders had agreed to give Moslems 30 per cent of the land of Bosnia-Hercegovina. Echoing widespread allied concerns, the British Foreign Office said it would push for the Nato meeting on Monday to consider the state of the peace negotiations in Geneva before any plans for air strikes were formulated. UN relief officials yesterday warned that Sarajevo, mostly without water and electricity, this week would run out of fuel if aid routes were not open.</p>

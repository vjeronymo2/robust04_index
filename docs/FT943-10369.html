			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good prospects behind the French financial 'facade' Sir, While we would seldom disagree with so eminent an 'international opinion leader', Barry Riley's dim view of France's financial reputation ('Airline cracks in the French financial facade', August 3) warrants a riposte. First, French reliance on foreign funding of its budget deficit has fallen, as net sales of some FFr104bn in the first five months of this year (twice the outflow seen from the German bond market) have reduced foreign ownership of the French bond market from more than 40 per cent to about 30 per cent. This exodus weighed on the market all the more because the French Treasury (tortoise to the German hare) has maintained its regular funding programme through thick and thin while a flood of bond issuance was stored up for the second half of the year in Germany. Second, while no one would pretend that the French authorities have been quick to reverse the fiscal deterioration of the last few years, the outlook is improving as the economy recovers. The 1995 presidential election should, furthermore, bring an end to government inaction, spurring the authorities to bring welfare spending into line and speeding up the reform of the tax system. Third, it is unclear that Germany's export-led recovery will be any more impressive than France's performance over the next few years. With German consumers hamstrung by falling real wages and rising taxes, exporters will have to do much of the running. In France, exports are on an upwards trend, unemployment is stabilising and may decline next year, and capital spending is recovering on the back of a healthy financial balance of the corporate sector and rising profits. Finally, we doubt that there is a great deal of political risk that needs to be priced into French assets. In part because unemployment will fall further, franc fort is effectively unquestioned and fiscal retrenchment accepted as unavoidable. Whoever wins the election, be it Mr Jacques Delors, Mr Edouard Balladur or Mr Jacques Chirac, a rebalancing of the monetary and fiscal policies is now unlikely. Without major political risk or strong signs of divergence between the French and German economies, it is hard to see why the French franc or bond market should weaken from here relative to Germany.

			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: TNT sells shipping businesses TNT, the Australian transportation group, is selling the bulk of its shipping and development division - including its 50 per cent interest in the Condor cross-channel ferries in the UK - for approximately ADollars 125m (USDollars 89m). The deal is structured so that a new company, headed by members of the shipping division's existing management, buys the business. TNT said it expected to receive ADollars 125.4m from the deal. Meanwhile, the new company, called Holyman, will raise funds to meet the bulk of this purchase price by floating some 62m shares on the stock market to raise ADollars 123.4m. The sale is conditional on the flotation being completed successfully but if it proceeds smoothly, Holyman will also take on about ADollars 8m of lease debt within the business. The new company will make 35 per cent of the share issue, around 21.6m shares, available to TNT shareholders and convertible preference shareholders on a priority basis. The businesses to be sold are fairly diverse and were acquired by TNT over the past two decades. They range from the ship-owning and chartering business in Australia, to the Hydrolines fast ferries, which plough the Hudson River in New York, the Palm Valley pipeline in the Northern Territory and a wood-chip trading operation in Queensland. The sale will not include TNT's 50 per cent interest in the Union Shipping Group, the Sydney Monorail, or its event merchandising business, called TNT Leisure. Holyman said yesterday that it expected revenue in the year to end-December 1994 to be ADollars 39.1m, and net profit to stand at ADollars 12.9m. The shares are being sold on an earnings multiple of 9.6 times. The sale is in line with TNT's policy of selling 'non-core' assets, in an effort to reduce the group's heavy debt levels. In its last annual report, the group said that it had identified over ADollars 200m worth of assets for sale during 1993/4 and a further ADollars 150m-ADollars 200m worth which might be disposed of in the future.</p>

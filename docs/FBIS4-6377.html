			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Intentional Move of Warlikers" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- The United States is  these days aggravating the situation in Korea by spreading the  fiction of "nuclear threat" from North Korea, making quite a  noise as if a war were impending. Lurking behind this is a  sinister intention of the United States, says a MINJU CHOSON  analyst today.    The news analyst goes on:    The mounting tension on the Korean peninsula is attributable  to the United States' policy hostile to the DPRK, not to the  latter's "nuclear threat".    The U.S. authorities, particularly the military quarters  closely connected with warmongers, are seeking to intentionally  aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and make money  through arms sales by taking advantage of it.    This is borne out by the fact that in November last year  when  Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, went to the United States, the U.S.  authorities vociferated about "North's nuclear threat" and  forced him to open the South Korean rice market, any more for  the maintenance of the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea and  buy more weapons including Patriot missiles in return for their  "commitment" to the "security" of South Korea.    In aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula they  also seek to find a way out of the crisis at home. The U.S.  Administration is now floundering under great condemnations and  criticisms from the American people for its anti-popular  policies and snowballing trade deficits. The recent "White  Water" scandal has made its position all the more difficult, and  the U.S. political crisis is worsening daily.    Hence, the U.S. authorities are aggravating the situation on  the Korean peninsula, crying themselves hoarse over the "North's  nuclear threat" to divert public attention elsewhere with the  aim of defusing the domestic crisis.    Whatever petty tricks they may play, they cannot conceal the  stark fact.    They must refrain from such despicable, anachronistic acts  as  selling off lethal weapons by spreading a lie and aggravating  the situation and withdraw all their destructive weapons and  troops from South Korea. That will do them good.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Danisco to raise dividend after 25% advance Danisco, the Danish food and beverages, food ingredients and packaging conglomerate, proposed an increase in dividend to DKr14 from DKr12 after net financial items by 25 per cent to DKr1.03bn (Dollars 166m) from DKr826m. Sales in the year to end-March were down slightly to DKr12.84bn from DKr13.02bn, reflecting the disposal of manufacturing company Niro Atomizer. Sales by other units increased by 16 per cent, two-thirds of the increase coming from Swedish sugar producer Sockerbolaget, which only featured in the accounts for part of the previous year. Net profits were ahead to DKr830m from DKr809m. An increase of about 10 per cent in pre-tax profits was forecast for the current year. The food and beverages division, which includes Danish Sugar and Danish Distillers, lifted sales 22 per cent to DKr8.25bn and operating profits 34 per cent to DKr1.00bn. Sugar production reached 1.02m tonnes, of which half was produced in Denmark, 380,000 tonnes in Sweden and 120,000 tonnes in Germany. The food ingredients division lifted sales 11 per cent to DKr2.02bn and operating profits by 52 per cent to DKr290m. Packaging sales fell 2 per cent to DKr2.59bn and operating profits gained 12 per cent to DKr209m. The board proposed a one-into-five share split and a DKr6m share issue for employees, priced at DKr40 per share.</p>

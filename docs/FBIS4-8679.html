			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "MAW": "Official Optimism; Number of Unemployed </F> in March Decreased by 19,000"]    [Text] "Since October, we have been witnessing a  decreasing trend in the level of unemployment, and at this point  I can be more optimistic in hoping that the trend will hold" --  said Labor Minister Leszek Miller during a news conference on 13  April. "The number of people registered at unemployment offices  was almost 3 million people at the end of March. This  represents a drop of almost 19,000 people compared with  February" -- added Deputy Labor Minister Jerzy Szreter.    The falling trend in unemployment was reported in 38  voivodships -- almost 24,000 people in total. On the other  hand, there was an increase in 11 voivodships in March of this  year, by a total of 4,300 people. According to the deputy  minister, the falling trend will hold until the end of  June, but beginning in July, there will be another increase, due  to new graduates entering the picture. At the end of  March, people registered at unemployment offices comprised 16  percent of the professionally active population. By this time,  132,000 people were registered -- a drop of 1.4 percent from  February. On the other hand, almost 152,000 people were crossed  off the unemployment list, which is an increase of almost 26  percent of all unemployed people, compared with the previous  month. Those who were taken off the register accepted permanent  jobs, interventionist work [not further specified], and public  works jobs offered by unemployment offices.    The highest unemployment rates continue to be in the  following voivodships: Koszalin, Suwalki, Slupsk, Olsztyn,  Elblag, Walbrzych, Pila, and Ciechanow. The lowest rates of  unemployment were reported in the following voivodships:  Krakow, Warsaw, Poznan, and Katowice. Minister Miller also  informed journalists that during next week's session by the  Council of Ministers, he will present a draft of an amended  Labor Law Code.</p>

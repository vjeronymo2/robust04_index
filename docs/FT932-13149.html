			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thames sold The bid by Pearson for Thames Television had been widely signalled but the terms were generally appreciated and both stocks held out against the overall weak market. Most analysts argued that the 200p-a-share agreed bid, valuing Thames at Pounds 99m, would boost Pearson's earnings and be a good fit for its increasing exposure to media and leisure. The Pounds 25m cash which makes up part of the assets, and to which most analysts were unaware of until Thames results were published earlier this week, pleased media observers. Nevertheless there was some caution over the synergy. Ms Louise Barton of Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'The quality of earnings from production companies is pretty low.' Pearson shares closed a net 10 higher at 429p while Thames jumped 20 to 195p. A large programme trade was said to have left marketmakers scrambling for stock in Allied Lyons and Whitbread. The shares were squeezed up 5 to 580p and 11 to 471p respectively. Whitbread also benefited from domestic recovery talk. However, Bass, off 6 to 548p, was hurt by presentations held by Courage. The Australian-owned brewer has been reiterating its threat to defend market share in the UK. BZW was recommending Shoprite after a recent visit. The shares gained 26 to 683p. Budgens spurted forward as the company announced that the German REWE Group was buying a 26.3 per cent stake from BIL Securities. A price of 55p a share has been agreed. Budgens shares added 3 to 49p. Broker recommendations published earlier in the week continued to power British Aerospace and the shares gained 9 1/2 to 318 1/2 p, closing at their highest level this year. Kleinwort Benson was said to be the latest house to point out the virtues of the stock. British Steel saw big two-way business and ended the day  3/4 lighter at 93p. It traded 6.5m, but there was also one very large order, equivalent to more than 19m underlying shares carried out in traded options. and said to have been executed by Kleinwort Benson. Analysts remained positive about Smiths Industries following results on Wednesday and the shares firmed 4 to 357p. Other market statistics, Page 9.</p>

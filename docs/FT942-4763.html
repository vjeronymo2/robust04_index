			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Leading Article: How not to pick a Euro-leader Europe owes a great deal to Franco-German co-operation. Without the driving force supplied by Bonn and Paris, the postwar community of European states would never have flourished. Wisdom displayed by the two countries' successive leaders has benefited the entire continent. One striking example was President Francois Mitterrand's support for deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles in Germany a decade ago. This strengthened Chancellor Helmut Kohl's policies at a crucial time. Mr Mitterrand thus made an important contribution to the eventual end of the cold war, paving the way for German unification. In spite of these successes, Bonn and Paris are not immune to mistakes. Mr Mitterrand and Mr Kohl are making one now in their efforts to steer the presidency of the European Commission towards Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister. Having decided on their candidate, France and Germany appear to be trying to impose him on the rest of the European Union, in spite of reservations by countries such as Britain and Italy. The objective of the campaign is misguided. Additionally, the way it is being carried out runs counter to the principles on which the EU should be doing business. Vital role The successor to Mr Jacques Delors will play a vital role in shaping the European Union during the next five years. As it tries to improve members' economic performance and deepen and widen existing integration, the Commission needs to be made more efficient, more cohesive and more persuasive. The right candidate will require vision and ideas combined with administrative skills and tough-minded negotiating ability. Mr Dehaene appears to have won support from Mr Kohl, in particular, on the grounds of his Christian Democrat party membership, his backing for political and monetary union, and his adroit handling of the 1993 European summit in Brussels. However important these attributes are, they are not sufficient to guarantee him the job. Mr Dehaene is already discharging with tenacity the difficult task of holding together his fractious Belgian coalition. Since there are three other contenders for the Commission presidency, all with relevant qualities which Mr Dehaene lacks, Europe would probably be best served if the prime minister were to remain at his post. European integrationist Of the others in the running, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, has strong credentials as an Atlanticist and as a European integrationist. His economic policy accomplishments during 12 years in government are impressive. The Netherlands is one of the few countries close to fulfilling the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union. Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior EU commissioner, has a sceptical mind, but is also a strong believer in the benefits of European union. His reputation has been improved by his contribution to concluding the Uruguay Round. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and a former Brussels competition commissioner, is not a front runner in the race. But, like Mr Lubbers and Sir Leon, he has a proven international track record. EU voters are preparing to go to the polls for the parliament elections on June 9 and 12. Austrian voters look nervous about the EU ahead of this weekend's referendum. Yet the horse-trading among governments about the Union's new chief executive is taking place in secrecy. If the next president is to give the Union the independent-minded, persuasive leadership it needs, he or she needs to be the right person chosen in the right way. That requires national leaders to state openly what they consider to be the qualities required for the job and then for candidates to come forward publicly, so that their merits can be examined and discussed.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Forth Ports float will raise Pounds 33m for Treasury THE FLOTATION of Forth Ports, which handles most port operations in the Firth of Forth in eastern Scotland, will raise Pounds 33m for the government. A total of 27m ordinary shares will be issued at 110p. Half have been firmly placed with financial institutions and the rest are being placed, subject to recall to meet demand from the public, through intermediaries. A further 3m shares have been reserved for an employee share ownership scheme. Applications must be received by March 18 and allocations will be announced the next day. Dealing in the shares is expected to begin on Monday, March 23. The sale is the only public flotation so far in the privatisation of the trust ports. Mr Hugh Thompson, Forth's chief executive, said he had rejected the more popular management buy-out route because the company would have been highly geared, limiting its activities and scope to make acquisitions. Mr Thompson said he was looking actively at acquisition opportunities. Forth would be interested in smaller ports elsewhere in the UK and marine-related businesses. Financial advisers to the issue are British Linen Bank, the merchant banking arm of Bank of Scotland, with brokers de Zoete and Bevan. The issue was fully underwritten by UBS Phillips and Drew.</p>

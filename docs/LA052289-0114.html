			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> U. OF KENTUCKY'S LERON ELLIS WILL TRANSFER AFTER SANCTIONS BY NCAA  </P> <P> Kentucky basketball center LeRon Ellis announced after a meeting with the  school's athletics director today that he will not attend the university next  year.  </P> <P> Ellis talked with Athletics Director C. M. Newton and sports information  officials before confirming his decision at an impromptu news conference.  </P> <P> The sophomore standout said he did not know where he will go to school for his  remaining two years of eligibility. He played in 32 games for Kentucky this  last season and averaged 16 points and five rebounds per game. The 6-foot-10,  225-pounder from Tustin, Calif., was a second team All-Southeastern Conference  selection by the Associated Press this year.  </P> <P> Under NCAA rules, Ellis may transfer to another NCAA school without losing any  eligibility because of sanctions imposed against the Wildcats last week. The  sanctions for alleged NCAA rules violations included placing the basketball  program on probation for three years, a ban on post-season play for two years  and a one-year ban on live television appearances.  </P></p>

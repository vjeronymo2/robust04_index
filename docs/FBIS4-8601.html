			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Zvornik, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- General Michael  Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander for the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, is personally responsible for the abuse of  the UN peace mission on the territory of the Srpska Republic and  the transformation of the UNPROFOR command into an executive  branch of NATO, Major General Milan Gvero, assistant commander  in chief of the Army of the Srpska Republic, has told TANJUG.    According to Gvero, "on the basis of fabricated reasons and  untrue reports he made a decision to use the NATO air force  against the Serbs and thus caused UNPROFOR to become militarily  involved in this civil war on the Muslim side."    Gen. Gvero explained that Gen. Rose did this "at a moment  when an agreement on the complete and permanent cessation of  hostilities throughout the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, as  proposed by the Army of the Srpska Republic, was about to be  signed."    "He personally did not have any objections to our draft  agreement," Gen. Gvero said, adding that Gen. Rose even assessed  the draft agreement as "too good," but said the Muslims would  not sign it.    According to Gvero, Rose should have "put pressure on the  belligerent Muslims to sign that agreement," but instead of that  "he encouraged them and sent the air force against the Serbs,  who were proposing peace."    "By this he displayed complete partiality and behavior  totally at odds with the UN peace mission," Gvero said,  stressing that Rose "did not prove to be up to this complex  situation." [passage omitted]    "While we were able to discuss facts with ease with Rose's  compatriot General Ramsey and with other generals -- which is  why good results were achieved in those periods -- Gen. Rose  cannot rid himself of the syndrome of one-sided textbook  schemes, according to which he is a `good guy.' He is always  right in advance while all those who are defending their country  are bad and incompetent."    According to Gvero, Gen. Rose "is behaving in this sensitive  situation as if he had just been dropped in with his parachute  and had met `bad Serb guys.' That is what he has been told,"  Gvero stated.    "Gen. Rose lost credibility with the Serb people when he  finally took off his mask and sent a combat air force to kill  civilians and defenders of the Serb territory, and he has  neither a moral, nor military, nor political basis to  participate any further in the peace process in the area," Gen.  Gvero believes. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Supplement 4: Respiratory Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> I. Considerations for Selection of Respirators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Personal respiratory protection should be used by (a) persons entering rooms where patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated, (b) persons present during cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures performed on such patients, and (c) persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls are not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei. These other settings should be identified on the basis of the facility's risk assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although data regarding the effectiveness of respiratory protection from many hazardous airborne materials have been collected, the precise level of effectiveness in protecting HCWs from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  transmission in health-care settings has not been determined. Information concerning the transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is incomplete. Neither the smallest infectious dose of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nor the highest level of exposure to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at which transmission will not occur has been defined conclusively ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 59,151,152 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Furthermore, the size distribution of droplet nuclei and the number of particles containing viable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that are expelled by infectious TB patients have not been defined adequately, and accurate methods of measuring the concentration of infectious droplet nuclei in a room have not been developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, in certain settings the administrative and engineering controls may not adequately protect HCWs from airborne droplet nuclei (e.g., in TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms in which cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures are performed, and ambulances during the transport of infectious TB patients). Respiratory protective devices used in these settings should have characteristics that are suitable for the organism they are protecting against and the settings in which they are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Performance Criteria for Personal Respirators for Protection Against Transmission of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respiratory protective devices used in health-care settings for protection against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  should meet the following standard criteria. These criteria are based on currently available information, including (a) data on the effectiveness of respiratory protection against noninfectious hazardous materials in workplaces other than health-care settings and on an interpretation of how these data can be applied to respiratory protection against  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; (b) data on the efficiency of respirator filters in filtering biological aerosols; (c) data on face-seal leakage; and (d) data on the characteristics of respirators that were used in conjunction with administrative and engineering controls in outbreak settings where transmission to HCWs and patients was terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The ability to filter particles 1 um in size in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of "95% (i.e., filter leakage of &gt;5%), given flow rates of up to 50 L per minute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available data suggest that infectious droplet nuclei range in size from 1 &mu;m to 5 &mu;m; therefore, respirators used in health-care settings should be able to efficiently filter the smallest particles in this range. Fifty liters per minute is a reasonable estimate of the highest airflow rate an HCW is likely to achieve during breathing, even while performing strenuous work activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit tested in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of &gt;10% ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 54,55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The ability to fit the different facial sizes and characteristics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the respirators available in at least three sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in accordance with OSHA standards and good industrial hygiene practice, by HCWs each time they put on their respirators ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 54,55 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of exposure: (a) inhalation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. tuberculosis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and (b) mucous membrane exposure to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these settings, protection against both types of exposure should be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When operative procedures (or other procedures requiring a sterile field) are performed on patients who may have infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions: (a) it should protect the surgical field from the respiratory secretions of the HCW and (b) it should protect the HCW from infectious droplet nuclei that may be expelled by the patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with expiration valves and positive-pressure respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a respirator that does not have a valve and that meets the criteria in Supplement 4, Section I.A, should be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Specific Respirators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OSHA respiratory protection standard requires that all respiratory protective devices used in the workplace be certified by NIOSH.* NIOSH-approved HEPA respirators are the only currently available air-purifying respirators that meet or exceed the standard performance criteria stated above. However, the NIOSH certification procedures are currently being revised ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 153 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Under the proposed revision, filter materials would be tested at a flow rate of 85 L/min for penetration by particles with a median aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 &mu;m and, if certified, would be placed in one of the following categories: type A, which has "99.97% efficiency (similar to current HEPA filter media); type B, "99% efficiency; or type C, "95% efficiency. According to this proposed scheme, type C filter material would meet or exceed the standard performance criteria specified in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> * <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 CFR 1910.134.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

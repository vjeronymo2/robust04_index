			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- Organisations of  different countries denounced the suppression of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by the  Japanese authorities.    The Central Committee of the Organisation of Workers of  Mozambique in a statement on May 13 said the rash acts of the  Japanese reactionaries against powerful socialist Korea and  Chongnyon are ridiculous, indeed. Japan is stepping up its  conversion into a military power and nuclear power behind the  curtain of such insidious acts, the statement noted.    It said the Japanese reactionaries must stop the suppression  of Chongnyon at once and apologize to the Korean people.    The French Committee for Recognizing the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea in a letter of protest sent to the Japanese  ambassador to France on May 10 branded the suppression of  Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities as an intolerable  violation of human rights and strongly urged a prompt stop to  the suppression.    On the same day, the Portugal-Korea Friendship Association  in  a letter of solidarity to Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central  Standing Committee of Chongnyon, expressed full support to and  solidarity with the Koreans in Japan in the struggle to defend  Chongnyon.    The Central Executive Committee of the National Railway  Workers' Union of Japan published a statement on May 12 and the  Saitama Women's Society for Supporting the Independent and  Peaceful Reunification of Korea sent letters of request to the  prime minister, the director general of the police agency and  the Osaka prefectural police headquarters of Japan on April 29.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Granada breaks ground with hostile LWT bid: Takeover offer is rejected as shake-up of ITV intensifies Granada launched the first hostile takeover bid in British commercial television history that stands a chance of success with an offer for London Weekend Television yesterday. The bid, which values LWT at roughly Pounds 600m, was firmly rejected by Sir Christopher Bland, its chairman. It is further evidence of a fundamental realignment in the ITV system following the government's decision last week to overhaul licensing rules. If parliament approves the proposals, any ITV group will be allowed to own two licences, however large the companies' revenues. Previous bids for ITV companies were blocked by the old Independent Broadcasting Authority. If the Granada-LWT deal were to go through after last week's agreed takeover by Carlton Communications of Central, the Midlands ITV company, the two companies would control more than half ITV's Pounds 1.4bn-a-year advertising revenues. Mr Gerry Robinson, the chief executive of Granada, which broadcasts to the north-west of England, offered six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares, valuing LWT shares at 582p at yesterday's close, with a cash alternative of 528p a share. Unusually, the price offered by Granada, which also has interests in leisure and business services, was at a discount of 0.5 per cent to the LWT share price of 585p on December 3, the last dealing day before the bid's announcement. Granada's shares closed 5p down at 485p and LWT's down 1p at 582p. Mr Robinson emphasised that the offer represented a 54.8 per cent premium on the LWT share price on June 28 when Granada first bought a stake in the company, which broadcasts to the London region at the weekend. The holding now stands at 17.5 per cent. The deal was 'a full and fair' valuation for LWT, he said. It would create a combined company accounting for about 22 per cent of total ITV advertising revenue and reaching 16m viewers at least some time during the week. The Granada offer was accompanied by an announcement of the group's results for the year to October 2 showing a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 176m on a turnover of Pounds 1.6bn. All divisions showed increases in operating profits, with television up 30 per cent to Pounds 43m and a 56 per cent rise in earnings per share to 24.8p. Granada, famous for programmes such as Coronation Street and more recent drama hits such as Cracker and Prime Suspect, also promised cost savings from rationalising the administration and support services of the new company. Granada's northern production centre in Manchester, Mr Robinson said, was custom-built for drama series while LWT studios were ideal for light entertainment production. Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, believed Granada would have to offer between 25p and 30p a share more for LWT. Sir Christopher should then 'roll over' and accept the inevitable, he said. It is far from clear if Sir Christopher and his management team, which collectively own 10 per cent of the company, or shares worth Pounds 60m, would give in at such a price. LWT rejects suggestions from Granada that it is too small and marginalised in the new world of commercial television by arguing that Granada, 'a conglomerate with only 20 per cent of its operating profit derived from television', had little to offer LWT shareholders. LWT believes that, with its stakes in other television companies, it can stand alone. Apart from 14 per cent of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the company has a 20 per cent stake in the loss-making GMTV, the commercial breakfast broadcaster, and 18 per cent in the profit-making Independent Television News.

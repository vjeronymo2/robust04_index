			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDELA, 22 ACTIVISTS DISCUSS STRATEGY AT PRISON;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: HE TELLS VISITORS THAT HE IS READY TO BE FREED AND THAT HE HAS  SET NO PRECONDITIONS.  </P> <P> Black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela and 22 leading anti-apartheid activists  discussed political strategy in a 5 1/2-hour session in his prison home near  here Friday, with participants quoting Mandela as saying he was optimistic that  the problems facing South Africa can be resolved peacefully.  </P> <P> But, in Johannesburg, a peaceful demonstration to celebrate President Frederik  W. de Klerk's week-old steps to open up political expression was marred when  police set upon activists departing the rally and beat some repeatedly with  batons.  </P> <P> The activists, dancing and singing liberation songs, were emerging from St.  Mary's Anglican Church onto downtown streets following a lunchtime service  beneath a church banner that read "Let justice roll down like waters." Police  gave them two minutes to disperse and then moved in, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The meeting with Mandela at Victor Verster prison farm reflected the unusual  dialogue that the imprisoned leader is conducting with black leaders and the  government behind prison walls.  </P> <P> "He appears to be in total control" of his discussions with the government,  said one of the delegates, Dullah Omar, a Mandela family lawyer and  anti-apartheid leader. But, the delegates said, the date of his release remains  in the hands of the government.  </P> <P> Mandela, who has served more than 27 years of a life term for sabotage, told  his visitors he stands ready to be released immediately and has set no  preconditions. But Mandela added that in discussions with De Klerk and other  government officials he has made it clear that his preconditions for  negotiations with the white minority-led government remain the same as those of  the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting Pretoria.  Among those conditions is a complete lifting of the 3 1/2-year state of  emergency and freedom for all prisoners convicted of politically motivated  crimes.  </P> <P> And, Mandela said that once he is released he will "never obey any apartheid  laws," according to Omar.  </P> <P> It was the largest delegation Mandela has yet received at the sprawling,  three-bedroom home he occupies at the prison, and the visitors included most of  the national leaders of the 2-million-member United Democratic Front  anti-apartheid coalition, which is closely aligned with the ANC.  </P> <P> Another sign of the new era that De Klerk has opened in South Africa came on  state-run television Friday night, when South Africans saw an unedited  rebroadcast of ABC-TV's "Nightline" program featuring ANC foreign affairs chief  Thabo Mbeki, South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, and moderate  Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi.  </P> <P> It was the first opportunity for most South Africans, both white and black, to  see and hear a leading ANC official since the organization was banned in 1960.  De Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and about 60 other anti-apartheid groups  last week and removed ANC leaders' names from the list of people who cannot be  seen or quoted in South Africa.  </P> <P> In the broadcast, which was shown in the United States on Thursday night, Botha  acknowledged that the government should have begun talking with the ANC years  ago. Mbeki said the ANC welcomes De Klerk's new reform initiatives but said the  president has to take more steps before the ANC will call off its campaign to  encourage international sanctions against Pretoria and enter into negotiations.  </P> <P> So far, the ANC has refused to engage in any talks with the government,  although Mandela has been acting as a facilitator between the two parties by  setting out the ANC's stand in meetings with government officials.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, De Klerk defended his reforms to Parliament on Friday, saying he is  trying to create a climate in which black leaders will come to the table to  discuss power-sharing in a new constitution.  </P> <P> He accused his right-wing opponents of trying to stir up racial animosity in  the country. The pro-apartheid Conservative Party has criticized De Klerk,  saying he is giving in to the 27 million black majority, and it has threatened  boycotts and protest strikes to force him to call a new election before his  5-year term expires.  </P> <P> De Klerk said his ruling National Party "talks renewal and courage, and they  (the Conservatives) talk racism and aggression."  </P> <P> The Conservatives, who won 31% of the vote in last September's elections, "will  plunge this country into a racial war," De Klerk told Parliament. But, he  added, the government "will not allow anyone or any party to set fire to this  country."  </P> <P> De Klerk has said he wants to bring blacks into the national government within  five years, but he opposes a one-man, one-vote system, which is the basic  demand of all leading anti-apartheid groups.  </P> <P> The United Democratic Front on Friday gave Mandela a new policy document that  conditionally supports negotiations with the government. But the UDF document  also calls for multiracial elections for a constituent assembly to draw up a  new constitution, an idea that De Klerk has rejected.  </P> <P> The president's reform moves have been hampered in recent days as police have  used force to disperse several peaceful protests. De Klerk has said he will  permit peaceful protest if permission is obtained from the authorities.  </P> <P> Anti-apartheid groups have welcomed his initiatives, including the lifting of  restrictions on several hundred political activists and a partial rescinding of  the state of emergency. But they are demanding more.  </P> <P> During Friday's rally in Johannesburg, the Rev. Godfrey Henhood told about  1,000 people packed into St. Mary's that "a major breakthrough has been  achieved. But the struggle is not over. There is much to be done."  </P></p>

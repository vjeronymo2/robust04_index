			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Workers on second Severn crossing to be reinstated Seven hundred construction workers on the second Severn crossing, who were sacked last Thursday for staging a 24-hour strike, are to be reinstated. Laing-GTM, the main contractor for the Pounds 300m crossing between England and Wales, said last night that it had offered to re-engage all the dismissed employees without loss of continuity of service. In return, the unions agreed to suspend industrial action. Work on the bridge is expected to start again on Monday. Nearly half the sacked workers have already left the Severn area in search of other jobs and have to be contacted. The agreement came after a further day of talks between the management and Ucatt, the construction union, and the TGWU and GMB general unions. Last week's strike followed a ballot in favour of limited action in pursuit of higher bonus payments. Laing-GTM said the terms and conditions of employment had been agreed by management and unions and it dismissed the men for breach of contract. Both sides yesterday agreed a statement that, on the resumption of work, they would undertake 'immediate discussions on matters of mutual concern to establish a firm framework for future good working relations'. It is understood the men will be re-employed under their old terms and conditions and that the issue of guaranteed bonus payments will not be part of the immediate discussions.</p>

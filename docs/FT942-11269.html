			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Directors must be responsible Sir, Mr Ian Brindle's concerns (Letters, May 3) about the unlimited liabilities of auditors would be reduced if the appropriate prosecuting bodies took a tougher approach on directors' liabilities. For many employees 'becoming a director' has no more implications than, say, getting a better company car. For the retired businessman 'taking on a few non-executive directorships' is often thought of as a bit of handy fee income in exchange for attending the occasional board meeting. Most such directors have no knowledge of their duties contained in the Companies Act. They may not even realise that they have personal liability for unpaid company Paye/National Insurance, or to unpaid creditors if the company fails having traded knowingly insolvently. I believe that is because the authorities either turn a blind eye, or are too busy to take proceedings against directors. Most of us have dealt with companies where the dominant director(s) has traded into insolvency and then reappeared, phoenix-like, often in the same area of business. Why, we all ask, are these people allowed to get away with it? It may be argued that often many (junior) directors are not privy to the information that enables them to know whether the company is trading within the law. On the other hand 'ignorance' is not treated as a defence in other legal matters. A tougher line on those who are elected as 'stewards' of the company would encourage them to be more realistic about their own policing, or be more appreciative as to what they are asking their auditors to do.

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Trade News: Australia attacks US on trade report to Congress A SIMMERING trade row between Australia and the US flared again yesterday when Canberra responded sharply to criticism from Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative. Senator Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, said a report to the US Congress by Mrs Hills was inaccurate. The report had said trade was distorted by tariffs, customs valuation practices, export incentives and subsidies. Senator Evans said the US had been told 'vigorously' that the allegations were denied by Australia, which has substantially reduced tariff protection over the last decade. He said many US trade practices were 'unquestionably unfair,' especially in areas such as agriculture which were of crucial importance to Australian exporters. 'There is only so much that we can put up with by way of double standards from the US. We do not accept these. . . allegations lying down,' Senator Evans said. His comments follow a series of complaints by Australia about lack of access to the US market, notably in relation to sugar and dairy products, which Canberra claims are virtually closed to imports. Canberra also accuses Washington of using subsidies to poach its Middle East markets for unsubsidised wheat exports. The US says its subsidies are intended to combat subsidised exports from the European Community.</p>

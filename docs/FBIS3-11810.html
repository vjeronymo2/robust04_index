			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] On 24 March the 24 countries that make up the OECD  unanimously agreed to invite Mexico to join the organization.  The formal induction will take place on 14 April. President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that within that organization  Mexico will enhance its presence in the industrialized  countries, particularly in Europe's markets. The president made  these remarks at the ceremony during which the Stability,  Competitiveness and Employment Pact [PECE] was signed.    This was a very timely moment for the private sector,  laborers, peasants, and government to confirm their economic  alliance through PECE. At Los Pinos [presidential palace], the  country's productive sectors totally rejected violence and  repudiated the assassination of PRI [Institutional Revolutionary  Party] candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. They totally rejected  violence and President Carlos Salinas categorically stated that  Mexico will not stray from its course.    [Begin Salinas recording] We unanimously reject every  attempt  to make us lose our course, to distract our efforts, to believe  that a violent offense can discourage Mexico. [end recording]    The president called for unity, saying that the peace  agreements will be fulfilled and adding that only concerted  efforts and full observance of the law will ensure a better  future for the Mexican people.    [Begin Salinas recording] Today we have confirmed that we  will defend the efforts made and the opportunities that have  been created. We will work arm in arm to defend the law; we  will not allow impunity to deprive us of the serenity that will  allow us to move forward. [end recording]    Participants in the meeting dismissed the possibility that  the tragic event in Tijuana has destabilized the Mexican  currency.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Yesterday's tragic  event has not translated today into a crisis in the Mexican  financial market. [end recording]    The labor sector proposed less tolerance of violence.</p>

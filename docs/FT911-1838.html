			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: New head at Paramount unit PARAMOUNT Commun-ications, the US publishing and entertainment company, has appointed Mr Brandon Tartikoff to head its Paramount Pictures unit, writes Karen Zagor. The move ends a month of speculation about who would succeed Mr Frank Mancuso as head of the studio. In a surprise move, Mr Mancuso was eased out as Paramount Pictures chairman in March when Mr Stanley Jaffe was appointed above him as president and chief operating officer of the parent company. Mr Mancuso resigned shortly after the appointment and has filed a Dollars 45m lawsuit against Paramount. Mr Tartikoff, 42, has been employed by NBC, a unit of General Electric, since 1977, and has headed NBC's Entertainment Group since 1990.</p>

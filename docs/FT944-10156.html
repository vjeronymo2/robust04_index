			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (8): Horn and the luck of the Hungarians - Though Gyula Horn is a talented operator, to many he now seems out-of-date / Prime minister interviewed There can be few better measures of the change in eastern Europe than the evolving image of Gyula Horn. As foreign minister in the last Communist government five years ago, he was one of the liberators of the Communist bloc: the man who with a gesture of biblical proportions opened the iron curtain and let the east Germans go free. Now, after four years in opposition, Mr Horn is back in government, this time as Hungary's Socialist prime minister. 'There should be no reservations about the government or me personally,' says Mr Horn. 'We started the transition to democracy in the second half of the 1980s of our own free will, without any pressure. We began creating a multi-party system and the market economy. Now we want to carry this through to the very end.' But eastern Europe has moved on even faster than Mr Horn. A progressive in the 1980s, the 62-year-old Mr Horn still reminds many of the past. 'He doesn't fit into the new European political landscape,' says Mr Janos Martonyi, former state secretary at the foreign ministry. Anti-communists damn the prime minister for his participation in the 'padded jacket' worker's militia that put down Hungary's 1956 uprising against Soviet rule. Even the 1994 version of Mr Horn provokes a shudder or two, at least among Hungary's influential intelligentsia. It may be unfair to judge by demeanour. But according to one prominent banker: 'Wherever Horn appears, everyone thinks of a former communist. No matter what he says.' Hunched in his chair, chain-smoking, rarely meeting the eye, a short man in a prime ministerial office the size of a basketball court, Mr Horn fits the stereotype of the Communist apparatchik. When Mr Horn departs from his script, he has a good line in deadpan humour illustrated by a wry grin. But he can as easily lose his patience with questioning and abruptly terminate an interview. Content is as much at issue as style. Mr Horn, born of a working-class Communist family, is still proud to call himself a leftwinger. But nowadays, he looks not to Marx as the fount of his socialism but to Pope John Paul II. 'The head of the Catholic church and the Vatican say capital is blind and deaf to social differences - that is why policymakers have to interfere.' The Socialist leader's left-leaning beliefs reflect the opinions of his constituency. Hungary had a communist government for four decades and egalitarian ideals remain strong. Many voters opted for the Socialists because they promised security and support for the losers in the transition. These, not Budapest's chattering intellectuals nor judgemental westerners, are the people Mr Horn cares about. 'My model is Janos Kovacs, the ordinary simple person on the street who can tolerate the zigzags that politicians make and tell what is genuine and what false.' Aides say he really means that. Uncomfortable in parliament and before western investors, Mr Horn nevertheless shows a real rapport with crowds that is rare among east European politicians. 'These are my waters,' he says. 'I can really feel good among people.' This popular touch makes Mr Horn in a sense a better democrat than his conservative predecessors who supported the idea that the people should rule in theory but were always disappointed in the character of the Hungarian masses. Mr Horn is a talented operator behind closed doors as well as on the public stage. He doggedly held his party together when it seemed doomed to extinction. Now he plays the arbiter between technocrats, trade unionists and the myriad groups within the broad and heterogeneous governing party. As foreign minister, Mr Horn visited the US. A former aide tells how a US state department official offered an insulting 15-minute audience. Mr Horn accepted, said his piece, smiled, got up and politely left the open-mouthed US official after 10 minutes. The genius of Mr Horn's tactics can be overdone. The prime minister has a tendency to make up policy on the hoof. 'I think Horn is a disaster,' says Mr Tamas Bacskai, chairman of Unicbank. 'Improvisation is wonderful if it is done by Moliere, but he is not a good improviser.' Nevertheless most people, whatever their criticisms, share the view of Mr Janos Bartha, managing director of CS First Boston in Budapest. 'I think that Horn is an absolutely professional politician,' he says. The question is whether the Socialist premier can be not just a consummate politician but a leader too: one who can understand Hungary's economic plight and convince the people to accept unpopular measures. Mr Laszlo Urban, economics spokesman of the opposition Young Democrats, has his doubts: 'He lets conflicts emerge, evaluates whose position is what and then tries to please everybody.' Even the government spokesperson concedes that Mr Horn likes to be liked. That makes the prime minister somewhat unpredictable, a bit of a weather vane, but not necessarily a man without principle. Mr Horn's socialism is of the born-and-bred variety. But he has another vision which sits uneasily with his ideological conviction. 'Perhaps it might sound like a kind of slogan,' he says, 'but I want a Hungary which does not differ from the developed countries.' But that line has become a cliche in eastern Europe and does not impress many Hungarian opinion leaders. 'I don't think he has a vision beyond Saturday, no, make that Friday,' says Mr Laszlo Csaba of the Kopint-Datorg economic research institute. Visionary leadership, however, may count for more in the confused countries of the former Communist bloc than in the settled west. Mr Vaclav Klaus appears to have made a real difference for the better in the Czech Republic. In Mr Bacskai's view, Hungary also had an 'outstanding statesman' in Janos Kadar, general secretary of the Communist party between 1956 and 1988. 'In 50 years a country is lucky to have one such man,' the banker says. Hungary, he suggests, has run out of its allocation.</p>

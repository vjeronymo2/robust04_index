			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CARSON FACED TOUGH ODDS FROM THE START  </P> <P> Circumstances may have doomed Dave Carson to failure at Hart High long before  he was forced to resign after just one season as coach of one of the area's  most successful football programs.  </P> <P> Principal Laurence Strauss called for Carson's resignation Thursday and then  installed defensive coordinator Tim Azevedo as interim coach after meeting with  the staff Friday.  </P> <P> Carson ran a successful program at Burbank for five years before enduring a  disappointing first season in 1988 in which the Indians finished 6-5, failed to  win the league title and lost in the first round of the Southern Section  playoffs. But problems ran deeper than that. Strauss cited philosophical  differences between himself and Carson, who claims the principal told him he  must resign because he ran a negative program and used obscene language.  </P> <P> Strauss said Thursday that he reprimanded Carson last year for excessive use of  profanity with players. At a meeting in April, according to Carson, Strauss  directed him to create a more positive attitude and clean up his language.  Carson claims he worked toward those goals, instituting a no-swearing policy on  the team. He said that he was shocked by his dismissal.  </P> <P> "Strauss said I didn't make any changes and was incapable of making changes,"  Carson said. "I'm disappointed that I didn't have ample opportunity to make  those changes. That hurts. I may not be the right coach for Hart but I still  know that I'm a good football coach and teacher."  </P> <P> Although his Burbank players support that assertion, some at Hart remain  unconvinced. They characterize him as an overzealous disciplinarian, a coach  given to yelling fits who too often pointed out his players' shortcomings while  overlooking their successes. Quarterback Rob Westervelt, who passed for 2,130  yards and 21 touchdowns last season as a junior, said that he was relieved when  he learned of Carson's ouster.  </P> <P> "I'm sad for him but I'm glad he's not there," he said. "It's the best thing  for the program. It was evident very early that it wasn't working out. There  were too many negatives. Everyone was afraid to mess up because you'd get  yelled at."  </P> <P> Brian Allen, Hart's All-Southern Section tight end who has signed with UCLA,  echoed those sentiments. "I hate to say this but everyone disliked him," Allen  said. "We just didn't play well for him. You have to teach kids, not just yell  at them. There was always a lot of tension in the air."  </P> <P> Some of that tension may have preceded Carson. He replaced the popular Rick  Scott, an easygoing man with a folksy touch with his players. He frequently  punctuated practices with jokes and made sure his players enjoyed themselves.  </P> <P> Scott also was a winner. In the four seasons before he resigned to coach Buena  High in Ventura, he led Hart to four consecutive Foothill League titles and 20  consecutive league wins, including four over Burbank. He also coached the  Indians to the Southern Section Northwestern Conference championship in 1986  and compiled a 41-9-2 record before moving to Ventura.  </P> <P> "They could have hired Don Shula or Vince Lombardi reincarnated and he would  have a tough time following Rick Scott," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said. "Carson  is a very intelligent coach with a great football mind but is obviously more  the disciplinarian than Scott."  </P> <P> Players chafed under Carson's rule but they had a gripe before he arrived.  After Scott resigned, a group representing the players asked Strauss to hire  popular assistant coach Mike Herrington and his brothers Rick and Dean, but  when Strauss chose Carson, he may have inadvertently stacked the deck against  his new coach.  </P> <P> "The players wanted the Herringtons and people didn't like Carson from the  beginning," said Brian LaMarre, last year's starting defensive tackle and an  assistant freshman coach this year. "After the first game, the players shut him  off. They thought they could do it on their own. The players are spoiled. When  they didn't get their way, they'd go cry to their parents who would talk to  Strauss. Sometimes as a person Coach Carson got on my nerves, but I thought he  was a great coach."  </P> <P> Carson didn't help his cause when he directed a a racial slur at Howard  Blackwell, a black running back, after he fumbled during a game last year  against Schurr. Carson said he immediately apologized to Blackwell and later  apologized to him in front of the team.  </P> <P> Carson says that he is free from racism and regrets hurting Blackwell. "I made  a mistake and took appropriate action by saying I was sorry," he said.  </P> <P> Burbank lineman John Cotti, who played for Carson as a junior and will play for  Cal State Fullerton this fall, remembers a different man from the one portrayed  by some Hart players.  </P> <P> "He was there for you if you needed him," he said. "His players came first and  he made us feel special. He had a lot of discipline and didn't put up with crap  from anyone, but that's why we had a good team. I liked him a lot and I'd play  for him again."  </P> <P> Carson, 41, wants another chance to convince players he has those coaching  skills. He sold his house in Pasadena and moved to Saugus when he took the Hart  job. He has a contract to teach physical education there this school year but  will look for other coaching jobs.  </P> <P> His faith in his coaching abilities remains unshaken and he regrets that he was  denied more time to sell the Hart players on his program.  </P> <P> "I was a different personality than what they were used to and it was a  difficult adjustment for them," he said. "The Burbank kids bought my program,  but the Hart kids never did.  </P> <P> "They may have looked down on me because Hart always beat us at Burbank. One  kid asked me what was the most games I won in a season. I told him seven and  these kids were used to winning 10, 11, 12 games a year. I don't think I  convinced the kids that I could lead them to a championship. I had to earn my  rite of passage and I don't think they ever accepted me."  </P> <P> Azevedo, 32, joined Hart last year after five years as an assistant at St.  Joseph High in Santa Maria, his alma mater. He also served as an assistant for  three years at Eastern Oregon State College where he was as an offensive  lineman.  </P> <P> Strauss said that Azevedo will run the program until the first week of August  and that any future hire would also be on an interim basis. Next year, Strauss  said, a permanent coach would be selected after interviews and a full-scale  background check.  </P> <P> "The position will be interim, whether its someone from outside our staff or  within our staff," he said. "Because of the time element, there's no way we can  implement the normal selection process."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S.D. POLICE ARREST 128 PROTESTING ABORTIONS  </P> <P> San Diego police using "pain compliance" methods arrested 128 anti-abortion  demonstrators Saturday in a hallway at the Midway Medical Center, where they  blocked women from entering the offices of a doctor they say performs  abortions.  </P> <P> In a maneuver designed to trick police and counter-demonstrators, the abortion  protesters picketed quietly outside three other locations in the Hillcrest area  Saturday morning, allowing patients to enter. Those protesters dispersed just  before noon.  </P> <P> While police and pro-choice advocates focused on the Hillcrest locations,  another group of anti-abortion demonstrators converged about 11:45 a.m. in a  first floor hallway at the Midway center outside the office of Dr. Phillip  Rand, an obstetrician and gynecologist. The center is next to Sharp Cabrillo  Hospital in the Loma Portal neighborhood.  </P> <P> By the time police and pro-choice counter demonstrators arrived, the  anti-abortion goup was firmly ensconced inside the medical center hallway. They  apparently prevented all of Rand's patients from entering Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> "We didn't know. I think that's fairly obvious," said Dave Cohen, a spokesman  for the San Diego Police Department. "We assumed the demonstration was over,  but obviously they had planned this."  </P> <P> Cohen said that after the demonstrators arrived, a woman who had gone to Rand's  office because she was experiencing a tubal pregnancy had to be escorted on  foot to the emergency room at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital. "She was very  distraught," Cohen said.  </P> <P> Through his answering service, Rand said he did not enter the office Saturday  and had no further comment on the day's events.  </P> <P> The San Diego demonstrations were part of a nationwide anti-abortion push  called "Operation Rescue," which brought hundreds of arrests Saturday in cities  throughout the country and prompted a large turnout of counter-demonstrators.  </P> <P> The San Diego demonstrators, who call  </P> <P> themselves Project Rescue, are under a federal court injunction won by the  American Civil Liberties Union ordering them not to block the entrances to the  clinics and offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 117 Arrested  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, 117 people were arrested as they tried to block access to the  office of a Hillcrest doctor.  </P> <P> There were no federal officials on hand Saturday to enforce the injunction at  the Midway Medical Center. Instead, about 60 San Diego police officers, acting  on a complaint from medical center officials, gave the demonstrators at least  two opportunities to leave, Cohen said.  </P> <P> "They have been repeatedly told they are in violation of the law," he said.  "None of them got up and left."  </P> <P> Police then began a tedious process of arresting the demonstrators one-by-one  and removing them from the building. After several hours, the demonstrators  agreed to leave in groups of about 20.  </P> <P> Protesters who resisted or went limp were put in "pain-compliance holds," Cohen  said. Frequently, this involved the use of nunchakus, hard plastic handles with  nylon rope strung between them. The rope is wrapped around a subject's arms and  squeezed with the handles to cause pain sufficient to make the person stand up  and walk on his own. A number of demonstrators left the building walking, but  groaning.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Charged With Trespassing  </P> <P> All were charged with trespassing and those who would not walk out on their own  also were charged with resisting arrest. All 128 arrested were cited and  released.  </P> <P> "Our goals and objectives are always the same, to prevent the killing of unborn  children," said Sylvia Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Project Rescue.  </P> <P> Earlier Saturday, about 150 men, women and children from Project Rescue sang  religious songs and prayed as they paced the sidewalks in front of Womancare  Clinic at 2850 6th Ave., and the building that houses the offices of Dr. Donald  G. Byrnes at 3330 3rd Ave. They also picketed another of Rand's offices, at  3367 4th Ave.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Photos of Fetuses  </P> <P> The anti-abortion protesters displayed photographs of fetuses, while about 40  counter-demonstrators representing Planned Parenthood and the National  Organization for Women carried signs and shouted slogans at the Project Rescue  marchers across the street.  </P> <P> Members of pro-choice groups were waiting with a long net early Saturday as the  anti-abortion demonstrators arrived at the Womancare offices. The pro-choice  advocates strung the net in front of the building, closing off a courtyard and  preventing the demonstrators from getting close to the building entrance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Escorted Women  </P> <P> "Operation Rescue's efforts have totally failed," said Patricia O'Neil,  associate director of Womancare who, along with about 20 others donned  fluorescent orange vests and escorted women into the building. O'Neil said the  clinic saw its normal load of about 40 women Saturday morning.  </P> <P> Cohen said the anti-abortion demonstrators apparently had not prevented anyone  from entering the offices at any of the three Hillcrest locations.  </P> <P> "All the babies who were scheduled to die today were, in fact killed," said Dr.  Robert Barron Jr., a physician who picketed with Project Rescue outside  Womancare.  </P> <P> The anti-abortion protesters approached women as they stepped out of their cars  in the near the Hillcrest locations and asked them if they were there to have  an abortion. Almost immediately, pro-choice "escorts" intervened to help the  women past the demonstrators.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Womancare workers tried to pass out condoms to the anti-abortion  demonstrators.  </P></p>

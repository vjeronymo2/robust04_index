			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Clinton officials give Whitewater evidence Three White House officials yesterday gave evidence in secret to a federal grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair. A stack of documents were also turned over to the same panel, convened by Mr Robert Fiske, the independent counsel probing Whitewater. First to be called was Ms Margaret Williams, chief of staff to Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who said afterwards she was encouraged to be involved in a process 'where the finding of fact is important, as opposed to innuendo and rumour-mongering and gossip and sensationalism.' She was followed by Ms Lisa Caputo, the first lady's press secretary, and Mr Mark Gearan, White House director of communications. All are said to have attended meetings with regulatory officials investigating Madison Guaranty, the failed savings and loan institution at the centre of the Whitewater affair, involving Mr and Mrs Clinton's 1980s financial dealings in Arkansas. Seven more senior White House and Treasury officials have secured postponement of testimony, most until next week. But one of them, Mr Roger Altman, deputy Treasury secretary, confessed to the Wall Street Journal yesterday to 'a piece of awful judgment' in arranging a meeting on February 2 with the White House to discuss the status of the Madison inquiry. He was then acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency formed to clean up the nationwide savings and loan debacle of the 1980s. He said he never told President or Mrs Clinton, or Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, in advance about his initiative, and insisted the session was purely informational. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, again alleging tampering with official inquiries, said Mr Altman should resign, as should Mr Webster Hubbell, associate attorney general and formerly a partner in Mrs Clinton's Little Rock law firm. The White House said resignation was not on the cards, but Mr Altman's star in Washington has been much dimmed. Also, 82 Republican congressmen yesterday demanded an investigation into an old story: Mrs Clinton's participation in an investment partnership accused of profiting by short-selling drugs stocks last year when she was attacking pharmaceutical companies for overcharging. Both Mr and Mrs Clinton sought to give the impression of business as usual yesterday, the president speaking in New York and the first lady attending a healthcare meeting on Capitol Hill. The threat of early congressional hearings on Whitewater, which Mr Fiske said could interfere with his inquiries, appeared to recede. Senator William Cohen, Maine Republican, doubted they could be held before June. The president could also take some encouragement from two polls published yesterday which showed that, notwith standing a torrent of critical and now nationwide media coverage, the public is still unpersuaded of the seriousness of Whitewater.</p>

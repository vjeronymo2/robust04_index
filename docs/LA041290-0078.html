			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: CUT-IT-YOURSELF SIRLOIN CAN ADD UP TO LARGE SAVINGS FOR A FAMILY  </P> <P> Recently I was shopping at a market in Baton Rouge, La., for meats for cooking  classes I was teaching in Cajun-Creole country. In the supermarket meat case  were barbecue steaks ($3.99 per pound), steak for etoufee ($3.89 per pound),  grillades ($4.19 per pound.), strips of lean beef for stir-fry ($4.49 per  pound) and lean cubes of beef for kebabs ($3.89 per pound).  </P> <P> Not 10 feet from the section of the meat case containing the above cuts was a  section of the meat case displaying, among other items, sirloin tip roast -- on  sale for $1.79 per pound. You had to buy the whole sirloin tip -- each of which  weighed between 10 pounds and 12 pounds -- but considering all the things that  you can do with one, the size should not be a deterrent. The sirloin tip is the  sub-primal cut from which all of the fancy cuts mentioned above are derived.  </P> <P> By doing a little cutting up in the kitchen, you can obtain barbecue steaks for  $1.79 per pound instead of $3.99 per pound. You can get strips for stir-fry,  grillades to do with grits, and cuts for kebabs at a fraction of what you would  pay if the butcher cut them for you.  </P> <P> And even if they aren't on special at $1.79 per pound, whole sirloin tips are  available at most markets just as they come from the packer, still in its  plastic vacuum packaging. With a little work, you can stock a freezer with many  beef meals at a bargain price. (Freezing meat has little effect on its  quality.)  </P> <P> A sub-primal sirloin tip easily can be divided to meet family needs. The tip  consists of two main muscles, a small one on top the cap and a large one called  the ball tip that makes up most of the piece.  </P> <P> Start by removing the cap, along with the fat that covers it, from the ball  tip. This is accomplished more simply by pulling than by any tricky knife work.  There is a natural seam that separates the two muscles.  </P> <P> Trim the fat away from the cap muscle and slice the cap into thin strips to use  for stir-fry or stroganoff.  </P> <P> What you do with the remaining ball tip is limited by little but imagination.  Split it in half, use one half for a roast and cut the other half into steaks  as thick or as thin as you like. Or slice a thick steak off one side for London  broil, then divide the rest into roasts, slice it for steaks or cut it into  cubes for kebabs or fondue.  </P></p>

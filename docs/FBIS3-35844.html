In an interview with  reporters after the closed-door session of the upper house of  the Russian parliament on Monday, he said that the head of the  temporary authority Vladimir Lozovoy, appointed by the  president, is not competent enough for his post. Aushev said  that due to Lozovoy's position as head of the administration,  the presidential decree on returning Ingush refugees to the  Prigorodnyy District is not being fulfilled.    Aushev also said that the Federation Council decided to  prepare a resolution where it will propose to the president to  introduce changes in the decree on a longer state of emergency.  He believes it necessary to introduce special rule on the  territory of the Prigorodny District where all power would go  over to the head of the administration, as well as to withdraw  all North Ossetian armed units from the District. "Only federal  law enforcement bodies can provide calm in the zone," believes  Aushev.    He said that North Ossetian President Galazov has a  different  view on these problems and is against the return of Ingush  refugees.    The president of North Ossetia, deputy to the Federation  Council Galazov, supports the president's decree on the whole,  but criticizes some of its provisions. In an interview with  Interfax, he said that in line with the decree, the help that is  being rendered to the republic through the temporary authority  will continue depending on how constructive talks are between  North Ossetia and Ingushetia.    No one is able to determine the degree of a constructive  dialogue. To place such conditions means a lack of common  sense, he said. He believes that those who drafted the document  asked the president to sign the unfinalized document.    Galazov expressed regret that the proposals and remarks on  the draft decree sent by representatives of North Ossetia were  not taken into account.</p>

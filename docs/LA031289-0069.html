			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A new federal indictment leveled additional charges against former Philippine  President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The superceding indictment  returned in New York accused the Marcoses of illegally funneling an additional  $77 million into the United States. The initial racketeering conspiracy  indictment last October accused the Marcoses and eight co-defendants of looting  the Philippine treasury of more than $100 million, buying Manhattan real estate  and expensive artworks, and of defrauding U.S. banks on more than $165 million  in loans to Marcos properties. The Marcoses have lived in exile in Hawaii since  February, 1986.  </P></p>

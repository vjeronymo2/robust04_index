			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today was the last day of Army General Raul Castro's  tour of the Western Army. The inspection, which began in  December, began today with a visit to the San Antonio de los  Banos Air Base. Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura;  Division General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, chief of the Western  Army; and Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist  Party of Cuba [PCC] in Havana, as well as other secretaries,  ministers, and PCC officials, accompanied Castro.    The briefing on the combat readiness of the base was  presented by Colonel Marrero Hernandez, chief of this historical  air base which opened fire against the mercenary planes on the  eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion and from which our scarce planes  and intrepid pilots departed to confront the enemy in the Bay of  Pigs. This base's revolutionary fire also frightened the U.S.  from its overflights during the October Crisis. Despite special  period difficulties, this large air and anti-air unit maintains  its combat readiness and the spirit of struggle from those  glorious days. It is also known for its pilots' participation in  internationalist missions in Ethiopia and Angola.    Castro showed interest in learning of the personnel's living  conditions, food, housing, and other aspects of life on the  base. He was told of a recent presentation of homes, and the  progress made in several dozen more, which are to be completed  this year. The food situation is improving to the extent that  the unit's farming program develops, thanks to the unit's  self-sufficiency efforts. They presently have over 700 hectares  of arable land within the base's perimeter. Castro stated: "Let  there not be a single corner left unplanted."    Raul and his companions expressed interest in the  characteristics of several planes. Lieutenant Col. Perez Perez,  who had been a Camilito student, and later an  internationalist-mission ace pilot, explained the capabilities  of the antisubmarine helicopter [Mi-14] and Mig-29 [Fulcrum]  fighters. An intense emulation program exists among the diverse  Western Army maintenance units and those that contribute to the  construction of extensive fortification projects such as the  Sugar Industry Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry, and the Blas  Roca Contingent.    Raul presented emulation awards to a brigade of the Blas  Roca  that is working on project No. 70, and to the company working on  project No. 26 in the depths of the earth of the fatherland.  Both units surpassed their 1993 plans, as well as the required  quality parameters. Raul extended warm words of experience to  the dedicated soldiers and civilian workers, and toured the  underground facility that will be completed this year.    At the well-known Sonrisa de la Victoria Camp of Farm No. 2  of the Guira de Melena Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise, Raul and  his companions conducted a thorough analysis of the work of the  Youth Labor Army [EJT], which took over the management of this  enterprise two months ago. The positive changes effected during  this brief period were emphasized. The EJT has implemented a new  annual plan structured according to week, type of farm, and  crop; production and consumption norms, and a workday never  shorter than eight hours. The plan will be adjusted to changing  conditions resulting from increases in productivity, weather,  shortages, and other factors. This farm has approximately 39  caballerias of fertile soil, and is 95-percent irrigated. The  annual plan foresees producing 11,500 tons of tubers, grains,  plantains, and garden vegetables. The work force consists of 221  EJT soldiers and 62 farmers. Over 91 percent of the workers are  directly involved with the land. Seventy percent of the fuel  will be used for irrigation, only 20 percent for agrarian  machinery, since 31 ox teams will reduce the need for tractors.  The remaining 10 percent will be used mainly for transportation,  plus a minimal amount for administration work.    According to Division General Rigoberto Garcia Fernandez,  chief of the EJT, this situation is repeated in another 19 farms  under EJT management, which is 40 percent of the state lands  used for miscellaneous crops in Havana. The EJT has about 5,000  soldiers and regular workers in the province. The plan for 1994  is to surpass 4.5 million quintals.    Another aspect analyzed in the meeting was the fight against  crime and the operation of the Unified Vigilance and Protection  System, based on the experiences of Guira de Melena  municipality, and on the premises of the report presented by PCC  provincial leader Pedro Zaez.    The presence and contributions of Division General Carlos  Fernandez Condin, Interior Ministry first vice minister; Justice  Minister Carlos Amat; Supreme Court President Jose Raul Amaro;  and Attorney General Juan Escalona enriched the discussion of  this important issue which is more critical in a large food  production area so close to the capital. A resolute effort  against crime was noticed. It was stressed that the  understanding of the mode of operation of cattle rustlers and  agrarian product thieves should result in more specific measures  within the framework of Cuban law.    Raul spoke briefly to the farmworkers, told them of the  ideas  discussed at the meeting, and expressed his hope for them to  achieve new and better work results, productivity, resource  conservation, cost reductions, and high agrarian yields to  benefit our people's food needs.    Raul also briefly visited the Western Army intelligence unit  where he was briefed on how this unit satisfactorily fulfills  its mission. Raul showed great interest in the diverse  facilities of the unit, and its outstanding and sophisticated  equipment for the mission of discovering the enemies' plans for  aggression against Cuba. Raul also observed a dexterous  demonstration of martial exercises by the troops.    The final stop in the tour was a visit to an antiair  regiment  where a brief demonstration of the operation of a modern SAM  [surface to air missile] unit was observed. Central Committee  members Eusebio Leal and Felipe Perez were invited to attend  this final leg of the itinerary. The minister's final words,  closing the extensive tour, were brief and eloquent: "The  Western Army is in outstanding shape and is successfully  fulfilling the five strategic goals of the Ministry of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces. The western part of Cuba, as well as  the entire island is an undefeatable bulwark."</p>

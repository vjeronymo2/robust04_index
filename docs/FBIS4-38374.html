			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and Pavel </F> Spirin]    [Text] Beijing, 29 May -- The visit to China by Viktor  Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, has been  completed and he has left the north-eastern Chinese town of  Dalian for home. A communique on the results of the visit notes  that it was a complete success.    At the meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and talks  with State Council Premier Li Peng, which were held in a  friendly, businesslike, and constructive atmosphere, there was  satisfaction that fruitful cooperation in the political,  economic, scientific- technical, cultural, military, and  law-protection spheres had been established.    During the Russian prime minister's four-day official visit,  seven intergovernmental documents were signed and willingness  was expressed to go on expanding and extending Russian-Chinese  cooperation in all directions. The parties confirmed their  commitment to the principles established in the joint  declaration on the basis of cooperation between Russia and China  signed during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Beijing in  December 1992. They declared their resolve to move their good  neighborly and amicable interstate links into a new stage of  development.    The parties are firmly convinced that long-term and stable  relations of good neighborliness, friendship, and mutually  beneficial cooperation aimed at the 21st century meet the  fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples and are  an important factor for peace, stability, and development in the  Asia- Pacific Ocean region and the world as a whole.    The further development of Russian-Chinese cooperation in  trade and the economy and in science and technology occupied a  central place in the talks and the parties expressed their  intention to give this greater priority. Since cross-border and  interregional cooperation is becoming an essential, constituent  part of these relations, the desire was stressed for cooperation  in manufacturing and on joint investment projects at regional  level.    Russia and the People's Republic of China also intend to  develop military-technical links while observing both sides'  international obligations.    There was positive assessment of the Russian-Chinese talks  on  border questions and the mutual reduction in the Armed Forces  and confidence-building measures in the military sphere in the  border region. Compliance with the spirit and letter of the  agreement on the state border on its eastern part was  reaffirmed. The sides intend to continue their talks on  outstanding problems, and also to intensify preparations for the  agreement on the Russian-Chinese state border on its western  part.    The importance of reaching an early agreement on a mutual  reduction in Armed Forces and confidence-building measures in  the military sphere in the border region was noted at the talks.  It was felt mutually that the further reaffirmation at the  border between the two countries of an atmosphere of peace,  good-neighborliness, and cooperation not only contributes to a  deepening of mutual trust and mutual understanding in  Russian-Chinese inter-state relations, but also favors security  and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.    During the course of an exchange of opinions between  Chernomyrdin and the Chinese leadership on questions of the  socioeconomic changes in Russia and China, the usefulness of  mutual knowledge of the theory and practice of reforms and  exchange of experience, with due regard for the specific  characteristics of the two countries, in order to assist in  deepening an understanding of the situation in Russia and in  China, was noted.    The document notes the proximity or coincidence of the views  of the two countries on fundamental international problems and  their intention to strengthen their multitiered, constructive  cooperation in regional and world affairs, which is an important  factor for stability and security in Asia and for the overall  improvement of the situation in the world. The importance of  multilateral, economic cooperation in north-east Asia and in the  Asia-Pacific Ocean region was acknowledged.    The parties agreed to maintain and develop active dialogue  at  all levels including the highest as they believe that this is of  great significance for the further expansion of mutual  understanding and mutual trust and the uninterrupted development  of good-neighborly and amicable relations and mutually  advantageous cooperation between Russia and China.    On behalf of the Russian Government, Viktor Chernomyrdin  invited Premier Li Peng to make an official visit to Russia in  1995.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S NO. 1? HEY, IT'S SDSU'S AREY!  </P> <P> The nation's top receiver sat on the bench outside of the San Diego State  locker room trying to sort it all out.  </P> <P> Since the latest NCAA statistics came out Sunday, Dennis Arey has spent the  week feeling like a guy who just found out the prettiest girl in school has a  crush on him.  </P> <P> He's thrilled. He's trying to figure out how it happened. He's a little  embarrassed by all of the attention.  </P> <P> "I looked in the mirror the other day and thought that people probably look at  me and say, 'Damn, that kid plays receiver? Him?' " Arey said.  </P> <P> He is averaging 115.20 receiving yards a game, which makes him the nation's top  pass receiver and the Aztecs' leading joke receiver.  </P> <P> He sat there, attempting to downplay his current status, but that lasted as  long as it took before a teammate walked by. Then he would receive some  sarcastic comment, handle it almost as smoothly as he catches a Dan McGwire  pass, then downplay some more. And another teammate would walk by.  </P> <P> And so on.  </P> <P> "No. 1," offensive lineman Nick Subis said.  </P> <P> Arey smiled. He looked down.  </P> <P> "Guys like that," Arey said. "He shows it is due to everyone. He's giving Dan  time to throw, Dan throws the ball, and Patrick (Rowe) and I are just catching  it."  </P> <P> This is Arey's first defense. Deflect some of his accomplishment to his  teammates.  </P> <P> Then someone else walked by.  </P> <P> "Remember my autograph," freshman receiver Curtis Shearer said.  </P> <P> "See?" Arey said.  </P> <P> He flashed a smile, and you thought maybe he would be perfect playing the lead  in a school play.  </P> <P>  That kid plays receiver? Him?  </P> <P>  Him. That's A-R-E-Y. He's a senior, 5-feet-11, 185 pounds, from Fountain  Valley High School.  </P> <P> You look at his numbers. He is sixth in the nation and fourth in the Western  Athletic Conference with an average of six receptions a game. Last week against  Wyoming, he became only the third SDSU player to put together four consecutive  games of 100 or more yards receiving. It was the best game of his career: eight  catches, 171 yards, three touchdowns.  </P> <P> He leads the team with 31 receptions. Entering the 1990 season, he had only 33  in his career.  </P> <P> That explains why not everybody is giving Arey a hard time when they find out  he is leading the nation's receivers in yards per game.  </P> <P> "He is?" Coach Al Luginbill asked. "I don't get wrapped up in statistics. . . .  That's neat for our football team and university that Dennis has that."  </P> <P> Arey takes football seriously, works hard and runs his routes with pinpoint  accuracy. That, and that he is quicker than he looks, makes him a threat.  </P> <P> "I think people underestimate Dennis' speed," Luginbill said. "He's fast enough  to play anywhere.  </P> <P> "He has a great awareness of the passing game. He knows where the ball is going  to be thrown, and he's learned to come back to the football. He's got excellent  feet and agility and a great work habit, too."  </P> <P> Said McGwire, Arey's roommate: "He's a hard worker and a great learner. He  always wants to learn how to run the right routes against different coverages.  He's always asking CJ (receivers coach Curtis Johnson) how, why. . . . He's  great. I can go out Saturday and have extreme confidence that I know where he's  going to be."  </P> <P> As in SDSU's 48-18 victory against Air Force two Saturdays ago. With no score  in the first quarter, McGwire and Arey hooked up for a 71-yard touchdown pass.  Arey was not the primary receiver; he was just running a clear-out route down  the left sideline. But McGwire looked Arey's way and saw that Arey had given  the slip to his defender and was wide open. Touchdown.  </P> <P> "I think all of the hard work he's done has paid off," McGwire said.  </P> <P> For one thing, Arey is relaxed this season.  </P> <P> "I've been happy," Arey said. "I think that's the biggest thing. It's my senior  year." While Arey has been at SDSU, since 1986, luck has sometimes been tougher  on him than an opposing cornerback. He redshirted in 1986, then missed most of  the 1987 season because of a stomach virus. He played in 1988, mostly in a  back-up role, and he finally cracked the starting lineup in 1989 -- and missed  three games with a hamstring pull.  </P> <P> Now, for the most part, life is first downs and touchdowns.  </P> <P> "Everything has turned around for me," he said.  </P> <P> Everything, that is, except the team's success. The Aztecs have struggled  early, getting off to a 2-3 start. The offense is starting to fire on all  cylinders, but the defense has been another story. Arey goes out, gets his 100  yards receiving a game, contributes quite a bit to an offense that is averaging  38 points a game . . . and then watches the defense give up 39.  </P> <P> The Wyoming game, the best of Arey's career, was a 52-51 loss.  </P> <P> "I had a great game, but we lost," Arey said simply. "And I contributed."  </P> <P> He and Patrick Rowe miscommunicated on a kickoff, fumbled and turned the ball  over to Wyoming in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys went 17 yards for the  go-ahead touchdown and a 45-38 lead.  </P> <P> Now, the Aztecs and their leading receiver face a trip to the Rose Bowl to meet  UCLA this week. Arey hasn't said much about this week's game. Memories of last  year's 28-25 UCLA victory still burn in his mind.  </P> <P> "I think that was my most depressing time," said Arey, who caught five passes  for 88 yards.  </P> <P> The Aztecs trailed, 28-25, with 1:23 left and had a fourth-and-10 on UCLA's 47.  McGwire threw an out pass to Arey for what would have been a first down . . .  but Arey caught it out of bounds.  </P> <P> "I didn't drag my feet," he said.  </P> <P> And that was it. UCLA got the ball back and ran out the clock.  </P> <P> Now, he and SDSU will get another chance.  </P> <P> "Coach told us, if we win, it will heal a lot of wounds," Arey said.  "Especially this one for me, personally. I proved a lot to myself when we  played against them last year."  </P> <P> Until Saturday, there will be jokes. Someone will ask him something, and he  won't hear it, and next thing he knows, that person will be telling him, 'Oh,  you're No. 1. You won't talk to me.' Or, in the middle of a conversation with  someone, that person will suddenly say something like, 'Oh my gosh, I'm talking  to the number one receiver.' "  </P> <P> Arey takes it in stride, but deep down, it bothers him a little. He's a  friendly kid, not a cocky superstar. He's like your favorite old next-door  neighbor who wanted nothing more on a Saturday than a game of catch. Now, all  he wants is to be an important part of a winning team.  </P> <P> So he practices, and gets ready for UCLA, knowing he could fall a few notches  on the NCAA chart after any game. He and fellow receiver Jimmy Raye continue to  dig up sports trivia questions to stump Johnson, something they started a few  days ago. It's an ongoing rivalry between the coach and his receivers, and  Johnson claims he's ahead.  </P> <P> For Arey, it's all part of keeping things in perspective. His ranking is like a  good book -- something to be put away, with care, until some cloudy winter's  day when he has time to pull it out and enjoy it. Right now, he would like a  few more victories. He knows that eventually, he will be the answer to an SDSU  trivia question.  </P> <P> He just doesn't want that question to be: Who led the nation in yards receiving  per game for just one week in 1990 on a losing team?  </P> <P> AREY IT OUT  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.55IN:1.56IN:1.56IN:1.45IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Opponent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rec.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Yds.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> TDs  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Oregon  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 51  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> CS Long Beach  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 117  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Brigham Young  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 133  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Air Force  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 104  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Wyoming  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 171  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Totals  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 576  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

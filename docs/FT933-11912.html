			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Saudis take Dutch terminal stake TEXACO of the US is selling a large part of its stake in a Rotterdam crude oil terminal to Saudi-controlled Aramco Overseas, giving the Saudis their first foothold in European storage facilities, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. Texaco Raffinerderij Pernis said it would reduce its stake in the Rotterdam-based Texaco/Esso Maatschap Crude Oil Terminal, a joint venture formed in 1962 by Esso Nederland and Caltex Petroleum Maatschappij Nederland. Aramco Overseas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Company, will acquire a 34.35 per cent stake in the storage facilities, marking the group's move toward a more permanent presence in Europe. Previously, the company had used only of leased storage capacity. Through the deal, Aramco would add an additional 6m barrels of storage capacity in the area to the 5m barrels the company leases from Paktank in Rotterdam. The sale would leave Esso with a 42.85 per cent share, and Texaco with a 22.8 per cent stake, Texaco said. A new company will be formed to operate the terminal, which receives, stores and pumps crude oil for the Esso refineries in Rotterdam and Antwerp. The storage facilities can hold up to 17m barrels of crude oil. Texaco said the proposed sale was meant to bring TRP's storage facilities into line with operating requirements. Those requirements have been reduced since 1989, the company said, when Texaco formed its Netherlands Refining Company joint venture with the British Petroleum. This venture links two refinery sites, at Pernis and Europoort.</p>

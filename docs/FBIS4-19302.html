			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for </F> foreign trade and Commission vice president, by special  correspondents Jean-Pierre Langellier and Philippe Lemaitre in  Brussels; date not given: "Sir Leon Brittan: `We Have No Right  To Reject East European Countries'" -- first paragraph is LE  MONDE introduction]    [Text] Sir Leon Brittan seeks to succeed Jacques Delors on  1 January 1995 as president of the European Commission in  Brussels. As European commissioner responsible for external  trade affairs and Commission vice president, he was the Twelve's  chief negotiator in the talks that led to the completion of the  GATT Uruguay Round, which is to be finalized on Friday 15 April  in Marrakesh. A clever and engaging man, this former interior  and industry minister of a conservative British Government will  appear in "L'heure de verite" [Hour of Truth] television program  on Sunday 17 April on France 2. On the next day, his  pro-European manifesto, The Europe We Need, will be  released in France. Sir Leon received LE MONDE's special  correspondents in his Brussels office.    [LE MONDE] You would like to succeed Jacques Delors at the  head of the Commission. How, in your opinion, has this  candidacy by an Englishman been received, for example in France?    [Brittan] I am not on the campaign trail. I only let it be  known that I was available should the heads of European states  and government decide to approve my candidacy. I did not apply  as an Englishman. I am an independent commissioner. As an  Englishman, and I am proud of it, and as a member of the  Conservative Party and a former minister, I take seriously the  independence of the Commission and its commissioners. And I  have ideas of my own. For instance, I have always been in favor  of the economic and monetary union, and I have supported it both  in Britain and elsewhere. This is one illustration of my  independence. There are others. In France, all I can do is  explain my ideas. This is the reason why I have written a book.    [LE MONDE] You were Europe's negotiator in the GATT Uruguay  Round to be finalized on Friday in Marrakesh. Now that some  time has elapsed after the talks came to a successful conclusion  in December 1993, do you believe their outcome has been as  positive as was expected at the time?    [Brittan] Yes, definitely. We achieved almost all of our  objectives. Some issues were set aside and will be dealt with  later; this was the case with financial services, for example.  But we convinced the other countries -- developed and less  developed alike -- to remove many obstacles to free trade,  including tariffs. We were able to preserve those industrial  sectors that are experiencing real difficulties, such as the  aluminum sector. This is why European manufacturers were so  happy with the outcome of the talks.    But most important will be the establishment of the World  Trade Organization (WTO) and the consolidation of trade rules,  which constitute a great step forward on the road to  multilateralism. A major trade power such as the United States  has now fewer levers with which to impose its views on other  countries, because it has formally agreed to be more mindful of  the rules of the multilateral game. This was always one of  Europe's objectives.    And thanks to the consolidation of its own regulatory  framework, Europe is now better able to defend itself, for  instance against dumping. Add to this the results concerning  farm products. For the most part, the Common Agricultural  Policy (CAP) has now been recognized as legitimate. All  parties, including the Americans, have approved a "peace clause"  whereby they undertake not to harass European agriculture any  longer.    [LE MONDE] Concerning farm products, you are happy with a  result that came about after France exerted strong pressure,  often encountering opposition by its European partners. What do  you now think of this strategy?    [Brittan] These talks produced an number of important  political lessons which must be heeded. Long discussions  within, but also outside, the Council of Ministers contributed  to a better understanding of France's position on the part of  its partners. Such discussions also afforded French citizens a  better view of the advantages of a successful GATT, of more open  markets, and lower tariff barriers. Conversely, France's  liberal partners now have a better understanding of its  agricultural interests as well as, on another level, its  commitment to a strong audiovisual policy.    [LE MONDE] On your initiative, after the Union's  enlargement to 16 members, the Commission has initiated a review  of policy options with respect to East Europe. Can it lead to  tangible results? And if so, how long will that take?    [Brittan] Yes, I think it can. But when? That is another  story. The future integration of East European countries in the  Union hinges on moral, economic, and political grounds.  Morally, we have no right to reject them after showing such  understanding, even compassion toward them during the Communist  era. Economically, there will be difficulties, of course, but  ultimately their integration will be an asset for us.  Politically, the question that matters is as follows: What  will happen if we turn them down? I believe rejection on our  part may push them into the arms of the Russians, which is the  exact opposite of what they want. Or they may consider that  Germany -- which has been keeping a high profile in the region  -- is the only European country with any real interest in them.  Germany would not like finding itself in such a situation,  which would run counter to the Union's interest. This is why we  must take them in.    When and under which conditions? The hardest part is finding  a way to integrate East European countries while continuing to  strengthen the Union. Those who advocate enlargement in the  hope of preventing further consolidation are totally in the  wrong. We must combine those two processes. Hence the key  question to be asked at the intergovernmental conference  provided for by the Maastricht Treaty in two years is: which  institutional changes will let these countries join the Union  without slowing down the consolidation process -- a perspective  that would lessen the Union's cohesion? This is a complicated  matter, but it can be solved.  <H5>  `I Favor the Single Currency' </H5>   [LE MONDE] Aside from monetary union, what are the other  issues on which your position diverges from that of the Tory  party?    [Brittan] You know, there is no single position within the  government. There is a range of nuanced opinions, and a number  of topics on which no-one has taken a clear stand yet, such as  institutional issues. In fact, the debate will take place at the  time of the intergovernmental conference. The notions I  outlined are not currently those of the British Government. It  may yet come to adopt them.    [LE MONDE] Do you think that the negative, dramatically  reaffirmed stance of the Euroskeptics still reflects the views  of a majority of the British population?    [Brittan] Opinions vary widely both within the population  and within political circles. These differences have been  around for a quarter of a century. A number of Conservatives  bitterly oppose further integration within the Union. And the  government is obviously hampered by its very small parliamentary  majority. As for British voters, it all depends on the  questions asked as well as the time they are asked. The  positions of the British can be explained by their history and  experience, which are quite different from those of the French  or Belgians, for example.    Yet again, such differences can also be found in France,  where the outcome of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty did  not reflect a dramatically pro-European feeling, and in Germany,  which is still divided over the currency issue. Also, England  does have a more lively debating tradition that other countries.    [LE MONDE] The British do not share your enthusiasm for the  single currency.    [Brittan] No, they do not; however, before the crisis in the  European Monetary System, business and corporate circles were  overwhelmingly in favor of it. After the crisis, the idea lost  some of its appeal with everybody. What I tell my fellow  British citizens is that they do not have to decide right now;  they can decide later whether or not they want to switch to the  single currency. I for one am in favor of it. And it is my  duty to say so to those who, mistakenly, believe that there will  be no Economic and Monetary Union.    In Great Britain, differences on this issue are also a  matter  of generations. Young people who travel a lot have more  generous ideas. Over the past 20 years, British society has  become more European, albeit very slowly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 27 May (PL) -- At the end of two days of  talks that also included the topics of trade and economic  cooperation, Cuba and Spain signed today an Agreement for the  Protection of Reciprocal Investments.    Ernesto Melendez, Cuban minister of Economic Cooperation and  Foreign Investment [title as received], and Apolonio Ruiz  Ligero, Spanish secretary of state for Commerce and Tourism,  signed the document and the records of the 4th Meeting of the  Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission in the presence of Vice President  Carlos Lage and Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.    Following speeches in which Melendez and Ruiz voiced great  satisfaction about the results of the negotiations, the Spanish  secretary of state told the press that Spain maintains a line of  credit granted to Cuba in the amount of $40 million.    Apolonio Ruiz said he trusts that trade with Cuba will  increase as a result of the agreements that have been signed and  the Cuban Government's measures that promote an increase in  internal demands through tourism and the people having an access  to convertible currency. He added that trade between the two  countries will also increase in the long run through an increase  in Cuban domestic production.    Bilateral exchange declined in 1993 to $290 million, but the  high-ranking Spanish official hopes it will increase this year.  The 5th Meeting of the Mixed Cuban-Spanish Commission will be  held in Madrid in 1995.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (29): How to pick a winner If you were trying to pick a winner in the rapidly-changing Polish steel industry, how would you go about it? That was the question facing Air Products, a manufacturer of oxygen and other industrial gases with a Dollars 3bn turnover worldwide, trying to make its first large investment in Poland. Air Products wanted to find a steel mill that was certain to survive the shake-out in the industry, to which it could supply oxygen. The use of oxygen instead of air in steel manufacture greatly improves the efficiency, as well as reducing environmentally harmful emissions. This is exactly the kind of investment which Polish mills will need if they are to survive the transformation under way in the industry. The government is adamant that it cannot contribute to the spending. But 'we had to be pretty sure the partner was viable', according to Mr Andrzej Zakrzewski, Air Products' business manager for Poland. The whole of the group's investment would be dependent on that one customer. Air Products' choice was the Huta-Zawierce steelworks near Katowice, which makes steel from scrap steel. In November, Air Products opened its two oxygen plants, supplying 100 tonnes a day, which cost DM14m. According to Mr Zakrzewski, it suited both parties for Air Products to carry the capital cost of building the plant. 'We get a fair return for the risk' through the price at which oxygen is sold to the steelworks, he said. The group was also keen to avoid complications of property rights and historic environmental liabilities by building the plant on the Huta-Zawierce site, rather than buying a site of its own. The factors that tipped the balance in the investment decision were the strides that Huta-Zawierce has made in recent years. According to Mr Jozef Lotko, technical director of Huta Zawierce, the capacity of the furnaces has nearly doubled since the 1970s, and it has installed continuous casting technology. The mill has also cut jobs from 6,300 to 4,300. It expects eventually to have only about 1,500 as maintenance and engineering activities are hived off as separate businesses. However, since Air Products' original expression of interest, the mill has had problems. Mr Lotko says that the first quarter of 1993 saw constant stoppages because of lack of scrap steel, and the mill made losses. The mill has now returned to profit. But Mr Zakrzewski emphasises that Air Products received no guarantees from the government about the mill's future. 'In the end we made an act of faith,' he says.</p>

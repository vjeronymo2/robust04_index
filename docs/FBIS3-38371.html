			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wio Joustra: "Netherlands Troops Receive Ground </F> Support"]    [Excerpts] The Hague -- The Netherlands troops opposing the  warring factions in eastern Bosnia do not have to rely solely on  limited air support, but can also rely on the support of ground  troops from other countries such as the United Kingdom and  France. According to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, the  international community must show that it is serious about  Bosnia. [passage omitted]    This afternoon in the Lower House, Defense Minister Ter Beek  will argue on the basis of Butrus-Ghali's letter that the launch  of air strikes to neutralize Serbian artillery positions around  Srebenica and Zepa is not on the agenda.    Asked for his reaction to the letter, Ter Beek said through  a  spokesman on Monday [31 January] that attacking Serbian  positions would be too great a risk for UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force] units already present in Bosnia. Various groups have  argued this point in previous debates. Limited air support will  only be used when resistance is such that the battalion's  ability to carry out its mission is jeopardized or if it needs  to defend itself.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PRIZE OFFERED FOR NORIEGA EXPOSES  </P> <P> A Panamanian newspaper, sponsoring an offbeat essay contest on the "criminal  acts" of deposed general Manuel A. Noriega, is offering the first-prize winner  a free trip to the former strongman's drug trial in Florida.  </P> <P> In a half-page announcement Saturday, the independent daily El Siglo solicited  essays that "explain and detail the criminal acts of the deposed tyrant  (Noriega) and his followers."  </P> <P> The essay "could be accompanied by testimonies, photocopies, material evidence,  films, documents and other types of evidence" explaining "the clearly criminal  conduct of" Noriega and his followers, the paper said.  </P> <P> "This is an important and vital topic for Panama. We expect the participation  of many Panamanians who have personal and incredible stories concerning  Noriega," said Carlos Singares, editor of El Siglo. Singares said that all of  the stories would be published.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: SANTA ANITA KEEPS PARTIES ON TRACK  </P> <P> The day after Christmas, Santa Anita was keeping the spirit bright in the  Directors Room high above the race track in Arcadia. Chairman of the Board  Robert P. Strub and his wife, Betty, of San Marino hosted their traditional  opening-day luncheon.  </P> <P> Chatting over Christmas gifts and the expected January slump in parties were  Santa Anita President Clifford and Karen Goodrich, Mary and Arthur Crowe and  Violetta and Bill Dougherty. Santa Anita's director of racing emeritus, Frank  Kilroe, got cheery hellos, along with Dorothy and Ray Rogers, Martha Chandler  and William Croxton, Jacqueline and Peter Dailey, Connie and John Gavin, Marion  and Earle Jorgensen, Fielder and Lotsie Webster and Philip and Mary Hawley.  Mary Frances and Bob Morgan and Candi and Taylor Grant came from Newport Beach,  Walter and Sheila Hoffman from Ventura and John and Norma Bowles from Los  Olivos.  </P> <P> At the rail watching Moon Madness win the first race were Felix and Barbara  McGinnis, Anne Brophy and Carl McGinnis. Lynn and Clement Hirsch were excited  about entering their Magical Mile in the Malibu Stakes race.  </P> <P> Among prominent horse owners in the Turf Club were Clarence and Dorothy  Scarborough of Midland, Tex. Biggest social days this season are the Charles H.  Strub Stakes, Feb. 10; the Santa Anita Handicap, March 9, and the Santa Anita  Derby April 6.  </P> <P> OPINIONS: Everywhere this holiday season, people compared invites. The  consensus: fewer black-tie events (Barbara and Marvin Davis and Henry and  Caroline Singleton canceled their traditional Christmas parties) and more teas.  </P> <P> There was an onslaught of cocktail open houses with mirth abounding, but the  serious question everyone asked was, "Do you think there'll be a war?" Worry  took the edge off fun.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, among the many hosts and hostesses giving lively parties with  guests eating too much and exchanging hugs and kisses under the mistletoe were  Debbie and Terry Lanni, Beverly and Larry Thrall, Cheryl and Bill Doyle,  Priscilla and Curt Tamkin, Carolyn and Chuck Miller, Barbara and Chuck  Schneider, Carolyn and Maury DeWald, Debby and Bill Appler, Gretchen and David  Seager, Phoebe and Joe Vaccaro, Liz and Craig Black, French Consul General  Gerard and Naomi Coste, Fred Nason Jr. (celebrating his 60th birthday), Veva  and Kingston McKee, Jess and Phyllis Marlow, Nancy and Bill Burrows and Connie  and Bob Butler. Whew!  </P> <P> DAY LIFE: If the evenings were filled with parties, the days were filled with  teas and luncheons. One of the special teas was at the glorious contemporary  home of Kitty Moses, with Maggie Edwards, Paty Kouba and Doris Coleman  co-hosting. More than 150 ladies attended, receiving little scrolls as they  left advising "Take Time." Such as, "Take time to think -- it is the source of  power." And, "Take time to laugh -- it is the music of the soul."  </P> <P> Alice Avery hosted a mammoth tea at the Los Angeles Country Club for 450 women.  </P> <P> At another tea at the club, Louise Griffith and Joyce Stuart sent their guests  off with miniature gold baskets containing three tea bags.  </P> <P> In Hancock Park, Suzanne Rheinstein had the silver tea urns polished and  gleaming for a friendly affair, and in Pasadena, at Dina Oldknow's tea,  daughters and granddaughters in lace and velvet outnumbered adults.  </P> <P> At the tea parties, the most common phrase is "tea food is my favorite food" --  as the cucumber and chicken salad sandwiches and the lemon bars, fudge and  baklava were devoured.  </P> <P> SITDOWN: One of the most joyous parties was the one Stephen and Jane Ackerman  gave upstairs at the Bistro. After good friends dined and danced, they joined  hands in Christmas carols and even a few tears, signaling that in almost every  family joy and sorrow mix, and friends are awfully nice to be there to help  lead you through.  </P> <P> Another night, the fireplaces their home set a cozy ambiance for Jane and  George Barretts' sit-down for 50.  </P> <P> HEARTS: Romantic touches have marked the season. Valet parkers had a heavy job  parking the cars at Carol and Mike Inman's home in Bel-Air at the party  honoring their son, Peter, and his wife, Lori, wed last month in a formal  ceremony in Kansas City.  </P> <P> Celebrating the engagement of Melissa Swann Winston and Dennis Victor Alfieri,  Edward and Patty Turrentine sent invitations wrapped in gold and burgundy silk  cording. The black-tie event also heralded the grand opening of the  Turrentines' (he's an interior designer) magnificent Italian ballroom, where  dancing continued until the wee hours.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, Amie Lu and John Haake and Jan and Buzz Hanson honored Paul  Anderson and Elizabeth Murphy at a shower with holiday pizazz. They'll be  married Saturday.  </P> <P> LUNCHEONS: The Blue Ribbon at the Music Center and its president, Joanne  Kozberg, filled the Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for a Christmas  luncheon before the Joffrey's "The Nutcracker."  </P> <P> Roger and Joanne Kozberg brought daughter Lindsey home from Princeton. Andrea  Van de Kamp had daughter Diana, Harriet Deutsch had granddaughter Cari Deutsch  and Dody Booth brought daughter Stephanie.  </P> <P> Jenny Rutt took over the Pavillion at the Bistro Garden to host 60 for a  luncheon. Launched with chat and green ravioli, the affair finished with  giggles and ice cream and chocolate. As a surprise, the hostess asked Neiman  Marcus to do a mini-fashion show of ball gowns. Rutt provided favors of  Christmas red lipsticks and tied-up boxes of lemon drops for everyone.  </P> <P> Over at the Bistro Garden at Coldwater, the Luminaires Juniors (supporting the  Doheny Eye Institute), including Mary Milner and Diane Avery, were in the  holiday spirit.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de  Vargas noted that if it is true that President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy made remarks [on the possible dissolution of Congress],  it would demonstrate that he is unaware of the Constitution  "because he cannot dissolve Congress, only through a coup  d'etat."    The PLRA [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] congressman  emphasized that Wasmosy does not have the slightest possibility  of constitutionally dissolving Congress, and he therefore "must  understand that he can dissolve it through a coup d'etat alone,  thus violating the Constitution."    De Vargas warned the chief executive that if he carries out  his threat, he must be aware of the fact that he will challenge  the Paraguayan people. De Vargas noted: "As we challenged  [former dictator General Alfredo] Stroessner with all our  strength, with thousands of comrades killed and hundreds of  thousands of comrades deported and tortured, he must be aware of  the fact that we will challenge him with the same strength and  determination with which we challenged Stroessner, if he decides  to become a dictator through a coup d'etat."    De Vargas noted that the citizens have changed their  attitude  and that over the past five years citizens have become used to  freedom, the right to assemble, and the right to demonstrate. De  Vargas pointed out: "Therefore, the chief executive must assess  all these facts very thoroughly before daring to make a  decision, but if he wants to make a decision, he is free to make  the decision he wants."    Among other things, the lower house president expressed his  surprise over Wasmosy's remarks "because I consider him too  intelligent and well-educated a man to make those remarks."</p>

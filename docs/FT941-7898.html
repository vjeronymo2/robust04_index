			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Fresh bid to woo SA right The South African government and the African National Congress yesterday met white and black conservative groups in a further attempt to prevent conflict after the right-wing Freedom Alliance rejected constitutional concessions aimed at averting an election boycott, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. President FW de Klerk met Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini to respond to the king's threat to declare a sovereign Zulu state in Natal province. The government is keen to persuade the Zulu king to endorse elections by guaranteeing his symbolic status in the new South Africa, in an attempt to undermine Zulu leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's call on his tribe to boycott the poll. Meanwhile, ANC officials met the Afrikaner Volksfront in a similar attempt to divide the white right and ensure that moderates such as Gen Constand Viljoen, AVF leader, endorse the election despite the opposition of Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, hard-right Conservative party leader.</p>

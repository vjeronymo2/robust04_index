			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / The BMW/Rover Deal: Quotes of the day 'The fact that BMW are prepared to pay Pounds 800m is a tribute to what BAe have achieved and a tribute to the whole British vehicle industry and its workforce.' Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade and industry minister 'Isn't today's deal the proof Rover was sold at a knockdown price to BAe and at a rip-off to the British taxpayer?' Robin Cook, Labour trade and industry spokesman 'It is our objective to guide two independent and powerful automobile manufacturers on a common route through the future in a competitive world market.' Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman 'The decision of BAe to sell its Rover shares to BMW negates Honda and Rover's long term efforts to establish a firm future for Rover as a British company with its own brand identity.' Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda 'Some people would think that Rover had a better future linked to Honda than to an ailing German giant.' Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP 'It's very difficult to be efficient in our business if you take a nationalistic approach to operating in that environment.' Mr George Simpson, Rover chairman 'The fact we cannot keep home ownership of a real jewel in the crown of British industry reflects the weakness of British manufacturing and the absence of long-term commitment to it on the part of the government.' Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary 'The partnership with BMW will strengthen the Rover business and provide a secure future for the company and its employees.' Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman 'Britain no longer owns its own motor industry. Considering we were once supreme in Europe, it has come to a sorry state.' Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU 'Anybody with red, white and blue in his heart will feel it's a pity. But Rover is not viable on its own from a European point of view.' Mr Joe Gormezano, motor industry consultant at Knibb, Gormezano 'We are determined to safeguard the interests of the Rover workforce. We are being assured it will not affect the present workforce or plants.' Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU chief motor industry negotiator 'BMW is a good company which makes good models. The announcement could be for the best. As long as it keeps me in employment, I don't mind.' Mr Steve Pitchford, setter operator at Land Rover</p>

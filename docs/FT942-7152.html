			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie falls 2.2 per cent to new low for 1994 - Market report London had no choice but to join in the setback in securities markets across Europe yesterday as this week's growing fear that the fall in German interest rates may be over drove investors out of equities. The FT-SE 100 Index fell 68.4 points to 3,020.7, a new low for the year and a loss of 2.2 per cent on the day. Weakness in the US dollar gave a further blow to international blue chip stocks at the close of the session. Trading volume increased sharply, but remained below peak levels as marketmakers struggled to cut share prices before the sellers could strike. Once the important 3,050 mark on the Footsie was lost, several computer-led sales programmes opened in the stock index futures market and the collapse in prices rapidly increased. Across the broader market, shares fell away sharply to record a loss of 62 points on the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which ended the day at 3,629.4, a fall of about 1.7 per cent. Equities opened firmly, helped by Wall Street's steadiness overnight. First quarter figures on UK gross domestic product, showing a modest rise of 0.7 per cent, were comfortably taken and the stock market remained in positive territory for the first hour of official trading. However, British government bond prices began to slide in sympathy with other European bond markets and UK stocks turned off in their wake. The setback was modest at first, however, despite the disappointingly small reduction in rates at the weekly Bundesbank repo auction. The blow fell at mid-session when it was disclosed that the Bundesbank had cancelled a note auction because of lack of demand for its paper in the German market. Bonds began to fall in earnest and losses in share prices increased dramatically as the UK market absorbed the possibility that domestic interest rates might be forced higher much sooner than expected. At worst, the Footsie was down by 77.8 at 3,011.3 as traders began to assess the prospects for Wall Street. But US durable goods orders data for April turned out to be less threatening than feared and UK stocks tried to rally. The recovery was very slight indeed, because Wall Street remained 15 Dow points off in UK trading hours, with Federal bonds also lower. Seaq volume reached 646.1m shares, compared with 555.8m in the previous session; Tuesday's equity business was worth Pounds 1.23bn in retail value. The rout in the market swept all sectors along with it. Hard hit were the merchant banks which earn their profits in securities markets and also hold their assets in the form of shares and bonds. With markets heavily down across the global range, international - such as Reuters, HSBC, RTZ, BP and Shell - were all under pressure as London traders waited to see how Wall Street would perform. Market strategists expressed significant concern over the outlook for the UK market now that it has plunged below the 3,050 support level. If selling continues into next week, the Footsie could be at risk of another fall of 70 points or more, according to the equity chart analysts. The UK markets are regarded as trapped between other European bourses, which are threatened by the apparent shift of stance at the Bundesbank, and Wall Street which is now perceived to be in danger of a further tightening of the credit screws by the Federal Reserve.</p>

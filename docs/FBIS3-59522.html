On 12 November the presidents of the Lander of Bavaria,  Lower  Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, and Bade Wurtemberg met in Munich  with Edzard Reuter, president of the Daimler Benz group, and  Jurgen Schrempp, president of Deutsche Aerospace [DASA], to  plead for abandonment or at least postponement of DASA's  restructuring plan, which is designed to restore the company to  financial health by 1995, in part by eliminating 16,000 jobs and  closing six factories. After four hours of debate, the DASA  executives convinced them that the plan, which will lower the  group's overhead by 1.5 billion German marks [DM] per year, is  unavoidable and represents the minimum downsizing needed to save  the enterprise.    Edmund Schoiber (CSU), president of Bavaria, where the  Neuaubing plant will have to be closed -- and who offered to  reject the purchase of 8.58 percent of DASA stock held by the  Land of Bavaria -- was told by the DASA executives that  financing is not the problem: They have to resolve an overhead  problem whose solution lies outside the political domain.    Gerhard Schroder (SPD), president of Lower Saxony, opined  that state intervention is justified when necessary to save the  jobs of highly skilled workers. He went so far as to propose  taking over the Lemwerder plant from DASA. He is going to urge  the SPD and the IG Metall syndicate to reconsider their  opposition to the Eurofighter program.    Jurgen Schrempp said in essence that if the program is  dropped he will have to eliminate 11,000 more jobs and close  nine factories, perhaps as many as 14. He added that Germany is  going to have to decide whether it wants an aerospace industry.  Without subventions for research and exports comparable to those  provided by the United States and Japan to their aerospace  industries, the German industry will founder. Schrempp asked the  Lander presidents to lobby the political parties to get Bonn to  prepare and implement a comprehensive plan for the aerospace  sector.    Gerhard Schroder promised to lobby for the disbursement of  an  additional DM300-400 million for civil aeronautics construction.    Theo Waigel, the federal finance minister, for his part  promised to review German aerospace policy, and in particular to  study how the industry could be given indirect assistance and  how the reduction in space program appropriations might be  suspended.    DASA employees are very militant, especially at the  Lemwerder  plant, which according to DASA executives is losing DM35 million  per year. But Hans-Joachim Beckmann, spokesman for the plant  council, said that closing it will cost DM168 million  (transferral to Hamburg and Manching of plant equipment needed  for the alteration of Transall and Airbus aircraft). Employees  say DASA management may have decided to close the plant in the  hope of obtaining state aid. But workers also seem to have  realized that disorderly agitation of the kind seen in recent  weeks does not advance their cause; henceforth, they say, they  will act resolutely but with cooler heads.</p>

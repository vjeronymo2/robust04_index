			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> MISTER FRISKY KEEPS RECORD PERFECT  </P> <P> Chris McCarron was speaking for a lot of people when he yelled to Gary Stevens  with about an eighth of a mile to run in the $106,075 San Vicente Breeders' Cup  Stakes Saturday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> "I guess he's the real thing," McCarron shouted after Mister Frisky had surged  past favored Tarascon in the seven-furlong San Vicente.  </P> <P> The pride of Puerto Rico, 13 for 13 before leaving the island, proved he can  compete on the mainland.  </P> <P> The first 2-year-old to be named Horse of the Year in Puerto Rico since Bold  Forbes, Mister Frisky defeated Tarascon by a length in 1:22 3/5, and it was  another eight lengths back to Top Cash.  </P> <P> In front every step in almost all of his previous races, Mister Frisky, the  Marsayas colt, was fourth after breaking a step slowly. He moved up to join  Tarascon, the 13-10 choice, nearing the quarter pole, then took charge and  provided Stevens with his fourth winner of the day.  </P> <P> "This is a helluva good horse," said trainer Laz Barrera, who didn't do badly  after taking over Bold Forbes 14 years earlier. "This sucker can run.  </P> <P> "When my friend in Puerto Rico (Enrique Ubarri) told me he's as good as Bold  Forbes, I believed him. The day he left Puerto Rico, 2,000 people came to say  goodby. That puts a lot of pressure on me.  </P> <P> "When Bold Forbes came, he didn't win his first race for me. It's a great thing  for me to bring this horse from Puerto Rico and win a stakes here. There's  going to be a lot of dancing in the streets there when they find out that he  won."  </P> <P> Mister Frisky, the 5-2 second choice of the 30,371 spectators, will be pointed  toward the Santa Anita Derby. His next appearance is scheduled in the mile San  Rafael Stakes on March 3. He won at a mile and a sixteenth in Puerto Rico and  Stevens said distance won't be a problem.  </P> <P> "I think he'll run all day," he said. "The farther, the better. He can gallop  two miles, and you can breeze him and he'll still give you a strong last  quarter.  </P> <P> "I was very excited about today. I was a little nervous. I never rode a horse  with a record like this one, and his owners came all the way from Puerto Rico.  I knew he was genuine after working him twice.  </P> <P> "He didn't break real square; he was off balance. But, by the third jump, he  was right there. I'm happy with the way the race turned out because we got to  see he could relax and be rated behind (another) horse. He actually liked it.  He's definitely one of the better (3-year-olds) around.  </P> <P> "I just nudged him at the five-sixteenths pole and he moved up alongside  Tarascon. He really shied from the noise in the grandstand. That's why he  lugged in through the stretch and, afterward, he didn't want to gallop back."  </P> <P> Tarascon, making his first start for John Franks, who purchased him from  Georgia Ridder earlier this week, had no excuses in defeat.  </P> <P> "He sure ran his race," McCarron said. "When I asked him to run, he felt like a  jet. I couldn't believe the other horse was still outside me."  </P> <P> The San Vicente disappointment was Farma Way, who turned in his second  consecutive dull effort. The Hollywood Futurity runner-up was extremely washy  going to the gate when finishing last in the Los Feliz on Jan. 10, and he  looked like he had been hosed down again in the post parade Saturday.  </P> <P> "He's washing out every time," jockey Ray Sibille said of the Marfa colt, who  was fourth, beaten almost 11 lengths. "When he leaves the paddock, he's a  nervous wreck. He came out of the gate, but then showed no run at all."  </P> <P> Ruhlmann and Present Value head the field for the $328,500 San Antonio  Handicap, the major prep for the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap next month.  </P> <P> Away since defeating stablemate Lively One in the Native Diver Handicap Dec. 23  at Hollywood Park, Ruhlmann has a series of sharp works for Charlie Whittingham  and he's shown a fondness for Santa Anita in the past. McCarron will ride  again, but a mile and an eighth isn't really his preferred distance.  </P> <P> Present Value, who will get a two-pound edge from Ruhlmann, the 122-pound  highweight, was third as the 6-5 favorite in the San Pasqual Handicap two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> However, that was his first start since the Breeders' Cup Classic and he  figures to improve with the race behind him. He returned to work six furlongs  in 1:11 3/5 for Jerry Fanning. The 6-year-old son of Halo should also get his  preferred trip today because he is more effective from off the pace, and in the  San Pasqual he was on the lead most of the way.  </P> <P> The rest of the lineup includes Criminal Type, who won for the third  consecutive time in the San Pasqual; Payant, who has performed horribly in two  outings after being away for several months; Variety Road; Complicate; Stylish  Winner and Hollywood Reporter.  </P> <P> Laffit Pincay, who broke a collarbone in a harness mishap at Los Alamitos Jan.  26, galloped Patchy Groundfog Saturday morning for Julio Canani and said he  hopes to be back soon. "I didn't feel any soreness," said Pincay, who was  injured while competing in an exhibition race for charity. "My legs just got a  little tired. I'll get on two (this) morning. I hope to start riding again next  Saturday."  </P> <P> If Pincay does come back Saturday, he'll be able to ride Bayakoa in her  anticipated battle with Gorgeous in the $300,000 Santa Margarita the next  afternoon.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Gary Stevens, who also won with Kennedy's Knockout, Phil's Illusion and Paisano  Pete, is starting to pull away in the jockey's race. He has 46 victories, eight  more than Chris McCarron and 18 better than third-place Alex Solis.. . . Eddie  Delahoussaye and Martin Pedroza both had two wins. The former won the sixth  with Turbo Trick and the finale with Vysotsky while Pedroza swept the daily  double with Smilin' Smiley and Key To Ding. . . . Mister Frisky paid $7.60 to  win and earned $47,325 for his owners, Solymar Stud.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Artem Kudinov: "Novosibirsk Oblast Intends To </F> Increase Gold Extraction"]    [Text] The Novosibirsk Geological Committee yesterday  announced plans for the conduct of a number of competitions for  the exploitation of alluvial (in river sediment) gold deposits  located in the oblast. The oblast administration decided to take  this step in connection with a sharp decrease in the extraction  of gold.    As Oleg Ivanov, chairman of the territorial Committee on  Geology and Utilization of the Mineral Resources of Novosibirsk  and Omsk Oblasts (Novosibgeolkom), stated in an exclusive  interview for KOMMERSANT-DAILY, several areas of gold deposits  exist in the territory of Maslyaninskiy Rayon, Novosibirsk  Oblast. The gold is contained in river sediment (alluvial  deposits). According to Novosibgeolkom data, extraction volumes  of the high-purity gold (950-990 pure) in 1993 amounted to 84  kilograms--less than the 1990 volume by a factor of 2.2. In  Ivanov's opinion, the drop in gold extraction can be explained  through insufficient funds of gold prospecting cooperatives and  the poor organization of their work.    Mr. Ivanov did not rule out the possibility of an auction  being conducted for the right of exploitation of the alluvial  gold deposit areas, as envisaged by the Law on Mineral  Resources. In such event, Novosibirsk Oblast would be one of the  first in Russia to test the auction scenario although, as the  Novosibgeolkom chairman emphasized, this alternative "has a  number of significant deficiencies." In his opinion, conduct of  an auction does not preclude the possibility that licenses will  be acquired at random by private individuals uninterested in  extracting gold and only capable of acting as intermediaries. In  Mr. Ivanov's words, particular features of the Novosibirsk gold  deposits make them suitable for development by small enterprises  and gold prospecting cooperatives, insofar as the extraction of  gold at them does not require significant financial investments.    The main participants in the competitions and auctions will  most likely be five or six prospecting cooperatives and  enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast. Mr. Ivanov stated that  enterprises of Novosibirsk Oblast exclusively will be permitted  to participate in the competitions, and that the list of gold  deposit areas designated for tender (auction) would be published  in the mass media following coordination with the Novosibirsk  Oblast Administration.</p>

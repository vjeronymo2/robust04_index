			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY JOINS L.A. IN ELSMERE CANYON PACT;  </P> <P> LANDFILL: A PROPOSED JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT CALLS FOR THE CREATION OF A  190-MILLION-TON DUMP IN THE SANTA CLARITA VALLEY.  </P> <P> Billing it as a historic moment, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors  voted Tuesday to end its long garbage-disposal feud with the city of Los  Angeles by forming a partnership to confront the region's growing garbage  problem together.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, the city and county, operating under a joint powers  authority, would create a huge dump in Elsmere Canyon in the Santa Clarita  Valley. The city of Los Angeles would be entitled to dump a large portion of  its garbage there.  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest winners in the proposed pact, which still must be approved  by the Los Angeles City Council, are Westside activists who have vehemently  opposed the county's effort to operate landfills in Mission, Rustic and  Sullivan canyons. Under the agreement, the county's sanitation districts would  agree never to convert the three canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains into  dumps.  </P> <P> Rustic and Sullivan canyons would be turned over to a public agency for  recreational purposes. The agreement would permit the county to sell its  Mission Canyon property, which at one time was a county landfill.  </P> <P> Other potential winners could be San Fernando Valley residents who have lobbied  to close the Lopez Canyon landfill near Lake View Terrace. Under the agreement,  the city-owned dump will close within a year after the Elsmere Canyon Landfill  opens. The pact, however, leaves open the possibility of reactivating Lopez  Canyon if Elsmere Canyon no longer can accept garbage. Some activists have  alleged that the proposal to close Lopez Canyon is an attempt to deceive them  into supporting the agreement.  </P> <P> The board approved the joint powers agreement on a 3 to 1 vote, with Supervisor  Pete Schabarum opposing the proposal.  </P> <P> "I think today this board has the opportunity to take a major step toward  laying the foundation for meeting the solid waste disposal for Los Angeles  County for several decades," Supervisor Deane Dana said before the vote. "And  that's what this tentative agreement creating this solid waste management joint  powers authority represents."  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose district encompasses much of the Westside, agreed.  </P> <P> "I think this agreement between the city and county is an historic agreement,"  Edelman said. "It recognizes for the first time that we both face a common  enemy, and that is the failure in the past to work together to solve a very  important need."  </P> <P> The soonest that sanitation officials could open the 190-million-ton Elsmere  Canyon Landfill is 1995. The dump would be operated by the new public agency,  which would need approvals by various government agencies certifying that the  dump would be environmentally safe.  </P> <P> The proposal has outraged the Santa Clarita City Council, which last month  voted unanimously to oppose the dump. Critics contend that the landfill would  pollute Santa Clarita air and underground water supplies and lead to traffic  jams.  </P> <P> In an effort to appease Santa Clarita officials, the agreement includes  provisions that the dump authority pay that city 5 cents for every ton dumped  at the site. The city of Los Angeles also would donate 50 acres it owns in  Saugus for a Santa Clarita civic center site and another 160 acres in Saugus  would be transferred to a Castaic Lake water agency.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's meeting, Santa Clarita City Councilman Dennis Koontz  unsuccessfully urged the supervisors not to approve the plan until an  environmental impact report is completed. Saying that he was disappointed, but  not surprised, he promised that the city of Santa Clarita "would regroup and  will come out with a strategy."  </P> <P> The site of the proposed dump is owned by the U.S. Forest Service, but BKK  Inc., a solid waste management company, is negotiating to buy it. The joint  powers agency would eventually buy the land from BKK after the company had  obtained environmental approvals for the project.  </P></p>

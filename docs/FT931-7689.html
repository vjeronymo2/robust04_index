			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Welsh Water pays Pounds 56m for engineer WELSH WATER yesterday became the sixth water company to make a significant acquisition this year when it paid up to Pounds 56.1m for Acer Group, the consultant engineer. Welsh has been rethinking its diversification policy since it sold a controversial 14.9 per cent stake in South Wales Electricity last December. Analysts said the decision to concentrate on engineering made sense and gave Welsh a meaningful non-core business. Mr John Elfred Jones, chairman, said the acquisition would allow Welsh to grow its non-core profits. 'We see ourselves as an infrastructure services company, so Acer is exactly the step we were looking for,' he said. However, the deal was attacked by Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West and Labour spokesman on the water industry. He said Welsh's previous diversifications, which include a loss-making hotel arm, had been 'disastrous'. Acer was formed in 1987 through the merger of Freeman Fox, which had a reputation as a bridge designer, and John Taylor and Sons, which had expertise in water-related projects. In the year to April 30, the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.4m on turnover of Pounds 85.5m. About 60 per cent of profits come from Europe, with the rest spread throughout the world. European sales are split between the transport and water sectors. Mr Graham Hawker, Welsh's group managing director, said the companies had been in discussions since last July. Acer's shareholders decided to sell because some partners had retired and ICF of the US, which owned 30 per cent, no longer wanted to acquire the company. 'Those still in the business realised their balance sheet could no longer support growth,' he said. Welsh is paying Pounds 21m in cash and assuming Acer's Pounds 27m of debt. A total of 36 senior managers have signed two year service contracts which include incentive payments if Acer's profits in the 35 months to April 1995 exceed Pounds 19.4m. The maximum payable under the scheme is Pounds 8.1m. Welsh will fund the purchase through cash held outside the core business. Welsh raised Pounds 75m though a bond issue in 1991 and made a Pounds 17m profit on the disposal of the electricity stake. The pro-forma exit p/e ratio is 7.8. Acer had net assets at the year end of Pounds 8.8m and goodwill of Pounds 5m. Acer has a small joint venture with Severn Trent.</p>

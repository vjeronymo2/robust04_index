			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Airtours reacts to OFT inquiry AIRTOURS, the holiday company, will suggest to the Office of Fair Trading that tied travel agency chains be required to display notices alerting customers that staff will probably recommend the parent tour operator's holidays. The OFT wrote to travel companies and trade organisations earlier this month saying it was conducting informal inquiries into links between large operators and travel agents. Companies have been asked to make submissions by July 11. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said its submission would say that customers have a right to know whether a travel agent is owned by a tour operator. He added that it would be impractical to prohibit the payment of incentives and commissions to travel agent counter staff by tour operators. He said staff at Pickfords Travel, the travel agency chain which the group purchased last year, were paid a pre-tax commission of Pounds 3 for every Airtours holiday sold. Staff can build up points towards a holiday as an alternative to the cash payments. Mr Crossland said the payment of incentives had been happening for decades and had nothing to do with the recent trend towards vertical integration in the industry. He recalled that as a travel agency employee in the early 1960s, he had received a holiday on the Costa Brava. He did not think the OFT would order tour operators to sell their travel agency chains as it had approved Airtours' purchase of Pickfords. Airtours, which yesterday announced a half-year pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.9m after the Pounds 9m cost of its failed bid for Owners Abroad, has bought Cardiff-based Aspro Travel, the UK's seventh largest tour operator. The Pounds 20m acquisition follows the purchase of the Hogg Robinson travel agency chain earlier this month. He said the purchase of Aspro would strengthen Airtours in Wales, Northern Ireland and the south-west of England. Aspro's programmes to the eastern Mediterranean would complement Airtours' strength in the western Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. Airtours would retain the Aspro brand name. Its airline, Inter Auropean Airways would, however, be integrated into the Airtours flight division and its eight aircraft repainted in the Airtours livery. Mr Crossland said the enlarged group would have 18 aircraft operating this summer. This would be reduced to between 14 and 16 by next summer. Airtours loss after bid costs, Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Gaza -- Dhiyab al-Lawh, head of Fatah's media  and educational department in Gaza, yesterday described the  relationship between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] as strategic and crucial and something that cannot be  disregarded or underestimated. He added that the current  circumstances dictate that this relationship be special as well  as more solid and harmonious than ever in order to close any  loopholes that might arise in the future.    In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, al-Lawh stressed that  Fatah is looking forward to establishing cooperation with all  forces present in the Palestinian arena -- not only with Hamas  -- regardless of whether those forces reject or support the  accord with Israel.    Al-Lawh downplayed Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres'  warning against a rapprochement between Fatah and Hamas. He  said: When we coordinate with Hamas we do not take into account  what the Israelis say because this sort of coordination is an  inter-Palestinian affair governed by the Palestinian people's  supreme interests and not by the Israelis. On elections for an  expected legislative council, al-Lawh said: They will be  general elections in which everyone can participate, because it  is this elected council that will form the Palestinian national  government. [passage omitted]    On the possibility that a security vacuum might be created  between the Israeli withdrawal and the national authority's  assumption of power, al-Lawh said: Now I cannot discuss the  details of the Palestinian security forces' deployment. I can  say, however, that the Palestinian leadership has taken all  necessary precautions and made all the necessary preparations to  provide security and safety for all Palestinians. It will not  allow the creation of a security vacuum even for one minute.</p>

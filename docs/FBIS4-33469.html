			<p>BFN     [Text] On 6 June most of the members of the Congressional  Investigating Committee on Illegal Activities (CBII) agreed to  begin an in-depth investigation of the many reports of Army  Commander General Lino Oviedo's involvement in  political-partisan activities.    By the time this afternoon daily went to press, the CBII was  getting ready to formally discuss the issue. The request for the  CBII to step in came from Deputies Sergio Lopez of the PLRA  [Authentic Radical Liberal Party] and Walter Bower of the  Colorado Party Reconciliation Movement. The report that the two  deputies prepared on the repeated charges against Gen. Oviedo  will be submitted at today's session of the CBII.    Should it be duly proven that the Army commander has  violated  the Constitution, the CBII will submit its findings to the  courts so that Gen. Oviedo can be tried, and will also ask the  national executive branch to remove and retire the general,  according to National Encounter Deputy Luis Alberto Mauro.    The CBII is controlled by the opposition, which has been  constantly criticizing Gen. Oviedo's activities, and by the  Colorado Party, which is now bitterly complaining about the role  Oviedo is playing in the party's internal power struggle.    Committee members Basilio Nikiporoff, Armando Espinola,  Fernando Pfannl, Hermes Rafael Saguier, and Luis Alberto Mauro  belong to the opposition; Carlos Romero Pereira and Walter Bower  belong to the Argana faction of the Colorado Party; and Luis  Becker, who recently called Oviedo "little Stroessner," and  "gangsters' protector," belongs to the pro-government faction of  the Colorado Party.    Bearing this background in mind, it is certain that the  majority of the CBII members will be in favor of investigating  Gen. Oviedo. The only pro-government legislator who could oppose  this decision would be Senator Emilio Cubas Grau.    Deputy Mauro stated that when last year CBII members accused  Oviedo of meddling in politics "we were criticized and told that  our attitude was antimilitary. It appears, however, that many  members of the various Colorado Party factions now share our  position."    He concluded: "This proves that our criticisms are  objective,  and not prompted by antimilitary feelings."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister Kiichi  Miyazawa has handed prosecutors a document concerning the  bribery case against former Construction Minister Kishiro  Nakamura, sources close to the case said Monday [23 May].    Miyazawa states in the document, which was submitted in  response to questioning by prosecutors, that Shin Kanemaru,  former vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  told him in February 1992 that some in the party were opposed to  the filing of a bid-rigging allegation against the Saitama  Doyo-Kai Association of contractors by the Fair Trade Commission  [FTC].    Nakamura was arrested in March and later indicted on a  charge  of accepting a bribe from one of the nation's top contractors,  Kajima Corp., in January 1992 in exchange for helping to block a  criminal allegation by the FTC. Kajima was the then leader of  the 66-member Saitama Contractor Association.    Miyazawa also stated he met with Setsuo Umezawa, then  chairman of the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), immediately after  he met with Kanemaru, they said.    Miyazawa was quoted as saying that although he remembered he  had talked with Umezawa about the intraparty objection to the  criminal accusation, he did not have a clear memory of whether  or not he told Umezawa he learned of the objection from Kanemaru.    Nakamura allegedly urged Umezawa not to file the criminal  accusation with prosecutors against the group over its illegal  price fixing.    Miyazawa also said in the document that he told Umezawa that  the FTC should deal with the case of Saitama Doyo-Kai on its  own, since the FTC had jurisdiction over the matter, the sources  said.    The FTC announced in may 1992 it would not file an  accusation  with public prosecutors, and instead ordered the 66 companies to  stop bid rigging.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Lottery licence to be longer The National Lottery licence has been extended by six months to a full seven years to give whichever operator wins it a better chance of recovering the money invested. The change was made by Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the lottery, in the formal application documents published yesterday. In November Mr Davis said the licence would expire on March 31 2001, which meant the licence would run for no more than 6 1/2 years because the winner will probably not be chosen until next May and is unlikely to launch before late 1994. The licence will now run until September 30 2001, making it at least possible that the licence will cover seven years. Mr Davis also confirmed yesterday that he was giving applicants the right to publish as much or as little about their applications as they wanted to. 'The level of interest in and enthusiasm for the National Lottery, demonstrated by potential applicants and other interested parties has been very encouraging,' Mr Davis said. Those interested in applying to run the lottery must submit a letter of intent by January 14 and full bids by February 14. At least eight applications are expected from groups ranging from The Great British Lottery Company, which includes Granada, to Camelot, a consortium including Cadbury Schweppes, The Rank Organisation, and Mr Richard Branson's UK Lottery Foundation.</p>

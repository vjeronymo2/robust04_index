			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROTHSCHILD CITES LACK OF PROFITS, DROPS OUT AS PRIMARY U.S. DEALER  </P> <P> L. F. Rothschild &amp; Co. Inc. said today it has withdrawn as a primary  dealer, making it the second institution in less than a week to defect from the  exclusive club of bond dealers that trade directly with the government.  </P> <P> Rothschild, a subsidiary of L. F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., said its departure,  which will leave 44 primary dealers to trade with the Federal Reserve, is  effective immediately.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scope of Decision Told  </P> <P> Rothschild also said it will discontinue its U.S. government securities sales  and trading activities except for trading in its own account.  </P> <P> Rothschild said that, while its capital exceeds the Federal Reserve's new  requirements for primary dealers, the return on capital devoted to its  government securities operations has been insufficient to warrant continuation  of the business.  </P> <P> A rumor that Rothschild would leave the primary dealer business circulated  widely on Friday when County Natwest Government Securities Inc., a subsidiary  of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc, said it was quitting the  overcrowded and often unprofitable business.  </P> <P> County Natwest had been a primary dealer for less than four months when it made  its surprise announcement.  </P> <P> Primary dealerships are special rights granted by the Federal Reserve to deal  directly with the government when it issues debt securities. The  once-prestigious role as the government-sanctioned bond dealer has been losing  its appeal as intense competition cuts profit margins.  </P> <P> Dealers say that at least half of the primary dealers were not profitable in  1988. Some say that only seven firms made profits.  </P></p>

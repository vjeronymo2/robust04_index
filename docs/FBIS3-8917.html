			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (AFP) -- Croatian officials and  representatives of the breakaway Croatian Serbs are to hold  peace talks in Zagreb later this month, Russian special envoy  Vitaly Churkin said here Wednesday [16 March] after talks with  the breakaway Serbs.    Churkin met at the Russian Embassy with Croatian Serb  leaders  Milan Martic, Slobodan Jarcevic and General Milan Celeketic,  declaring afterwards that they had agreed to peace talks in  Zagreb next Tuesday [22 March].    Martic, however, said he had agreed to attend the meeting on  condition that that the Croatian delegation to the talks be  headed by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman.    The peace talks would mark the first time Serb leaders from  the breakaway Krajina region travel to Zagreb since clashes  between the two sides began in 1991.    The Russian Embassy in Zagreb said Churkin was expected back  in Zagreb Wednesday afternoon to discuss the matter with Tudjman.    Before leaving Belgrade, however, he was scheduled to hold  separate meetings with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    The Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency said Karadzic had  indicated  he would be willing to discuss a proposed federation plan  linking Croats and Moslems as long as it did not go counter to  Serb interests.    The plan calls for Bosnia's Moslems and Croats to merge  their  territories in a loose Bosnian federation that could eventually  be linked with Croatia.    Attempts to convince the Serbs to join the U.S.-brokered  plan  and end more than two years of bloodshed in Bosnia have so far  proved fruitless.    Churkin, who is Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special  envoy to the former Yugoslavia, and Milosevic met Monday to  discuss possible Serb involvement in the proposed federation's  constitution.    Churkin earlier this week also met Bosnian Serb leaders  Momcilo Krajisnik and Nikola Koljevic.    The Belgrade daily BORBA said the U.S.-brokered federation  plan would be discussed at a meeting here Wednesday involving  Milosevic, Karadzic and Martic.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / MFI advances strongly and plans accelerated expansion MFI, the UK furniture retailer and manufacturer, reported a sharp recovery in profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 87.8m in the 53 weeks to April and said that sales were currently running 13 per cent ahead of last year. The company also announced an acceleration of its expansion in France. Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said: 'We are increasingly confident we can establish a major chain in France.' In the UK, MFI experienced a slowdown in sales of kitchens and bedrooms at the end of the period which it blamed on the consumer caution ahead of the April tax increases. But this proved short-lived and growth has since picked up strongly. Excluding the 53rd week, turnover rose 7 per cent with sales per square foot up 8 per cent. Mr Hunt said the results were boosted by increased Sunday opening and by the introduction of new kitchen ranges which contributed to record sales in the key winter sale period of January and February. Gross margins slipped to 55.9 (57.3) per cent due to strong growth in lower margins products but staff costs were unchanged to push the operating margins up to 11.1 (8.4) per cent. Adjusting for the impact of MFI's flotation the previous year operating profit rose 45 per cent to Pounds 73.3m and pre-tax profit, including the Pounds 19.6m contribution from the sale of the stake in Carpetright, more than doubled from Pounds 42.4m before taking account of flotation. The disposal helped to cut gearing from 52 per cent to 9 per cent. Capital expenditure was up almost a fifth at Pounds 27.5m and is budgeted to increase by more than 30 per cent this year. MFI plans to add 9 stores to its 176 in the UK, in addition to the expansion in France. A final dividend of 2.67p gives a total of 4p, up 6.7 per cent, which was covered 1.9 times by earnings, excluding exceptional items, of 7.7p (4.5p). The company said that higher earnings in future would be reflected by increased dividends, but also improved cover. The shares closed 3p higher at 142p. French expansion, Page 27</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Observer: Shooting star Proof that the day of the entrepreneur is not yet over comes in the dashing form of Ivan Bradbury, owner of printed circuit board maker Interconnection Systems, based in a depressed part of north-east England. Bradbury heard a few weeks ago that electronics giants Hewlett-Packard of the US and Japan's Oki were closing their state-of-the-art Dollars 40m factory in Puerto Rico after internal disagreements. He jumped on a plane and secured a deal which is bringing some 25 container loads of barely used, high-quality manufacturing equipment back to South Shields for the knock-down price of just over Pounds 1m, a fraction of how much it cost when the plant started operations a year or so ago. The deal will boost Bradbury's output significantly. Let's hope he doesn't slip up because he is one of the few star turns on the Treasury's industrial prospects committee.</p>

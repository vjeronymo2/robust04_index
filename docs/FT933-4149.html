			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Palestinian Economy: Public services in Occupied Territories inadequate An Investment in Peace' describes serious shortcomings in the infrastructure to be inherited by an incoming Palestinian self-government. 'The provision of public services and physical infrastructure is highly inadequate,' the report says, because of the state of public finances in the occupied territories. First, neither the Israeli military-run Civil Administration nor the utilities borrow to finance investment and are forced to fund investments from revenues. Second, the bodies have inadequate revenue resources. Third, there is a 'lack of coherence in sectoral policies and programmes'. The bank lists the inadequacies as follows: Water: Intermittent supply leads to contamination of water from the intrusion of polluted water into the networks. Power: Some 138 Palestinian villages have no permanent, full-time electricity supply. Sewage: Solid waste collection and disposal 'is grossly inadequate, raising serious health and environmental concerns'. There are no modern sanitary landfills and no satisfactory waste water collection or treatment system. Roads: 'The physical condition of the roads serving the Palestinian population has deteriorated to the point where without immediate rehabilitation, past investments may be lost completely.' Communications: There is a large suppressed demand with the backlog for telephone connections exceeding 12,500 in the West Bank. Educational facilities are poor. The health infrastructure is less in need of repair although hospitals and clinics are not efficient.</p>

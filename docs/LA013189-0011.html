			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AGUIRRE MUST REPAY $50,250 TO DUFFY, FILNER FOR ELECTION SUIT COSTS  </P> <P> Attorney Mike Aguirre, who lost a hotly contested District 8 San Diego City  Council seat to Bob Filner in 1987 and then lost a lawsuit he filed against the  victor and Sheriff John Duffy in 1988, now must pay some of the legal bills the  pair incurred during their defense, a judge has ruled.  </P> <P> U. S. District Judge William B. Enright issued a written order Friday,  directing Aguirre to pay $50,250 toward the legal tabs of Filner and Duffy.  </P> <P> Aguirre's suit contended that the two violated his constitutional rights in a  campaign flyer. The judge ordered $30,000 to go toward Filner's legal expenses  and $20,250 to go toward Duffy's.  </P> <P> Aguirre, who is attending Harvard for a one-year graduate study program, did  not return messages left on his answering machine Monday to respond to the  judge's order.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fees for Lawyers  </P> <P> Of the amount awarded to Duffy, $10,500 is allocated to pay his personal  attorney, and $9,750 is for his county counsel, who defended the sheriff in his  official capacity. Filner spent about $50,000 for his defense, while Duffy said  he spent about $18,000.  </P> <P> The lawsuit for unspecified damages, which was dismissed by Enright last  September, alleged that Filner enlisted the aid of Duffy -- along with his  authority as an elected official -- for a combination endorsement and attack on  Aguirre in the campaign mailer sent out just before the November election.  </P> <P> Patricia Meyer, Aguirre's law partner who is handling the case, said an appeal  of the decision could not be ruled out. But she conceded that Friday's decision  may be the final activity in the feud.  </P> <P> "I can't rule it out positively," Meyer said. "I want to make sure that I've  looked at all the aspects and then make a final decision. As far as Judge  Enright's decision, it's quite possible it will be the final say in the  matter."  </P> <P> Meyer, who has discussed Enright's order with Aguirre, said she "couldn't  accurately gauge" the attorney's reaction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Controversial Flyer  </P> <P> Aguirre ran an unsuccessful campaign against Filner in 1987 for the bitterly  contested 8th District council seat. During the campaign, the controversial  mailer was sent out on behalf of Filner just before the November election,  bearing a depiction of the sheriff's official badge and the headline: "A Strong  Letter From Sheriff Duffy." In the letter, the sheriff endorsed Filner and  described Aguirre as lacking integrity and accused him of being "a practitioner  of the big lie."  </P> <P> Filner hailed the judge's order on Monday as a victory, saying it sends out the  message that candidates for public office should not fear lawsuits from a loser  in the wake of defeat.  </P> <P> "I think this will help candidates who run against attorneys not to be  intimidated," Filner said. "An attorney can say, 'If you win, then I will sue.'  That kind of intimidation is not going to be successful if you don't have a  foundation for it. I think, if it would have been successful, there would have  been a real chilling effect.  </P> <P> "I'm angry. Originally, this thing cost me over $50,000 and a year's worth of  trouble. During the primaries, there were 10 of us (candidates) who joked about  who was going to be sued by Aguirre. We always joked, at the time, that he had  a reputation for this, and then he did it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'You Bet I'm Satisfied'  </P> <P> Duffy echoed Filner's comments, saying the order would discourage political  opponents from "bringing their political squabbles into the courtroom."  </P> <P> "You bet I'm satisfied," Duffy said Monday. "The judge's ruling on the  attorney's fees, I think, is a real vindication. My attorneys told me there was  a 50% chance of getting them."  </P> <P> Among the charges made in the original suit, Aguirre contended that the mailer  violated his right to free speech, undermined his right to run for office and  raised other federal constitutional questions. At that time, Aguirre said he  thought "there's still something there."  </P> <P> And Meyer reiterated Aguirre's earlier comment.  </P> <P> "I think it's fair to say I think the papers filed in court say there's  something there," she said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, word of the ruling has prompted a stream of congratulatory phone  calls to Filner's office at City Hall, he said.  </P></p>

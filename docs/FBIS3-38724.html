The ministers reiterated their governments' commitment to  regional peace and stability. From this perspective, they  examined regional developments, highlighting the overall  situation in Iraq, and laying special emphasis on the situation  in northern and southern Iraq.    The ministers also underscored the extreme importance of  safeguarding Iraq's unity and territorial integrity, noting that  this is important for peace and stability in the region. They  underlined the importance their governments have attached to  this issue, something that was reflected in the resolutions  passed by the UN Security Council in the aftermath of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait.    The ministers stressed the need for Iraq to commit itself to  the framework set by the relevant UN resolutions so that it may  rejoin the international community. They also urged Iraq to  make additional efforts toward that end by extending full  cooperation to the United Nations.    The ministers examined the situation in northern Iraq, and  urged the Iraqi Government to remove all restrictions against  Iraqis there. They expressed their strong convictions that the  ways and means of normalizing the situation in northern Iraq  must be explored in Iraq. This should be done, the ministers  maintained, through dialogue and through creating a climate of  peace and security for the Iraqis living there.    The ministers renewed their determination to resist all  attempts to disintegrate Iraq under any pretext. They expressed  their strong belief that the future of Iraq must be determined  by the free will of the entire Iraqi people on the basis of  equality, democracy, and good neighborly ties.    Within this context, the statements and activities promoting  partition by certain groups in some Western states are  unacceptable, and must be halted.    The ministers renewed their condemnation of the terrorism  targeting their countries, and expressed determination to take  all possible measures to achieve peace, stability, and  tranquility in the region.    The ministers agreed to continue their consultations to  safeguard the region's security and stability on the basis of  the principles enshrined in the UN Charter, such as according  due respect to the territorial integrity of states,  nonintervention in the domestic affairs of states, and peaceful  resolution of conflicts.    The ministers decided to hold their next meeting in Damascus  in July 1994. A committee of senior officials will meet one  month before the convocation of the foreign ministers' meeting  to prepare for this meeting.</p>

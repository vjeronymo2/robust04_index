			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Coal White Paper: Power station may mean 5,000 jobs THE GO-AHEAD for a gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay, Clwyd, may lead to the creation of up to 5,000 jobs for Merseyside, Cheshire and north Wales  -but it will not save the Cammell Laird shipyard from closure in July, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The Pounds 500m, 1,360MW power station will guarantee a market for four new gas fields discovered by Hamilton Oil, Lasmo and Monument in Liverpool Bay. Gas supplies of 1,000bn cu ft should last up to 25 years, as will an associated find of 200m barrels of oil off Southport. Hamilton puts total investment at Pounds 1.5bn, with 3,000 construction jobs and 200 permanent ones. But little construction work is likely before next year - too late for Cammell Laird at Birkenhead. Amec, previously the most likely buyer for the yard, is unlikely to bid now, especially with spare capacity at Amec Offshore on Tyneside. VSEL, the nuclear submarine builder which owns Cammell Laird, yesterday confirmed the closure will go ahead. Amec stopped discussions while the future of the Liverpool Bay gas and oil fields was uncertain.</p>

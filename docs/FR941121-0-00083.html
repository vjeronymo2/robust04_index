			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that disputes over the level or manner in which a service is provided, such as model variations of durable medical equipment, should not be subject to the appeals process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The appeal rights of Medicare enrollees of an HCPP pertain to disputes involving an organization determination. We believe that &sect;417.838(a), which identifies actions that are organization determinations, responds to this concern. Section 417.838(a) limits the applicability of the appeals process to a refusal, on the grounds that the services are not covered by Medicare, to furnish or arrange for services or pay for services furnished to the beneficiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter sought clarification on whether an HCPP's refusal to pay coinsurance on services obtained out-of-plan (and paid for by the carrier) would be subject to the appeals process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The HCPP's obligation to pay coinsurance amounts, where the plan's Medicare premium covers such amounts, would depend on the circumstances. If an enrollee is denied a service by the HCPP, then obtains the service out-of-plan, and subsequently the service is determined to be a covered service and paid for by the carrier under Medicare principles of reimbursement, the enrollee can request that the health plan pay the coinsurance amount. Then, if the HCPP makes an organization determination that is adverse to the enrollee, or fails to complete its review in 60 days, the matter would be referred to us for reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested allowing HCPP enrollees to retain existing appeal rights through Medicare carriers if the HCPP review process proves futile or ineffective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree. One intent of this rule is to ensure that HCPP enrollees have the same appeal rights as other beneficiaries in Medicare managed care. A back-up system does not exist for other Medicare beneficiaries and cannot be justified on either a cost or programmatic basis. When this rule takes effect, HCPP performance in operating an effective administrative review process will be added to our contractor monitoring process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the estimate for additional paperwork burden on HCPPs related to these new requirements is grossly underestimated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Health plans that contract with us as HCPPs vary in their administrative systems and capability to adapt to the new requirements. While we agree that the estimate may underrepresent the additional burden on some health plans, it may not for others. We attempted to estimate an ``average'' additional workload, given that most HCPPs have a grievance system for commercial enrollees on which to build an appeals system for Medicare enrollees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that they opposed a change to &sect;417.630 (``Right to a hearing'') regarding ``amounts remaining in controversy'' to qualify for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Addition of this phrase is a clarification of existing practice, not a substantive change. Beneficiary appeals made to Medicare managed care organizations may be denied in full or in part. Once a service or a claim has been covered by an HMO/CMP, even if the service is only one part of the appeal, &sect;417.604(a)(2) specifies that the service or claim is no longer subject to appeal. Only those services that continue to be denied may be moved through the process of reconsideration to hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter opposed the change in terminology from ``initial determination'' to ``organization determination.'' The commenter is concerned that policy issues may be mislabeled as ``organization issues'' and be misdirected to the appeals process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The concern of the commenter, we believe, is that communications to an HMO or CMP questioning the plan's coverage policies will be misinterpreted and directed to the plan's appeal process. We believe that HMOs and CMPs can distinguish between challenges to the plan's coverage policies, in general, and appeals of coverage decisions for specifically requested services, if clearly communicated. We do not believe that the commenter's rationale warrants a change from using the terminology ``organization determination'' as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Other Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that HMOs be granted formal appeal rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have considered this suggestion. However, because the commenter is suggesting a significant change that was not addressed in the proposed rule, we cannot address this issue at this time. The issue of HMO and CMP appeal rights, as well as other appeals process issues, will be evaluated and considered for development as a separate regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter questioned allowing HMOs/CMPs to request a reopening of a determination and another commenter recommended that an HMO/CMP request for a reopening should not delay implementation of the reconsideration determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  With regard to the first comment, the regulations impose no limitation on who may request a reopening, although the decision whether to reopen is discretionary with the decisionmaker. In response to the second comment, &sect;417.626 provides that a reconsidered determination is ``final and binding'' on all parties unless a hearing request is filed, or the determination ``is revised'' in accordance with a reopening decision. Therefore, if an HMO's or CMP's denial of a service or claim is overturned upon reconsideration, the plan must abide by the determination unless and until the termination is overturned as the result of the reopening.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

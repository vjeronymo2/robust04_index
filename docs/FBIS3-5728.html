			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, deputy chief of staff  of the Third Army Region, described the situation along the Lao  and Burmese borders at the Phithak Thai Meeting Hall in Somdet  Phra Ekathotsarot Camp, Phitsanulok Province at 1000 on 9 March.  He said the forces of the Kachin minority group have signed a  cooperation agreement with the Burmese Government. Two hundred  armed followers of the National United Front under the  leadership of Sanda and the Communist Party of Burma under its  leader surrendered to Major Cho Tong, deputy commander of  Battalion 4789, at its base in Ban Mae Chae, opposite Thailand's  Tambon Mae La Noi, Mae Hong Son Province in order to negotiate a  cease-fire. The Burmese soldiers did not confiscate the United  Front members' weapons.    According to Prasit, about 150 members of a Burmese  engineering battalion have been repairing the road between  Myawadi and Ban Mae Kasa, opposite Thailand's Phop Phra  District, Tak Province. They plan to repair the road to reach  the Phra Chedi Sam Ong [Three Pagodas' Pass] border crossing in  order to facilitate the conservation of forests in southern  Burma and the control of minority groups in the area. This  development could affect Thailand's security, particularly Thai  villagers near the border.    On the Lao border situation, Prasit said the Lao Government  has stepped up its suppression of antigovernment elements along  the Thai border. Forces in Ban Yuap -- opposite Thailand's  Chiang Kham District, Phayao Province -- have been augmented to  suppress anti- Lao elements under the leadership of Generals  Vang Pao and Thonglit, who have been active in the Mae Charim  District and Song Khwae Subdistrict, Nan, and in Chiang Kham  District, Phayao. It is necessary for the Third Army Region to  force all anti-Lao elements to cease their activities as the 8  April opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge approaches.    Prasit said Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit are the targets  of  the current suppression campaign. This will likely result in  more Lao people fleeing to Thailand. In that case, Thailand  will have to force them back.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY ORDERED TO KEEP WILMINGTON MENTAL CLINIC OPEN  </P> <P> In the latest twist in a tangled legal battle, a Superior Court judge Friday  ordered Los Angeles County officials to keep the Wilmington Mental Health  Center open, only hours before clinic workers were to permanently vacate the  psychiatric center.  </P> <P> "We have our boxes here, but we can now stop packing," said a joyful Mary  Ewing, a psychiatric nurse at the Wilmington clinic, which last saw patients a  week ago.  </P> <P> "We're going to start making patient appointments again. That's good news,"  Ewing said after the court decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Patients Notified  </P> <P> More than 120 patients at the Wilmington center had been notified last week  that they would be transferred to a nearby clinic after county mental health  officials claimed that safety reasons had forced them to close the facility.  </P> <P> But Superior Court Judge Barnet M. Cooperman declared Friday that the move  violates a preliminary injunction barring such closures and admonished the  county for going ahead with a shutdown plan without court approval.  </P> <P> The preliminary injunction, which Cooperman issued last September, prohibits  the county from closing any clinic until the state Supreme Court can rule on a  class-action lawsuit filed last summer. Legal Aid attorneys, representing  indigent mentally ill patients, had filed suit challenging the county's  original plan to close eight mental health clinics and curtail services at five  others for budgetary reasons.  </P> <P> After paring the original cut list to three clinics, county officials singled  out the Wilmington facility -- the county's smallest -- for closure and claimed  that the action did not violate the court order because it was not being done  for financial reasons.  </P> <P> Cooperman, however, ruled Friday that the county should have sought court  permission before closing the facility and throwing patients and staff members  into turmoil.  </P> <P> "Only in this way can misunderstandings be avoided . . . and persons who are  patients at this clinic will be protected from these misunderstandings," the  judge said.  </P> <P> Cooperman added that he would consider a request by county officials to modify  his preliminary injunction and still close the Wilmington clinic. But Mental  Health Director Roberto Quiroz said late Friday that no decision has been made  on whether the county would file such a request but that the clinic will reopen  Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Bunch of Rulings'  </P> <P> "We are being subjected to a whole bunch of rulings and findings totally  irresponsible in terms of stabilizing our situation in L.A. County," Quiroz  said, adding that his department would try to comply with the court ruling,  which includes an order that the county increase security and hire two more  psychiatric social workers at the Wilmington clinic.  </P> <P> Cooperman's ruling came two days after the state Supreme Court refused to block  the Wilmington closing, concluding that the high court lacked the jurisdiction  to enforce the preliminary injunction.  </P> <P> But after Legal Aid attorneys turned to Cooperman, the judge ruled that the  clinic could not be closed without a specific court order or until the state  Supreme Court had decided the clinics' case.  </P> <P> County lawyers were clearly stunned by the judge's decision. Immediately after  the decision, Roberta Fesler, assistant county counsel, was asked if she had a  comment. "Not a printable one," she replied.  </P> <P> Later, Fesler said the judge's decision was "not warranted" but said the county  would try to comply with it. However, she raised questions about whether the  department could find the additional psychiatric social workers ordered by  Cooperman.  </P> <P> "If it's not possible to comply with court order, the ball comes back to our  court to determine what is the best way to protect the county," Fesler said,  adding that the county might appeal the decision.  </P> <P> Paul Schettler, executive director of the Wilmington facility, took a different  view, although he said any celebration would be tempered. "It's a relief, but  it's still momentary. This thing is not yet over," he said. "We can't allow  ourselves to feel too good about it because don't know what's happening around  the next turn."  </P> <P> The court hearing came on the same day that a state Senate subcommittee held  hearings on the proposed closings of the mental health clinics. Testifying  before members of the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, Quiroz called  the court decision a "hollow victory" for its supporters and warned that the  county faces even deeper cuts in local programs during the next fiscal year  because of a bleak state funding picture.  </P> <P> Other speakers, including mental health patients and their advocates, pressed  for additional state funding for the mentally ill. But state Sen. Bill Greene  (D-Los Angeles), the subcommittee chairman, cautioned that any additional  funding for the mentally ill would be difficult to obtain.  </P></p>

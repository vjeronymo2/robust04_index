			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Warning by British Gas after quarterly decline BRITISH GAS yesterday warned that a combination of warm winter weather, low oil prices and increasing regulation could damage results this year, as it revealed an 11.5 per cent drop in first quarter current cost pre-tax profits. The stock market showed little surprise at the results, and the shares closed down 4 1/2 p at 250 1/2 p. This was despite the company's announcement that it would reduce prices to 17.8m domestic customers by 3 per cent from July. Profit came to Pounds 860m (Pounds 973m) from turnover of Pounds 3.58bn (Pounds 3.69bn). But the company said its underlying business remained strong, with continued growth in the key tariff market sector, which consisted mainly of domestic customers. In the UK gas supply sector, operating profit was down to Pounds 719m (Pounds 834m). Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said warm winter weather led to a 5 per cent fall in demand against 1991, and an 8 per cent drop compared with what would be expected in a normal winter. Sales in the tariff market showed strong underlying growth of 3 per cent, although contract sales to larger customers fell 14 per cent because of a combination of lower economic activity and increased market share by competitors. Mr Evans said 26 per cent of the UK firm gas market was now being supplied by competitors to British Gas, equivalent to 15 per cent of the total market including interruptible gas. Profits from UK marketing activities were Pounds 7m higher through an improved performance from installation and contracting. But flat appliance trading sales reflected the continued slump in retailing. Operating profits in the overseas gas supply sector rose to Pounds 71m (Pounds 68m). The exploration and production sector, in which British Gas is looking for substantial growth in coming years as its share of UK gas supply is reduced, suffered a slight downturn in profits to Pounds 104m (Pounds 111m). This was mainly the result of lower oil prices, although sales, at 29.7m barrels of oil equivalent, showed an increased from last year's 27.9m barrels. Earnings per share came to 13.7p (15.1p). Mr Evans said management faced a 'monumental challenge' in maintaining its levels of profitability, confronted with the cost of hiving off the pipeline business into a separate subsidiary. It must also reduce the share of the industrial gas supply market, and face competition in the commercial gas supply sector from later this year. Analysts warned that while British Gas had long known its core domestic supply business would reach saturation point in the second half of the 1990s, it was now facing an earlier-than-expected slowdown in that market. The need to invest in the exploration and production and global gas supply market to compensate for this would cut down the room for manoeuvre in reducing its spending.</p>

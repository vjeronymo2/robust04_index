			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / People: Said at Aitken Wafic Said, the Syrian-born arms dealer who was mentioned as a possible purchaser of the Observer newspaper earlier this year, has become a director of Aitken Hume International, the financial services group in which the Said Trust has a 31 per cent share. The other major shareholder, Lee Ming Tee of Hong Kong, has long been on the board. Ziad Idilby, chairman and chief executive of Aitken Hume, says he was approached by the Trust which wanted to nominate a director. As to the timing of Said's appointment, he adds simply: 'It is very difficult for the chairman to ask, hey, how come you want to be on the board?' In May, the group sold its fund management group National Securities Research, leaving only a London and a Guernsey bank and a huge pile of cash. 'It is time for the company to decide on its future direction,' Idilby agrees.</p>

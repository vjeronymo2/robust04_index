			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Ukraine and Russia have  made some progress on the division of the disputed Black Sea  Fleet, according to recent reports.    Delegations from the two countries made "great improvement"  in seeking a solution to the Black Sea Fleet issue during their  latest round of talks in Kiev on June 8 and 9, the UKRAINIAN  NEWS AGENCY reported.    The two sides have reached agreement on a detailed list  related to the divided fleet, ground equipment along the  coastline where the fleet is located and equipment in the  surrounding community.    Although they agreed to keep the fleet at its current base  in  the port city of Sevastopol on the Crimea Coast, Ukraine and  Russia still differ on this point. Russia has insisted on full  control of Sevastopol, while Ukraine proposed that both fleets  could be based in or near Sevastopol.    On May 24 and 25, the Ukrainian and Russian prime ministers  held talks on the fleet but failed to reach agreement as the two  sides disagreed over the location and terms for basing the two  fleets.</p>

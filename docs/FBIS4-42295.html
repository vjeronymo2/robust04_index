			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gino Li Veli: "No to Combative Judges"] </F>   [Excerpt] Milan -- "There is an international agreement  against Italy which we cannot accept. There are too many people  beyond the Alps who do not like our tricolor flag. However, we  must let the French know that it is not up to them to decide on  our foreign policy. As far as President Mitterrand is  concerned, he would be better advised to be concerned about the  agreements he has reached with the communist party, whose  totalitarian ideology has been ruinous for the world." These  words were uttered by [Justice Minister] Alfredo Biondi, who  yesterday briefly relinquished his role as justice minister in  order to speak from the platform at the Center Union Congress  held in Turin. Biondi made it clear that he did not welcome the  position adopted by the president of the French Republic.  Furthermore, he suggested that some sort of international  "conspiracy" against Italy's interests lurked behind the concern  expressed by many European leaders over the presence of AN  [National Alliance] members in Berlusconi's government. After  sounding the alarm, the minister nevertheless praised the  "firmness" displayed by his colleague [Foreign Minister] Antonio  Martino, who in the last few days made a sharp retort against  the head of the Elysee [French president's palace]. The liberal  leader also shared the foreign minister's position in favor of  "reviewing historical conditions with bordering countries in the  former Yugoslavia." [passage omitted]</p>

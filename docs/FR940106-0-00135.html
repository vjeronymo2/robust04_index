			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department does not believe that the regulations are ambiguous on this issue. The 1988 Amendments to section 239(f) state that every worker filing for UI is to be informed of the TAA program and the benefits available, even though the worker may not qualify for TAA. The regulations at &sect;&sect;617.4(e)(1) and 617.67(c)(2) clearly state that each worker who applies for UI shall be advised of the benefits available under the TAA program and does not confine such advice to workers who have been identified as adversely affected by imports. Therefore, no change is made in the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Advice to UI claimants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The OBES commented that &sect;617.4(e)(1) requires State agencies to advise each worker who files for unemployment insurance of TAA benefits available and the deadlines for applying for such benefits. The OBES requested that the final rule replace the term ``deadlines'' with ``time limits''. The final rule should also establish the administrative funding mechanism for the substantial costs associated with implementing this requirement. CEDD also commented on a funding issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The regulations at &sect;617.4(e)(1) track the language of section 239(f)(1) of the Trade Act, which provides that workers shall be informed of the ``deadlines'' for applying for TAA benefits. Matters of administrative funding are addressed in program letters and other issuances of the Department and will be addressed further in &sect;617.60 when it is published. (See explanation on the publication of &sect;617.60 in item Q. above.) No special funding category is contemplated for furnishing information and assistance to applicants and potential applicants. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> All UI claimants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The CEDD, commenting on &sect;617.10(d), stated that this section contains a statement about providing ``workers'' with TAA information at the time the UI claim is filed. The CEDD argues that, if the rule means every individual who files a UI claim, States will have problems meeting this requirement because often a TAA certification has not been issued when the worker files an initial UI claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The 1988 Amendments require the State agency to inform every worker filing an initial UI claim about the TAA program and the benefits available under it. There are no exceptions to this rule. One of the purposes of the amendment is to ensure that workers are informed of the program at that time so they can file a petition for TAA if they wish, whether or not a petition has been filed or a certification issued covering that worker or others. See &sect;617.4(e). The Department believes this requirement can be met easily by furnishing an information bulletin or brochure on the TAA program to every worker who files an initial UI claim. See discussion in item 8, above. Therefore, no change is made in the final regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Legal work requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The UAW commented that the proposed rules at &sect;617.11(a)(1)(iii)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(C) are not reflected in any provision of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, nor in the 1988 Amendments. The UAW stated that the Department is trying to enforce the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) with this provision. The UAW argued that if Congress wished to enact such a provision it could have, but it did not do so. IRCA did not implicitly amend other federal laws. The Department should not amend the TAA program to enforce IRCA in the absence of statutory authority and therefore the referenced subparagraphs should be deleted entirely. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The content of &sect;&sect;617.11(a)(1)(iii)(C) and (a)(2)(iii)(C) is not changed by reason of the 1988 Amendments. These sections of the regulations merely restate a requirement which has been in the TAA regulations since they were issued in 1975 in a different place within the regulations. No substantive change has been made in this regulatory requirement. These provisions do not implement the IRCA. Therefore, no change is made to the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certification period. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NYDL recommended that paragraphs (B) and (C) of &sect;617.11(a)(1)(ii) and (a)(2)(ii) be combined to read as follows: ``(B) Before the expiration of the two-year period beginning on the date of such certification, or, if earlier, before the termination date, if any, of such certification.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department agrees that this change would clarify an ambiguity in the statutory language. Therefore, the regulations are changed along the lines suggested by the NYDL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

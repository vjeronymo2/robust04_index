			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / The Clinton Economic Plan: Soaring costs that have to be tamed - Healthcare PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's economic plan was like a book with a missing chapter. All efforts to revive the economy would fail, Mr Clinton warned in the most moving passage of his address to Congress, if the country failed to take bold steps to reform the healthcare system. He said the nation already spent 30 per cent more of national income on healthcare than any other industrial country, yet was unique in failing to provide a basic package of benefits to all citizens. On present trends, healthcare would absorb 20 per cent of the economy by the year 2000. The figures released this week showed that the planned halving of the budget deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product by fiscal 1997 would represent only a temporary fiscal victory if healthcare is not reformed. Double-digit increases in spending on federal health programmes would result in steep rises in the deficit by the end of the decade. But while identifying the nation's most pressing economic problem, Mr Clinton is not yet in a position to give a clear indication of the type of solution the administration will recommend. Wednesday's plan imposed some relatively minor new curbs on payments to doctors and hospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid programmes for the elderly and poor and increased funding for a variety of preventive health programmes such as children's immunisations. But a full-scale restructuring of healthcare awaits the findings of the presidential task force headed by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton. It is expected to make recommendations by May. The centrepiece of the reform is expected to be some version of a system known as 'managed competition'. Mr Clinton has indicated that he wants people to be grouped into large healthcare purchasing co-operatives that could negotiate good quality and cost-effective care from competing providers in the private sector. At issue is the degree to which such institutions would be subject to direct regulations. The administration is examining the feasibility of various more direct controls on the price and volume of services that hospitals and doctors can provide. One option would be to extend regulations now applying to federal schemes to the private sector. But any changes are likely to provoke strong opposition, if only because cost controls in effect mean controls on the incomes of physicians, hospitals, insurance companies and drug companies, all of which are well represented by Washington lobbyists. In the short run, there is no prospect of cost controls saving money. Indeed, fears are growing that the planned extension of health care benefits to the 37m Americans without insurance cannot be financed without a new wave of tax increases of between Dollars 30bn and Dollars 90bn (Pounds 21bn and Pounds 63bn). Companies fear that directly or indirectly they will be asked to pick up a large chunk of the costs of extending insurance. But until Mr Clinton writes the healthcare chapter of his reform, his economic package remains an unfinished work, lacking full credibility.</p>

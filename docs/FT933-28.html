			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (19): Red tape heroes - Non Resident Indian Investors AN Indian businessman, resident abroad, who wanted to invest less than Dollars 500,000 to set up an export-oriented software company in Bangalore, south India, spent about six months going through nine steps in three cities to win approval for his plans. First he applied in Bangalore to the director of the Software Technology Park (STP), a special commercial estate designed to attract high-technology investment. Then the application was considered by an inter-ministerial committee of the Department of Electronics (DOE) in Delhi. The committee sent the application to the Secretariat for Industrial Approval SIA) in the Industries Ministry to certify that the company was a 100 per cent Export Oriented Unit (EOU), and therefore entitled to special regulatory privileges aimed at promoting exports. From the SIA, the case went to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), where the majority foreign ownership was cleared and permission granted for the eventual repatriation of dividends. The FIPB's decision was passed for ratification to the Empowered Committee, a committee of one - the finance minister. The application was sent back to the SIA which issued an EOU certificate. Armed with this, the applicant went to Bombay to the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to seek permission to remit the money from abroad and invest it in an Indian company. He negotiated terms with the RBI. He was permitted to invest his money in India. Whether the investment is Dollars 0.5m or Dollars 300m, the procedure is the same. It is no wonder that most non-resident Indians and foreigners are turned off by Indian bureaucracy. The only solution is to abolish the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the law which controls foreign exchange transactions. Even after recent reforms, the rules run into hundreds of pages. Any partial tinkering will not do. The financial regulation of foreign investments should be delegated to commercial banks which can be authorised to ensure that the remaining rules are observed. The greatest challenge facing India is creating enough jobs for its burgeoning population. India's unemployed have never been properly estimated but they could total 100m. As the population is growing at 20m a year, India must create at least 10m jobs a year. The total number of jobs in the organised sector is only 26m - 18.5m in the public sector and 7.5m in private companies. Only about 0.7m jobs a year have been created in the past few years, most of them in the public sector. The lack of jobs is a socially-explosive issue manifesting itself through demands for increasing job reservation according to caste. This is a time-bomb. Lacking a social security system for the unemployed, India desperately needs to create more jobs. It can only do this by a radical economic policy change to generate economic growth of 10 per cent a year, instead of about 5 per cent as now. The main constraint on growth is the lack of capital. India's savings rate is high at over 20 per cent of GDP, but much of this money is deployed to support a large bureaucracy and a vast loss-making public sector industry. The only sensible solution is to attract more foreign investment. India needs an infusion of at least Dollars 10bn a year for 10 years. It can only get it by making it easier for foreigners to invest. The government has already taken some steps - significant by Indian standards - to liberalise the economy. It has virtually abolished industrial licensing; it has diluted the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act; it has made the rupee fully convertible for trade transactions. Today it is possible for Indian and foreign companies to expand their activities even through mergers. The recent take-over of Tomco, a soaps and detergents company in the Tata industrial grouping, by Hindustan Lever, an affiliate of Unilever, the international foods group, is an example of the new freedom. Foreign companies which were previously forced to reduce their holdings to 40 per cent have been able to raise them to 51 per cent, and that at reasonable prices. New investors attracted by the change in policies include American corporations such as Coca Cola, Pepsi, General Electric, and IBM. Indian exports have also become more competitive and increased significantly in the recent past. Yet the total of direct foreign investment approved by the government is under Dollars 2bn. The investment which has actually flowed into India is much smaller. This is a trickle compared to what the country needs. (China has in the past decade attracted Dollars 40bn). The Indian government needs to take the following steps to make the country more attractive to foreign investors: strengthen the government's commitment to reform by inducting into the Cabinet more ministers who are not only fully committed to reform but are able to articulate the policy in Parliament, in public and in the media. decentralise the decision-making process with regard to industrial investment. With the end of licensing, there is very little need for the centre to intervene in India. Intervention only adds to confusion, corruption and delay. Decentralisation will simplify procedures and promote competition for investment among states. To speed this up, each state should be allowed to set up a Special Economic Zone to attract export-oriented investment. large public sector undertakings should be opened to international groups with specialised knowledge in areas such as petroleum, power, and telecommunications. This will help upgrade India's infrastructure, the poor quality of which is a major limitation on growth. reform the financial sector by forcing nationalised banks to go to the capital markets to raise capital and by allowing foreign financial institutions to enter and compete. Competition is the best cure. abolish foreign exchange regulation. By adopting these suggestions, India can eventually attract a much larger flow of investments than China because it has significant advantages such as democracy, the rule of law, a highly-sophisticated entrepreneurial class, well established stock markets, a good supply of talented English-speaking managers, and cheaper skilled labour than the rest of Asia.

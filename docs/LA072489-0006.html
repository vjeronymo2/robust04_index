			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WOULD END ITS UNFAIR COLONIAL STATUS  </P> <P> The time has come to place statehood for the people of Washington, D.C., at the  very forefront of the nation's civil-rights agenda.  </P> <P> In 1989, more than 200 years after the U.S. Constitution promised to "secure  the blessings of liberty" to all citizens, the District of Columbia's colonial  status is a scandal that must be brought to the attention of the nation and the  world.  </P> <P> It is a little-known but increasingly intolerable reality that 650,000  Americans living in the district have only a limited form of home rule that is  subject to congressional veto at all times. Even worse, they are denied the  right to voting representation in Congress, the very institution that has final  say over their land, their property, their laws and, ultimately, their lives.  </P> <P> The people of Washington, D.C., are living under congressional occupation.  </P> <P> But now we have the chance to wipe out this stain on American democracy by  passing bipartisan legislation, pending now in Congress, to carve out a  separate "federal enclave" of government buildings and designate the rest of  the District as "New Columbia," the 51st state of the Union.  </P> <P> The American revolutionaries who dumped tea in Boston Harbor held up this  slogan: "No taxation without representation!" And today that slogan should be  raised again by more than half a million patriotic Americans who pay federal  taxes, fight and die in foreign wars and are subject to federal laws written by  Congress.  </P> <P> The citizens of the District of Columbia have fought in every war since the  American Revolution. In the Vietnam War, the people of the district suffered  more casualties than the people of 10 states and more casualties on a  per-capita basis than the people of 47 states.  </P> <P> The people of the district annually contribute more than a billion dollars in  taxes to the federal treasury, which is more in absolute terms than nine states  pay and more in per-capita terms than is paid by 49 states.  </P> <P> At a time when democracy is afire in the minds of people all over the world,  this shocking colonialism in the nation's capital threatens America's claim to  be the world's leader in democracy .  </P> <P> In fact, the United States is the only democracy on Earth that denies  parliamentary representation to the citizens of its capital city. Indeed, of  115 nations with elected national legislatures, from Austria through Zimbabwe,  only the United States denies representation to citizens of its capital city.  </P> <P> How would we react if the citizens of Paris were denied representation in the  French National Assembly, 200 years after the French Revolution, or if the  citizens of Bonn were given no voice in the Bundestag?  </P> <P> It would be cause for outrage because it offends common sense, which is the  very basis of democracy.  </P> <P> That is why a national survey conducted by former President Reagan's pollster,  Richard Wirthlin, determined that by an overwhelming 8-to-1 margin, Americans  agree that the citizens of the district are entitled to the same rights as the  citizens of the 50 states. The poll also found that, by a 2-to-1 margin,  Americans support bipartisan legislation now before Congress to make "New  Columbia" the 51st state.  </P> <P> That is why the 1988 Democratic Party platform promoted statehood for  Washington, D.C., as a plank, and that is why it should be in the Republican  President's program in 1990.  </P> <P> The arguments against statehood make no sense. For example, it is said that the  population of Washington, D.C., is too small for statehood. But the fact is  that more American citizens live there than in Vermont, Wyoming, North Dakota  or Delaware.  </P> <P> If there is a magic population threshold for statehood, the people of  Washington have already passed it.  </P> <P> Perhaps it will be said that the state created by the people of Washington will  wield too much power over the federal government. But the supremacy clause of  the Constitution makes it clear that federal law and policy prevail over the  law of any state.  </P> <P> The rest of the opposition to statehood for Washington is based on partisan  political motivation or -- we must be frank -- racism. The next time someone  tells you that the people of Washington don't "deserve" statehood, ask him if  he would feel the same way if the city were two-thirds white.  </P> <P> Such selfish and antiquated motivations should have no place in a matter of  basic citizenship rights under the American form of government.  </P> <P> President Bush has said that he is in favor of statehood for Puerto Rico, when  the people of Puerto Rico have not even applied for it. The people of  Washington, D.C., on the other hand, adopted a "Constitution for the State of  New Columbia" on Nov. 2, 1982. This Constitution and a petition for statehood  were sent to Congress on Sept. 9, 1983. Yet President Bush, who lives in the  district, has not yet declared his support for statehood for the people who  live there.  </P> <P> Surely President Bush and those members of Congress who were indignant about  the Supreme Court's flag-burning decision love American democracy enough to  extend its rights and privileges to all American citizens. Or is the rhetoric  of democracy inside the Capitol not to be made the reality of life in the  capital city?  </P> <P> More than 650,000 good and patriotic American citizens are waiting for an  answer.  </P></p>

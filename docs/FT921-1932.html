			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Fund managers jump on the bondwagon - International bonds for short-term investment THIS TIME last year, the unit trust industry was piling into a previously under-exploited sector: international bonds. Unit trusts have always been regarded in Britain as primarily an equity vehicle; but at the beginning of 1991 a series of the bluest-chip names in the industry, including Mercury, Baring, Fidelity and Newton, launched bond funds. The argument was simple. The world was near the trough of a recession, and a recession traditionally is the best time to buy bonds. Yields are high, offering good income initially. Then, as interest rates come down, investors need a lower yield to tempt them into bonds. As yields go down, so the price of bonds must rise, offering the prospect of strong short-term gains. International bonds were favoured because British base rates were falling already. Meanwhile, European interest rates were ready to fall, while currency risks had been lessened by entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Also, international bond funds have a more favourable tax position than gilt funds. So investors could look forward to a quick, tax-efficient gain. Has it happened? Not really. Over the past year, the average fund in the sector has grown 9.3 per cent; nothing spectacular, although this does put the sector slightly ahead of international growth equity funds, which have put on 7.2 per cent. Of the brave new bond funds from last year, Mercury's Global Bond unit trust, now worth an enormous Pounds 145.6m, is ninth in the sector, having grown 9.9 per cent. Baring's fund is up 9.4 per cent, Fidelity's 10.5 per cent (seventh in the sector) but Newton's only 3.3 per cent (last of the 22 funds with a year's record). The reason, of course, is that the recession has not ended on cue. The pattern is not uniform across the world, but there are still several economies which have yet to see significant cuts in interest rates. As a result, some of the most attractive bond markets of a year ago - particularly France - still seem poised to produce comfortable gains. Peter Oppenheimer, chief international economic strategist at Hambros, sees the world's economies as having reached different points in the recession. He says: 'The axis is still split between those countries which are close to some kind of moderate recovery in growth, and others which are still waiting for cuts in interest rates.' Most of the former are 'Anglo-Saxon' economies - the US, Canada, Australia and, to some extent, the UK - and there is little hope of exciting growth in their bond markets. But Oppenheimer foresees strong prospects for bond prices in the rest of the world, particularly Japan and continental Europe. He says the interest rate reductions which had been forecast for Europe have been tempered by the ERM and, more recently, by a troubled wage negotiation round in Germany. Economic troubles there have helped to keep other European economies offering rather better rates than they would do otherwise; in particular, Oppenheimer notes that France, which has a low inflation rate, is offering real bond yields (above inflation) of 7 per cent. French bonds, therefore, seem overdue for a strong rally. He adds that when the Bundesbank does cut base rates, it usually does so quickly and substantially. In each of the last two recessions, it cut four percentage points off base rates in 12 months. Oppenheimer's analysis is shared by many fund managers. Ian Ainscow of Commercial Union - whose PPT Global Bond fund, aimed primarily at umbrella funds, leads the sector over three years - says the fund is as underweight as it can be in dollar bonds. It aims to beat the Salomon Brothers World Bond index, 50 per cent of which is in dollar bonds, so this still requires a heavy amount of US stock. CU has twice the index weighting in France and is also heavily overweight in Spain. And it has a heavy allocation of yen bonds, anticipating that the Japanese economy is moving into a severe slow-down. Mercury, however, believes that US bonds should continue to make progress providing fiscal measures are not considered to be 'unduly aggressive.' But its distribution at the beginning of the year included 33.9 per cent in France, 11.5 per cent in Spain and 14.4 per cent in Japan. So, the chance of a strong gain in the short term is still there. Whether you should look at bonds as a capital growth investment for the long term is another matter altogether. Over the past 10 years, the four funds which have been going this long have managed average growth of 165.6 per cent, according to Micropal. International growth equity funds grew 256.7 per cent over the same period, and UK growth funds 321.4 per cent. Traditionally, bonds have been prey to the ravages of inflation although this may change in the 1990s, in the view of some commentators. The five-year figures, which reflect the full impact of the October 1987 crash on equities, show that while the sector has moderate attractions for the risk-averse investor, they should not be overstated. Although the average international bond trust beat a UK growth trust, the return for investors since March 1987 was just 18.8 per cent (a compound rate of only 3.5 per cent per year). The following view from Fidelity, therefore, seems to make sense: 'An international bond exposure could be recommended for investors who expect interest rates to continue falling but who are not confident enough to put their money into equities yet.' Do not, however, expose yourself to international bonds without examining conventional and index-linked gilts first. They are better for the security-conscious investor.  ----------------------------------------------------- BEST INTERNATIONAL FIXED INTEREST TRUSTS OVER 1 YEAR  -----------------------------------------------------                         % gain  ----------------------------------------------------- Norwich Int Bond          15.6 Whittingdale US Shrt      14.6 CU Worldwide Bond         14.2 CU PPT Global             13.2 Invesco Int Bond          12.5  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal.

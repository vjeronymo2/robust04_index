			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Bahrain breaks Gulf ranks and urges closer ties with Iraq BAHRAIN has become the first frontline Gulf country to urge better relations with Iraq since the forces of President Saddam Hussein were driven out of Kuwait last year. Sheikh Khalifa bin Sulman al Khalifa, prime minister, said in an interview at the weekend that it was time to open a new chapter in relations among the Gulf states and put behind 'whatever has happened between us'. At the height of the Gulf war Bahrain was attacked by Scud missiles and was host to more than 17,500 US servicemen and over 200 combat aircraft, including Tornados from the British Royal Air Force. It is the operational headquarters for the substantial US naval presence in the Gulf. The prime minister's comments followed greetings he sent to President Saddam at the start of a recent Moslem holiday and reported contacts between Iraqi and Bahraini officials in Rio de Janeiro during the Earth Summit. Sheikh Khalifa said he could not speak for his neighbours on the sensitive issue of developing ties with Iraq - his initiative is certain to be greeted with concern, especially in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - but he pointed out that Oman, one of six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), had maintained links with Baghdad throughout the crisis. Sheik Khalifa likened a rapprochement with Iraq to US moves to improve links with Vietnam. 'They lost 50,000 men in Vietnam but they are now trying to normalise relations. It is only natural,' he said. 'I would like to see normalisation of relations in the Gulf on a wider scale with all countries - this is the only way we can maintain our international relations and security.' The prime minister added: 'Saddam Hussein is only a man. He will die one day. However, Iraq has to be preserved as a country. There is an idea in the west that Iraq could be divided into northern, central and southern parts. We want to prevent its break-up.' He emphasised the humanitarian nature of his desire for closer links with Baghdad. 'It was not just a cable I sent to Saddam Hussein. We look at Iraq as one Iraq. We look at the Iraqi people and we look at suffering people all over the world. We look at Yugoslavia, and we have sympathy with the people of Iraq.' Sheik Khalifa said governments were racing to re-establish links with Iran. He looked forward to the day when the GCC (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar) might be expanded to include Iran and Iraq. But before this could happen the GCC would have to patch up differences, a reference to several divisive border and economic issues. Iraqi and UN officials began a third session of talks yesterday to seek a way to end the UN oil embargo against Baghdad, Reuter reports from Vienna. Under discussion is a plan agreed in September by the Security Council, and extended in March, which would allow Iraq to sell Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 860m) of oil over a six-month period. The sales would be monitored by the UN and would fund purchases of food and medicines for Iraq, war reparations to Kuwait and UN costs incurred in enforcing the Gulf war ceasefire.</p>

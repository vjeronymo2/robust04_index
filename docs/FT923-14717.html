			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (8): Anti-trust watchdog shows its teeth - Competition 'WE CAN bite as well as bark,' claims Mr Alberto Pera, general secretary of the Autorita Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato, Italy's anti-trust authority. Established in October 1990, the authority has just reported on its first full year of activity. The record shows that the authority examined 104 cases of concentration, involving a total of 238 companies, in 1991. Among these was the ENI state hydrocarbons holding's purchase of Montedison's shareholding in the Enichem chemicals company. This operation drew the authority's wrath and a L500m penalty against the state holding corporation for its failure to report the share purchase. Another big state company, the Sip telephone monopoly, also earned an adverse ruling last year when the authority decided that it was abusing its dominant position. During the first quarter this year the authority examined nearly 100 cases of concentration, gave opinions on operations in the banking and publishing sectors (where the Bank of Italy and the media authority have anti-trust responsibilities) and investigated 15 agreements between firms. More recent decisions have included pecuniary penalties against two cement companies. Italy's anti-trust watchdog seems to be getting its teeth into the task, as well as making itself heard. But not before time. Rome was late in legislating against competition distortions and the law limits the authority to strictly domestic matters that are not covered by rules set in Brussels. Indeed, Italy's anti-trust law mirrors the principles framed in EC market legislation, regulating agreements between companies, abuse of dominant position and takeovers. The authority must be notified in takeovers where the aggregate turnover of the companies involved exceeds L500bn in Italy, or where the Italian turnover of the comapny being taken over is more than L50bn. The authority must complete its investigation within 45 days. Mr Pera says that simple cases are dealt with rapidly, usually within a few days. While most of the authority's work involves takeovers, it is handling an increasing number of cases of abuse of dominant position. 'These generally arise from complaints to the authority,' says Mr Pera. 'With only 60 staff we have not been able to search for abuse of dominant position. But we recognise the need for being active as well as reactive,' he adds. The legislation that established Italy's anti-trust authority gave it full autonomy of operation and independence in its decision-making. It is headed by a chairman, currently Mr Francesco Saja, and four members, all five being appointed by the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate for non-renewable, seven-year terms. Has the authority been able to assert the independence it enjoys on paper, and avoid the powerful party political tentacles that grip Italy's public administration? 'So far we have encountered no political obstacles or been subjected to interference,' claims Mr Pera. He says the ruling in the Sip case should show the political placemen in state corporations that the authority means business.</p>

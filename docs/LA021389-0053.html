			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI SUSPECT-TRACKING PLAN DRAWS FIRE  </P> <P> A proposed expansion of the FBI's nationwide computerized crime files to track  suspects under investigation -- but not sought for arrest -- was attacked  Sunday on civil liberties and technical grounds by a panel of computer  scientists  </P> <P> The expansion would convert the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC)  from a system based on information in the public record into "an unprecedented  type of nationwide electronic surveillance," according to an advisory panel to  the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.  </P> <P> FBI Director William S. Sessions recently reached a decision on whether to go  ahead with the controversial expansion, and his finding will be forwarded to  Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh for "appropriate review," said Milton Ahlerich, the  FBI's assistant director for congressional and public affairs. He declined to  disclose Sessions' decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discussed Vigorously  </P> <P> However, Ahlerich said civil liberties and privacy concerns weighed "most  heavily," along with operational concerns, in Sessions' decision. "It was given  very vigorous discussion, and everyone weighed in on it," he said.  </P> <P> At the heart of the dispute is the NCIC, which was created in 1967 as a  mechanism for the interstate exchange of criminal justice information and has  grown from about 300,000 individual records to about 20 million records on  wanted or missing persons, stolen property and criminal histories.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, the NCIC advisory policy board, made up of representatives  of some of the 64,000 federal, state and local agencies that draw on the  system, recommended to Sessions that it be used for tracking suspects in drug,  murder and kidnaping cases for whom no arrest warrants had been issued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Generate Notice  </P> <P> Under the proposed expansion, subjects of investigations would be listed on an  NCIC index, and any subsequent query to the computer on such a person would  generate a notice to the investigating agency, specifying the current location  of the individual.  </P> <P> The system includes a "silent hit" feature that is designed to help safeguard  the privacy of individuals on the index. It would not tell an inquiring police  officer that the subject of his inquiry is also under investigation for drug  trafficking, murder or kidnaping. But the inquiry would give the agency that  originally entered the subject in the NCIC tracking file the option of  contacting the inquiring officer for further information.  </P> <P> "However, even if the silent hit proposal is implemented, officers could learn  of the existence of an investigation in another agency," said the report by  Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, which worked with the  American Civil Liberties Union to assess the expansion.  </P> <P> "By entering a query on a particular individual, an officer would trigger a  contact from the investigator who created the original record," the report  noted.  </P> <P> Adding investigative files to the NCIC would dramatically change the system,  said the report, which was requested by Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman  of the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raise Serious Issues  </P> <P> "It would turn the NCIC from a public record system, which collects and  disseminates information already available to the public, into a surveillance  system," the report said. "Such files are not authorized by statute and raise  serious constitutional issues."  </P> <P> Potential benefits to law enforcement from the tracking files "appear to be  limited," the report said. "Investigators may have difficulty locating the  inquiring officer, and that officer may not remember the encounter with the  subject (which may have been a routine traffic stop)."  </P> <P> The NCIC advisory policy board, while recommending using the system to track  persons under investigation in drug, murder or kidnaping cases, opposed using  it for organized crime, arson, terrorism and foreign intelligence cases. No  official could be reached to explain why the group excluded these categories,  but it appeared to be trying to limit the scope of the system's expansion.  </P> <P> But the report contended that approving of any tracking files would serve as a  precedent for further expansion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Notes Public Concern  </P> <P> "Proponents of new files will select areas of crime where there is widespread  public concern," the report said. "The drug trafficking file was among the  first to be proposed, precisely because of that concern. If another issue  similarly captures the attention of the media and the public, there will be  calls for a tracking file in that area."  </P> <P> Edwards, who forwarded a copy of the report to Sessions last week, is expected  to hold subcommittee hearings on the expansion next month.  </P> <P> Sections of the report were written by James J. Horning, Peter G. Neumann and  David D. Redell, all computer scientists and members of Computer Professionals  for Social Responsibility; Janlori Goldman, an attorney with the ACLU's project  on privacy and technology, and Diana R. Gordon, a professor of political  science at the City College of New York.  </P></p>

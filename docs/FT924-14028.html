			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Creditors split over Soviet debt deal WESTERN creditor governments are scheduled to meet in Paris in the middle of next week to discuss a possible rescheduling of the former Soviet Union's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 39.3bn) foreign debt, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. A deferral of principal payments on medium-term debts has been extended until the end of this month in anticipation of a full rescheduling. But Paris Club creditors are at loggerheads with each other and their commercial banks over how generous it should be. Another problem is that Russia - which is the only republic to be making any debt repayments and wants formal responsibility for the entire debt if other republics give up claims on former Soviet assets - has so far failed to reach agreement with Ukraine on a special arrangement for sharing repayments with it. Diplomats said this was less serious a problem, however, than disagreements between countries such as the US, which has relatively little exposure, and Germany, which is owed the lion's share. Mr Peter Aven, Russian foreign economic relations minister, says Russia can pay only Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 3bn next year instead of the Dollars 20bn falling due.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Procter and Gamble buys German tissue producer Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant, is to take its first step into the Dollars 5.5bn-a-year European market for toilet paper, kitchen towels and paper handkerchiefs with the acquisition of VP-Schickedanz, a leading German manufacturer of hygiene products. The VPS brands being acquired include Bess toilet paper, Tempo paper handkerchiefs, Camelia feminine protection pads and Certina adult incontinence products. VPS's disposable nappy business is not included in the sale. The purchase is being made from VPS's parent, the privately-held Gustav und Grete Schickedanz Holding of Furth, Germany. The purchase price is thought to have been about DM1bn (Dollars 582m), although neither side would confirm this. Information about the German company is scarce: Schickedanz said that in the year to end-January, consolidated turnover was DM1.5bn and, despite increased European competition, the company had shown a 'sound and solid financial performance'. Mr Edwin Artzt, Procter &amp; Gamble's chairman and chief executive, said paper products were the group's biggest business after detergents, but this would be the company's first move into the tissue business outside North America. Procter &amp; Gamble already sells disposable nappies, feminine protection pads and adult incontinence products in Europe, and Mr Artzt said the purchase was a good opportunity to extend that presence into tissue products. The VPS business represents only a small part of the Schickedanz group, a family concern with annual sales of around DM18bn in activities as various as mail-order, retailing, beer and financial services. The recession has forced Schickedanz, in common with many large German groups, to focus on its 'core businesses' and the sale of VPS is an early example of a corporate spin-off prompted by the streamlining process under way in broad swathes of German industry. The company was advised on the sale by Morgan Stanley.</p>

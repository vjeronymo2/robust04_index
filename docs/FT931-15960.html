			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / One-day strike closes TSB branches and hits services THE NATIONAL strike at TSB Bank yesterday led to the closure of at least 380 branches and prevented the delivery of all cheques to processing centres. Bifu, the banking union, said the strike had been the most disruptive in the banking industry for 20 years. TSB executives admitted that the effectiveness of the action had surprised them. There was a dispute between Bifu and TSB about the number of branches affected. Bifu claimed 700 of TSB's 1,400 branches had been closed and that 14,000 employees took part. TSB's banking operations employ slightly more than 20,000 people, excluding its insurance staff. Mr John Elbourne, TSB's chief operating officer in charge of retail banking and insurance operations, said 73 per cent of branches stayed open, and that the number of strikers was much lower than Bifu claimed. He admitted that no cheques were being delivered to processing centres, so customers would experience 'a slight delay' before cheques were credited to their accounts. The strike was prompted by TSB's unilateral decision to amend a 1983 agreement with Bifu that job cuts at the bank should be achieved without compulsory redundancies. Mr Elbourne said such an agreement was no longer tenable because of pressure on banks to cut costs. He denied the bank was seeking immediate compulsory redundancies. Mr Bill Green, the Bifu organiser for Birmingham, said the bank was trying to include compulsory redundancies as part of its programme to cut 1,000 jobs by the end of January. Compulsory redundancies have been rare in the banking industry. Last year National Westminster became the first big bank to say it would make some compulsory redundancies. Bifu said that unless a settlement was reached soon with TSB it would embark on a series of selective strikes in different regions. Industrial action has not been particularly successful at any of the big banks since 1987 when there was widespread industrial action over pay at many of them. Pickets hold line, Page 4</p>

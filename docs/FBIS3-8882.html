			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A group of parliament members from the National  Unity Party of Romania [PUNR] held a news conference in the  Green Hall of the Senate today within the framework of which  Adrian Motiu, vice president of the Senate Foreign Policy  Commission, presented a few of his conclusions regarding the  visit he recently paid to Washington.    Referring to the way Romania is known in Washington, the  PUNR  senator assessed that this knowledge is simplistic and distorted  due to the lack of information for which the diplomatic mission  representing us there is to be blamed as well.    Mr. Adrian Motiu specified that during his meetings at the  State Department and U.S. Congress, he explained that the PUNR  is far from the description of extremism and that the verbal  attacks of certain leaders have nothing to do with the way of  action and thinking of PUNR.    Referring to the Hungarian celebration linked to 13-15  March,  PUNR believes that they must take place within a legal  framework, without harming the national dignity of Romanians,  our correspondent Ana Ionescu informed us.</p>

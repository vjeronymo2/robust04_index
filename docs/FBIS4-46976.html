			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ukrainian Socioeconomic Situation in </F> the First Quarter of 1994"]    [Text]  <H5>  Industry </H5>   A decline in production accelerated in Ukraine in the first  quarter of 1994. The gross domestic product fell by 34 percent  compared to the corresponding period of 1993 and the national  income by 36 percent. The decline in production reached the  highest level since the beginning of the year. Compared to the  first quarter of 1993, the volume of production fell by 38  percent and labor productivity fell by 32 percent. More than 75  percent of the industrial enterprises reduced the volume of  production. The greatest drop in the output of products was  registered in ferrous metallurgy, the chemical, petrochemical,  refinery, light and pulp-and-paper industries, machine building,  and the construction materials industry.    A decline in the production of the main types of energy  resources in the fuel and energy industries was also registered.  On the whole, 27.3 million tonnes of fuel were produced, which  was 4.3 million tonnes (or 14 percent) less than in the first  quarter of 1993. The volume of primary oil refining fell by more  than one-half, and the production of motor gasoline, diesel  fuel, and heavy fuel oil diminished accordingly.    The drop in production has affected a majority of the key  types of products in the chemical and petrochemical industries,  mineral fertilizers, tires for trucks and passenger cars,  synthetic resins, and plastics. The procurement of commercial  wood and timber products fell in the timber industry;  consequently, the output of the key types of products of the  woodworking and pulp-and-paper industries declined  substantially. The production of pulp, paper, and cardboard fell  by a factor of five.  <H5>  Agriculture </H5>   Spring field work is underway in the entire territory of  Ukraine. Before the beginning of May, farms had been planted: in  spring crops--an area of 10 million hectares, which was 64.5  percent more than was planted at that time the year before; in  sugar beets-- 1.1459 million hectares; in sunflowers--592,300  hectares; and in potatoes--73,800 hectares.    The situation in animal husbandry remains difficult although  the first signs of its stabilization have appeared. The average  daily increment in cattle and hog breeding and finishing  increased for the first time in recent years. The average milk  yield per cow on public-sector farms came to 424 kilograms in  the first quarter compared to 413 kilograms during the  corresponding period of 1993. However, in the first quarter of  1994, the collective, interfarm agricultural enterprises, and  sovkhozes produced almost one-third less meat in live weight  than during the corresponding period of last year and 21 percent  fewer eggs. Milk production was almost at the 1993 level. The  volume of cattle and poultry breeding dropped by 11 percent.  <H5>  Construction </H5>   The pace of construction of facilities in the social sphere  slowed down. Residential buildings, with a total floor space of  967,000 square meters, with all forms of ownership were built,  which is 46 percent less than in the corresponding period of  last year. Less housing was built in Crimea, Kiev, and  Sevastopol, as well as in 18 other oblasts.  <H5>  Transportation Carriage </H5>   The work of transportation has continued to deteriorate as a  result of cutbacks in production, the disruption of economic  relations, a failure to meet contractual obligations, and a fuel  shortage. In the first quarter of this year, all modes of  public-use transportation carried 206 million tonnes of freight  (336 million tonnes during the corresponding period of 1993).  The carriage of freight by railway transportation fell by 35  percent. The volume of carriage by highway transportation fell  by a factor of more than two (52 million tonnes of freight were  carried). Some 6.3 million tonnes of freight were carried since  the beginning of the year by all modes of transportation. The  rate of decline in carriage came to 8 percent. Since the  beginning of the year, all modes of transportation carried 1.1  billion passengers. The rate of decline in carriage was 18  percent.  <H5>  Finance and Prices </H5>   The processes of imbalance in state finances, as one of the  manifestations of economic crisis, grew stronger. The Ukrainian  state budget had a deficit of 8.6 percent. The emission of  currency in the first quarter of this year came to 10.8 trillion  karbovantsy and, compared to the corresponding period of 1993,  increased by a factor of more than 36.    At the same time, a decline in the inflation rate was  registered on a monthly basis in the first quarter of 1994. In  January, the inflation index came to 119.2 percent, in February  to 112.6 percent, and in March to 105.7 percent.    On the whole, consumer prices grew by a factor of 1.4 during  the quarter (by a factor of 2.7 during the corresponding period  of 1993). In the first quarter of 1994, the rate of growth of  prices for nonfood goods and paid services for the population  outpaced the rate of growth of prices for foodstuffs by a factor  of two. Prices for certain groups of foodstuffs (meat products,  butter, eggs, and citrus fruit) fell. For the most part, goods  in the fruit and vegetable group became more expensive. Prices  increased the most for children's clothing, children's footwear,  books and newspapers, office supplies, and pharmaceuticals from  among the nonfood consumer staples. From among paid services to  the population, prices grew the most, by a factor of 2.8, for  the services of public-use transportation (in view of higher  airfares and railway fares), as well as for recreation, cultural  services, and services of barber shops.    Before the beginning of January, the Ukrainian unemployment  rate as a whole came to 0.29 percent of the population in the  able-bodied age bracket. The average size of benefits per each  unemployed individual came to 169,000 karbovantsy in March,  compared to 100,000 karbovantsy in December 1993.    The Ukrainian population number stood at 52.1 million on 1  April 1994. In the first quarter, the number of deaths exceeded  that of births by 75,000.  <H5>  Production of Consumer Goods </H5>   In the first quarter of this year, such goods worth 55  trillion karbovantsy were produced (this was 39 percent less  than in the first quarter of 1993). Almost three-fourths of the  enterprises reduced their output and, compared to the first  quarter of 1993, failed to turn out goods worth 38 trillion  karbovantsy. The output of the enterprises of the State  Committee for the Food Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture  and Foodstuffs accounted for more than 45 percent of this total,  and that of the enterprises of the State Committee for the Light  and Textile Industries, for almost 20 percent.</p>

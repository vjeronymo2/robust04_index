			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Blue chips lose attraction as Tel Aviv consolidates - The slowdown in Israeli equities After a dizzying boom during the past two years, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is settling into a period of cautious consolidation marked by increasing selectivity in the market. A domestic economic slowdown, continuing recession in Europe, combined with expectations of poorer corporate financial results and the continuing deadlock in Arab-Israeli peace talks have taken their toll of the market, which nearly doubled in 1992. Since January, the Mishtanim index, which covers the 100 most traded companies, has fallen 4 per cent; the broader, general share index has edged up by 1.5 per cent. The Mishtanim index yesterday added 1.2 per cent to 199.30. Investors have shied away from blue-chip stocks recently, reflecting nervousness about their half-yearly financial statements and a general feeling that the capital gains enjoyed by so many companies in 1992 will not be repeated this year. Electronic and hi-tech companies, like Scitex, were especially hit by poorer than anticipated exports to Europe. However, investors in the Karam - the computerised call market which excludes the Mishtanim constituents - have done much better this year with a rise of about 20 per cent since January. Shares in infrastructure companies have performed especially well as a result of the government's massive on-going public works programme. Bankers and market analysts believe that, over the long term, the market will continue to expand in an economy forecast to grow by 5 per cent annually over the next five years, with decreasing inflation and interest rates. Furthermore, any serious progress in the peace process, which holds out the prospect of Israel becoming the industrial and trading capital of the Middle East, would cause another massive boom. The potential long-term strength of the equity market is evident in the rise in financial assets held by the public from USDollars 88bn in 1988 to USDollars 130bn today; a quarter of this is invested in stocks, compared with less than 6 per cent in 1988. The economy is awash with liquidity; and the population has a high propensity to save. This has encouraged a corporate rush to raise capital on the stock market. Since January, more than 140 public and private offerings of shares and convertible securities have been floated on the TASE; and more than 100 companies have joined the exchange, increasing its listings to almost 500. More than Shk3bn (over Dollars 1bn) has been raised this year and turnover on the TASE averaged Shk194m in the first six months of the year. On top of this, the government felt that the market was strong enough to take the sale of shares in the country's two largest state-owned banks. Twenty per cent of Bank Hapoalim was sold in June and 20 per cent of Bank Leumi is up for sale next week, adding to what is expected to be a record wave of new issues. Analysts believe that there is more than enough liquidity to soak up the new issues with an estimated Shk7bn expected to leave the traded and non-traded bond markets during the rest of this year. The government, in an effort to reduce its domestic borrowing and cut its deficit, is issuing less bonds. Provident and pension funds, with a combined capital of more than Shk120bn, were only recently allowed by the government to invest up to half their capital in equities. The thumbnail scenario for the market - predictions of strong economic growth and lower inflation, combined with government promises of more privatisation to come of big profitable state-owned corporations like Israel Chemicals and Bezeq, the telecommunications giant - have created an optimistic atmosphere among most analysts. As a mark of its confidence, earlier this month the TASE opened an options market called the MOAF-25 which trades on an index of the 25 stocks with the highest capitalisation. The TASE hopes that this will lay the ground for much more extensive futures and options trading.</p>

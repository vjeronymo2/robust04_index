			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch from Neil Kelly, correspondent in Bangkok] </F>   [Text] Leaders of the Karenni [or Kayah] nationals in  Burma have appealed to British Prime Minister John Major to  intervene in their long struggle for independence. Meanwhile,  other ethnic groups have been holding peace talks with the  Burmese Government and the Karenni are in danger of becoming the  only group left fighting the Burmese Government.    Karenni is a branch of the Karen ethnic group -- the biggest  ethnic group in Burma. There are reports that Karens are on the  threshold of ending its 45-year hostility against the Burmese  Government.    In a letter to the Prime Minister's Office in London's  Downing Street, the Karenni provisional government based in  northern Thailand, has appealed to the British Government to  play a leading role in supervising their peace talks with  Rangoon. The letter of appeal also said that the Karenni State  would have been given protection by the British Government had  the Conservative government been in power when Burma gained  independence from Britain in 1948. The letter also cited  documents which stated that the Karenni State was a British  protectorate during the colonial era and was never a part of the  Indian Empire or Burma.    Britain's official view is that the official representatives  of the Karenni State, which now has a population of over  300,000, chose the path of independence and to jointly work with  Burma at the time of independence.    In an interview with the BBC, the Karenni foreign minister,  Abel Tweed, said he wanted Britain to mediate in the peace  talks. He said Britain has growing sympathy for the Karenni, and  that it could still do a lot for the Karenni's goal.    The Karenni has appealed in the past to Britain, India, and  Australia to recognize them as an independent state. Abel Tweed  also said that although the low-level preliminary peace talks  are being held with the Burmese Government at a secret venue  inside Karenni territory, full-scale peace talks could not be  held as long as the Burmese troops are not withdrawn from  Karenni territory and the forceful recruitment of porters and  interrogation and imprisonment of people continue.</p>

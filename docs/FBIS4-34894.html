			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report By Reali Junior] </F>   [Text] Paris, 24 Jun (AE) -- If it were up to Luiz Inacio  Lula da Silva, the Angra-2 nuclear plant would not be built.  The PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate made this  commitment during talks he held today in Bonn with  representatives of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. During a  recent visit to Bonn, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim  had assured German Government officials interested in the  progress of that plant that it would be built.    Yet Lula and Marco Aurelio Garcia, the external area  coordinator of the PT program, did not succeed in convincing  German businessmen. They were both evasive regarding foreign  trade financing and the PT approach to the foreign debt. The  representative of the Deutsch Sud Amerikan Bank walked out of  the room in protest over Lula's confusing positions about the  Brazilian reality.    In a meeting with German Vice Foreign Minister Helmut  Schafer, Lula stated that a PT government would honor all of the  agreements signed by Brazil regarding nuclear nonproliferation  and the missile control regime.</p>

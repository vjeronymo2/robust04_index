			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Bemrose rises to Pounds 2.7m and makes Pounds 2.3m buy Bemrose, the security and promotional printer, announ-ced a 6 per cent rise in interim profits as well as the acquisition for an initial Pounds 2.3m of a company which sources, imprints and supplies promotional products. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 2 rose from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 2.7m on turnover up 56 per cent at Pounds 48.1m (Pounds 30.8m). More than 50 per cent of sales are generated in the US where Bemrose is now the largest supplier to the US advertising speciality market following a series of acquisitions. 'We have made a positive start, with substantially increased sales from our enlarged group,' Mr Roger Booth, chairman, said. Order books were strong and second half trading would be substantially greater than that seen in the first half, he said. A seasonal bias to Bemrose's results, which saw 75 per cent of the company's earnings generated in the second half of last year, has been further exaggerated by acquisitions, including McCleery-Cumming, the second largest US publisher of advertising calendars. Acquisitions over the last two years have increased the proportion of sales represented by promotional products, such as calenders and diaries, from under 50 per cent to more than 70 per cent. Mr Booth said the acquisition of Incentives Two, a Manchester-based company, would strengthen the management of Bemrose' promotional products division. The company had substantial experience in sourcing low-cost products from the Far East. The purchase will be satisfied by Pounds 715,000 cash, Pounds 1.1m of cumulative redeemable unsecured loan stock and the allotment of 117,733 new shares. Incentives Two made pre-tax profits of Pounds 459,000 on Pounds 5.26m sales in the year to January 31. Bemrose saw improved performances in all its divisions. The growth in sales of security print products was the result of new initiatives, Mr Booth said, while margins were being preserved by investment in more efficient production equipment, including a Pounds 2m web press which would reduce the cost of high volume catalogues and directories. Promotional product sales in the UK were also ahead and contracts to print calendars had been won from National Westminster Bank and Midland Bank. US operations saw profit margins and cash generation higher than the group as a whole. He said the Renaissance Group had enjoyed 'an excellent year' following the acquisition of McCLeery-Cumming. By combining the two businesses, substantial savings had been made in the costs of paper, printing, packaging, materials and distribution. Gearing has gone up from 46 per cent at the last year-end to an expected average of 50 per cent for 1994. Earnings per share stood at 5.67p against 7.48p restated following a rights issue in December. An interim dividend of 4.7p (4.3p) has been declared.</p>

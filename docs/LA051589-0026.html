			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORWAY'S LAURITZEN WINS FIRST TOUR DE TRUMP TITLE  </P> <P> Dag Otto Lauritzen of Norway benefited from a crucial mistake by Eric  Vanderaerden of the Netherlands Sunday during the final stage time trail and  won the overall title of the inaugural Tour de Trump bicycle race.  </P> <P> Lauritzen, who held the lead for a week, finished fourth on the 24-mile  Atlantic City-Brigantine ocean-front course on the Boardwalk in 52 minutes 19  seconds.  </P> <P> Vanderaerden, considered one of the world's finest sprinters and time  trialists, went off course for an estimated 500 meters and finished 1:44 behind  Lauritzen.  </P> <P> Near the halfway point of the out-and-back course, Vanderaerden followed a lead  motorcycle straight instead of turning right. According to race officials,  motorcycles were not allowed on the course. In previous stages, however, riders  followed lead vehicles.  </P> <P> "I just followed the motorcycle," Vanderaerden said. "I don't know exactly what  happened. But the moment after it happened, I knew that I couldn't win the  race. But I think I would have won without going off course."  </P> <P> Ron Kiefel of Boulder, Colo., won the final stage in 51:27, with England's Sean  Yates second in 52:11. Amateur John Stenner of Greeley, Colo., was third in  52:14.  </P> <P> The race was not injury free as Greg McNeil of Ojai, Calif., hit a wall two  miles from the finish and sustained a concussion.  </P> <P> Lauritzen, who began the day with a 28-second lead over Dutchman Henk  Lubberding and 50 seconds over Vanderaerden, said he believed he would have  been victorious even if his Dutch rival hadn't ridden off course.  </P> <P> "I felt confident that I would have won," said Lauritzen, a former Norwegian  policeman and military officer who earned $50,000 for the victory. "I was told  I had gained 30 seconds after eight miles."  </P> <P> Lauritzen, who didn't win a stage, finished the 10-day race, which began May 5  at Albany, N.Y., with a cumulative time of 33 hours, 22 minutes, 28 seconds.  Lubberding finished second overall, 1:54 behind Lauritzen.  </P></p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: Austria goes cold on complete sale of bank Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the socialist Austrian finance minister, appears to be backing away from the government's intention to privatise fully Creditanstalt, the country's second-largest bank. Mr Lacina yesterday described as 'absurd and immoral' a proposal that would see half of the government's 70 per cent voting stake sold in a secondary offering. The proposal came last month from a consortium of Austrian, Italian and German interests led by the insurance group EA Generali and First Austrian Bank. The consortium has offered some Sch7.5bn (Dollars 676m) to buy half the government's shares, provided the state agrees to its proposal to underwrite a placement of the rest in the near future. 'It is as if a tenant of two rooms in a five-room flat wanted to forbid the landlord from continuing to live in the remaining three rooms,' Mr Lacina said. 'There is no five-room flat for rent,' he concluded. The minister also poured cold water on the bid for Creditanstalt from CS Holding of Switzerland. CS, the financial group built around Credit Suisse, has said it sees the purchase of a 20-25 per cent stake in Creditanstalt as merely a first step towards obtaining outright control and, ideally, 100 per cent of the bank. Mr Lacina said he had made clear to Mr Rainer Gut, CS chairman, that a majority takeover by foreign interests was out of the question 'at the present time'. CS declined to comment on Mr Lacina's remarks. Austrian bankers were startled by the imagery used by Mr Lacina yesterday, which suggested he was reinstating the government's phony privatisation policy of the late 1980s. During that period, minority shares in state assets were often placed or floated, but the government always retained control.</p>

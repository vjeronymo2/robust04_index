			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Business and the Law: Property services - Legal Briefs The Law Society of England and Wales is to undertake a review of conveyancing procedures to see if it can cut down on the incidence of mortgage fraud involving solicitors as part of a new three-year strategy plan covering the commercial and domestic property services. Part of the three-year plan will also be to campaign for a number of changes in the law including: the introduction of a system of common-hold to facilitate communal management of blocks of flats; reform of the law which makes businesses still liable for their successor's defaults even after they have assigned the lease; and the creation of an environmental tribunal to handle cases involving the higher environmental standards businesses are now expected to meet.</p>

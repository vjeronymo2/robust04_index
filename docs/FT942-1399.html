			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Telegraph faces news distribution trade row: Raymond Snoddy on the consequences of newspaper cost cutting The Daily Telegraph was last night heading for confrontation with the news distribution trade over attempts to link wholesalers' and newsagents' margins to performance, to help pay for its price cut to 30p. In an effort to get back some of the estimated Pounds 40m a year cost of the weekday price reduction from 48p, The Telegraph group has told the news trade that it will keep the 26.5 per cent distribution margin but that traders will be compensated for the price cut with a performance bonus. No further details were given but the implication is that the amount will be linked to sales. A wholesaler said last night: 'The trade will not fall for this.' He added that his company would pass on any difference to newsagents. The Telegraph conceded that Forbouys, the multiple newsagent chain, had already written expressing concern. It is believed that at least one multiple newsagent group has already decided not to accept a performance bonus element in its terms. The Times, which last night announced another round in the price war by reducing its weekday price from 30p to 20p and Saturday price from 40p to 30p, has been careful to keep the news trade 'on side'. The attempt to link distribution costs to performance is just one attempt by The Telegraph to reduce costs. Mr Max Hastings, Telegraph editor-in-chief, said yesterday: 'We will look seriously at all costs.' He said it would be irrational to do anything to damage the editorial product. He added: 'We are not going to cut a swathe through editorial.' Big savings would come from the paper's promotional budget, at present about Pounds 9m-Pounds 10m a year. All special offers, such as free CDs, would be dropped, although the 30p Telegraph would continue to be advertised. Mr Hastings said the decision to cut the cover price, a move designed to protect long-term market share, had cost him and several other senior Telegraph managers several hundred thousand pounds each. They have share options maturing in February which are likely to be worth very much less than they otherwise would be. Mr Hastings said: 'At least we can't be accused of acting out of self-interest.' News of the imminent decision to cut the paper's price forced him to speed up editorial changes at the top of the Telegraph hierarchy. Mr Simon Heffer has been appointed a deputy editor. Editorial executives Mr Christopher Hudson and Mr Trevor Grove are leaving. Mr Hastings said the changes would add bite to the opinion pages of the paper. He added: 'When I told Conrad (Mr Conrad Black, the chairman) he said, 'Max I thought you had lost the capacity to surprise me. You haven't'.'</p>

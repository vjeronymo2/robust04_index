			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Definition of Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Changes are proposed at 24 CFR 570.3. This proposed rule would for the first time define what constitutes income for purposes of determining whether persons or households qualify as low or moderate income under the CDBG program. To preserve the flexibility of the program while ensuring greater uniformity in the critical program issue of determining the extent to which low- and moderate-income persons benefit from CDBG-funded activities, the Department is proposing that the grantee be required to select either of the Section 8, Census Long Form, or IRS Adjusted Gross definitions of what is income for each type of activity benefiting low- and moderate-income persons. (The rule makes slight modifications to the Section 8 definition to bring it into accord with the CDBG program purposes.) The option to choose a definition does not apply to activities that qualify for the low- and moderate-income area benefit criteria in &sect;570.208(a)(1) except when the recipient carries out a survey. Activities qualifying under &sect;570.208(a)(1) generally must use the area income data, which is taken from the decennial census and supplied to recipients by HUD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD believes a definition of income is desirable to ensure that when CDBG funds are used to address the national objective of benefiting persons of low and moderate income, those deemed to benefit are actually low- and moderate-income persons. The Department repeatedly has received questions about the definition of income, and is aware of the potential for abuse in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1984, HUD proposed definitions of low- and moderate-income household, low- and moderate-income person, low-income household, low-income person, moderate-income household, and moderate-income person that included a reference to the definition of income under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program at 24 CFR Part 813. As the September 6, 1988, preamble to the Final Rule stemming from that proposal noted: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> The majority of commenters objected to the reference *&blank;*&blank;* because they concluded that grantees would be required to calculate income eligibility for the CDBG program in exactly the same manner as for the Section 8 program. Several commenters pointed out that the use of the Section 8 methodology would make many low- and moderate-income homeowners ineligible for rehabilitation activities and for jobs created by economic development projects. This was the case, commenters said, because under Section 8 procedures real property assets are considered in determining income levels. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> At the time the referenced definitions were proposed, HUD only intended to reflect the requirements at section 102(a)(20) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (the Act) that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> income limits <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  established for CDBG purposes must be equivalent to those used in the Section 8 program. Therefore, the proposed reference to the definition of annual income at part 813 was removed in the Final Rule, and the following was added: ``The method for determining income under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program need not be used for this purpose.'' This rule proposes to remove the quoted sentence wherever it appears. The definitions proposed in this rule would be used in calculating incomes of individual families and households to be applied against the established income limits in determining whether such families and households are low or moderate income under the CDBG program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Inspector General has repeatedly expressed its preference that the CDBG program have an easily verifiable definition of income to standardize income qualification across the country and to help limit the risk of abuse in this area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing a proposed definition, the Department decided to review a number of Federal definitions already in use by grantees and beneficiaries before beginning completely anew. Use of an established definition should pose fewer training problems and lower changeover costs for grantees, as well as offering the potential of ``doubling up'' on verifications. Before proposing the definition in this rule, the Department reviewed the definitions used under Section 8, Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Food Stamps, National Student Lunch, and Food Distribution Programs, and the Census and IRS definitions of income. In selecting the approach proposed in this rule, HUD used the following criteria in judging the various definitions reviewed: comprehensiveness (covered most sources/fewest exclusions); verifiability; familiarity of the definition to HUD staff, grantees and beneficiaries; fit with the objectives and practices of the CDBG program; and ease of administration. The three definitions that HUD believes most closely meet the above criteria are the Section 8 definition, the Census definition, and the IRS Adjusted Gross Income definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One option considered was a modified Section 8 definition of annual income. The Section 8 definition is second to the IRS definition in comprehensiveness of income sources considered and its exclusions are close to the other aid program definitions. (Census has no exclusions, and IRS has a very limited number.) Agencies verifying income under the Section 8 definition could validate beneficiaries' income by direct contact with employers or assistance agencies. This definition is familiar to many HUD staff and the housing staff of many CDBG grantees. While it may be familiar to persons administering housing-related assistance under the CDBG program, it is less likely to be familiar to grantee and subrecipient staff administering economic development and public service activities. Because the CDBG program considers income of the family or household  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> at the time assistance is provided, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ease of administration primarily means ease in explaining the definition to the beneficiary and calculating income. (Considering income at the time assistance is provided means that the annual income of the family or household, as applicable, should be projected based on the prevailing rate of income of each person at the time assistance is provided.) The Section 8 definition, with a fairly large number of exclusions from income, can take some time to explain and calculate. In particular, estimating the value of Net Family Assets and calculating the income attributable to the assets in excess of $5000 can sometimes be difficult. For example, if a grantee wants to provide an economic development loan to a business for working capital, and intends to meet the national objective of low- and moderate-income job creation and retention, each of the benefiting employees would have to undergo an assets review if the use of the section 8 definition were to be mandatory. Note that the need to apply the Net Family Asset calculation is probably perfunctory in the Section 8 (rental assistance) program since persons receiving a rental subsidy are not likely to own a house and few would have many other includable assets. On the other hand, it is arguable that, from the standpoint of the objectives of the CDBG program, inclusion of some part of the value of major non-income producing assets would be desirable to help focus assistance on the more needy, particularly with respect to the elderly who may not have much annual income but have high value assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Census definition reviewed was that used for the decennial census so called ``long form.'' It has both the fewest inclusions and the fewest exclusions of the definitions reviewed. All of the inclusions except ``net income from operation of a business'' could be easily verified by contacting employers and assistance agencies. There are no exclusions. Grantee and HUD staff and beneficiaries are not likely to be familiar with the definition, unless they have recently completed a census long-form questionnaire. It is noteworthy that income based on the Census definition is used by HUD for CDBG formula allocation and low- and moderate-income summary data by Census tract and block group. The definition would probably be easy to explain to beneficiaries and to calculate, and would likely be the simplest definition to use for an income survey for determining the percent of low- and moderate-income persons in an area. The definition does not attribute income to ownership of non-income-producing assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

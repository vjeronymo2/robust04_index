These guidelines, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), have been adopted by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation as the accessibility standards for newly constructed and altered places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and transportation facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  28 CFR part 36, Appendix A; 49 CFR part 37, Appendix A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Access Board is an independent Federal agency established by section 502 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, whose primary mission is to promote accessibility for individuals with disabilities. The Access Board consists of 25 members. Thirteen are appointed by the President from among the public, a majority of who are required to be individuals with disabilities. The other twelve are heads of the following Federal agencies or their designees whose positions are Executive Level IV or above: The Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, Interior, Defense, Justice, Veterans Affairs, and Commerce; General Services Administration; and United States Postal Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Access Board has initiated rulemaking to add new sections to ADAAG for certain State and local government facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 57 FR 60612 (December 21, 1992). Under Department of Justice regulations, State and local governments presently have the option of using ADAAG or an earlier accessibility standard, the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), when constructing or altering buildings and facilities. 28 CFR 35.151(c). The Department of Justice is expected to amend the regulations in the near future to eliminate this option. The Access Board is also working with other Federal agencies to use ADAAG as the basis for the accessibility standard for federally financed facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act. Eventually, it is anticipated that there will be a single accessibility standard for all public and private buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When it initially published ADAAG, the Access Board announced that it would periodically review and update the guidelines to ensure that they remain consistent with technological developments and changes in national standards and model codes, and meet the needs of individuals with disabilities. 56 FR 35410 (July 26, 1991). The Access Board also stated that it would work cooperatively with national standards and model code organizations to achieve a single standard over time that meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and that can be adopted as an accessibility code by State and local governments throughout the country. Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Access Board will begin the process of reviewing and updating ADAAG this fiscal year by establishing an ADAAG Review Advisory Committee (Committee). The establishment of the Committee would be in the public interest and would support the agency in performing its duties and responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Committee will review ADAAG in its entirety and make recommendations to the Access Board on: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Improving the format and usability of ADAAG; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reconciling editorial and substantive differences between ADAAG and national standards and model codes, including the CABO/ANSI A117.1&hyph;1992 American National Standard for Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Updating ADAAG to reflect technological developments and to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coordinating future revisions to ADAAG with national standards and model codes organizations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The Committee will be expected to present a report with its recommendations to the Access Board within one year of the Committee's first meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Access Board requests applications from organizations representing the following interests for membership on the Committee: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Architects and design professionals; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Building owners and operators; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Individuals with disabilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Model code groups; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;State and local building and accessibility code officials; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other persons affected by accessibility standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The number of Committee members will be limited to effectively accomplish the Committee's work and will be balanced in terms of interests represented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications should be sent to the Access Board at the address listed at the beginning of this notice. The application should include a statement of the organization's interests and the name, title, address and telephone number of the person who would represent the organization on the Committee. The application should also describe of the person's qualifications, including any experience the person has had with developing or applying national standards, model codes, or State and local codes. Committee members will not be compensated for their service. The Access Board may pay travel expenses for a limited number of persons who would otherwise be unable to participate on the Committee. Committee members will serve as representatives of their organizations, not as individuals. They will not be considered special government employees and will not be required to file confidential financial disclosure reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the applications have been reviewed, the Access Board will publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing the appointment of Committee members and the first meeting of the Committee. The Committee will operate in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 U.S.C. app 2. The Office of Management and Budget has approved the Committee in accordance with Executive Order 12838. Committee meetings will be held in Washington, DC. Each meeting will be open to the public. A notice of each meeting will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least fifteen days in advance of the meeting. Records will be kept of each meeting and made available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Committee will be limited in size, there will be an opportunity for the public to present written information to the Committee and to comment at Committee meetings. Persons and organizations who are interested in particular sections of ADAAG, are encouraged to inform the Access Board of their interests. The Access Board will notify persons and organizations who indicate interest in particular sections of ADAAG when Committee meetings are scheduled to discuss those sections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorized by vote of the Access Board on November 10, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Judith E.

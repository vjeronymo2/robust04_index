			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORESTRY DEPT. TOLD TO HIRE LAWYER IN SUIT OVER REDWOODS  </P> <P> A judge has ordered the state Department of Forestry to hire outside lawyers to  defend it against an environmental group's lawsuit.  </P> <P> Humboldt County Superior Court Judge John E. Buffington made his ruling after  deciding that Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's office "cannot . . . carry out its  duty to assure that the environment of this state is protected."  </P> <P> The ruling grew out of a lawsuit in which environmentalists are challenging the  harvest of some of the world's last privately owned virgin redwood forests,  despite warnings by the state Department of Fish and Game that logging would  threaten endangered species and degrade the environment.  </P> <P> "The public could easily conclude that the attorney general is overlooking some  legitimate environmental issues while adopting a position which favors a large  corporation's business concern," Buffington wrote.  </P></p>

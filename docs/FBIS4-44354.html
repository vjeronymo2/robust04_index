			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 28 (A.A) -- The prime minister's  adviser Volkan Vural on Tuesday [28 June] said that a long-term  agreement with Russia aims at increasing Turkey's oil imports  from that country to 3 million tonnes in return for export  products and services to Russia from Turkey.    He said that presently Turkey buys one or two million tonnes  of Russian oil as spot purchases and this could be expanded to  three million tonnes, therefore entering a long-term agreement.    Vural said the oil deal would be discussed when Russian  First  Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets visits Turkey next month to  consider how to increase trade and economic links.    `We would like to expand our exports of consumer goods to  Russia, and we have a key interest in our investments in  contracting and services there,' Vural said.    Turkey, which imports the bulk of its oil from Saudi Arabia  and Iran, did not buy any Russian crude in the first quarter of  this year, but took 129,000 tonnes in the same 1993 period.</p>

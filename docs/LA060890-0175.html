			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCDONALD'S TO BARE CHOLESTEROL, SODIUM CONTENT OF BIG MAC  </P> <P> McDonald's Corp. said today it will post complete nutritional information --  including fat and sodium levels -- on all of its products at its restaurants by  the end of July.  </P> <P> "The more (customers) know about McDonald's food, . . . the easier it will be  for them to see how McDonald's fits into their balanced diet," said Terri  Capatosto, spokeswoman for the fast-food giant.  </P> <P> McDonald's drew fire from anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof this spring  when the Omaha industrialist took out full-page ads in newspapers across the  country pleading with McDonald's to cut the fat in its hamburgers.  </P> <P> Sokolof's ad, under the headline "The Poisoning of America," was attacked by  McDonald's as misleading and malicious.  </P> <P> Capatosto said today's announcement had nothing to do with Sokolof's campaign.  </P></p>

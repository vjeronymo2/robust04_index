			<p>BFN     [Text] Major-General Aleksander Einseln, commander of the  Estonian defense forces, who is on a visit to Moscow, made a  proposal today to the Russian Ministry of Defense on creating a  joint working group of the military of the two countries which  would begin to monitor the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Estonia.    Einseln met today Colonel-General Mikhail Kolesnikov,  Russian  chief of general staff. At the meeting ideas were exchanged on  the activity of the working group on military issues at the  talks between Estonia and Russia and on the opportunities for  military collaboration of the two countries. Kolesnikov again  emphasized that solving the issue of troop withdrawal together  with giving social guarantees to the retired military living in  Estonia is important to Russia.    As it became known to the Baltic News Service from official  sources of the Russian Defense Ministry, it was confirmed while  Kolesnikov and Einseln were meeting that the instruction by  Boris Yeltsin concerning the creation of Russian military bases  in the CIS and Latvia was drawn up by the general staff. The  instruction, issued on 5 April, caused tension between Russia  and the Baltic states, especially in relations between Latvia  and Russia. Kolesnikov said that the text of Yeltsin's  instruction published in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI did not correspond to  the truth. Today Kolesnikov (?brought for making public) the  instruction's actual contents [passage indistinct].</p>

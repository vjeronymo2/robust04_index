			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian physicist Anatoliy Dyakov, head of </F> the Moscow Center for Arms Controls, Energy, and Environment, by  Andrzej Rybak; place and date not given: "Nonsense!"]    [Text] [Rybak] Six grams of plutonium 239, used in nuclear  weapons, has been seized in Germany. Might it have come from a  Russian military arsenal?    [Dyakov] That cannot be ruled out. But controls over  radioactive components in Russian military nuclear facilities  are still quite stringent. The quantities of plutonium that  have appeared on the black market and can be used in weapons are  very small. No one can make a bomb out of that.    [Rybak] Can plutonium for use in weapons be obtained during  the process of dismantling warheads?    [Dyakov] Russia destroyed some 2,000 warheads last year.  This took place under strict supervision.    [Rybak] In that case, where are the loopholes? The theft  and smuggling of radioactive substances is reaching frightening  proportions!    [Dyakov] The situation is fully under control in all the  facilities under the authority of the Nuclear Ministry. But  because the wages of most employees are not enough to subsist  on, many of them try to earn extra money. Unfortunately, one  way of doing that is by stealing and selling radioactive  substances.    [Rybak] Can one not control the handling of these substances  more stringently?    [Dyakov] That is very difficult. Noone knows exactly how  much plutonium and uranium are produced in civilian reactors.  That does not apply only to Russia. In the entire world there  are no exact figures, just estimates.    [Rybak] Weapons-grade plutonium is still being produced in  Russia. When will the military reactors be shut down?    [Dyakov] Weapons-grade plutonium is produced in three  reactors in Russia. The press claims that they will be closed  down this year. That is nonsense. These reactors also produce  electricity and provide heating for the neighboring cities of  Krasnoyarsk and Tomsk. Only when there is an alternative can  they be shut down. That is out of the question before the year  2000. But we are prepared to place under intentional control  every gram of plutonium we produce. The relevant document has  already been drafted.    [Rybak] Could the West offer more effective help?    [Dyakov] The Americans have already promised us lots of  money just to dismantle the warheads. Now they want to provide  us with gas-fueled power stations in exchange for the shutdown  of the nuclear ones. I am skeptical about that, because so far  we have only received a smidgen of this loudly proclaimed  assistance.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hungary is seen as top choice for expansion HUNGARY is the most popular east European location for the expansion of medium-sized companies, a study by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the accountancy and consultancy firm, has shown. One-third of a sample of nearly 400 companies from 20 developed companies said Hungary was their first choice in the region. The next most popular countries were Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia. The vast majority - 71 per cent - said the main reason for interest in the east was market opportunity. But the survey showed many businesses were hindered in their attempts to invest in the east. One-third said investment was too risky, while a significant minority were troubled by the unsuitability of the political and social environment. Deloitte Touche said the study showed prospects for increased trade were encouraging, given the need for good information and funding mechanisms. Why Companies Go International.

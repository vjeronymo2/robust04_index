			<p>BFN     [Text] The Church of England has lifted its decades old ban  on investing its cash in South Africa following the elections.  However, church commissioners said in London that the decision  was unlikely to mean an immediate movement of substantial sums  into South African companies. They said that proper research  and monitoring would continue to ensure that potential  investment conformed with ethical guidelines.    Observers at the conference said South Africa would gain  from  acting as a conduit to the rest of Africa with better transport  links, while its skilled technicians and engineers would be  cheaper than their counterparts from Europe and the United  States.</p>

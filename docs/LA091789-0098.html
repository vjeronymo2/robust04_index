			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A Jesuit order has sold a 1,100-acre plot of land in the Santa Cruz Mountains  to a Hong Kong billionaire who plans to build a golf course on part of the  land. The Hong Kong Metro Realty Co., headed by Dr. Stanley Ho of Hong Kong and  the Lee family of Madison, Wis., agreed to pay more than $10 million for the  property, which lies in an unincorporated area of Santa Clara County near Los  Gatos. The rolling meadowland and redwood forest was the former home of Alta  College, a Jesuit school, and has been owned by the Catholic order for several  decades. The developers plan to build on 400 to 500 acres, leaving the rest  open space.  </P></p>

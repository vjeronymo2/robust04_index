			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: BankAmerica pays Dollars 50m to cover losses at fund BankAmerica has paid Dollars 50.5m to cover losses at one of its money market mutual funds, taking to Dollars 67.9m the cost of compensating investors for losses on volatile derivative-type securities. On Friday, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a letter in which it indicated that several other money managers have shouldered losses on securities which the regulators viewed as unsuitable for money market funds. Money market funds seek to beat normal bank deposit rates by investing in short-term debt instruments. There is an implicit understanding that investors' principal will not be put at risk - a factor which has encouraged some banks and others to bail out their funds in recent weeks. BankAmerica said its funds had held structured notes issued by US government agencies. The return on such instruments is tied to an external factor - for instance, the return on a stockmarket index, or the difference between short and long-term interest rates. Depending on their structure, such instruments can result in a leveraged exposure to movements in financial markets. BankAmerica did not provide details of the particular securities which led to losses in the two funds, the Pacific Horizon Prime Fund and Government Fund. However, it said that these instruments, while permitted under the rules of the funds, had been unsuitable for the funds. The bank said all of the funds' structured notes had now been sold. The sale was prompted by quickly rising US interest rates, 'a significant level of redemptions' by investors and indications from regulators that structured notes may be inappropriate for money market funds, it added. In a letter at the end of last week to the Investment Company Institute, the mutual funds trade association, Mr Barry Barbash, director of the SEC's investment management division, outlined types of structured securities that could be unsuitable for all such funds. These include inverse floaters (interest on which falls as market rates rise), leveraged floaters (which give a geared exposure to rate changes), range floaters (which cease to pay interest when a certain level is reached), and dual-index floaters (the return on which is tied to the relationship between two indices). Recent interest rate rises have 'caused the value of many of these securities to fall below par,' Mr Barbash said. The SEC urged all managers of money market funds to develop a plan to 'dispose of the securities in an orderly manner, consistent with the interests of the fund's shareholders'.</p>

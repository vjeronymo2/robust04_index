			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / UK Company News: GIM launches smaller companies investment trust GLASGOW INVESTMENT Managers is launching a new investment trust which will invest in smaller companies and aim for a high yield. Despite the problems which have hit the new issues market, including three investment trusts, in the last month, GIM said it had picked its time well. Mr David Williams, managing director, said: 'I don't think our timing could be better. We are confident we're at the bottom of the cycle and the current weakness of the market offers very real opportunities for growth over the longer term.' The trust, to be called Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies, will buy shares in companies with a market capitalisation between Pounds 25m and Pounds 250m with a minimum dividend yield of 120 per cent of the FT-A All Share index. The projected initial gross yield will be 7 per cent, and the managers expect dividends to grow faster than inflation. GIM argues that smaller companies outperform UK equities during periods of economic expansion. The launch of the trust will be aided by Shires, GIM's flagship investment trust, which will transfer smaller companies shares to the value of Pounds 5m from its own portfolio in return for a Pounds 5m shareholding in the new trust. Williams de Broe, sponsor to the issue, has obtained underwriting for Pounds 12.5m, and is aiming for a maximum of Pounds 30m. The trust, primarily aimed at the retail market, will try to attract private investors via personal equity plans. Warrants will be attached to the ordinary shares on a 1-for-5 basis, but the company has avoided the more complicated capital structures popular with new investment trust issues earlier this year, saying that these could create conflicts of interest between different classes of shareholder. The formal launch will be on Friday and the trust will remain open to subscriptions until August 20.</p>

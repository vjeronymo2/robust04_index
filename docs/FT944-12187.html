			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): NAPM report sends Dow sharply lower Wall Street US share prices ended sharply lower across the board yesterday in the wake of a weaker bond market, which was disturbed by a stronger than expected manufacturing sector report, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dropped 44.75 to 3,863.37. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 3.93 to 468.42, while the American Stock Exchange composite retreated 3.05 to 455.52 and the Nasdaq composite shed 5.30 to 772.19. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 315m shares. Following Monday's losses, the stock market opened in a bearish mood. Early falls in the bond market only deepened the gloom. The losses, which sent the yield on the 30-year bond back above 8 per cent, were prompted by a rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index of business activity from 58.2 per cent in September, to 59.7 per cent in October. Wall Street had expected a 59.0 per cent reading and analysts said the data only increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at some time within the next month. The consensus is that monetary policy will be tightened following the November 15 meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Share prices fell because stock market investors are fearful that another interest rate increase will slow the economy down too far, and break the pattern of steady growth of corporate earnings. Also, higher interest rates could eventually persuade investors to move out of stocks and into fixed-income assets. Later in the day, equities fell further amid computerised program selling, which at one point pushed the Dow's decline beyond 50 points. Among individual stocks, cyclicals were notably weaker, unsettled by concerns about the long-term economic outlook. Caterpillar fell Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 , International Paper Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 73 3/8 and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 3/8 . The oils sector, which had a good run last week, encountered selling after broking house Prudential Securities downgraded several leading stocks. Mobil retreated Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 83, Exxon Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 61 3/4 , Royal Dutch Petroleum Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 114 1/4 and Chevron Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 . In the Nasdaq market, Biogen plunged Dollars 9, or 18 per cent, to Dollars 40 in volume of 9.5m shares as investors reacted to Monday's late news that the company is taking a Dollars 25m pre-tax charge to cover the cost of halting the development of its anticoagulent Hirulog, which was one of its most promising drugs.</p>

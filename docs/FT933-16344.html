			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Rights for apes THERE IS A book that I think you ought to read, called The Great Ape Project: Equality beyond Humanity. It is an important book for there is a chance that if enough of us read it, and do something about it, good will come of it - perhaps so much good that we will be able to ameliorate the predicament of our own species by helping others. Our closest relatives are chimpanzees. To put it another way, says Jared Diamond, professor of physiology at the University of California, chimpanzees' closest relatives are not gorillas but humans. The genetic difference - 1.6 per cent - separating us from pygmy or common chimps is barely double that separating pygmy from common chimp and less, for example, than between such hard-to-distinguish European bird species as willow warblers and chiffchaffs (2.6 per cent). Despite our genetic closeness to the other great apes, we treat them badly. Hence this book, in which 34 writers - scientists, philosophers, a lawyer, a psychologist - anticipate a new stage in human development: a reassessment of the moral status of chimps, gorillas and orang-utans and the acceptance of some non-human animals as persons. The authors want a declaration on great apes that welcomes them into a 'community of equals' and gives them various rights, enforceable at law, including the right to life, protection of liberty and the prohibition of torture. At present, says the declaration, only some humans are regarded as members of this community. But there is now no remaining moral or ethical argument against extending it. 'History shows us,' the declaration maintains, 'that there has always been, within our own species, that saving factor: a squad of determined people willing to overcome the selfishness of their own group in order to advance another's cause.' I was so uplifted by The Great Ape Project that I scuttled round to London Zoo to talk to one of the chimps, funnily enough named Michael. With a bit of luck, I said, you will be out of here quite soon. There is a groundswell of opinion among intelligent humans that holds that our treatment of the great apes is similar to the way in which normally compassionate people once condoned human slavery. Jane Goodall, an expert on chimps, says that evidence for sophisticated mental performances by apes has become ever more convincing, I continued. They can solve simple problems with reasoning and insight. Can plan for the immediate future. Experiments have demonstrated their powers of generalisation, abstraction and concept-forming. They can use abstract symbols to communicate. And they have some kind of self-concept. The thing is, Michael, that the line dividing man from beast, 'us' from 'them,' has become blurred and disreputable. We are all in this together. I know we are shuttling to oblivion on a pint-sized planet. But there is still time for humans to make amends - to acknowledge your rights and protect you from harm. Michael snorted. He said: What makes you think we want to have anything more to do with you than the absolute minimum? Your species is a disgrace. You are wrecking yourselves and the planet. I said: I suppose you mean our wars and nuclear adventurism and population growth? Or even the little things, our pornography and hard drugs? Our amazingly short-fused tempers? That is only the start of it, said Michael. Apart from your ugliness and cruelty there is all the rest: John Major, John Smith, your silly political squabbling, prices at Sainsbury's, music critics, News At Ten, your obsession with stupid ball games, blithering Virginia Wade, Thames Water - the depthless banality of so many of your enterprises. I said: Give us a break, Michael. We are still a young species. The last common female ancestor of all living humans probably lived 150,000 years ago. We are only 5,000 human generations old. This may explain our defensiveness: our insistence on 'them' and 'us.' And we are not all bad. I don't want to hear about the Sistine Chapel, growled Michael. I don't mean that, I said. I mean that in most places we have at least stamped out slavery, the exhibiting of deformed humans in circuses and public hangings. We are trying to improve ourselves. Michael turned away in disgust. He said: Tell that to the giraffes. They are suckers for happy endings. The Great Ape Project, edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, Fourth Estate, Pounds 9.99.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> ISRAEL SEES UPTURN IN ITS DIPLOMATIC FORTUNES;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: A GUERRILLA RAID AND BOMBING IN A CROWDED MARKET COMBINE TO DEFLECT  CRITICISM. U.S. MOVES ARE HAILED IN JERUSALEM.  </P> <P> In a dramatic space of two weeks, a crisis that began with wide condemnation of  Israel's treatment of Palestinians ended with potentially key Israeli  diplomatic victories and a setback for Palestinians who have been trying to  persuade the United States to pressure Israel into peace talks.  </P> <P> Israeli and Palestinian leaders had tried to manage to their own advantage an  uproar ignited May 20 when a lone Israeli gunman shot and killed seven  defenseless Palestinian workers in the town of Rishon le Zion. Israel is  pleased with its management efforts, Palestinians are not.  </P> <P> On Friday, Israeli officials expressed satisfaction with two moves by  Washington. First, the Bush Administration is threatening to break off talks  with the Palestine Liberation Organization unless the PLO expels a member  responsible for this week's abortive raid on Israel from the sea. Second, the  United States used its veto Thursday to block a move by some members of the  U.N. Security Council to send a special commission of inquiry to the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> "We can all be pleased" that the United States vetoed the resolution, said  Foreign Minister Moshe Arens. "It's an indication of the fact that we do have  very close relations despite the differences of opinion that surface now and  then and, lately, quite frequently."  </P> <P> Israeli officials said they want to maintain the momentum by getting the United  States to end once and for all efforts to involve the PLO in peace talks, even  indirectly, by the involvement of Palestinians in exile.  </P> <P> "Peace talks can only work if the PLO is dealt out of them," said Yosef Ben  Aharon, a top adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.  </P> <P> The Shamir government will continue to promote a plan to hold elections among  the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in order to select  a peace delegation, Ben Aharon said. But, he added, the Israeli government  wants progress on other points of the plan, including integration of  Palestinian refugees abroad into Arab society and the recognition of Israel by  hostile Arab states.  </P> <P> "We want elections, but we don't want the preparations dominated by the PLO,  which was the road that Washington was moving down," said Ben Aharon.  </P> <P> In the year since Shamir proposed his election plan, no progress has been made  toward holding them. Preliminary talks quickly stalled on Israel's reluctance  to work out details with a Palestinian panel that would include PLO followers  from abroad and residents of Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Israel opposes giving the PLO a role on the grounds that the group is wedded to  terrorism and because the group demands the establishment of an independent  state alongside Israel.  </P> <P> After the Rishon le Zion incident and a subsequent army crackdown in the West  Bank and Gaza that left at least 15 more Palestinians dead, the Shamir  government sought to contain damage to its relations with Washington. For a  while, the tide seemed to flow against the Shamir government. President Bush  expressed condolences not only for the families of the seven workers but also  for other victims of army gunfire. Secretary of State James A. Baker III  expressed interest in sending a special U.N. investigative team, but he soon  backed off in the face of Israeli protests.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, two terrorist attacks took place that eclipsed the impact of  Rishon le Zion and its aftermath. First, someone placed a pipe bomb in a  crowded Israeli market, killing an Israeli passer-by. Then, the Palestine  Liberation Front, a faction of the PLO, tried to attack the Israeli shoreline  by speedboats brought to the coast by a mother ship that embarked from Libya.  </P> <P> The raid failed; four Palestinian guerrillas were shot to death and 12 others  were captured. Israel lost no one.  </P> <P> On Friday, local Palestinian leaders, stung by the U.S. veto at the United  Nations, announced they were suspending contact with American officials here.  They sent a plea to Arab governments to put economic pressure on Washington in  support of their cause.  </P> <P> "What the United States did yesterday in the Security Council was to stab all  those people who believe in peace," said Radwan abu Ayash, a leading contact  for the PLO in Jerusalem.  </P> <P> And in Baghdad, Iraq, where PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat met Friday with  ambassadors of the Soviet Union, China, Italy, France and Ireland and urged  their governments to reopen U.N. discussion of the violence in the occupied  territories, he also denounced the veto: "I only ask why the United States  keeps protecting and covering the crimes Israel is committing against the  Palestinian people. Why does the United States champion human rights everywhere  but stop doing that when Palestinian human rights are concerned?"  </P> <P> Abu Ayash and several other public leaders of the Arab uprising against Israel  concluded a 13-day hunger strike in protest of the Rishon le Zion killings. The  Palestinians were urging the United Nations to send in an observer team to  protect Arabs in the occupied territories.  </P> <P> The hunger strikers felt themselves under pressure because their stand in favor  of diplomacy and of limiting violence in the uprising appeared to be leading  nowhere. Since the uprising began in December, 1987, more than 650 Palestinians  have died by Israeli gunfire. Palestinians have killed about 220 other Arabs on  suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-four Israelis have died at the  hands of Palestinians.  </P> <P> Young grass-roots activists have been preaching greater militancy, including  the use of firearms. Washington's most recent moves appeared to leave the  public leaders high and dry, and they reacted with uncustomary anti-American  rhetoric.  </P> <P> The hunger strikers rejected suggestions that the abortive seaborne raid  against Israel on Wednesday by a faction of the Palestine Liberation Front had  sunk their effort in the United Nations.  </P> <P> "The United States has a history of supporting Israel no matter what," said  Hannan Ashawri, a faculty member at Birzeit University, which, like all  colleges in the occupied areas, has been closed during the 29-month uprising.  </P> <P> The cut-off of relations with the United States and the appeal to the Arab  world represents a sea change in the focus of local diplomatic efforts. By  limiting Palestinian protest mainly to throwing stones, the leadership had  hoped to directly appeal to both American and Israeli public opinion for  diplomatic progress.  </P> <P> While the Palestinians view their own prospects to influence the United States  as dim, it is not clear what response they will get from Arab leaders. At the  recent Arab summit, backing for the Palestinians was limited mostly to  anti-Israeli rhetoric. Most Arab countries reject the side-by side, two-state  solution proposed by the local Palestinian leaders and endorsed by the PLO.  </P></p>

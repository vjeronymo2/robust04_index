			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["CHINA DAILY Commentary": "A Long-Term Battle"] </F>   [Text] The Shen Taifu and Li Xiaoshi bribery and  embezzlement cases are just the latest major corruption scandals  to have been made public since the govenment declared its  renewed commitment of fighting graft last year.    The cases show that, though initial successes have been  achieved, the crackdown on corruption is an urgent as well as a  long-term battle, as was said by Party General Secretary Jiang  Zemin not long ago.    Any relaxation in the fight against graft will nullify all  the achievements that have so far been made.    More than 60,000 people were reportedly indicted on charges  of corruption last year. Fifty-four percent of the cases  involved bribery and 24 percent involved embezzlement.    And unless corruption is effectively checked, it is liable  to  spread like a virus through the body politic.    The virus is particularly rampant at the moment as the  country moves from a planned economy to a socialist market  economy, which is at its primary stage. The transition means  that there are many administrative loopholes which may be  exploited.    Corruption, with its promise of easy, big profits, can only  result in the downfall of weak-willed ranking officials and  public servants and tarnish the image of the government.    The fate of Shen Taifu, president of the Beijing Great Wall  Machinery and Electronics Group, and Li Xiaoshi, former vice-  minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, is a  case in point.    And now both of them have been dealt with by the law.    All government functionaries should learn a salutary lesson  and refrain from trying their luck in defiance of Party  discipline and State law.    History shows that serious corruption can jeopardize the  State and even lead it to destruction.    But the sad fact that there has been an increse in disclosed  corruption cases as the country turns to a socialist market  economy cannot be blamed on the policy of reform itself.    On the contrary, the reforms aim to eliminate corruption for  good in the long run.    And in the meantime, the continued fight against corruption  will ensure the implementation of the reforms and guarantee the  country's opening to the outside world. The battle is also of  crucial importance to the setup of socialist market economy.    And, as the war against corruption continues, there is an  urgent need for strengthened legislation to close the loopholes  for potential offenders.    Though the majority of government officials and public  servants are honest, the few, like Li Xiaoshi, have taken  advantage of the power vested in them.    And the stable environemnt which is necessary to reform and  development can be undermined by corruption.    The crackdown on graft is a war we cannot afford to lose.    Public support and governmental determination are essential,  if this arduous and prolonged war is to be won.    The Party and government have shown great determination by  taking concrete measures and they have enjoyed public support  because people at large intensely resent corrupt officials and  civil servants who prey on our society.    Long-term plans should be worked out to ensure the  operation's continued success. The crackdown is already a major  item on this year's Party and State agendas.    And the major cases of corruption that have so far been  exposed should be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law.    Only thus can we ensure a clean government, which will lead  this country to prosperity.</p>

Hata, 58, concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign  minister, has been the main contender since Hosokawa announced  his bombshell resignation on April 8 amid a Diet (Parliament)  stalemate sparked by his personal financial affairs.    The choice of Hata today dashed the hope of former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe, who simultaneously abandoned his plan  to leave the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  to run in an upcoming Diet election for the premiership.    Watanabe, an LDP veteran, had tried to align with Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government Party), the  key political forces within the current seven-party coalition,  with the aim of leading, or at least influencing, the next  government.    By keeping Watanabe and his supporters within the fold, the  LDP, still the largest single party, has averted another major  split and is still a thorn in the coalition's side.    The LDP lost its 38-year-old grip on power last summer after  Hata and his political ally, Ichiro Ozawa, bolted the party with  their followers to form Shinseito.    It was the second attempt by Watanabe, 70, for the prime  ministership. He made his first attempt when the LDP was in  power.    Political commentators said he changed his mind this time  after realizing the slim possibility of winning support from  Shinseito and other parties.    If a policy platform statement is signed by the coalition  partners, the leaders of the alliance will nominate Hata for the  premiership as early as Wednesday [20 April].</p>

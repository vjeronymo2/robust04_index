			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Heavitree ahead 26% to Pounds 507,000 Heavitree Brewery reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 507,000 for the six months to April 30, a rise of 26 per cent on the comparable Pounds 401,000. The outcome, achieved on turnover of Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 3.85m), was struck after losses of Pounds 64,000 (profit of Pounds 26,000) on the sale of properties and lower interest charges of Pounds 154,000 (Pounds 197,000). Despite its name, the USM-traded group ceased brewing activities in 1970 to concentrate on operating public houses. Mr William Tucker, chairman, said the 'good progress' should continue into the second half 'but at a reduced percentage rate.' The interim dividend goes up to 1p (0.6p), payable from earnings of 3.8p (3.2p) per share.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / PSBR figure for December rises sharply A BOOST to tax payments caused by a change in the rules for collecting value added tax failed to prevent a sharp rise in the public sector borrowing requirement for December. The Treasury said yesterday that last month's PSBR climbed to Pounds 3.43bn compared with Pounds 1.33bn in December 1991. The rise was caused mainly by a big increase in public spending. The total PSBR for the first nine months of 1992-93 was Pounds 25.7bn compared with Pounds 10.3bn in the corresponding period for the previous year. The Treasury forecasts a PSBR for 1992-93 of Pounds 37bn after one of Pounds 13.8bn in 1991-92. Much of the change is because of weak economic activity constraining tax receipts, while rising unemployment has pushed up social security spending. The spiralling deficit is casting a cloud over the March 16 Budget, in which the government may be forced to increase taxes to reduce borrowing. Government receipts last month came to Pounds 6.49bn compared with Pounds 5.89bn in the corresponding month a year before. The relatively high figure was due mainly to additional VAT revenues, caused by many large companies making these payments on a monthly basis rather than quarterly. The Treasury said that because of the change, receipts in December were between Pounds 750m and Pounds 1bn higher than would have been expected. Receipts this month are also likely to be boosted while the figure for February will be correspondingly reduced. Spending by central government departments last month amounted to Pounds 19.91bn compared with Pounds 16.2bn in December 1991. Spending during the first nine months of the financial year totalled Pounds 179.3bn, 14 per cent up on the Pounds 156.9bn spent in the first three quarters of 1991-92. The spending figures are calculated after allowing for privatisation proceeds, which totalled Pounds 1.3bn in December.</p>

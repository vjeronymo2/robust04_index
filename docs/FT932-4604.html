			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (19): Leapfrog in time - China AT A time when the airline industry in the west faces a slump and aircraft orders are down, China's aviation market is booming and shows no signs of easing up. 'Its industry is growing much more than the US aviation business in the 1960s and 1970s, when the maximum growth rate was 12 to 13 per cent annually,' says a western businessman. 'China's growth rate is more than double that of the US.' China's passenger traffic volume rose more than 30 per cent last year over 1991, and it has averaged an annual 25 per cent increase since 1984. Domestic flights are consistently more than 80 per cent full. Some business forecasts estimate that China will need to acquire 50 to 60 aircraft a year for the next three years to begin to meet demand. In a period of tremendous economic reform, China is modernising and restructuring its aviation industry. At the same time, to cope with the immense growth in passenger and cargo traffic, it is acquiring a wide variety of planes and equipment using an array of financing techniques, from leasing to barter deals to outright purchasing. Three of the country's state-owned airlines have leased at least 16 Ilyushin 86s from the former Soviet republics. Under the terms of what is called a 'wet lease', the foreign carrier supplies the aircraft, crews, flight attendants and technical support staff. The Russians are also bartering or selling Tupolev 154s. Though these aircraft require more frequent repairs and use more fuel, they are cheaper than their western counterparts. China has also recently purchased 12 Airbuses from Germany, with options for 13 more in a Dollars 1bn contract. Boeing is a major player in the China market. It is expected to deliver a total of 47 aircraft this year. The company signed an Dollars 800m order in the spring to sell 20 737s and one 757 to China. It is also negotiating to sell widebody 767 jets, which can carry 260 passengers, to China Southwest, and an advanced new 777 plane that can seat 390 people, which would go to Air China. China has acquired nearly 200 Boeings since Mr Richard Nixon flew in one to Beijing in 1973 to begin the process of Sino-American rapprochement. Other foreign companies are also negotiating to manufacture aircraft in China, but western sources said these discussions are on hold as the Chinese industry undergoes a reorganisation. Saab-Scania has been talking with the Chinese about producing a turbo-prop commuter. Last year, Saab sold some 340s to China Southern. The French and Italians have also been competing to offer a similar 50-seater model, called an ATR, to the Chinese. Fokker is believed to be proposing its version of the turbo-prop. Since April, the Ministry of Aerospace Industry has been dismembered. The aerospace functions are now handled by the China Aerospace Industrial Corporation, and the aviation and manufacturing arms are the responsibilities of the China Aviation Industrial Corporation. Although both corporations are still government-owned, this change brings more decentralisation and a greater emphasis on responding to market demand. With this restructuring, it is still unclear how much clout the aviation corporation has and to what extent it is able to compel Chinese airlines to buy domestically made jets. Many airlines prefer to purchase foreign aircraft, believing they get a cheaper and better quality product. At the same time the ministry has been dismantled, the Civil Aviation Administration of China has also been broken up. CAAC now functions primarily as a regulatory agency, much like the Federal Aviation Administration in the US. It no longer retains control of the airports, though it still keeps authority over some aircraft purchase decisions. In the face of the country's rapid economic reform, the number of airlines has mushroomed. At last count, China had 25 to 30 airlines. They can be organised into three groups: The first category consists of six major state-owned regional carriers: Air China, China Eastern, China Northern, China Southern, China Southwestern, and China Northwestern. These airlines can float bonds and shares, sign joint ventures, and create subsidiaries, but still need central government approval for aircraft purchases. The second group includes specialised airlines, such as Yunnan Air, which CAAC controls directly. Despite provincial and local government pressure to ignore Beijing's directives, CAAC retains authority over these airlines so as to allocate routes. The third category of carriers includes all of those owned by municipalities, provinces, and other shareholders. The largest of these airlines is Shanghai Air, which has three Boeings now and will have 13 of them by 2000. Xiamen Air in Fujian province is partially owned by China Southern, which is based in Canton. With the decentralisation of the industry and the economic boom, a host of new problems has arisen. Safety issues have often taken a back seat to expansion. China's safety record has been erratic. Last year, four publicly reported accidents claimed 276 lives. And in April this year, turbulence rocked a China Eastern flight to Los Angeles, killing two people and injuring more than 150. China also faces a severe pilot shortage. Good pilots have left the major state airlines for smaller, local ones and much higher pay. Many of the country's airports have antiquated ground facilities, few radar systems, or none at all. To improve its safety record, CAAC recently announced a crackdown. New airlines cannot be created unless they meet minimum capital requirements, have qualified pilots and adequate ground control equipment. New regulations also prohibit pilots from flying overtime and from taking off or landing in bad weather. Safety inspections and spot checks are being stepped up. CAAC has also banned unauthorised pilot and technical personnel recruitment from one airline to another in the country. 'All of this will take time,' a western business executive says. 'China is trying to leapfrog to the latest available technology without going through the steps western countries have taken.'</p>

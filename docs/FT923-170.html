			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Angolans vote in festive mood UNDER multi-coloured umbrellas, Angolans queued yesterday to cast their votes in the country's first democratic elections. Voters pouring with sweat and clutching plastic voter identity cards pushed to get into polling stations in the capital Luanda in festive spirit. Members of the National Electoral Commission, whose T-shirts depicted a white dove with ballot paper in its beak, processed voters in an orderly and professional manner remarkable by most African standards. Mr Onoffre dos Santos, commission chairman, said yesterday no violent incidents had marred the first of two days of voting, but a number of polling stations had not opened by the afternoon in the hotly contested rural provinces of Uige, Huambo and Malange where difficult logistics could become the key issue in post-electoral controversy. In the worst case, in Uige, 160 polling stations out of 450 were still being installed yesterday after their delivery by helicopter had been delayed. However, Mr Dos Santos said all 5,800 polling stations would be open today, and everybody would be able to vote even if it meant keeping polling stations open tonight. Mr Dos Santos also said turnout had been high, especially in Luanda. Many voters appeared confused about how to cast their first ever democratic vote after decades of Portuguese colonialism and 30 years of civil war. Electoral commission members, watched by representatives of the political parties, went through a series of checks against electoral fraud. Even Unita, the former right-wing rebel movement and the main electoral opponent against the ruling MPLA government, after consistently warning against electoral malpractice yesterday gave a cautious preliminary approval to the first day of voting.</p>

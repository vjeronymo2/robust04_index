			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ company to farm deer in Malaysia A NEW ZEALAND company has linked up with the Johor state government of southern Malaysia to set up farms capable of carrying 9,000 deer. Corporate Investments, a diversified company, will form a NZDollars 8m (Pounds 2.7m) joint venture with the Johor state government economic development corporation. CIS will hold a 25 per cent stake in the new company and have a five-year management contract to supply fallow deer. The first consignment from Auckland is expected to arrive soon. An export slaughtering and processing plant will be set up later. Mr Peter Masfen, executive chairman of CIS, said 200 hectares of land, mostly jungle and coconut plantation, were being cleared and fenced for the first farm and a further 200 hectares would be available for further development. CIS also has a joint venture deer farm in British Columbia and a joint venture with Sumitomo Forestry Company of Japan to process timber. Mr Masfen said the main objectives of the thrust in south-east Asia was to link New Zealand expertise in farming, processing and marketing with the abundance of land and labour in the region.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] The spring meetings of the NATO Foreign  Ministers Council has started in Istanbul.    The opening session was held this morning. The foreign  ministers of the 16 member countries are participating. At the  opening session, speeches were delivered by Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin, honorary chairman British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd, and acting NATO Secretary General Sergio Valencino.    The first speech was delivered by Cetin who said that under  the changing world conditions, like other international  organizations, NATO saw itself insufficient. He pointed out  that difficulties are being faced at times in positing the will  that can bring about any changes. Within this framework, he  said, the decisions reached during the NATO summit held in  January were very appropriate.    Assessing NATO's functions so far, Cetin stated that the  alliance must be able to meet the needs of the political and  strategic conditions in Europe. He stressed that first and  foremost NATO must have credibility. I consider the alliance as  a basic vehicle in establishing European stability, he said,  adding that NATO should be able to play a more effective role in  areas where stability has been upset.    Cetin said: The developments of the past few years should  teach us some lessons. One of them is that even though we are  on the eve of the 21st century, certain communities do not  refrain from resorting to barbaric methods to further their own  interests. In such situations where all the values and  principles we uphold are violated, it is impossible for the  alliance to avert its eyes and hope that the conflict will go  away.    Foreign Minister Cetin stressed that when it has to act,  NATO  must do so in a timely fashion and with determination. That is  the only way to prevent barbarism in crisis areas, he said.    Cetin pointed out that the success of the alliance should be  ignored, adding that its determined approach in  Bosnia-Herzegovina prevented the conflict from spreading further  and contributed to peace.

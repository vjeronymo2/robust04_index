			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington in Pounds 90m Italian purchase PILKINGTON, the glass group, and Techint Finanziaria, its Italian-Argentine parter, last night signed a L210bn (Pounds 90m) contract to buy Societa Italiana Vetro, the Italian state-owned glass company being privatised. The news came after the market closed with Pilkington shares up 1p at 132p. The deal, foreshadowed for some weeks, is still subject to approval from the European competition authorities. If that goes through, it would make Pilkington a strong number two in Europe after Saint Gobain of France. Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington's chief executive, said the acquisition was in line with the group's strategy of concentrating on developing 'its core businesses in major markets'. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director of Pilkington, said the Siv deal would give Pilkington greater balance both in its business and geographically. Siv's strength is in automotive glass while Pilkington's emphasis in Europe is on architectural glass. Siv has a southern European bias, with plants in Italy and Spain, whereas Pilkington's facilities are based in northern Europe. He said that the timing of the deal was dictated by the Italian privatisation programme. Although the European automotive market is currently depressed, he expected it would recover. Siv's plants were all modern and it would be able to use Pilkington's advanced coatings. Mr Robb said there was little customer overlap between Pilkington and Siv, with one or two in common in Germany and the UK. Siv has two float glass lines in Italy and a half share in a third line, and two automotive glass processing plants in Italy with a third in Spain. Pilkington's Pounds 45m share of the consideration will be funded from existing bank facilities and since its share of Siv's underlying net asset value of Pounds 130m is Pounds 65m, its balance sheet will be marginally enhanced by the deal. Siv will be treated as an associate by Pilkington. Siv made an operating profit of Pounds 10m on sales of Pounds 280m in 1992, but incurred a Pounds 23m loss after exceptional charges partly relating to the impending privatisation. Pilkington and Techint's business plan envisages redundancies of 450 of the 4,000 workforce, numbers which have been shown to the unions. The joint venture agreement provides for either side to buy the other out, including provisions for change of ownership of either.</p>

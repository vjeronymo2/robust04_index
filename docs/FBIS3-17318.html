			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Angeli] </F>   [Text] Chisinau 24 March, TASS -- The eighth round of  Russian-Moldovan talks on the status and deadline for the  withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldova is due to get  under way in Chisinau on 5 April, an official of the Russian  Embassy in Moldova told TASS.    Moldova continues to press for unconditional pullout of  Russian troops from the Republic by 1 July 1994. As for the  Russian side, it links the withdrawal shcedule to Moldova's  granting a special status to its breakaway Dniester region.  Russia has recently stepped up considerably its activities  aiming to settle the Dniester conflict. At the moment, the  Russian president's special envoy Vladilen Vasev is staying in  the region as a mediator between Moldovan authorities and the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. The Russian diplomat has  already met with moldovan President Mircea Snegur, parliament  speaker Petru Lucinski and Dniester leader Igor Smirnov. He  informed them about Russia's proposals, which could form the  basis for resolving the protracted Dniester crisis.    Moldovan and Romanian newspapers are still exaggerating  rumours that the 14th Russian army may be turned into a Russian  military base in this region. The Moldovan head of state flatly  dismissed the rumours. But other republican leaders and  Russia's official representatives in Chisinau decline to give  any comments.    The CSCE mission in Moldova has recently declared again for  unqualified withdrawal of foreign troops from Moldovan territory  and expressed grave concern over the lack of progress in  settling the problems of the Republic's eastern regions.</p>

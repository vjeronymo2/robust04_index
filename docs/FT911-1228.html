			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Spanish airline opens pay campaign STRIKING GROUND staff and cabin crews yesterday forced the cancellation of 168 Iberia flights, most of them to international destinations, in the opening round of a tough union response to wage restraint policies in Spain's public sector companies. Industrial action over the next two weeks is expected to spread to the national railways, to Telefonica, the telecommunications monopoly, to the state-controlled shipbuilding and aerospace industries, and to the publicly owned gas companies which are all currently involved in annual wage negotiations. The Iberia strike, the first of four 24-hour stoppages planned at the national airline this month, followed a management decision to freeze salary increases this year. The company, which is in the process of buying several Latin American carriers, including Aerolineas Argentinas, lost Pta22.5bn (Pounds 123.6m) last year and is likely to make further losses this year. Elsewhere in the public sector, management is offering salary increases of 5 per cent, nearly one point below the present inflation level, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Economy Ministry. Unions, spurred by pay awards exceeding 8 per cent in the private sector, are demanding 9 per cent increases in the public sector.</p>

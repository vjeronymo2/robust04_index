			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Summer Festivals: Dance takes pride of place After many fallow and frightful years, dancing has an honourable place once more at the Edinburgh Festival, a fact surely not unconnected with the opening of the new Festival Theatre, which is the desperate old Empire Theatre re-born, re-furbished, and not before time too. Mark Morris, who had a great success at last year's jamboree, returns with his finest creation, L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato. It crowds the stage with memorable dancing, ravishing images. Handel's music will be given by a distinguished group of soloists and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Not to be missed: performances between August 20 and 22 at the Festival Theatre. Also not to be missed is the Miami City Ballet, a strong company directed by Edward Villella. Villella was a tremendous dancer for 20 years with Balanchine's New York City Ballet, and he has made the Miami ensemble a home for Balanchine choreography, which is danced with verve and clarity. Three acts of the sublime Jewels are on view between August 15 and 17; a quadruple bill on August 19, 20. Performances in the cavernously dour Playhouse. The festival also presents Merce Cunningham and his dancers with two recent pieces on August 27, 28 at the Playhouse, while another American dance-explorer, Lucinda Childs, will be at the Playhouse with two programmes between August 23 and 25. Canadian choreographer, Jean-Pierre Perreault, makes his British debut at the King's Theatre between August 20 and 22. The Holland Festival, Amsterdam, will feature three major dance companies. Merce Cunningham and his newest piece, Ocean, will be at the Muziektheater between June 27 and 30. Nederlands Dans Theater is mounting a special programme of choreographies by Hans van Manen and Jiri Kylian, inspired by the paintings of Mondrian, at the Muziektheater on June 2, 4, 5, 7. The Dutch National Ballet shows new works at the Stadsschouwburg, June 25, 26. The Aldeburgh Festival proposes three evenings by London Contemporary Dance Theatre comprising new works by Richard Alston to scores by Britten, of course, and to three movements from Stravinsky's Petrushka, at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall on June 11, 12, 13. The Brighton Festival offers several post-modern dance troupes until May 29, with the admirable Jonathan Burrows showing us his newest creation on May 14 and 15. On August 5, the Harrogate Festival presents an evening by eleven soloists from the Stuttgart Ballet in an intriguing repertory of modern choreographies. In New York the New York City Ballet celebrates its 100th season with a tremendous roster of Balanchine works at the State Theater until June 26, and some novelties from mid-May onwards under the banner of the 'Diamond project'.</p>

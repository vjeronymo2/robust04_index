			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORM BRINGS WINDS, SHOWERS, SNOW, HAIL  </P> <P> A fast-moving storm system swept into Southern California Tuesday night,  whipping up strong winds and bringing showers, snow and reports of hail in some  areas.  </P> <P> Police in Pasadena reported heavy showers late Tuesday, and residents on Mt.  </P> <P> Washington near downtown Los Angeles said hail fell in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> The upper-level low-pressure area, combined with cold air funneling down from  the north, will create winds gusting up to 65 m.p.h. in desert and mountain  passes today, said a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides  forecasts for The Times.  </P> <P> Winds will probably reach 45 m.p.h. in most parts of the Los Angeles Basin, the  forecaster said.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol reported snow on Interstate 5 in the Tejon Pass  area, but not enough to close it to traffic. High winds also whipped through  the pass Tuesday night. Rain was also reported on mountain roads in San  Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said they had received no reports of rain Tuesday night, and  that police helicopters, which would be grounded during showers, were still  flying.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service places the chance of rain at 20% through early  this morning. But mostly clear skies are expected today with cool temperatures.  Highs are expected to reach only into the 50s, with lows in the 40s.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Increased losses at CountyGlen Losses before tax at CountyGlen, the Dublin-based property investor and trader, rose from IPounds 153,000 to IPounds 170,000 (Pounds 175,000), for the six months ended October 31. Directors stressed that the deficit mainly represented costs incurred in finalising agreements in the UK for CountyGlen to recover its Pounds 500,000 loan to the Videoplus distributors as well as write-offs of rent accepted by the company to obtain possession of the Blackrock site. The company added that it was examining a number of merger and takeover suggestions but it was too early to bring them to shareholders. The shares have been suspended since October 20.</p>

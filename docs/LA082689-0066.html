			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SHEENA, QUEEN OF THE OF POP ROCK GENRE  </P> <P> Sheena Easton's show at the Universal Amphitheatre last weekend was an  hour-plus, high-energy workout of every song she's ever recorded -- or maybe it  just seemed that way.  </P> <P> Easton, who'll be at the Pacific Amphitheatre tonight, is a gifted singer with  industrial-strength lungs and charm to spare. Still, her act contains a lot of  bloat.  </P> <P> While Easton can outclass many other pop vocalists on such emotive,  lung-bursting ballads as "I Wouldn't Beg for Water" and "For Your Eyes Only,"  she wasted a lot of time on lightweight sweat-inducers like "No Deposit, No  Return."  </P> <P> She sounded best when she stuck to fresher fare, such as "Sugar Walls," a song  that earned her Tipper Gore's brand as a corrupter of youth.  </P> <P> "Hey, Dan Quayle's more dangerous to this country than I am," Easton chortled  Friday. And he probably doesn't look nearly as cute in exercise gear. CONNIE  JOHNSON Sheena Easton sings tonight at 7:30 at the Pacific Amphitheatre, 100  Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $20. Parking: $4. Information: (714) 634-1300.  </P></p>

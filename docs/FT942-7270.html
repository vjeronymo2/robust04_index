			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Yabba dabba deals The formidable marketing machine behind The Flintstones, which premieres in the US tomorrow, is getting into gear. Even if you never see the film - which opens later this summer in Europe and Asia - it will be hard to escape the promotional blitz. Amblin Entertainment, Steven Spielberg's production company, estimates that more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m) will be lavished on marketing, more than twice what was spent on Jurassic Park. The Flintstones film is based on the 1960s cartoon series of life in prehistoric Bedrock. The series holds cachet with US babyboomers, and viewers in countries such as Britain, Mexico and Japan, where re-runs have been playing for years. The toy maker Mattel has signed a deal with Amblin for a new line of Flintstones dolls, including the Talking Fred. Actor John Goodman, who plays Fred in the movie, has been taking the doll with him on television appearances. Flintstones songs have already become hits. The rock group the B-52s, which appears in the film as the BC-52s, has two new singles out: its version of the Flintstones theme song and 'Bedrock Twitch'. McDonald's has traded in its golden arches in the film for dinosaur tusks, and has been re-christened Rocdonald's. In exchange for the cameo, the food chain has launched what it calls its biggest promotion. McDonald's will be selling Flintstones mugs and t-shirts in 38 countries. Left-over products from the cartoon era will receive a free ride from the promotion. Turner Entertainment, which owns the animated series, is receiving heavy play on television. The ultimate success of the Flintstones products depends on how much enthusiasm the film generates at the box-office. In a few months, executives involved in the promotion may either be crying in their dinosaur milk or yabba-dabba-doing all the way to the bank.</p>

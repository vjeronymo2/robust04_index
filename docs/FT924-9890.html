			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Continental bidding closes THE bid deadline for Continental Airlines, the large and bankrupt US carrier, expired yesterday, with at least three suitors thought to be still in the running. Earlier, Continental confirmed that Lufthansa, the German airline which had considered making an offer with Mr Marvin Davis, the Californian financier, was no longer pursuing a deal. This appeared to leave three contenders: a consortium lead by Mr Charles Hurwitz's Maxxam group, an offer from Mr Alfredo Brener's Houston Air, and a proposal from Air Canada in conjunction with a Texan investment partnership. Shortly after bids closed, Air Canada confirmed it was still interested in Continental, but declined to give more details. The Maxxam group also said it had submitted an offer by the deadline. Houston Air was not immediately contactable. Continental has to present the 'best offer' to the bankruptcy court on November 9.</p>

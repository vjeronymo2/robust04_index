Creation  of `Siberian Faction' in Parliament Postponed, But Apparently  Not for Long"]    [Text] Chiefs have changed in "Siberian Agreement." From  now on the association's council will be headed by Leonid  Polezhayev, chief of the Omsk Oblast administration, not Vitaliy  Mukha, who was fired by Boris Yeltsin from the post of  Novosibirsk governor for disloyalty.    Mr. Polezhayev promised that under him the association will  continue to work "for the benefit of Siberia and all of Russia,"  but at the same time "new opportunities" that opened up after  the elections would be used. The official creation of a  "Siberian faction," however, has so far been postponed: Too  many disgruntled members turned up on 10 January for the  association's council meeting. According to Vladimir Shumeyko,  he "would like supraparty deputy groups to operate at the Duma,  while at the upper chamber there should be no factions at all."  Newly elected Duma members from Siberia, having realized that  even deputy seats will not save them from their local bosses'  control, on the contrary advised that "such a group should be  set up precisely at the Federation Council" and that independent  Duma deputies should be left alone.    Nonetheless, "Siberian Agreement" is seriously intent on  setting up a "Siberian cohort" that would operate in both  chambers of the Federal Assembly and is even ready to assume all  expenses of this deputy group's staff.    It seems that this lobby will be formed at an accelerated  pace precisely at this stage until next year's budget is drawn  up. "We are as yet unable to get anything either from this  Fedorov or from this Central Bank," Buryatian Prime Minister  Vladimir Saganov exclaimed. Currently, the association is  summarizing all demands voiced by Siberian regions so as to  present them to the government, and what all of them want is to  resolve the nonpayments crisis while avoiding bankruptcies of  enterprises.    Aleksandr Shokhin, who attended the council meeting,  confided  that "taking the regions' demands into account in the budget  will be a difficult task." Nonetheless, the place of "the  regions' advocate" on Staraya Ploshchad has never been empty,  and Vladimir Shumeyko is apparently going to replace the  outgoing Sergey Shakhray in this capacity. At any rate, it was  he who suggested on Monday that "Siberian Agreement" determine  "an amount required for priority Siberian programs -- and we  will back it at a government meeting."    Apparently, it is precisely Leonid Polezhayev's push-through  qualities that landed him in the seat of the head of an  association of raw material and military-industrial regions,  although his purely agrarian Omsk Oblast has no bearing either  on raw materials or the military-industrial sector. Even  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy indirectly confirmed his reputation of a  "strong manager" by announcing recently his intention to  nominate Mr. Polezhayev to the government from his party. The  Omsk governor himself, however, told your SEGODNYA correspondent  that he was hearing about this for the first time and did not  have any connections with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  leader.</p>

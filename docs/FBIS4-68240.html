			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [NARODNA ARMIYA report: "An Expression of Appreciation to </F> the Minister of Defense"]    [Text] Recently, General of the Army Vitaliy Radetskyy, the  defense minister, received a letter from Mr. A. Malynovskyy, the  presidential representative in Zhytomyr Oblast.    Your assumption of the leadership of the defense ministry,  states the letter, has ushered in important changes in the  approach to building the Armed Forces of Ukraine. We are  impressed by your energetic and consistent search for promising  directions in the development of the Armed Forces, and, in  particular, in reforming military education.    The latter is of particular concern to Zhytomyr residents,  who are grateful to you for your attention to one of the oldest  military schools, which has been located in Zhytomyr since 1946.  On 8 December 1994, the school will celebrate its 75th  anniversary. Since its establishment, it has trained more than  30,000 officers for the Air Defense Forces [PPO]. At present,  the school, which is the only one of its kind, is training  highly qualified specialists for the antimissile and space  defense forces. We therefore feel that the decision to close the  school is hasty and without sufficient grounds.    Being aware that you have given our problems your careful  attention, we wish to express our deepest gratitude to you  personally and to the entire leadership of the Ministry of  Defense and express the hope that you will ultimately reach a  positive decision regarding the fate of our school.    We believe that one way to decide this matter is to use the  school as a base on which to create the military division of the  Zhytomyr Missile and Space Engineering and Technological  Institute [institut raketno-kosmichnoho profilyu] and a National  Space Center. Proposals to this effect have been submitted to  the Cabinet of Ministers. Taking into account your support of  these proposals, we ask permission to begin enrolling first-year  students as soon as possible, thereby preventing the  irreversible loss of the school's professors, instructors, and  auxiliary teaching personnel--ends the letter from the  presidential representative in Zhytomyr Oblast.</p>

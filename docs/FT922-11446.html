			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar prices reach 16-month highs - Week in the Markets RAW SUGAR prices on the world market this week broke out of the strait-jacket that had confined them for the past 16 months as fears of a squeeze on nearby supplies prompted heavy short-covering by traders in New York. Computer fund buying was also reported as the prompt May position in New York moved above the psychologically-significant 10 cents-a-lb mark for the first time since late 1990. Thursday saw the prompt May position at the Big Apple's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange reach 10.28 cents a lb, up from at 9.59 cents at the end of last week. A more cautious mood prevailed yesterday and in late trading the May price had reacted to 10.05 cents a lb, but traders said the funds and other speculators were still holding big long positions because of concern about supplies of raws from Thailand and drought-hit South Africa. That concern was clearly reflected in the premium of 36 cents for the May position, which is to expire soon, over the July position. When May sugar became the prompt position at the end of March it was trading at a discount to July of 13 cents. There were doubts in the world sugar market, however, about the sustainability of the recent price upsurge. GNI Research noted that Thursday's sharp rise at the London Futures and Options Exchange had 'inevitably' been magnified by short-covering and described the market's strength as 'an ephemeral affair'. In yesterday's daily market report GNI said that the South Africans had stressed that they had taken steps to ensure that export obligations would be satisfied. 'There is mounting speculation that a large proportion of the open position will be taken out against actuals (physical deliveries) on their (the South Africans') behalf,' the report said. 'This still leaves the specs and funds long in the run up to next Thursday's expiry (of the May position). Since they are unlikely to want to take delivery a heavy bout of long liquidation is on the cards.' GNI said it was also worth noting that the Japanese, who are big buyers of South African sugar, had not reported any significant tightening of conditions on the Tokyo market. In its World Commodity Forecasts, published this week, the Economist Intelligence Unit paints a fairly sober picture of the longer term sugar price outlook. It estimates that it will average 8.5 cents a lb during the present quarter and in the second half of this year, compared with 8.13 cents in the first quarter. For next year it sees a further modest rise with the price average reaching 8.75 cents in first quarter and remaining at that level in the second and third quarters. But that would still be below the 1991 average of 8.97 cents a lb and the previous year's 12.55 cents. The EIU report describes a similar prospect for robusta coffee prices. It forecasts the present quarter's average at 45 cents a lb, up from 44.8 cents in the January-March period, rising gradually to 48 cents in the final quarter and 50 cents in July-September 1993. This week saw the July position on the London robusta futures market dip to a fresh 17-year low of Dollars 782 a tonne - equivalent to 35.4 cents a lb - as stale long-liquidation in a thin market touched off stop-loss selling orders. The price rallied to Dollars 802 a tonne yesterday morning but came under renewed pressure and closed at Dollars 787 a tonne, down Dollars 14 on the week. Cocoa prices slipped to 9-month lows meanwhile, with the July position ending at Pounds 608 a tonne, down Pounds 11 on the week. A proposal at UN talks in Geneva by the Ivory Coast, the biggest cocoa producer, for a new international price-stabilisation agreement based on export quotas made little impact. GNI described the plan as 'merely a political face-saving manoeuvre as the consuming members have already said that they will only consider a (stock) withholding scheme'. Traders thought support might emerge around Pounds 600 a tonne mark, but otherwise they saw little to prevent a continued decline in cocoa prices, especially as manufacturer buying interest was conspicuous by its absence. In a pretty routine week at the London Metal Exchange interest remained dominated by the squeeze on zinc supplies for nearby delivery. This helped to lift the cash price by Dollars 33.50 to Dollars 1,339.50 a tonne and widened its premium over the three months price by Dollars 16.50 to Dollars 44 at one point. By yesterday's close, however, the premium had narrowed to Dollars 35 a tonne.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium  +4,450 to 1,212,625 Copper     -4,375 to   282,925 Lead       -1,425 to   130,475 Nickel       -258 to    26,034 Zinc       +1,575 to   236,275 Tin          +240 to    12,125  --------------------------------------</p>

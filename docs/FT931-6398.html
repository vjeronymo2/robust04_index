			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / ICI not to pay 'pool uplift' charges IMPERIAL Chemical Industries will not have to pay 'pool uplift' charges for the purchase of electricity from Teesside power station for its adjacent Wilton site, the company announced yesterday, Michael Smith writes. Since electricity privatisation, virtually all electricity in England and Wales has had to be sold through a pool, or wholesale market, which then results in a higher price to cover administration and other 'uplift' costs. Until this decision on uplift charges by the pool executive committee, ICI would have been liable to pay Pounds 1.5m a year to the pool on top of what it will pay to the consortium that operates the power plant, which is on land owned by ICI. ICI said it was too early to say what the effects would be on talks to bypass the pool at its Runcorn chlorine plant. The situation there is different because the potential supplier, PowerGen, would be physically separate from the plant and electricity would have to be supplied through equipment owned by a regional electricity company. South Wales Electricity is to reduce tariffs for more than 900,000 customers for the second time in six months. Domestic customers paying quarterly will see a 1 percentage reduction in bills. Electricity prices for 3m Eastern Electricity customers are to be held at 1992 prices for a year from April. Both companies made their decisions following reductions in the price of coal which is used to generate electricity.</p>

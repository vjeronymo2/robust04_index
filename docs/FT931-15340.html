			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / NedCar to axe 1,200 jobs nearly one quarter of the work force - are to go by the end of this year at NedCar, the Dutch car maker owned jointly by Volvo, Mitsubishi of Japan and the Dutch government. The job cuts form part of a company restructuring, both to combat dwindling sales of its current Volvo 400 models and to prepare for production of joint Volvo/Mitsubishi models from the mid-1990s. NedCar makes about 100,000 cars a year. The company told unions yesterday the measures were 'essential if the continuity of NedCar was not to be seriously jeopardised'. About 800 job losses will be compulsory. NedCar's management said a drop in European car demand, increased competition and adverse currency shifts had made 'far-reaching economies' necessary. Vehicle production is to be concentrated at the group's main manufacturing facility at Born. The company's engineering and development would be shared between Born and the company's administrative headquarters at Helmond. In an attempt to increase revenue, NedCar is exploring the possibility of selling its research and development skills to outside companies. The Dutch government had held a 70 per cent stake in NedCar up to end 1991, when Mitsubishi was invited to take a 33 per cent stake. The government is committed to selling its remaining one-third stake by 1998 equally to Volvo and Mit-subishi. The new car range to replace the 400 will be badged both as Volvos and Mitsubishis but are to be mainly engineered by Mitsubishi.</p>

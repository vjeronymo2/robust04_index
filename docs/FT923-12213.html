			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Survey of International Capital Markets (5): The bankers keep their euphoria under control - Patrick Harverson gauges the mood on Wall Street FOR Wall Street, the past year and a half must have seemed at times like a happy re-run of the go-go 1980s. Investment banks and securities houses have cashed in record earnings as stock and bond underwriting business has soared. The equity markets have roared ahead to new heights. Bonuses have rocketed in the wake of record fees and commissions. The after-tax profits of New York Stock Exchange member firms reached a record Dollars 3.8bn in 1991 on record revenues of Dollars 61bn, compared with the pathetic Dollars 106m loss incurred in 1990. So far this year, their earnings are keeping up a record pace. Yet despite the huge amounts of money which have swilled about the US capital markets since early 1991, the investment bankers, securities salesmen and brokers of Wall Street have been remarkably subdued about their good fortune. After the shocks of the post-1987 crash era, when payrolls, salaries, bonuses and corporate earnings tumbled amid overcapacity and soft markets, the 'masters of the universe' in lower Manhattan have learnt to treat the good times with a certain degree of respect and humility. In fact, bonuses for all but a few top performers last year did not match 1980s levels, a reflection of a tougher-minded, more performance-related approach to compensation among senior executives in the securities industry. There was also less than normal growth in salaries, especially at lower levels, and, except in a few areas (retail broking, notably), companies were in no rush to hire new blood. The relief on Wall Street that the red ink and job losses of the 1988-1990 period was over, however, was genuine enough. Although the Federal Reserve has endured much criticism for its management of monetary policy, most of the credit for the turnaround in US capital markets goes to the nation's central bank. It was the Fed's rush of interest rate cuts last year (a belated response to economic weakness) that created the conditions for a surge in capital raising by companies eager to refinance high-yielding debt, to pay for much needed restructuring, or (in rarer cases) to pay for expansion. Lower interest rates also revived individual investors' interest in stocks, by making alternative short-term assets, such as bank certificates of deposit and money market funds, look less attractive compared with higher-yielding equities. Consequently, investors handed over money to professional investment managers and stock funds in record amounts. The greatest growth in domestic capital markets, however, was in corporate stock and bond issuance, where volume last year jumped to a record Dollars 586bn, up 88 per cent on 1990's total. The bulk of the total was issues of mortgage-backed securities (Dollars 246bn), followed by corporate bonds (Dollars 210bn, including junk debt), and common stock (Dollars 54bn), of which almost half was initial public offerings (IPOs), or flotations. So far this year, debt and equity issues are maintaining their volume, thanks to further interest rate cuts, the latest being the half-point reduction in the discount rate to 3 per cent early this month. In the first six months of 1992, new stock and bonds sold in the US amounted to a record Dollars 437bn; up 61 per cent on a year ago. Mortgage-backed securities dominated again, while issues of investment-grade debt totalled Dollars 136bn, evenly split over the first and second quarter. Junk debt remained popular, with almost Dollars 19bn in high-yield bonds sold in the first half. Just over Dollars 41bn in new stock was issued, of which almost half was in the form of IPOs. Yet signs are already evident that the record pace of 1991-1992 is slackening. The IPO market, in particular, seems to have peaked. Volume did reach a record Dollars 19.4bn in the first half, but the total would have been much greater were it not for a large number of postponed or cancelled issues. Pricing has also become difficult, with 60 of the 150 IPOs that came to the market in the second quarter being offered at a price below their target range. The problem has been a new wariness about IPOs among investors, whose appetite for stock may finally be waning in light of the poor performance of recent new issues. According to IDD Information Services, only 29 of the 100 most recent IPOs were trading above their sale price as of June 24. Despite this month's interest rate cut, it is unlikely that corporate capital-raising will maintain the heady pace of the first half of the year. Much of the financing of the past 18 months has been used to reduce debt and generally tidy up balance sheets. That trend has probably peaked, and companies are now likely to wait for a significant improvement in earnings before dipping into the capital markets again with such vigour. That means the fortunes of the capital markets will be more closely tied to the domestic economy and driven less by interest rate. So far this year, economic growth has averaged around 2 per cent, and economists are not expecting much more for the rest of 1992.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S QUIET IN THERE -- TOO QUIET;  </P> <P> AZTECS: IF AN OPPONENT FALLS IN THEIR STADIUM, AND NOBODY IS THERE TO SEE IT .  . .  </P> <P> The first time Dan McGwire ran onto the field for a football game as a freshman  at the University of Iowa, a sellout crowd of 67,700 at Kinnick Stadium gave  him a standing ovation.  </P> <P> "They had heard so much about me before I got there, they were just glad I was  there," McGwire said. "Something like that sends chills up and down your spine.  The excitement of seeing that many people in a full stadium is unbelievable."  </P> <P> But if McGwire, who transferred to San Diego State two years ago, were to  receive the same recognition Saturday night against New Mexico, he might not  notice. Forty-five thousand empty seats do not make much noise.  </P> <P> Welcome to an Aztec home game.  </P> <P> Attendance at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is down to an average of 20,507 per  game this year, and the players say they feel the difference. They miss the  excitement a large crowd generates, the rush those cheers give them and the  support they provide at crucial points in a game. They long for a time when  they too can count on a noisy crowd to enhance their home-field advantage.  </P> <P> "The crowd brings out the best in you," McGwire said. "You make a big play and  the crowd starts cheering, and it makes you want to make another one and  another one. It feeds on itself. I just hope we get the crowds back soon."  </P> <P> Playing in a stadium that is three-quarters empty has lately become as much a  part of an Aztec home game as lights, black jerseys and Monte Montezuma. It is  not what several players said they envisioned college football would be like.  </P> <P> "I went to a small high school where the only people cheering for your were the  20 or 30 people who came with you on the bus to the game," said Milt Wilson, a  senior defensive end from Daniel Murphy High School in Los Angeles. "I figured  when I got to college the crowds would be huge. I didn't think there would be  this trouble getting people to come to the games."  </P> <P> Average attendance for the Aztecs' first four home games is lowest in the  Western Athletic Conference by more than 2,000 per game. This despite SDSU  playing in the second largest stadium and being situated in the largest  metropolitan area of any conference school. Crowds have ranged from a high of  31,639 for the home opener against UCLA to 13,548 four weeks ago against Cal  State Long Beach. It was the smallest SDSU crowd since 1985.  </P> <P> "I talked to a friend of mine in Los Angeles, and he said, 'You're drawing less  than New Mexico,' " said Monty Gilbreath, the Aztecs' leading receiver. "It's  hard to play in front of 13,000 people. That's 50,000 empty seats.  </P> <P> "I come out to field punts, so I'm one of the first guys on the field for  warmups. You look out there, and there is no one in the stands. You can't say  that doesn't affect you."  </P> <P> But while his players say they are bothered by the size of the crowd, Coach Al  Luginbill said he will not use that to explain away some less-than-impressive  home performances against Cal State Fullerton (41-41) and Long Beach (30-26  victory).  </P> <P> "That has nothing to do with it," Luginbill said. "They are lucky they have two  people out there the way they played in those two ballgames. They go out and  crush those teams and watch how many people start coming back."  </P> <P> Attendance was not always a problem at SDSU. For their first 15 seasons in San  Diego Stadium, the Aztecs consistently averaged more than 30,000 per game and  set a school record by averaging 42,040 in 1975. From 1967 through 1981, the  smallest season average was 24,845 in 1980. In the eight seasons since, the  Aztecs have averaged more than that only -- 31,723 per game during their 1986  WAC championship season.  </P> <P> The players say they understand why the ticket-buying public has stayed away.  Several of the opponents -- Fullerton, Long Beach and Pacific -- have lacked  marquee value, and the Aztecs have given them little to cheer about since their  1986 Holiday Bowl appearance. But they said at least half of that is changing  in that SDSU is winning again.  </P> <P> The Aztecs enter Saturday night's WAC game against New Mexico having won three  in a row and four of their past five to move over the .500 mark (4-3-1) for the  first time since 1986. The players said they hope the victories will bring back  the crowds but recognize that a 1-8 New Mexico team is a difficult sell, even  for a winner. School officials are predicting a crowd of 15,000 Saturday.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of things to do in San Diego on a Saturday night," said John  Wesselman, a senior nickel back and the team's leading tackler. "I think the  fans look at who we are playing and decide if they want to go. If it is someone  they think we should beat, and it won't be a good game, they do something  else."  </P> <P> Evidently, a lot of people in San Diego have found that something else to do.  </P> <P> Ticket sales are below preseason projections, Athletic Director Fred Miller has  said. But he has declined to give specific figures except to say that the crowd  of 31,639 for UCLA exceeded its goal. Attendance prospects for the remaining  three home games are not encouraging. The projected crowd for New Mexico is  below expections, as are the early estimates of 17,000 for Wyoming Nov. 11 and  about 25,000 for Brigham Young Nov. 25.  </P> <P> No one understands what the Aztecs are missing better than McGwire, their  junior quarterback. He transferred from the Big 10, where large crowds in big,  historic stadiums were commonplace. If there is there one aspect about playing  football at Iowa that he misses, it would be the crowds.  </P> <P> "I knew when I came that the crowds in the WAC would be smaller than the Big  10," McGwire said. "I accept that. But I still miss it. Those stadiums were  something special. Going into Michigan Stadium with 100,000 people cheering, it  brings back the feeling of all the great players who have played there. You get  the feeling you can be part of it, too."  </P> <P> About the only time that McGwire and the other Aztecs play in front big crowds  now is on the road. Sometimes they wish they didn't.  </P> <P> "I remember going to Brigham Young two years ago," Wilson said. "It was cold,  rainy day. The sky was gray, and the stadium was filled. The cheer went around  the stadium. It started on one side with a 'B,' then 'Y,' then 'U,' then,  'Cougars' The stadium shook, it was so loud. That can be intimidating."  </P> <P> The Aztecs can only dream about a time when their home crowds will generate  that kind of noise. Until then, they must make the most of the fans they have.  </P> <P> "We're glad for what we have," Gilbreath said. "I know this, I'd rather play in  front of our 13,000 than on the road in front of Hawaii's 40,000."  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> San Diego State was without its three top running backs in practice Wednesday,  but Coach Al Luginbill said he is hopeful all could be ready to play Saturday  night against New Mexico. Darrin Wagner, the team's leading rusher and scorer,  was out with the flu. Ron Slack, the regular starter, is sidelined with a groin  pull. Curtis Butts, a sophomore walk-on, was given permission to miss practice  to visit hospitalized family members. That left Kipp Jeffries, a freshman who  has not played in a game, to handle the work load in practice. Luginbill said  he his most concerned about Slack's recovery and said there was a possibility  he would not play Saturday.  </P> <P> HOME ATTENDANCE FOR SDSU FOOTBALL  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:1.34IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> G  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Average  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1979  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 236,978  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 39,978  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1980  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 149,068  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 24,450  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1981  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 171,829  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 34,366  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1982  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 122,711  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20,452  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1983  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 89,743  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17,949  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 163,650  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23,378  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 136,396  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19,485  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 190,336  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 31,723  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 137,464  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22,911  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 111,992  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 22,398  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 82,028  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20,507  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

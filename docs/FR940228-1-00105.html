			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Pro Rata Refund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary notes that although the statutory requirements for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds supersede the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  regulations found in the FFEL program regulations, institutions have been advised to follow guidance given for implementation of the FFEL program regulations as ``safe-harbor'' guidance for implementation of the statutory requirements for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds. The Secretary intends that final regulations for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds developed as a result of this NPRM and any guidance given for implementation of these regulations will replace the required  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund policy for an institution that is required to use a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund policy because the institution has a cohort default rate that exceeds 30 percent under the FFEL programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund,'' as defined in statute, is required for a student attending an institution for the first time, unless another applicable refund is greater. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund may not be less than that portion of the tuition, fees, room, board, and other charges assessed the student by the institution equal to the portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that remains on the withdrawal date. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund is then rounded downward to the nearest 10 percent of that period. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund is then reduced for any unpaid charges and a reasonable administrative fee. The administrative fee may not exceed the lesser of one hundred dollars or five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to permit institutions to subtract certain amounts of institutional charges from the refund to the student. The Secretary wishes to clarify that these proposed regulations would permit an institution to subtract charges or portion of charges from a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund only if the charges are included in the calculation of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the statute, an institution may subtract any unpaid charges owed to the institution by the student. The Secretary is proposing to define unpaid charges by using the definition for an ``unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment'' published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32188). Although those final regulations discussed the unpaid amount of a scheduled cash payment as being excluded from the amount the institution may retain for institutional charges, rather than for the purpose of excluding any unpaid balance from the refund to the student, the Secretary believes it is appropriate to adopt the same definition to define these unpaid charges. In accordance with the current regulations, a student's scheduled cash payment would be defined as the amount of institutional charges that is not paid for by financial aid. An institution could count any late disbursements of Title IV aid as financial aid for this purpose (i.e., the amount of the late disbursement would not be included as part of the student's scheduled cash payment.) Any amount of the scheduled cash payment that has not been paid would be the amount of unpaid charges owed by the student. The treatment of unpaid charges for refunds other than  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  refunds is addressed later in this discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute also permits an institution to subtract a reasonable administrative fee from the refund owed to a student. This administrative fee must be a real charge and documented as such. An institution may not automatically subtract the lesser of five percent of the tuition, fees, room and board, and other charges assessed the student or one hundred dollars if no such administrative fee actually exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add to the list of permitted subtractions from the refund to a student any application fee charged by the institution. The Secretary believes that an application fee is a fee incurred separately from a student's charges for an enrollment period, and therefore, should not be included in the refund to the student.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for institutions whose students are issued meal credits that can be spent irregularly throughout the enrollment period (e.g., coupons or meal tokens) the Secretary proposes to allow an institution to deduct from the refund owed under this paragraph the portion of ``board'' charges (i.e., meal tickets) that has been expended by the student that exceeds the portion attributable to the period for which the student attended at the time of withdrawal. For example, if a student withdrew at the 50 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which the student has been charged but had used 60 percent of the meal tickets, the institution could subtract from the refund to the student the value of the meal tickets attributable to that 10 percent of the period of enrollment that the student did not attend. If a student used less than the attributable value of the meal tickets at the time of his or her withdrawal, an institution would not be permitted to subtract any amount from the refund to the student. An institution would not be permitted to subtract any amount from the refund to the student in cases where students have unlimited use of meal tickets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

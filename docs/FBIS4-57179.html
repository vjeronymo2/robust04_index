			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Basic Industry's Electric Union has  announced that the deficit in electricity will continue this  week and will be similar to what it has been to date, but with a  slight increase on 14 and 15 May because a unit from the Carlos  Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant in Cienfuegos will go  off-line.    The Electric Union also announced that the parts needed for  repairs to the thermoelectric plants in order to stabilize  generating capacity are continuing to enter the country.    At the present time, the maintenance program is progressing  well and the generating capacity is gradually being increased;  the average deficit is 25 percent lower than last April's.</p>

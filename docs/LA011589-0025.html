			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING THE TRUTH -- WHETHER DARK OR CHEERY;  </P> <P> THE GREATEST PLAYS DON'T TAKE A BENEVOLENT VIEW OF THE HUMAN CONDITION  </P> <P> A few weeks back I wrote a column wondering why no playwright had written an  optimistic modern Christmas fable, akin to director Frank Capra's "It's a  Wonderful Life." I have received an answer.  </P> <P> "Why should the Christmas season be any different than the rest of the year?"  writes Donna Lowre of North Hollywood. "Stories like 'Wonderful Life' aren't  being written or produced at any time.  </P> <P> "Too many plays are dark and dreary with a malevolent view of what life is all  about. Art is not news, Mr. Sullivan. It reflects the artist's value judgments.  In my opinion, it should show life the way it can be and should be. Not the way  it is at its dreariest level.  </P> <P> "If that isn't true, Mr. Sullivan, then why the popularity of 'It's a Wonderful  Life'? Why do you yearn for its type of story -- its benevolent view of the  world and of its heroes who overcome adversity and win?  </P> <P> "Maybe if reviewers did not praise plays that see man as immoral, or inept, or  irrational, or drugged out, or hopeless, with no control over his life -- but  as a rational, intelligent, moral being with a sense of values and a sense of  humor -- then maybe some changes may start."  </P> <P> I disagree with about 75% of this. I think that art is news -- information  about the human experience. ("News that stays news," as Ezra Pound said about  poetry.) This information can come from any level of experience that the artist  cares to deal with. I'm not calling for someone to write another "It's a  Wonderful Life" -- not if he doesn't see the world that way. I was wondering  why nobody had written one.  </P> <P> Still, Lowre's letter was a pleasure. First, because we in the stage department  don't often hear from readers on the big questions. Usually it's a complaint  about how rude the ushers are at Theater X.  </P> <P> Second, because it is important what kind of stories get acted in a particular  time. If each era has its climate of opinion, it also has its climate of  emotion. Plays contribute to this, either directly or in screen translations.  ("Talk Radio," "Torch Song Trilogy" and "Dangerous Liaisons," to name three  recent examples.) One wants the contribution to be useful.  </P> <P> Only . . . what is useful? What do we need to hear more of from the theater  right now? What do we need to hear less of? And who decides?  </P> <P> Reader Lowre says that we need to hear more about the human potential for good.  Yes, always. That's why Robert Harling's "Steel Magnolias" was so satisfying at  the Pasadena Playhouse last year -- despite all those one-liners. First Harling  showed a mother and her touchy daughter working out their lines of  communication, not without static. Then he showed how the mother's friends  shored her up when she lost her daughter.  </P> <P> Some critics thought it a sentimental show. I thought it an observant one.  Parents and their grown-up children have been known to come to terms. Friends  do come through in a crisis, sometimes. "Steel Magnolias" admired its people,  but there was a scene where the mother showed how furious she was at the  daughter for dying. There's always room for a play like that.  </P> <P> But do we need a generation of plays devoted to the message that friends always  come through? That people are invariably kind-hearted once you get to know  them? That for every problem there's a solution? That tomorrow will be better?  That, all in all, it's a wonderful life?  </P> <P> The Soviet theater had 50 years of such plays. Stalin and his successors forced  Soviet playwrights to write "positive" scripts on the premise that the  Revolution had purged people of their old selfish ways and created an  altruistic creature known as the New Soviet Man and Woman. Audiences put up  with the fiction. But for the truth about human nature -- the whole truth --  they went back to Chekhov and Shakespeare.  </P> <P> American radio and TV have also given us half a century of cheerful family  comedies where slight domestic misunderstandings are cured by everybody sitting  down at the table and talking it out. We have also had many a dramatic series  like "The Waltons," where hard work and family pride got John Boy and his folks  through the Depression.  </P> <P> That's fine for TV, which is meant to put people half to sleep, so that they'll  be susceptible to the commercials. But imagine a theater that was nothing but  sitcoms and "The Waltons."  </P> <P> We wouldn't trust it. We'd say: "But it doesn't always work that way. Family  pride can bring down a family. Hard work isn't enough if you're living in the  Dust Bowl. Talking-it-out can leave people more embittered than they were  before. Some people get worse the more you know them." We would also become  bored. It's difficult to find tension and texture in a play where little is at  risk. If the characters all mean well, where's your antagonist? If nothing can  seriously go wrong, where's the suspense?  </P> <P> The playwright doesn't have to deal with life "at its dreariest level." But I  think we do want him or her to deal with life as it is, even when he sets his  play in Never-Never Land or Oz, two worlds where defeat was possible. Unless we  recognize the moral landscape, what good is his parable to us?  </P> <P> We certainly recognize Hamlet's Denmark. In the original legend, a clever  prince kills his wicked uncle, reclaims his father's crown and marries his  sweetheart. This is life as it ought to be.  </P> <P> Shakespeare gives us a hero who isn't sure that he is doing the right thing, a  villain who says his prayers at night and a denouement that would be a comedy  of errors, except that the players are dying. This is life as it is. On the one  hand -- "What a piece of work is man." On the other hand, catastrophe.  </P> <P> Greek tragedy can be read the same way. It's curious that the plays that seem  to offer the fullest account of the human experience don't offer the  "benevolent view" that Lowre speaks of, but the tragic view. Rather than  celebrating life's terrific possibilities, they seem to be warning us not to  push our sense of those possibilities too far. That message too is always in  season.  </P> <P> But when Lowre talks about hopeless characters with no control over their  lives, she is probably not thinking about Oedipus or Lear. Perhaps she is  thinking of the two tramps in "Waiting for Godot," slogging through the ashes.  Or maybe she is thinking of the druggies in "Hurlyburly."  </P> <P> In fact, "Hurlyburly" offers some hope at the end that the hero has bottomed  out and is ready to clean up his act. And "Godot" suggests that while Godot may  not be keeping his appointment, the two tramps are keeping theirs.  </P> <P> But the critic isn't there to measure a play's hope-content. He is looking to  see whether the playwright has put a world on stage that squares with the  experience of its audience and enlarges it. If so, it's a good play, even when  its characters aren't behaving admirably. Maybe it's even a positive play, in  that it may catch the conscience of the viewer. That's why Hamlet put on his  little show at Elsinore.  </P></p>

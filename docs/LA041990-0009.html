			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIR SHOW OKD FOR VAN NUYS, WITH CONDITIONS  </P> <P> Los Angeles airport commissioners on Wednesday authorized an air show for Van  Nuys Airport this summer after imposing conditions aimed at satisfying  homeowner complaints about airplane noise and illegal automobile parking at two  previous shows.  </P> <P> The two-day free exposition, which last year drew 210,000 people, making it the  largest public event in the San Fernando Valley, will be Saturday and Sunday,  July 21-22.  </P> <P> It will be held at the Air National Guard site on Balboa Boulevard, south of  Roscoe Boulevard.  </P> <P> Airport staff officials say they have not yet secured commitments from  exhibitors but hope to have a B-1B and a B-52 bomber, F-16 fighters and other  front-line military craft, as well as historic military and civilian planes.  </P> <P> But because of conditions imposed Wednesday by the Board of Airport  Commissioners, none of the planes at Aviation Expo '90 will be permitted to  conduct flying exhibitions over the airport.  </P> <P> Also, exhibitors will be pressured to arrive during normal business hours the  day before the show and leave after 8 a.m. on Monday after the show, said  Charles Zeman, Van Nuys Airport manager. Airport officials have acknowledged  that they were peppered with complaints last year about noise from the flying  demonstrations and from exhibitors taking off from the airport early Monday.  </P> <P> Homeowner group leaders also accused airport officials of turning off the  system that automatically records telephoned noise complaints.  </P> <P> Zeman said the system was not turned off but was "overloaded, at least partly  because people were using the complaint line to find out about the show so they  could attend."  </P> <P> Commissioners also directed the staff to open remote parking lots and charter  buses to shuttle people to and from the show to lessen the glut of parking in  nearby residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Lee Kanon Alpert, chairman of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory Council,  endorsed the air show with the conditions attached by the commission, saying  the event was of "great benefit to the community."  </P> <P> Also, Don Schultz, president of Ban Airport Noise, a group that frequently  criticizes the airport as too noisy, said that with the commission's  conditions, "I think it's an event we can live with and support."  </P> <P> But Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, opposed the  commission's action, saying that "static air shows are far from quiet. They  draw thousands of visitors, increase auto traffic and create congestion for  miles around."  </P></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Mollemann calls for G7 summit on Gatt MR Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister, called on Friday for a summit of the Group of Seven (G7) rich industrial nations if long-running talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to liberalise world trade remained deadlocked. 'If necessary, we need in March or April a special summit of the G7 to overcome the standstill,' he told business and political leaders attending the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. In Geneva, a spokesman for Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, said Mr Dunkel would welcome such a meeting to bring long-running trade talks to a speedy close. The crucial talks have been snarled by a row between the United States and the European Community over agricultural reform. Mr Dunkel has set a mid-April deadline for a Uruguay Round agreement. Mr Peter Lilley, the British trade secretary, said it was too early to say whether or not a summit of the G7 heads of government was needed to bring about a resolution of the deadlocked Uruguay Round trade talks. 'We need a demonstration of leadership from G7 leaders and a reduction in special interests, especially on the agricultural issue.' Mr Mollemann said: 'We cannot leave it to negotiators of the second rank.' Mr Mollemann was supported by Mr Bill Bradley, a New Jersey senator known for his advocacy of free trade. Mr Lilley sparred briefly with an official of the French motor group Peugeot over allowing Japanese cars free entry into the European market. Mr Tristan d'Albis, an adviser to Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet, argued that it was difficult to worship the religion of free trade in the motor industry when Japan had built up its powerful companies behind a wall of protection. Mr Lilley replied that protectionism was not a significant factor in the success of the Japanese car makers.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Japan to advance halt in production of CFCs JAPAN is to halt all production and consumption of harmful ozone-depleting chemicals by the end of 1995, moving up its earlier target of 2000, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The move will bring Japan in line with the US and the European Community, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said. Japan decided to announce the new target now so that Japan, the US and Europe would speak with one voice at the United Nations-organised Earth Summit in Brazil in June. The Montreal Protocol calls for a total ban of CFCs and the other main ozone-destroying culprits - halons, carbon tetrachloride and 111-trichloroethane - by the year 2000.</p>

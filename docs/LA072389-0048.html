			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST STUFF  </P> <P> I have just come back from a long trip to New York City, England and France.  Thank goodness my office saved all the back issues of the Sunday Los Angeles  Times. I have just read and re-read Jerry Hulse's pieces on Bora Bora (May 14)  and Raiatea (May 21). They are some of the best stuff I have ever read and I  have saved them, not only to refer to for my readers but as a source of  inspiration. Thank you for your beautiful series.  </P> <P> WILLIAM TOMICKI  </P> <P> Publisher, Entree  </P></p>

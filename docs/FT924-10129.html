			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Letter: Real interest Sir, On April 9 last year you published a letter from me alerting you to the 'de-linking' by the clearing banks of loan rates from base rate which resulted in small businesses being asked to pay a real interest rate of 8.5 per cent over the then base rate of 12.5 per cent. The situation has hardly improved: my bank (Lloyds) now quotes a monthly rate for small businesses of 1.17 per cent (APR 14.98 per cent) plus an arrangement fee of 1 per cent per annum - a total of nearly 8 per cent over base rate. It may not be usury but perhaps it explains why many small businesses are reluctant to invest or are even going to the wall? J W Seabright, chairman, Teamband, Nettlebed, Henley-on-Thames</p>

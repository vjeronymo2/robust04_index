			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  has proposed that nearly 1,800 UN civilian observers should help  monitor the country's April election. In a written report to  the security council Butrus Ghali says the observers will form  the largest contingent of an international observer group of  2,840.    The group will also include 50 observers from the  Organization of African Unity, 322 from the European Union, 70  from the Commonwealth and about 600 from individual countries  and the diplomatic community. They will all be coordinated by  the UN. Butrus-Ghali says, however, the total of election  monitors is likely to exceed 5,000. This is counting observers  likely to be sent by foreign nongovernmental organizations. He  did not give the cost of the UN operation, but diplomats say it  is estimated at around $40 million.</p>

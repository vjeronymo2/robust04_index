			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: UK Bond Funds THE TABLE shows unit trusts investing primarily in gilts and the fixed interest securities of large companies. Some of the funds listed do not aim to provide income. Whittingdale's short-dated gilt fund aims for capital growth and has no yield. Murray Acumen Reserve, which is one of Murray Johnstone's funds, was so small five years ago that it was a cash fund, according to Ian Winship, its manager. Its performance was helped by the high interest rates prevailing in 1988/89 and from holding long-dated gilts. Murray Johnstone is one of a handful of fund managers to have cut initial charges on its unit trusts. The initial charge now stands at 1 per cent against an industry average of 5 per cent to 6 per cent, with an annual mangement charge of 0.25 per cent. The minimum investment is Pounds 500. Peter Geikie-Cobb, the manager of Mercury Asset Management's Government Securities fund, attributes some of the fund's strong performance to its overseas exposure. Unlike a pure gilt fund, it is able to get indexation against capital gains tax because it has a minimum of 12 per cent in overseas bond markets (and a maximum of 25 per cent). Overseas exposure also helped performance, says Geikie-Cobb, when sterling fell in value after it left the ERM. 'We've had a very good run in the bond markets but we are taking a more cautious stance now. We are expecting the market to fall but that will be a good buying opportunity.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10 HIGHEST PERFORMING UK BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                         Size       Yield (%)    Perf*                           (Pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Murray Acumen Reserve        6.0          7.0        74.4 Mercury Govt Secs            6.4          6.9        65.2 Whittingdale Shrt gilt      48.1            0        64.8 Barclays Unicorn gilt      168.3          7.9        64.7 MIMstar Gilt &amp; FI            2.8          7.6        64.2 Abtrust Fixed Interest      12.2          7.1        62.6 Abbey Gilt &amp;FI              12.0          5.5        61.4 Abbey Capital Reserve        3.9          4.7        60.7 ManuLife Gilt &amp; FI          34.6          6.8        60.1 GRE Gilt &amp; FI               16.8          5.0        59.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sector average              19.8          6.5        52.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal. * Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over 5 years to September 1.

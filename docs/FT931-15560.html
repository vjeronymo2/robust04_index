			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Restructuring of O&amp;Y debt begins CREDITORS of Olympia &amp; York have begun approving proposals which are likely to lead to a gradual dismemberment of what was once the world's biggest property developer. Three of O&amp;Y's 33 creditor groups set the process in motion yesterday morning, quickly passing debt restructuring plans for relatively minor properties in Toronto and Ottawa partially owned by O&amp;Y. Three meetings were adjourned to consider 'technical amendments'. At five meetings later in the day, four groups approved plans , while a fifth voted to adjourn until later this week. Another 22 meetings are scheduled over the rest of the week. The meetings are being held behind closed doors. The proposals being voted on this week involve about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 10.5bn) debt. They do not include the Canary Wharf project in London, which is in the hands of administrators, nor O&amp;Y's US properties. Negotiations are continuing separately with lenders to the US buildings, the only part of the O&amp;Y empire which remains outside bankruptcy protection. Under the proposals, creditors with loans secured by individual buildings will generally be free to seize their collateral. O&amp;Y has already handed over one Toronto building, the 45-storey Aetna Centre, to the mortgage holder. It is expected to lose control in coming months of several other properties, including First Canadian Place, its 72-storey flagship in the heart of the city's financial district. Most of the remaining Canadian assets of O&amp;Y Developments, the present holding company, will be transferred to a new management and leasing company, called O&amp;Y Properties. In a circular to creditors, O&amp;Y last month described O&amp;Y Properties as a 'viable, self-financing entity'. Although the Reichmann family will continue to be represented on the boards of directors of both companies, control will be in the hands of a court-appointed administrator. Loans secured by O&amp;Y's stakes in papermaker Abitibi-Price, energy producer Gulf Canada Resources and property developer Trizec, will be serviced out of available cash-flow from the pledged shares. These loans will be treated as unsecured to the extent of any deficiency in debt-service payments. Payments to unsecured creditors will ultimately depend on the course of the North American real estate market and on O&amp;Y's ability to re-establish itself. A five-person 'monitoring committee', nominated by the unsecured creditors, will be set up to safeguard their interests.</p>

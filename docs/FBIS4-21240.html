			<p>Face   More Charges   <F P=102> 94WD0295C Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in Danish 17 Mar 94  p 6 </F>  <F P=103> 94WD0295C </F> <F P=104>  Copenhagen BERLINGSKE TIDENDE </F> <F P=105>  Danish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anders Wiig: ``Two Prisoners Involved in New </F> Drug Case'']    [Text] The narcotics police have arrested two South  American drug smugglers who are serving long sentences in  Vridsloselille.    The narcotics police have arrested two South American drug  gangsters who are serving long prison sentences in the state  prison in Vridsloselille.    Yesterday Detective Inspector Anette Vester brought the two  prisoners before a judge at a closed preliminary examination in  Copenhagen, after which both men were placed in isolation cells  while the police investigate new charges against them.    They are now charged with involvement in the smuggling and  attempted smuggling of 500 grams of cocaine into Denmark while  they were serving their sentences here.    The smuggling of 200 grams failed because a courier was  arrested on 31 January of this year.    The two men's position on the new charges is not known. Both  have previously smuggled large quantities of cocaine into  Denmark and were sentenced by the Supreme Court.    The now 26-year-old Colombian, Norman Caicedo Espinosa, was  sentenced to six years in prison on 20 October for smuggling in  1.5 kilograms of drugs concealed in a skateboard.    The 46-year-old Bolivian, Bitmarck Figuerca Frey, is serving  eight years in prison. He smuggled 7.8 kg of cocaine, some in an  attache case with a false bottom and some taped to his body.    The jury did not believe his explanation that he thought it  was gold. And the public prosecutor also pointed out that a  quantity of gold corresponding to the cocaine that was found  would have weighed 150 kg.  <H5>  Charged in Big Cocaine Case </H5>   The two were charged in connection with the same group of  cases in which 13 other foreigners and Danes have been charged  with the smuggling and attempted smuggling of around 45 kg of  cocaine.    It is Denmark's biggest cocaine case and the alleged  ringleader, another Colombian, was arrested in January--also  while serving a sentence in Vridsloselille.    Incidentally, there appears to be some confusion or  uncertainty about Frey's and Espinosa's nationality, with Deputy  Commissioner Peer Ivar Petersen of the narcotics police  referring to them as a Spaniard and a Chilean prior to the court  session.</p>

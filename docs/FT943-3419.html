			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher's flight Kingfisher spent a long time convincing the City of the merits of its Every Day Low Pricing philosophy, only to find itself the victim of a backlash in sentiment when earnings failed to match the rhetoric. Reflecting that, the shares have dropped 37 per cent in the year to date, beaching them on a substantial discount to the price-earnings ratio of the market as a whole. At a time when the retail sector stands at a premium to the market, the question now is whether Kingfisher is ripe for a re-assessment. Although yesterday's interim profits were at the bottom end of scaled-back expectations, and like-for-like sales in the core UK businesses stagnated or fell, there were still some positive indications. Darty, the French electricals retailer bought last spring, performed better than some had feared when the deal was done - indeed without the contribution from this source, retail profits for the group would have been down sharply. B &amp; Q did well to improve profits in dire market conditions, and Superdrug showed a welcome, if small improvement in margins. It was also encouraging to hear the management lay new emphasis on the nuts and bolts nature of the challenges ahead - an acknowledgment that crude price cutting is not the panacea it was once portrayed to be. Given the weaknesses inherent in Kingfisher's mix of businesses, the points of light in yesterday's figures were hardly enough to swing sentiment immediately back into its favour. Had Kingfisher really wanted to reinforce the positive aspect of its message, it should have increased the interim dividend in line with its cautious optimism.</p>

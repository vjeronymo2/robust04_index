			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Brussels (DPA) -- Germany plans to ratify the  membership treaties of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway with  the European Union [EU] before the Bundestag elections in  October. This was stated by Ursula Seiler-Albring, state  minister in the Foreign Ministry in Bonn, in Brussels on Monday  [16 May]. During a break in the meeting of the EU foreign  ministers, the state minister stressed that Germany thus wants  to make sure that the four new members will be accepted as of 1  January 1995 in any case.

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Avoiding hazardous stocks in a bull market This far into a bull trend the general market risk may seem to be reassuringly low - there have been no substantial reversals for many months  -but we still suffer specific risk. That has been painfully obvious in the UK during the past few days as various companies including Fisons, Courtaulds Textiles and Trafalgar House have issued warnings or unveiled skeletons in the cupboard. There are echoes of the minefield characteristics of the US market a few months ago when blue chips ranging from IBM to Philip Morris appeared to be making a habit of badly upsetting expectations. In the UK really substantial sectors such as breweries, food retailing and pharmaceuticals are showing declines on the year even though the stock market as a whole is up nearly 20 per cent. Such sectors look rather dull, and the heavy volume of money coming into the market has been chasing more exciting prospects. Those have to be found (or invented) in the cyclical recovery sectors, several of which have produced sector index growth of more than 50 per cent in 1993 so far. The question is, however, whether investors are in touch with what is going on in the real world. In particular, don't they know that there is still a serious recession in continental Europe? Do they know that apparently unstable politicians are receiving millions of votes in Russia? During 1992 investors were selling property companies and gold mines, which were at the bottom of the sector league tables. In 1993 property and gold mines have been soaring back to prominence and are right at the top. The transformation does not make investors look very clever at anticipating events, but it does demonstrate the power of liquidity flows in relatively small stock market sectors. In a liquidity-driven bull market the weight of money will drive prices higher. As long as interest rates are falling, the stretching of the valuation basis can be justified by reference to historical ratios of the yields available on bonds and equities. But eventually bond yields will cease to decline; it may well be that the US long Treasury bond yield bottomed out two months ago at 5.8 per cent (although the UK government long-dated bond yield, now little more than 6.5 per cent, is still falling). The bull market in equities must then end unless improved corporate fundamentals can take up the running. There has to be a shift to an earnings-driven market. This can be tricky, because there are obvious contradictions. Bonds respond positively to weak inflation and low economic growth (unless growth is so weak that the stability of government financing is threatened). Companies, in sharp contrast, want an economic environment in which they can raise prices and achieve volume growth. But in the UK, manufacturers' output and prices have been stagnant since the summer. The implication is that although the bond bull market may continue to run, equity valuations are becoming more and more stretched. We can expect more shocks as companies try to bring investors into closer contact with reality. However, the apparent progress of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks towards a reasonably successful conclusion, in spite of the cultural and agricultural sensitivities of the French, has naturally helped the securities markets in the past few days. For all the fashionable comparisons of the 1990s with the 1930s, we shall not have to contend this time with self-destructive trade politics. But in the context of a sluggish world economy it may well be that the initial benefits of a new Gatt round will come in lower inflation rather than growth in output. Manufacturers in the advanced countries will be under still more competitive pressure from the industrialising nations, and the focus will be on sectors of special advantage such as, in the case of the US, the entertainment industry whose interests the Americans have been so carefully fostering. The investment implications could therefore be that there will be more good news for bonds in many western countries, but also more pressure on the valuation basis of equities and, most obvious of all, more specific risks.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, 21 May (SNARK)--Border incidents preventing  measures were discussed yesterday at the meeting of Armenian and  Nakhichevan delegations.    As SNARK was told today in the Armenian Defense Ministry,  Azerbaijan side has acknowledged that tension at the border is  sometimes caused by Nakhichevan combat units which thus try to  justify their unwillingness to fight in Karabakh. Nakhichevan  representatives also consider possible the provocations by  Peoples Front of Azerbaijan attempting to destabilize the  situation in Nakhichevan Republic.    Negotiating parties agreed to undertake adequate measures to  prevent the possible border incidents.    There were no serious incidents along the entire Armenian  border during the last day, informed the Defense Department.</p>

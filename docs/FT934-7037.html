			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Arts: Designs of a romantic hero - Architecture There is a famous still from a movie of Gary Cooper standing in full profile before a soaring skyscraper, looking firmly into the future. The Fountainhead was made in 1949 from the novel by Ayn Rand, which sold five million copies. Its hero was an architect, Howard Roark, a young genius who pits his wits and skills against the conventions of the New York establishment. Gary Cooper played the part to the hilt. The film, like much of Ayn Rand's work, extols rugged individualism, powerful egoism and all refusals to compromise. Her hero was probably based on the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who certainly saw the architect's role as that of the powerful, single-minded genius. Sir Norman Foster is an architect who shares with the hero of The Fountainhead that taciturn virility and confidence. His quiet conviction that his designs are rational and logical is impressive. He is also convinced that architecture is a product of individual genius and that compromises are to be avoided. A visit to his London office reveals that, while undoubtedly a top architect, he is also aware that posterity may see him as a creative romantic - a man who tried to change the world. In this year's Financial Times Architecture Award Sir Norman's office has two runners in the shortlist: the University Library at Cranfield; and Stansted Airport in Essex, which represent just a fraction of the work of this international practice. In the pipeline there are a quite remarkable number of major projects. The new Canary Wharf underground station will be the best reason for the expansion of the Jubilee line, and the Imperial War Museum exhibition hangar at Duxford will be a dazzling example of appropriate technology. Then there are three new international headquarters for major companies - Agiplan, Obunsha and Sanei; a new law library for the Cambridge Institute of Criminology as well as the new Napp laboratories for the same city; the new Commerzbank in Frankfurt; in Berlin the new Reichstag; in Nimes the Carre D'art; in Frejus the new Lycee; in Rotterdam the Marine Safety Simulator; in Neudorf the business promotion park; and in Corsica a timber-framed house for a private client. If the governor of Hong Kong can keep things on an even keel, Sir Norman's design for the large new airport at Chep Lap Kok will be one of the finest new airports in the world. In Valencia the design for the new conference centre is well underway, and in the City of London the new offices at Tower Place for Bowrings is currently in for planning consideration. Sir Norman has been unafraid to add to a listed building  - a house in Chelsea designed in the 1930s by Mendelsohn and Chermayeff - enhancing the original. In Omaha, Nebraska his firm is adding a wing to the Joslyn Art Museum; and the results are still awaited for the competition for a new gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow. The hero of The Fountainhead would have been amazed that one architect could change so much of the world. Foster's office gives some clues. Visitors enter and walk up a grand, gentle granite staircase and the office itself is a young architect's dream. Beneath a high glass wall with amazing views of the Thames are ranks of architects and technicians. Howard Roark would have enjoyed this elevated position: you feel as though the team below could well be drawing up designs for some great spaceship to take us all to the moon or beyond. For the best of Foster's work in the UK, go to Stansted Airport and then to the Sainsbury Centre at the University of East Anglia in Norwich. The extension to the Sainsbury Wing is a cool triumph. To enjoy Foster more intimately, the Royal Academy's Sackler Galleries show how well he can fit an older context. It will be fascinating to see how Foster does in the FT Award on November 29. Meanwhile, he should be appointed designer of the new Tate Gallery Museum of Modern Art, convert the Bankside Power Station into a home for very contemporary art (like the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, in warehouses converted by Frank Gehry), and build a gallery for modern art on the Vauxhall site.</p>

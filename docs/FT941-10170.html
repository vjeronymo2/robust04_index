			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Russia opens T-bill market Russia is to open its domestic Treasury bill market to foreign investors, allowing non-residents to take up to 10 per cent of the next bond issue on February 15, Reuter reports from Moscow. The finance ministry said it would put up Rbs100bn of three-month Treasury bills at this month's auction. Russia's tiny small Treasury bill market has been restricted to domestic players. Turnover, about Rbs2.2bn a day over the past week, has fallen sharply as investors moved their assets into hard currency because of doubts about government economic policies. This year the rouble has fallen 25 per cent against the dollar. Russian Treasury bills yield more than 230 per cent, up from about 185 per cent at the January auction. Western emerging market portfolio managers have begun looking at investment opportunities in Russia's new financial markets. Treasury bills offer one possibility. Foreign banks are interested in finance ministry bonds, issued last year to compensate domestic companies whose funds were frozen by the foreign trade bank of the former Soviet Union at the start of 1992.</p>

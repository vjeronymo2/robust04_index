			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Company News (This Week): Questions of survival may be on the agenda - United Biscuits With luck, United Biscuits' full year figures on Thursday will be bad. Otherwise they will be awful. The chief uncertainty is how much UB will write off in closures and restructuring at its struggling US subsidiary, Keebler. However, it seems clear that profits will be down not only in the US, but in UB's British heartland as well. The worse the figures, the more questions will be asked about UB's survival as an independent entity. While the food industry becomes steadily more global, UB risks going the other way. Even in 1992, the UK made up three quarters of its profit. At this rate, the company could end up more dependent on its home market than it was a decade ago. In a world increasingly dominated by monsters like Nestle and Unilever, this is not a sustainable strategy. In its defence, UB might point to its painstakingly assembled European business. This contributed one eighth of group turnover in 1992, which is arguably not enough. In global terms, there is a bigger strategic danger. The real growth in the food industry lies not in the developed world, but in the developing countries of Asia and South America. The giants like Nestle are investing there massively. UB cannot afford to do likewise. A best guess for pre-tax profit is around Pounds 170m, compared to Pounds 162m the year before. This allows only for exceptional events already announced: the closure of one US factory and the sale of the Ortiz business in Spain, more than offset by the profit on the sale of Terry's chocolate. In other words, underlying profits may be down for the second year running. Stated earnings may be down too, as a result of a higher tax charge, though with luck the dividend will be held. All that is on the basis of only Pounds 12m write-offs at Keebler. Much more than that, and the vultures could start circling.</p>

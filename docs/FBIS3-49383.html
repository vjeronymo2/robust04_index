President Michal Kovac raised the issue of a wider coalition  in his New Year's address, and opposition parties as well as  part of the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) supported the  idea.    The programme for the April 1993 SNS conference in  Ruzomberok, Central Slovakia, included the idea of a wider  coalition, SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak said today.    The 1994 budget vote, which took place in last December,  tested the coalition's strength, HZDS Deputy Hvezdon Koctuch  said.    The opposition aimed at the rejection of the budget, which  they had hoped would result in a vote of no confidence in the  government and Meciar, Koctuch said, adding that in this way the  opposition would achieve its alleged aim that some other  politician represent Slovakia as premier during the coming talks  between U.S. President Bill Clinton and representatives of the  Visegrad countries (Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary and  Poland).    Meciar is open to cooperation, said SNS Deputy Chairman  Jozef  Prokes, who had attended the meeting as a guest of honour.  Prokes is a member of the SNS parliamentary group, which  favours the HZDS-SNS coalition at all costs.    Cernak belongs to the SNS national democratic parliamentary  group lobbying for a wider coalition.</p>

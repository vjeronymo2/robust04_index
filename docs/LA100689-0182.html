			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> YOUNG &amp; RUBICAM AD AGENCY INDICTED IN JAMAICA BRIBE CASE  </P> <P> One of the country's largest advertising agencies was indicted today on charges  it paid nearly $1 million in bribes to obtain the Jamaican Tourist Board's ad  account in 1981, a federal prosecutor said.  </P> <P> A grand jury this morning returned the 43-page indictment against Young &amp;  Rubicam, three of its current or former executives and two former Jamaican  officials, said U.S. Atty. Stanley A. Twardy.  </P> <P> The grand jury has been investigating the relationship between the agency and  the Caribbean nation's tourism authority since 1986, Twardy said.  </P> <P> The New York-based agency, which developed the "Come back to Jamaica" ad  campaign, denied any impropriety.  </P> <P> "We are shocked and dismayed by this move. We believe these allegations are  based on speculation and innuendo and are without substance or merit," Young  &amp; Rubicam said in a 2 1/2-page statement today.  </P></p>

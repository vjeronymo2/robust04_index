			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETIRED RACE CAR DRIVER GINTHER IS DEAD AT AGE 59  </P> <P> Richie Ginther, a retired race car driver, died Wednesday in France, apparently  of a heart attack. He was 59.  </P> <P> Ginther was stricken while on vacation in Touzac, a village near Bordeaux.  </P> <P> After beginning his career in Southern California sports car racing in 1951,  Ginther eventually moved to the international Formula One circuit, where he  drove for Ferrari, BRM and Honda.  </P> <P> A mechanic for a Southern California Ferrari importer, Ginther got into Formula  One racing almost by accident. While visiting the Ferrari plant, he was asked  to test-drive a car because the driver who usually did it was ill. He was so  impressive that he later was asked to join the Ferrari team.  </P> <P> "He was on the Ferrari team at the same time I was and he did a tremendous job  of helping to develop the new Formula One cars," said Phil Hill, who became the  first American Formula One champion in 1961.  </P> <P> Ginther won his first and only Grand Prix race in 1965 at Mexico City. Driving  a Honda, he edged Dan Gurney. His highest finish in the season standings was  second in 1963.  </P> <P> A pint-sized man with a trademark grin, Ginther was seriously injured in 1966,  when he broke his collarbone, several ribs and cracked his pelvis when he  slammed into a tree in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Expected to be  sidelined for at least six weeks, Ginther was racing three weeks later.  </P> <P> He moved into Indy car racing in 1967 but retired later that year after failing  to qualify for the Indianapolis 500.  </P> <P> Ginther was also recognized as one of the top developmental mechanics in  racing. He helped develop the aerodynamic tail spoiler.  </P> <P> While testing a Ferrari, Ginther noticed that handling problems were caused by  aerodynamic lift. He solved the problem by adding a tail to spoil the air flow  across the rear of the car, reducing lift.  </P> <P> He formed Richie Ginther Racing after retiring, then, after selling the  business, toured the country in a motor home before building a house in  Rosarita Beach, Mexico.  </P> <P> Ginther told friends that the time he spent in the motor home was the most  freedom he'd ever had.  </P> <P> Born in Hollywood on Aug. 5, 1930, Ginther lived in Granada Hills before moving  to Mexico.  </P> <P> Ginther is survived by his wife, Cleo, and a son, Greg, from a previous  marriage. No funeral services are planned. A family spokesman asked that  donations be made to the World Wildlife Foundation.  </P></p>

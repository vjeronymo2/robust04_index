			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Hadleigh issues restated figures as finance chief quits Directors of Hadleigh Industries Group, the USM-quoted industrial holding company, yesterday published restated results for the six months to September 30. At the same time the company announced that Mr David Maddison, finance director, had 'resigned from the board and left the company with immediate effect'. Furthermore it warned that it would incur a loss for the year to March 31 1992. Hadleigh said that it had become aware that interim losses of Pounds 283,000, announced in January, were understated and felt that they should be restated to take account of further losses of Pounds 252,000. The new figures reduce the January-announced Pounds 227,000 operating profits to Pounds 49,000, giving pre-tax losses of Pounds 535,000, against Pounds 283,000 reported earlier. Losses per share rose to 4.9p, against 2.5p.</p>

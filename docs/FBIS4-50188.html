			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Li Zemin, Wan Xueyuan Emphasize at </F> the Second (Enlarged) Session of the Provincial Discipline  Inspection Commission: Party Committees and Governments at  Various Levels Should Earnestly Strengthen Leadership To Unfold  Unremittingly the Anticorruption Struggle"]    [Text] Addressing the second (enlarged) session of the  provincial Discipline Inspection Commission on 1 April,  provincial party committee Secretary Li Zemin emphasized: Party  committees and governments at various levels must take the  entire work of the party as a whole, proceed from the level  where we can strengthen the flesh-blood party-people ties and  consolidate the party's ruling status in fulfilling its  important historic mission of promoting reform, opening up, and  the socialist modernization drive; and unremittingly carry on  with the anticorruption struggle with periodic results by  further unifying thinking and understanding, summing up  experiences, keeping a sober mind, and enhancing a sense of  responsibility and urgency.    Li Zemin said: Starting last year, particularly after the  second plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, Zhejiang has been active in launching the  anticorruption drive and building the party work style and clean  government in accordance with the central commission's  arrangements and demands. With importance being attached by  party committees and governments at various levels, with large  amount of arduous work being carried out by discipline  inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs; with active  participation from the vast number of cadres and the masses, and  with common efforts by all concerned, we have been able to  achieve certain results in our threefold anticorruption mission.  Honesty and self-discipline awareness among leading cadres has  been enhanced through self-screening against the "five  stipulations." New headway was made in probing important cases  following the stepping up of case investigations, marked results  were achieved by the special units in rectifying unhealthy  practices, and certain negative corrupt phenomena bitterly hated  by the masses were checked to varying degrees. However, we must  be sober enough to note that the anticorruption struggle has not  been developing in a well- balanced manner and that the results  achieved thus far have yet to be consolidated. Due to social,  historical, economic, and ideological backgrounds, eliminating  soils and conditions that breed negatives and decadence will not  be possible within a substantially long period, particularly at  the present time when the old systems are being replaced with  the new ones amid inadequate laws and regulations. Because the  anticorruption struggle is a long-term mission in the process of  reform and opening up, it must be carried on unremittingly.    Li Zemin pointed out: The success of this year's  anticorruption tasks will depend in a crucial way on their  actual implementation by party committees, governments, and  leading cadres at various levels with enhanced understanding and  greater determination. Strengthening the anticorruption struggle  is not only an internal demand in line with the party's basic  line and in implementing the entire party work set by the  central authorities this year, an important political guarantee  in deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and  promoting development, but it is also an important condition in  maintaining political, social, and economic stability. Leaders  at various levels must enhance their understanding of the  anticorruption struggle, correctly master the dialectical  relations of "fostering both material progress and cultural and  ideological progress," and strengthen the sense of  responsibility and urgency by overcoming such sentiments as  slackness, fear of difficulty, weariness, and the anxiety about  lagging behind when a comparison is made. The fight against  corruption should be conducted in an in-depth, sustained, and  solid manner. Tasks that were not completed last year as  scheduled should be followed up while unsatisfactorily completed  items need further remedial action. The "five new stipulations"  put forward by the central authorities this year must be firmly  implemented one by one in consideration of Zhejiang's reality.  Besides, all localities and departments should seriously  rectify relatively prominent negative corrupt phenomena commonly  noted by the masses. We should intensify investigations to  thoroughly find out what is actually going on, conscientiously  study the limits of various policies before offering concrete  opinions, and form special units to solve problems one after  another. Both permanent solutions and temporary relief measures  are required in fighting corruption. While curbing unhealthy  tendencies and tightening up discipline, we should strengthen  members' and cadres' immunity against decadent thinking by  giving them more education on ideals and objectives and by  enhancing their concept of party spirit. We should identify the  key aspects and weak links of a system which are corruption  prone and have them perfected and well managed. Organizations,  the masses, public opinion, and democratic parties should  intensify their supervisory roles, help improve laws and  regulations, and thus gradually bring about a sound supervisory  system.    Li Zemin stressed: Party committees at all levels must  regard it as their bounden duty to effectively strengthen  leadership over the anticorruption struggle; they must never  regard it as a job of the discipline inspection and supervisory  organs. First, they should make the anticorruption struggle an  important item on their agenda, frequently analyze the state of  the struggle, make suggestions and arrangements for  anticorruption work for a period of time, and promptly study  major problems in this work. The principal party and government  leaders should personally attend to major cases in order to  eliminate interference. They should insist on a thorough  investigation and never be indulgent toward wrongdoing. Second,  it is necessary to strengthen supervision, study the situation,  promptly discover and solve problems, and sum up and spread  experiences so as to use them to guide the anticorruption drive  as a whole. Third, efforts should be made to improve the  responsibility system by which leading cadres are responsible  for promoting party work style and honesty. Leading organs of a  higher level should oversee the work of those of a lower level,  and leading organs of a lower level should be responsible to  those of a higher level. The fight against corruption, the  improvement of party work style, and the building of a clean  government should be made important criteria for evaluating the  performance of a locality and cadres. These criteria should  also be integrated with the training, education, and appointment  of cadres. Fourth, we should continue to uphold the system of  holding joint anticorruption meetings and support  law-enforcement departments, such as discipline inspection,  supervisory, and procuratorial organs, to exercise their  functions. These organs should improve their effectiveness  through coordination. Fifth, we should show concern for the  training of discipline inspection and supervisory personnel. We  should create good conditions for the allocation, exchange, and  training of cadres. We should protect discipline inspection and  supervisory cadres who uphold principles and carry out their  functions boldly. Whenever cases of retaliation against  discipline inspection and supervisory cadres are discovered,  they must be investigated and handled strictly. We should do  our best to help discipline inspection and supervisory cadres  solve problems relating to work and living conditions.    Wan Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of Zhejiang, also spoke at the meeting.  He said: Governments at all levels should keep the overall  situation of this year's work in mind, adhere to the principle  of "grasping two links," make overall plans and take all factors  into consideration, and integrate the anticorruption struggle  with deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world,  expanding development, and maintaining stability. First,  leading cadres should set an example in being honest and in  doing their jobs industriously. They should be honest and  discipline themselves according to the two "five-point  regulations." At the same time, they should pay attention to  the anticorruption struggle in their localities and departments.  The principal leaders should assume personal command over the  struggle and personally solve major problems. In the future,  when leading cadres are evaluated, they will be checked to see  whether they perform their duties industriously and whether the  units under their leadership are honest and clean. Second, we  should solid work. We should attend to economic work and  opening to the outside world in a down-to-earth banner.  Likewise, we should do solid work when we strive to build a  clean government and combat corruption. Third, we should  support discipline inspection and supervisory organs to carry  out their functions in order to concentrate strength in  combating corruption. The leading cadres of governments and  departments at all levels must attach importance to and show  concern for discipline inspection and supervisory cadres, trust  them politically, support them in their work, and help them with  their living conditions. In this way, discipline inspection and  supervisory cadres will work without worries and will be devoted  to their duties. Wan Xueyuan stressed: Economic and  administrative departments need the support of discipline  inspection and supervisory departments, and the discipline  inspection and supervisory departments also need the support of  economic and administrative departments. Therefore, they should  support one another and closely coordinate with one another to  make greater contributions to the efforts of deepening reform,  opening Zhejiang wider to the outside world, bringing about the  sustained, rapid, and sound development of its economy, and  promoting a good party work style and honesty.    The second plenary session (enlarged) of the provincial  discipline inspection commission ended on 1 April. At the  session, 18 units introduced their experiences in combating  corruption and promoting the improvement of party work style and  honesty. The session examined and adopted the work report given  by Wang Qichao on behalf of the provincial discipline inspection  commission's standing committee.</p>

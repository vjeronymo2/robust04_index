Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, said he could  understand the anger felt by Honda, which owns 20 percent of  Rover, but he urged other Japanese investors in Britain not to  take fright.    "I would like to reassure any Japanese investors that as far  as this country is concerned we will continue to welcome  Japanese investment." Britain, he added, would continue to  provide "the most business-friendly environment in Europe" for  Japanese firms.    The UK accounts for about 40 percent of all Japanese  investment into Europe and is the location for transplant  factories set up by Japan's three leading car manufacturers,  Toyota, Nissan and Honda.    Mr Sainsbury said the Department of Trade and Industry had  maintained close links with Honda and Michael Heseltine,  President of the Board of Trade, had talked to the company in  Tokyo only two weeks ago.    Commenting on the sale of Rover to BMW, which has put in  jeopardy a partnership with Honda stretching back 15 years, Mr  Sainsbury said: "Their partner has gone off with somebody else  and I can understand their reaction.    "Honda are going to have to make their decisions on the  future of their arrangements. I hope that they will recognise  when they talk to BMW that this is a mutually beneficial  arrangement."    The BMW chairman is expected to fly to Tokyo next week to  meet Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president of Honda, in an effort to  assuage Japanese anger over the Rover deal.    It emerged yesterday that BMW executives had tried to see  Honda in Japan last week but had been unable to do so. They  have also offered to see them any time this week.    In a letter to Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of  Trade, BMW says that it would like to build on the link with  Honda, which owns 20 percent of Rover's car business, both in  terms of current and planned projects.    Speaking at a presentation by Nissan, which last year  overtook Rover as Britain's top car exporter, Mr Sainsbury said:  "This is itself a message not only for Japanese investors but  for the whole of the car industry." He said the Rover-BMW deal  was "likely to strengthen Rover and give them access to new  markets for exports."    Mr Sainsbury added that the DTI [Department of Trade and  Industry] had maintained close contact with Honda and would  continue to do so. "We share the wish expressed by BMW that the  relationship between Rover and Honda will continue," he said.    The Prime Minister was involved in angry exchanges in the  Commons yesterday after the Labour leader, John Smith, asked  him: "Is it now the Government's definition of success for a  British company that it is taken over by a foreign competitor?"    Mr Major accused the Opposition leader of living in the  1960's and urged him to "catch up with the modern world." He  said: "The prospects for Rover in the future are excellent. The  new arrangements will provide new export markets for Rover and  more investment."    On BBC Radio 4, Mr Heseltine called for an end to the  "moaning" and described the takeover as a "massive vote of  confidence" in the British economy.    He said: "The chance here now for Britain, one of the most  competitive economies in Europe today, is the opportunity to  build on this investment, to see larger numbers of Rovers sold  across the world, to see British component manufacturers saying  to the Germans: `First of all you have put your money into  buying this company, why don't you now give us a chance to  supply German cars in Germany with British components?'"    In its letter to Mr Heseltine BMW says the merger could  "unlock enormous potential benefit for both enterprises."  Referring to Rover's market niche and distinctive range, it  adds: "We want to protect that asset and therefore intend to  maintain BMW and Rover as separate enterprises, each with their  own manufacturing plants and their own design and development  capabilities."</p>

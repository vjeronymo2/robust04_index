			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan posted a record  surplus in its merchandise trade in 1993 for the second straight  year, but monthly figures underscored the recent downward trend,  the Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report Friday [21  January].    The customs-cleared trade surplus in 1993 came to 120.40  billion dollars, up 12.9 percent from a year before, with the  December surplus expanding 15.5 percent to 12.93 billion dollars  after falling 2.2 percent in November to stop a consecutive  year-on-year gaining streak of 34 months.    Briefing reporters, a ministry official said that monthly  movements over the past year showed "substantial stability,"  especially in "the August-November period as the yen's  appreciation started to undermine exports in terms of volume."    Exports in 1993 rose 6.3 percent to 360.98 billion dollars  while imports gained 3.2 percent to 240.58 billion dollars.    In volume, exports fell 0.5 percent to post the first fall  in  seven years, while imports gained 4.4 percent for the first rise  in two years.    The dollar averaged 111.39 yen in 1993, down 13.7 percent  from the previous year's 126.64 yen.    The yen's appreciation since last January started to slow  the  surplus growth from August and the first contraction in 35  months was posted in November.    Looking ahead, the official said the politically sensitive  surplus is on the decline, but did not offer a clear outlook,  saying "It depends on crude oil prices, exchange rates and  economies at home and abroad."    Crude oil prices averaged 17.65 dollars per barrel, down 8.8  percent from 19.36 dollars.    Many economists agreed that Japan's surplus has peaked, but  said a sharp decline ahead is unlikely with the weak domestic  economy undermining imports.    On a country basis, Japan registered a third straight rise  in  its trade surplus with the United States in 1993, gaining 15.2  percent to 50.19 billion dollars, the third largest amount.    The surplus with the European Union fell for the first time  in three years to 26.32 billion dollars, down 15.6 percent, and  that with Asian nations topped that with the United States for  the first time at 53.59 billion dollars, up 28.8 percent for the  fourth rise in a row.    In the latest reporting month, exports rose 6.1 percent from  year-earlier levels to 32.74 billion dollars, and imports inched  up 0.7 percent to 19.80 billion dollars.    In volume, exports fell 2.4 percent for the fifth  consecutive  decline, and imports rose 4.6 percent for the 10th straight gain.    The official attributed the rise in December trade surplus  to  large exports of ships and to the sharply lower import value of  crude oil and oil products due to a decline in crude oil prices  that averaged 16.22 dollars, down 16.8 percent from 19.42  dollars.    For both 1993 and December, sharp rises in exports were  posted for microchips and chips, and steep declines in  automobiles and audiovisual equipment.    Imports of crude oil and products posted notable decreases,  and those of microchips gained sharply.    The ministry official pointed to the sharply lower export  volume of automobiles -- Japan's key export item -- which fell  22.3 percent to 392,000 vehicles in December.    On a country and area basis in the latest reporting month,  Japan posted a trade surplus of 5.36 billion dollars with the  United States, up 17.3 percent for the 21st rise in a row; 2.22  billion dollars with the EU, up 9.7 percent; and 5.90 billion  dollars with Asian nations, up 9.8 percent.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOT RIPE FOR THE TAKING;  </P> <P> REBUILDING CAL LUTHERAN MUST RELY -- FOR NOW -- ON ITS DEFENSE  </P> <P> For Cal Lutheran the best offense might be a good defense.  </P> <P> New Cal Lutheran Coach Joe Harper has inherited a football squad with a defense  that has remained somewhat intact since last season and an offense that has  sustained heavy losses.  </P> <P> Only four starters return on offense, and everyone who carried the ball, except  perhaps a manager or two, has departed.  </P> <P> In one area, though, Cal Lutheran (3-6 in '89) has achieved addition by  subtraction, dropping Cal State Northridge -- which had won the past seven  games between the schools -- from the schedule. The Kingsmen have added  Division III teams Whittier and Claremont-Mudd and Division II San Francisco  State.  </P> <P> Despite the tenderized schedule, Harper describes himself as "very  apprehensive" entering the season.  </P> <P> At least in the early going, the defense will have to hold the fort for a team  that will be considerably less offensive than an Andrew Dice Clay joke.  </P> <P> "I expect (the defense) to do well while we're getting our act together,"  senior tight end and co-captain Dave Deisinger said.  </P> <P> At Cal Lutheran, a California condor would be easier to find than an  experienced offensive back.  </P> <P> Leading rusher Craig Ashley, who ripped Cal State Northridge for 151 yards and  three touchdowns as a freshman last season, has dropped off the team, and  Harper is looking to freshman Brian Kane (5-foot-10, 170) to contribute.  </P> <P> Kane, a transfer from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and a former Oak Park High star,  spent the spring with the Kingsmen track team but has four years of football  eligibility remaining.  </P> <P> Quarterback is more than a question mark; it's an interrogation.  </P> <P> The four quarterbacks from last season, all underclassmen, have left the team.  The leading returning passer is linebacker Cary Caulfield, who completed one  pass for seven yards.  </P> <P> Freshmen Feliciano Ramirez (5-11, 175) and Javier Ramirez (5-9, 185), are  expected to compete for the quarterback position, and Harper plans to ease  their development by keeping the offense basic.  </P> <P> "We've got to kind of go at the pace that they can assimilate the material,"  Harper said.  </P> <P> The receiving corps is probably Cal Lutheran's strongest offensive unit.  Deisinger (6-6, 235) is a two-year starter who caught 18 passes last season.  </P> <P> Junior wideout Tom Leogrande (6-0, 163), a big-play receiver, caught 11 passes  (24.7-yard average), three for touchdowns. Sophomore Len Bradley (5-11, 175)  caught three passes and also punted, averaging 38.7 yards a kick.  </P> <P> Returning starters Mike Pezonella, a 5-10, 260-pound junior guard, and John  Milam, a 5-11, 255-pound senior tackle, lead an offensive line that lost four  players who started frequently last season. Senior co-captain Dana Zupke (5-11,  195) will shore up the line after moving from defensive line to center.  </P> <P> Personnel will dictate the offense, but the playbook likely will include more  play-action passes and shorter routes than it did last season.  </P> <P> "I'm sure things will click," Deisinger said. "It's going to be new for  everybody so it doesn't matter that we don't have a lot of returnees."  </P> <P> The defense has more continuity than the offense. Kyle Tarpenning returns as  defensive coordinator and welcomes back several players who played extensively.  </P> <P> The basic 3-4 system reportedly will stay the same, but emphasis will be placed  on pressuring the opposing quarterback.  </P> <P> The defense's primary strength is the secondary, with three veteran starters.  The linebacker corps also boasts a few good men.  </P> <P> Junior inside linebacker Caulfield (6-0, 236) and senior safety Nicko Rising  (6-1, 190) hit like they're wearing lead shoulder pads. Caulfield and Rising  had 84 and 59 tackles, respectively.  </P> <P> Defensive back Kevin Evans, a 6-0, 195-pound junior, returns as the  second-leading tackler from a year ago with 67, including eight for losses, and  he also had two interceptions. Senior Mark Staley (5-9, 183) started at  cornerback last year, and junior defensive back Mike Sylvester (6-0, 180) has  caught Harper's eye in game films.  </P> <P> Sophomore Chris Sestito (6-1, 200) played extensively at linebacker last  season, and Eric Bowman (6-4, 210) returns to the defensive line after an  injury-plagued junior season. Harper said defensive lineman Ron Matthews (6-2,  255) has been a pleasant surprise.  </P> <P> Kicker Greg Maw has graduated and Harper said he has not recruited a  replacement.  </P> <P> For the first time in school history, Bob Shoup will not lead the Kingsmen into  their opener. His replacement, Harper, has won 117 games in 18 years as a  college head coach.  </P></p>

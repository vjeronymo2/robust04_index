			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bad debt provisions push Bikuben into the red BIKUBEN, the first of the large Danish banks to publish its 1991 results, suffered a DKr2m (Dollars 317,000) pre-tax loss last year after increasing bad loan provisions from DKr920m to DKr1.38bn. In 1990 the bank recorded a pre-tax profit of Dkr80m. The bank said at the half year that it expected second-half provisions to decrease. However, the continuing recession in Denmark, as well as in several of its most important trading partners, had affected both business and personal customers, said Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, the group's chief executive. Bikuben raised DKr500m through a new share issue in November. The bank then forecast that 1991 results would be very close to break-even. Despite the small loss last year, the bank's capital adequacy ratio was 11.4 per cent, compared with the legal minimum ratio of 10 per cent. Unibank, Denmark's second largest bank, is streamlining its management structure and giving the group management a tighter grip on credit decisions, which have been the responsibility of the bank's four divisions. The move by the bank, which publishes its 1991 results today, is seen as a recognition of the problems it has faced since it was formed in 1990 by the merger of Privatbanken, SDS and Andelsbanken. The first sign came with the 1991 half-year results which showed a pre-tax profit of DKr728m, compared with DKr1.5bn for its rival, Den Danske Bank. Since then the equity market has marked down Unibank. Shares of Unidanmark, the holding company, have recently traded at around DKr210. The decision last week by Moody's, the US rating agency, to place Unibank's long-term debt rating under review was another blow. Moody's expressed concern at the quality of the bank's assets.</p>

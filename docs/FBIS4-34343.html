			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manolo Rodriguez Salas from Pinar del Rio for the </F> "NTV newscast"]    [Text] In a dignified salute to 14 June, the date when two  of the greatest men in our history were born, Antonio Maceo and  Ernesto Che Guevara, the citizens of Pinar del Rio have obtained  the first 100 grams of gold at the plant in Castellanos, Minas  de Matahambre Municipality. The investment had been planned  barely two years and four months ago.    Hundreds of workers, mostly members of the Celso Maraotolara  Brigade, as well as engineers, project managers, and technicians  from the Ministry of Basic Industry gave additional proof of our  people's intelligence and capacity when they got the plant  operating without foreign consultation. Also, this is a  one-of-a-kind project in the country. The new plant is capable  of delivering up to 500 kg of gold per year for seven or eight  years; it is considered the most feasible of all the  gold-producing plants in Cuba.    The sulphur plant was also reopened. This year, it has a  pledge to deliver 32,000 tons of sulphuric acid, which is an  essential product for the nickel industry.</p>

Narisimha Rao, arrived in Bonn for a  four-day visit to Germany and for talks on expanding relations.  Rao is returning a visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited  India last February and thus introduced a new stage of Germany's  policy toward Asia.    A few hours after his arrival Rao, who will meet with Kohl,  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of  Germany), as well as high-ranking representatives of German  industry and the leaders of the coalition parties this Thursday,  had an appointment with Development Aid Minister Carl-Dieter  Spranger (Christian Social Union). The minister will go to  India on 10 February to take a look at the projects of  German-Indian cooperation in situ. On Wednesday, the Fraunhofer  Society for the Promotion of Applied Research and the "Council  of Scientific and Industrial Research" signed an agreement on  cooperation in the fields of, among others, microelectronics and  environmental research.    Deepening political and economic cooperation between India,  which has 900 million inhabitants, and Germany will be the focus  of all of Rao's meetings in Bonn and Berlin. On Friday  President Richard von Weizsaecker will receive Rao in Bellevue  Palace in Berlin. [passage omitted]</p>

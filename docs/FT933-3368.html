			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Foster's moves back into the black at six months FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian brewing group with substantial operations in the UK and Canada, yesterday returned to the black with a ADollars 310m (USDollars 201m) profit after tax and abnormal items for the year ended June. The figure compares with a ADollars 950.8m loss in the previous year, a result that was largely due to asset write-offs and other one-off charges. At the operating profit level, before both tax and abnormal items, Foster's reported a profit of ADollars 279.5m for the year just ended, up by 5.7 per cent on last time's ADollars 264.4m. Nevertheless, Foster's - which saw a management shake-up earlier this year and in which Broken Hill Proprietary acquired a sizeable minority stake last year - said that it was pleased with the results 'in the light of subdued economic conditions and continuing declines in beer industry volumes in Australia, the UK and Canada'. Profit from the core brewing operations actually fell over the year, by about ADollars 28m to ADollars 527m. Carlton and United Breweries posted an 11 per cent increase in operating earnings at ADollars 211m, with gains in both volume and market share. However, the Courage interests in the UK saw operating earnings fall to ADollars 208 from ADollars 244m - although the fall was largely explained by a resumption of contributions to the Courage Pension Funds, absorbing ADollars 35m. Inntrepreneur Estates was described as 'trading satisfactorily' with reduced losses. Meanwhile, the profit contribution from Canada's Molson Breweries declined to ADollars 107m from ADollars 120m - although Foster's blamed much of the shortfall on the one-time cost of retaliatory duties on products exported to the US and a reduced contribution in the final three months following the sale of a 10 per cent interest in Molson to Philip Morris's Miller Brewing division. Interest expense was significantly reduced to ADollars 206m, compared with ADollars 249.7m last time, due to the equity raising last year and a spate of non-core asset sales. Foster's said that these produced cash inflows of ADollars 648m, ahead of budget, and that the disposal programme would continue for the next two to four years. The bottom-line profits figure was also aided by a ADollars 46m surplus on abnormal items, stemming mainly from the profit on the sale of the Molson shares. Looking ahead, Foster's said it was not anticipating any significant short-term improvement in beer industry volumes in the group's main markets but it would continue to focus on non-core asset sales, debt reduction and pushing down costs.</p>

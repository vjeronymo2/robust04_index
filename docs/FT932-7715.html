			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News in Brief: Olympic Airways privatisation stalled THE Greek government has abandoned plans to privatise Olympic Airways quickly and now aims to restructure the state carrier, Reuter reports from Athens. 'Let's leave out for the time the word privatisation. This is not the objective. The objective is to have a viable company which will not depend on government subsidies,' Olympic's recently appointed president, Mr Emmanuel Fthenakis, said. '(This) objective cannot be reached by going out and selling shares. I won't do that,' he said. The government decided in 1991 to sell 49 per cent of Olympic and give management rights to the strategic investor. Officials had said privatisation was going ahead, but investors showed little interest because of Olympic's dollars 1.3bn debt. 'The short-term policy now is to keep Olympic from closing down. The middle-term policy is to restructure it by writing off its debt and in the long run the company could still be partly privatised,' a senior government official involved in the sell-off said in an interview. 'But this (privatisation) will not take place before the next elections,' he added.</p>

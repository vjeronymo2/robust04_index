The SNARK agency  learned this from the Karabakh army press service. According to  this report, Azerbaijani soldiers were also affected, because  bombs of this type have a considerable effect over a wide area.    It has also been reported that Karabakh's antiaircraft  defense troops have prevented Azeri aircraft from delivering an  air strike on Stepanakert. The information department of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has interpreted this increased  activity on the part of Baku as an attempt to put pressure on  the Karabakh side during the consultations on the Karabakh issue  currently under way in Moscow.</p>

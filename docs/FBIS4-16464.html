			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Yelmakov] </F>   [Text] Novosibirsk April 18 TASS -- Deputy Prime Minister  Sergey Shakhray supported state regulation and protectionism in  the regional policy, when he was speaking today at a scientific  and practical conference in Novosibirsk. The purpose of the  conference is to work out a strategy of stabilising the economic  situation in the region.    The diversity of regions and the multinational character of  the Russian state are not the source of its weakness, but, on  the contrary, a factor of its potential might. At the same  time, he pointed to the growing disproportion among regions and  a trend towards economic disintegration. According to Shakhray,  some regions are stepping up economic transformations, others  are preserving old methods and approaches to the economic  development. There is not a single region in Russia without  problems today, he said.    Shakhray described as rather ineffective the market-oriented  mechanisms of eliminating disproportions in the development of  the regions. This is why, he continued, a tougher regional  policy is needed, whose main task will be to bring to naught the  contrasts between living standards of the population of various  regions.    The conference is being attended by representatives of 25  regions of Russia, of the Federation Council, the State Duma,  many ministries and organisations, as well as by scientists.</p>

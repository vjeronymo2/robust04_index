			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Kurds fear Saddam's ire: Level of allied protection seems unclear AS TENSION between Iraq and the west rises again, fears that Baghdad will attack the Kurds in retaliation for last month's western air strikes have compounded the daily anxieties of the 3m people of the Kurdish enclave of northern Iraq. Left in limbo for two years, the enclave can do little to help itself, either by attracting investment to rebuild its shattered infrastructure or by tapping oil reserves. President Saddam Hussein is a man of surprises. His strategy has been to wait. Economic hardship will, he believes, compel the Kurdish leadership to resume autonomy negotiations broken off in 1991. The Kurds are in a weak position. Kurdish leaders have no clear idea what allied protection they might get. 'We are getting confusing signals,' a senior Kurdish official said. All of Iraq is covered by United Nations Security Council resolution 688 which demands that Mr Saddam's regime ends internal repression. Specific additional safeguards for the Kurds date from 1991, when 15,000 allied troops entered northern Iraq to enforce the world's first 'safe haven.' This uncertain departure in international procedures persuaded over 1m Kurds to return. The safe haven near the Turkish border which Iraqi troops were forbidden to enter is now in effect defunct: only 18 allied soldiers - based in Zakho - remain. The wider 'no-fly zone', Iraqi aircraft north of the 36th parallel, is still in force. But the political geography of northern Iraq is more complex still. The Kurdish-held zone, from which Mr Saddam withdrew all administration in October 1991, is divided from the rest of Iraq by an informal 'green line.' While part of the no-fly zone is in government hands, a substantial part of the Kurdish-held zone, including the city of Sulaymaniyah, is outside the no-fly zone and so beyond any area of formal western commitment. No-one doubts the ability of Iraqi forces to subdue the Kurds. A recent US congressional report said Iraq had rebuilt 80 per cent of its military manufacturing capacity and returned to service 2,500 tanks and 250 aircraft. The Kurds do not expect support from allied ground troops. 'If the Iraqis launch a major offensive, the allies will intervene,' Mr Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurdish spokesman, said in Washington earlier this month. 'But it would be from the air.' Uncertainty over security hampers rebuilding of the Kurdish infrastructure. The Kurdish-held zone, like the rest of Iraq, is subject to UN sanctions. 'Electricity, telecommunications, and roads are all in ruin,' Mr Latif Rashid, another Kurdish representative, told aid workers in London recently. 'Local factories have ceased to function.' Early reports say this year's harvest is good, but much will find its way to Baghdad. 'The Iraqis have raised the price paid for the crops and farmers are desperate to get money,' said Mr Zebari. The Kurdish leadership seeks acceptance abroad, but recent regional developments are unfavourable. Both Iran and Turkey, neighbouring countries with 5m and 10m Kurds respectively, have denounced the Iraqi Kurds' plan for a federal Iraq. Relations between Iraqi Kurds and Iran deteriorated recently as Tehran became increasingly concerned at Kurdish unrest within its own borders, fostered, it believes, by Iraqi Kurdish TV stations. Since March Iranian jets and artillery have bombed guerrilla bases operated by the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran inside Iraq. The ending in June by the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) of its two-month ceasefire with the Turkish army alarms Iraqi Kurds, whose most important trade lifeline is threatened by resumption of hostilities in south-east Turkey. The alternative is re-opening autonomy talks with Baghdad. Mr Mukarram Talabani, a former Iraqi government minister, operates as a go-between and reportedly made a recent visit to the Kurdish leadership. But the further their economic situation deteriorates, the weaker will be the Kurds' negotiating position.</p>

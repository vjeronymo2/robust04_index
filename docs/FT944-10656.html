			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Finland (11): Specialist shuns subsidies / Profile of Masa-Yards There was a moment in early 1993 when Mr Martin Saarikangas, president of Masa-Yards, took on the status of national hero. It was the day that Masa clinched a Dollars 1bn contract to build four sophisticated liquefied natural gas carriers for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation, beating off intense competition from Japanese and European yards. Hailed as Finland's biggest ever export order, its importance to the country at the time could hardly have been greater, with the economy stuck deep in recession and other industry stalwarts, such as the forestry companies and Nokia, apparently still not on the path to recovery. The stock market celebrated and tabloid newspapers suggested Mr Saarikangas should run for the presidency. The achievement was all the more remarkable because only a few years earlier the yard had almost gone out of business with the bankruptcy of its former owner, Wartsila Marine, in 1989. The Norwegian group, Kvaerner, eventually came to the rescue, buying the yard for NKr700m in March 1991. The purchaser is unlikely to have had any regrets about its move, given the spectacular revival of Masa-Yards in the past three years. Its order book has more than doubled to FM15bn, providing work for its 4,700 employees - at yards in Helsinki and Turku - until the end of 1997. Finland, with generally high wage costs, is not a natural home for shipbuilding and it is therefore something of a surprise to find one of Europe's biggest shipyards located there. Masa has managed to be successful, even without the subsidies enjoyed by some of its competitors, because it has concentrated on building up a strong position in a few niche, technically-sophisticated areas. Take cruise ships, for example. Here, the group has built up a 25 per cent world market share through orders from leading operators such as Carnival Cruise and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line. The company currently has seven cruise ships on order: two each from Carnival and RCCL, two from the German operator DSR and one from the Japanese group NYK. It has been a good industry for Masa to specialise in, given the average 10 per cent a year expansion of the cruise market over the past 10 years. Mr Saarikangas is confident that the trend will continue. 'The Caribbean has been the main focus of cruise market development so far; there is a great deal of potential in other parts of the world,' he says. LNG vessels are the company's other big speciality, with the Abu Dhabi order alone giving it a 20 per cent market share. It has also penetrated other niches including cable layers and ice-breakers, and hopes one day to build a presence in the Arctic market for vessels trading in the icy waters of northern Russia and Canada. 'We are not series-building ships like a lot of yards,' stresses Mr Saarikangas, 'Our vessels are tailor-made.' The group's results would seem to vindicate the strategy. Last year it achieved a FM386.9m profit on turnover of FM2.76bn, the best figures in its history. Return on investment has been around 25 per cent a year for each of the last three years. Mr Saarikangas dismisses suggestions that the yard's success has hinged on the hefty devaluation of the Finnish markka since 1991. 'All our results until now have been based on orders placed before the devaluation,' he states. Having said that, the weak markka was crucial to the yard's success in winning the LNG contract and Mr Saarikangas is alarmed at the recent strengthening of the currency. 'I am looking forward to the time when the markka reaches its proper level, which is weaker than today,' he says. Productivity improvements have been the other factor in the group's success. Despite the big expansion in the Masa-Yards order books over the past few years, the company employs 1,800 fewer people today than when Mr Saarikangas took over. Although numbers have risen slightly from their lowest point, the company's main response to its greater workload has been to increase sub-contracting. The impact of EU membership on the yard is likely to be limited. However, it will gain access to EU research and development funds, and perhaps more importantly, it will get a say in the community's shipbuilding policy. Mr Saarikangas says the yard will certainly make its voice heard if competitors are unduly favoured by subsidies and other state support. 'I consider all kinds of subsidy unfair. You are not allowed to have drugs in sport. Why should you have them in industry? I would like to have a doping committee in industry,' he adds.</p>

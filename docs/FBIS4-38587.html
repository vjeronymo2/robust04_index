			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputies of the Crimean parliament were faced today  by the same question as at previous sittings -- the question of  the republican Cabinet of Ministers. Roman Babayan reports from  Simferopol:    [Babayan] The fact is that almost all of last week the  deputies, together with Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and  Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov, discussed the  nominations for future republican ministers. But they failed to  reach any decisions. Each side gives their own explanation of  this.    Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov believes that the  deputies are being obstinate over the issue of approving the  Cabinet of Ministers because the parliamentarians do not want to  have a pro-presidential government in the Crimea. Yevgeniy  Saburov noted that in the very near future deputies of the  Crimean parliament will try to kick out Yuriy Meshkov.  According to Saburov, there is a situation developing today in  the Crimea which is like the September-October 1993 Moscow  situation.    President Yuriy Meshkov is not as categorical as the Crimean  deputy prime minister. However, after the parliament again  refused to approve the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers,  he also stated that the Crimea is on the verge of a third  government crisis.    As for the parliamentarians themselves, they explain that  they are taking these actions because the people put forward for  nomination are incompetent.    Whatever the reasons, as a result the Crimea still does not  have a government, and in consequence starting the process of  bringing the Crimean economy out of the bad situation in which  it is at present is being postponed indefinitely.</p>

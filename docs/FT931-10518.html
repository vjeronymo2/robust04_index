			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Aspin confirms commitment to Nato: Plans for US troop cuts do not mean sidelining Europe, new defence secretary says MR LES ASPIN, the new US secretary of defence, sought to reassure his allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation at the weekend that the Clinton administration's plans for troop cuts in Europe would not undermine its commitment to the alliance. 'Our intention to reduce our presence in Europe by the mid-1990s reflects the reduced threat environment in Europe, not any reduction in our commitment to Europe,' he told senior government ministers, top diplomats and military officers attending the annual Munich security conference. The defence secretary is expected to receive a report in Washington today on how the total US military strength can be reduced to 1.4m, instead of the Bush administration's target of 1.6m over the next five years. The number of troops in Europe is expected to be cut to a maximum of 100,000, instead of 120,000. Mr Aspin was responding at the weekend to repeated urging by the European allies, led by German chancellor Helmut Kohl, for the new US administration to restate its security commitments, at a time of growing instability in eastern Europe. While he stopped short of spelling out any details of the administration's foreign and security policy rethink, he insisted that his very presence in Munich should 'demonstrate our determination to work with our European allies to meet the challenges of the post-cold war era'. Mr Kohl led the European chorus calling on the US to maintain its commitments. 'It is imperative that the US, mindful of the lessons from history this century, continues to play its central role in matters of European security,' he said. 'It also requires that a substantial military presence should remain in Europe in order to meet the alliance's tasks now and in the future.' His words were immediately echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who said: 'It would be deeply foolish to let or encourage the Americans to go home, as foolish as it was in the 1920s when Adolf Hitler was simply an insignificant adventurer in this city of Munich.' The strains in the Nato alliance, and the anxious debate among the allies over how to redefine its role, dominated the meeting. Mr Kohl repeatedly stressed the dangers of instability in eastern Europe, especially the former Soviet Union, requiring concerted action from all the western allies to prevent new conflicts. However, he underlined the budget pressures on member states when he announced a new review of the troop strength of the German military, opening the possibility that it could be reduced below the present target of 370,000. There was clearly no consistent line on how to resolve the conflict in former Yugoslavia, nor on how to redefine Nato's function to include peace-keeping and peace-making outside the territory of its member states.</p>

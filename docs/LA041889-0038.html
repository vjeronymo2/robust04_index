			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS: KINGS VS. FLAMES;  </P> <P> KINGS RETURN TO EARTH IN CALGARY;  </P> <P> VICTORY OVER EDMONTON GIVES TONELLI SHOT AGAINST FORMER TEAM  </P> <P> Before John Tonelli was a King, he was a Calgary Flame. But that doesn't  necessarily mean he's going to go through the same kind of gut-wrenching  emotions during the Smythe Division playoffs that plagued Wayne Gretzky during  the semifinal series against Edmonton.  </P> <P> It's a different story for Tonelli in the series that begins tonight at  Calgary.  </P> <P> He wasn't called the Great One in Calgary. In fact, he wasn't called much at  all during the playoffs the last couple of years he was with the Flames.  Mostly, he sat.  </P> <P> And when last season ended, they called him a cab. Made him a free agent.  </P> <P> That was a shock, but not as big a shock as having been traded to Calgary by  the New York Islanders, the team he helped to four Stanley Cup titles.  </P> <P> Holding desperately to the belief that he had some more good days of hockey  left in him, Tonelli signed with the Kings last June 27.  </P> <P> Now he wants nothing more than to show the Kings that they were right, that he  can still do the job. He did it all season, showing the way on the ice with a  dogged determination and off the ice with mature, low-keyed leadership. But he  wants to do it in the playoffs. This is his favorite time of year. This is when  it really counts.  </P> <P> And what happens this time around? He comes down with the flu, then  complications. He ends up in the hospital with respiratory problems, losing  weight and patience while the Kings struggle through the early games.  </P> <P> "I was very frustrated when I was in the hospital watching the games," Tonelli  said. "It was very difficult. You can't help but think a little negative at a  time like that, thinking, 'It's happening to me again. I'm being denied this  opportunity again. I'm missing the time I like to play most.' I'm so thankful  for my teammates for keeping it going."  </P> <P> So he can get back into it.  </P> <P> Tonelli made a token appearance in Game 5 against Edmonton, played a little  more in Game 6 and actually played some real hockey in the big victory Saturday  night in Game 7.  </P> <P> "I'm getting better every day," Tonelli said. "I feel I'm getting stronger. The  coaches have been very wise in giving me part-time duty, letting me fill in."  </P> <P> He insists that he harbors no animosity toward the Flames, but his days in  Calgary do not account for his happiest hockey memories.  </P> <P> "My heart was in New York," he admitted. "It was a big shock to be traded. It  took me awhile to get over it. But I love playoff time, and my first season  with the Flames, I got to play and contribute in the playoffs, and that was  great. The last two seasons were very different. I wasn't given the opportunity  to play."  </P> <P> Tonelli played in all 22 playoff games as the Flames advanced to the Stanley  Cup final series against the Montreal Canadiens right after he was traded to  Calgary. But the next year he played in only three of six playoff games. And in  his second full season with the club he played in only six of nine playoff  games.  </P> <P> As soon as he said that he didn't play much, he hastened to add in his  diplomatic way: "But that has to go on my shoulders as well as theirs. I don't  think I got the best out of me, so, obviously, they didn't get the best out of  me. It works both ways."  </P> <P> Given another chance with the Kings -- and when that almost slipped away,  another chance when the Kings came from two games behind to gain him at least  one more round -- he says things will be different. "I damn well better get the  best out of me this time," he said.  </P> <P> The Kings are taking nothing for granted as they prepare for the team with the  best record in the National Hockey League during the regular season, the team  that dominated their season series, winning six of eight games. The Kings did  not win at the Saddledome this season.  </P> <P> The only sign, so far, that the Flames might be vulnerable is the semifinal  series between the Flames and the Vancouver Canucks. The Flames finished 43  points ahead of the Canucks in the regular season, and the series was expected  to last four games, maybe five. But it went seven, and even went into overtime  in the seventh game at the Saddledome.  </P> <P> "We have to take a close look at what made Vancouver so successful against  them," Tonelli said. "Vancouver took them to the brink, to the final seconds of  overtime. (The Canucks) never gave up. They took the body and forced them all  over the ice."  </P> <P> The Kings also have been pointing out that the Flames did not see them with  their current roster completely assembled. The Kings are playing much better  now than they were earlier in the season. And the Flames?  </P> <P> "They play so well all season long, right from the start they have great  consistency," Tonelli said. "They play so well throughout the regular season.  Other teams, during the playoffs, pick it up a notch, eh? The Flames are  already there."  </P> <P> Still, it's not easy for a team to go into a building where it was 0-4 and try  to upset the favorite.  </P> <P> "You either look that challenge right in the eye or you don't," Tonelli said.  "We've seen a big challenge already, and we met that one. We have to be  positive."  </P> <P> Playoff Notes  </P> <P> Tonight's game will be televised by Prime Ticket and broadcast by KGIL (1260)  and KORG (1190) at 6:30, Pacific time. . . . Calgary will be without defenseman  Gary Suter, who suffered a broken jaw in Game 2 against Vancouver, and Mark  Hunter, who suffered a broken hand in Game 6. When Calgary beat the Kings in a  Smythe Division semifinal series last season, Suter led the Flames with nine  points, including eight assists.  </P> <P> Mike Vernon, the Calgary goaltender who has been maligned as a guy who can't  win the big games, made 42 saves, including two overtime stops, in the Flames'  4-3 victory in Game 7 against Vancouver. Vernon, who led the NHL during the  regular season with 37 victories, said after the game that he never understood  the reputation. "I don't understand the bad rap. It ticked me off a bit, yeah.  In the last 10 years, only three goalies have won a Cup. I have a great team in  front of me. So did (Grant) Fuhr, (Patrick) Roy and Billy Smith. I think the  criticism has made me a better player, though. I've had to face it day in and  day out."  </P> <P> King Marty McSorley, on whether this series will be more physical than the  fight-free Edmonton series: "Our goal-scorers are going to have to suck up a  punch, a stick to the ribs. They're going to have to be tough -- and it's tough  to take that stuff and not retaliate -- and then hurt them by shaking it off  and scoring goals. That's the best way to stop that garbage. I expect Wayne  (Gretzky) to get a few more cheap shots this series. But he can take a shot,  turn around and score a goal. When I was first getting to know Wayne, there  were times when he would come back to the bench and say, 'Relax, I can handle  it.' He's said many times, it's easier to look in the mirror and see yourself  with a bloody nose after a win." But McSorley is not saying that the Kings are  going to do nothing but take shots. He's not shy about dispensing what he sees  as justice if he needs to. McSorley said: "Our guys have to have some room to  play."  </P></p>

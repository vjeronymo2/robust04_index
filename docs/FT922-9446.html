			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Outlook for merger mania in the early 1990s IF THE authoritative history of accountancy were ever yo bewritten, somewhere towards the end there would have to be a chapter called 'Merger Mania', charting the acquisitions of the late 1980s. A question now facing firms is whether it would also have to cover the more cautious era of the early 1990s. While the recession bites home and the taste of merged firms being digested grows increasingly bitter, rumours of a new wave of acquisitions are beginning to surface. The latest candidates to be mentioned are BDO Binder Hamlyn and Pannell Kerr Forster, which were respectively seventh and ninth by fee income last year. Both vigorously deny it. Whatever the truth of these particular cases, the consensus among managing partners is that many firms are coming under competitive pressure and the total number must shrink. None admits, though, that their own practice faces any difficulties. This has led to a new game played by journalists and the recipients of their telephone calls within accountancy offices. The Accounting Standards Board may be tightening up on the imaginative skills of the creative practitioners, but merger gossip has provided a new outlet for invention. Last season's version - which still continues  - involved the issue of partner redundancies. Some firms adamantly deny that any have taken place. Most favour a more circuitous response: they stress that partners cannot be made redundant. Instead, they take early retirement, or depart voluntarily after deciding that their aims and those of the firm are no longer compatible. The 1992 variant - for countering talk of mergers - adopts the same technique. You can get a straight denial - though generally in a tone of voice that does not suggest the 'true and fair' pledge of an audit report. More typically, you hear an oblique comment using language which leaves the options open. 'We are not in merger discussions with anyone,' says an exasperated Mr Chris Swinson, national managing partner of Binder Hamlyn. 'I haven't even looked for the phone number of a dating agency  .. But one keeps one's eyes open.' Mr Richard Pearson, national managing partner at Pannell Kerr Forster, sighs wearily: 'There is no strength to the rumours. From time to time one has discussions about discussions  .. Of course, if the opportunity arises, we will certainly consider it.' There is no doubt that accountancy firms have been severely hit by the recession. Demand has dropped for non-essential services, such as management consultancy, and for activities linked to periods of economic growth like corporate finance. Insolvency work may have prospered, but it remains a small proportion of income for most firms. Statutory audits continue to command large revenues, but companies are increasingly putting this work out to tender and maintaining a tight ceiling on the fees charged. Meanwhile, costs have escalated sharply. Mergers have left the combined firms with substantial overheads including considerable surplus staff and excess property when they could least them. Corporate litigation is also fast expanding. Accountants, armed with professional indemnity insurance, have proved a tempting target for aggrieved users of accounts looking for recompense. When figures on fee income and employment are released by the top firms in June, they are likely to look bleak. Undisclosed internal accounts showing the falls in profitability will probably be gloomier still. This does not bode well for mergers driven by strategic reasons between two equal complementary partners, rather than as a panic-stricken survival measure by from ailing firms. But Mr Hugh Aldous, managing partner of Robson Rhodes, suggests that is nothing new. 'None of the mergers in the late 1980s was motivated by strategic cleverness. Despite all the hype from the firms' press offices about strategy, it is now clear that they were all driven by economic necessity.' He argues that the entire accountancy profession has come under pressure and many partners from leading firms are now on the job market. Mr Aldous believes the 'Big 6' - Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young, Price Waterhouse, Arthur Andersen, Touche Ross - are likely to survive because of their very strong reputation and the stranglehold they have on the largest clients. Some of the smaller firms will probably fade away, he thinks, while the group of six or eight firms below the premier league are likely to shrink to two or three over the next few years. Those which survive - among which Aldous naturally counts Robson Rhodes - will have to offer 'the same calibre of thinking' as the Big 6, while acting increasingly as advisers to individuals and private companies. A number of his competitors share the view of a shrinking middle tier, while putting up equally strong arguments for their own position as survivors. Among the most notable is Grant Thornton, eighth largest by fee income, which embarked three years ago on a strategy to concentrate on advisory work to small and medium-sized businesses. 'I don't think any firm outside the Big 6 which has a significant part of its income from the audit market can have a strong future,' says Mr David McDonnell, national managing partner. He believes two of the Big 6 firms may yet merge to create five large players, while a number of medium-sized firms are likely to have to seek partners in order to survive. The structure of Binder Hamlyn, by contrast, continues to be modelled in many ways on the Big 6 firms and it retains a number of large company audit clients. Mr Swinson is confident that such a role is sustainable. 'We have preserved a reasonable air of professionalism, and avoided the more rapacious moves of our competitors,' he says. Mr Paul Hipps, senior partner at Stoy Hayward, says: 'We have certainly sharpened up our act, putting enormous emphasis on quality and working hard talking to people to secure whatever business is around.' His firm has heavily cultivated family-owned businesses. Mr Peter Orenstein, senior partner with Casson Beckman, argues that his firm is not in the so-called 'second tier' but is at the top of a 'third tier'. He suggests that the second tier firms are coming under considerable pressure squeezed by both the Big 6 firms and the third tier. Many do not have the strong international networks of the larger firms, but have large overheads than their smaller competitors. 'We are small enough to be flexible and give clients the personal attention of individual partners, but large enough to have the specialist expertise they need,' Mr Orenstein says. 'We are certainly not under any pressure to merge. But that doesn't mean if a firm comes along with a proposal of some merit we would put up a brickwall. That would be foolish.' If further mergers do occur, one result will be a growing headache for regulators. Fewer firms will threaten both competition and independence. It is already difficult to find firms not subject to conflict of interest in a large and complex case such as the collapse of the Maxwell empire. Mr Swinson remains unconcerned by the rumours about BDO. He has flown off to Singapore on assignment and said before his departure: 'I would hardly be leaving if we were about to merge, would I?'</p>

President Clinton and Rabin urged PLO Executive  Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to resume the talks with Israel.    In a joint news conference with Rabin at the end of their  talks yesterday, Clinton said that he believes that 1994 can  still be the year of peace in the Middle East. He added: We  are now closer to an agreement than we were a year ago, but  further away from a peace agreement than we were a month ago.    For his part, Rabin urged 'Arafat to end his boycott of the  talks on Palestinian autonomy in occupied Jericho and the Gaza  Strip.    In a separate development, the spokeswoman for the U.S.  Embassy in Cairo has asserted that the U.S. stand on the status  of the occupied city of Jerusalem has remained unchanged.    In a statement to the Voice of America radio yesterday, the  U.S. official denied the statement Israel Radio has attributed  to U.S. President Clinton, in which he reportedly said that his  country views the unified city of Jerusalem as the capital of  Israel. She emphasized that no U.S. official has made such a  statement.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Greenspan faces monetary test: America The most delicate question for central bankers is how quickly to start tightening monetary policy after an economic recovery gains momentum. Last week, a group of economists led by Professor Allan Meltzer, the well-known monetarist from Carnegie-Mellon university, accused the US Federal Reserve of having delayed far too long already. Policy, they claim, is irresponsibly expansionary because narrow measures of the money supply are growing at double digit rates, far in excess of monetary demand in the real economy. The excess liquidity is pouring into financial markets, artificially bidding up the prices of shares and bonds. Unless the Fed begins to tighten policy quickly, they say, the US could face an 'asset price bubble' of the kind that destabilised the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. Fed policymakers meet in Washington tomorrow for their regular six-weekly assessment of monetary conditions. Most will be inclined to argue that fears of a speculative bubble are exaggerated. In his Humphrey-Hawkins congressional testimony in July, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, echoed conventional wisdom when he argued that the relationship between monetary aggregates and other economic variables, such as growth or inflation, had broken down. He was trying to explain why abnormally slow growth of M2, a broad measure of money, did not justify further cuts in interest rates. But his argument could equally well be used to justify not raising rates in response to exceptionally rapid growth of narrow measures of money, such as the monetary base (currency plus banks' reserves). A glance at real estate markets confirms that the US is not suffering a Japanese-style bubble in asset values. It is equally unwise to read too much into movements of the monetary base: the currency component, for example, has been inflated by large foreign holdings of dollar bills in Latin America and formerly communist countries. Yet there is a kernel of truth in the charge that financial institutions awash with liquidity are bidding up the prices of financial assets. To understand why, recall that monetary policy in recent years has had an important sub-plot: restoring the financial health of the US banking system. To raise bank profits, Mr Greenspan has deliberately engineered some of the biggest interest rate margins in US financial history. The Fed is pumping reserves into the banking system to keep interbank rates at the artificially low level of 3 per cent - zero in real terms. The cost of retail deposits has fallen to a derisory 2 per cent. But the Fed has put no pressure on the big banks to reduce their loan rates accordingly: the prime lending is still 6 per cent rate and many short-term loans are far more expensive. Instead of competing to lend at cheaper rates, banks are enjoying high margins and ploughing cash into US government securities. After growing at a compound annual rate of nearly 20 per cent for three years, bank holdings of government bonds stood at a giddy Dollars 700bn in June, roughly a third of their outstanding loans. The Greenspan policy has had a startling impact on bank finances. On the verge of bankruptcy at the end of the 1980s, US banks are now among the best capitalised in the world. Bank profits nearly doubled 1992 and have risen further this year. The average return on assets has soared to record levels. 'It's a very, very generous situation for the banks,' muses Mr Leonard Santow, a Wall Street bond market commentator. 'I'm not sure we have ever had margins like this.' Share and bond prices were bound to rise sharply as the economy emerged from recession. But would long bond yields have fallen three percentage points to the lowest levels in a generation without the extra push from banks? And if bond yields had not fallen so fast would the Dow Jones average have risen nearly 50 per cent from its trough in 1990? The Fed's policy of shoring up the banking system initially made sense. But with profitability fully restored, continued largesse seems unnecessary. Raising the cost of reserves for banks would make little sense if the economy as a whole still needed a big monetary stimulus. But does it? The recession formally ended more than two years ago. Huge revisions to statistics show that the downturn was milder than previously thought and the rebound stronger: economic growth has averaged a respectable 2.5 per cent a year since spring 1991, in spite of weak export markets. Recent figures for retail sales and production suggest the economy may currently be growing at an annual rate of about 3 per cent. More than 2m jobs have been created in the past 18 months. The jobless rate has fallen more than a percentage point to 6.7 per cent, low by the standards of much of the buoyant 1980s. The popular view is that the Fed does not need to tighten monetary policy because inflation seems under control; a spurt in prices in the spring has since reversed itself. Yet most forecasters still expect inflation to average 3 per cent or slightly more in coming years - hardly the price stability promised by Mr Greenspan. With the economy growing steadily and financial markets decidedly frothy, his policy of zero real interest rates is getting ever harder to justify.</p>

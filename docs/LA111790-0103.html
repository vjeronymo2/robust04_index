			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS UP, THEN DOWN;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: MAVERICKS COME BACK FROM AN EARLY 14-POINT DEFICIT TO WIN,  99-86.  </P> <P> There was another inspirational victory in a Laker game, only they weren't the  winners in this one.  </P> <P> A day after beating the Houston Rockets in overtime, the Lakers let the  post-Roy Tarpley, out-on-their-feet Dallas Mavericks climb off the deck. The  Mavericks rallied from a 14-point deficit and smoked the Lakers for the rest of  Friday night, thumping them, 99-86.  </P> <P> After the first quarter, the Mavericks, who had just lost back-to-back games to  Orlando and Miami, not to mention their last six in Reunion Arena to the  Lakers, shot 60%.  </P> <P> The Lakers are still one of three NBA teams allowing opponents to shoot 50%.  The others are Charlotte and Denver.  </P> <P> There were other problems: Dallas cut a 13-point lead to four as soon as Magic  Johnson left the floor; Terry Teagle's slump, the continuing problem of the  Lakers' settling for long shots.  </P> <P> But they pale beside the fact that they have become fish in a barrel.  </P> <P> "In the second half, we kind of fell apart a little bit defensively," Dunleavy  said. "I'm not sure it didn't have to do with fatigue. I played our guys big  minutes in the overtime (at Houston on Thursday). But defensively, we've got to  have a 'gut check.' "  </P> <P> The Mavericks started the night looking as though they were doing well to avoid  crying in public. Contenders for the finals in their own minds as the season  began, they were ambushed by Tarpley's knee surgery. The news was felt to be of  such import, two area newspapers carried it on the front page.  </P> <P> Once again the Mavericks found themselves in what the Dallas Morning News calls  "Post-Tarpley Syndrome." Coach Richie Adubato walked up and down press row  before the game, confiding how upset he was.  </P> <P> His team went out and proceeded to demonstrate why.  </P> <P> Ducking a fusillade of Maverick bricks, the Lakers shot to a 26-12 lead. They  led, 31-18, in the second quarter when Johnson went to the bench for his first  rest.  </P> <P> Within four minutes, the Mavericks trailed, 32-27.  </P> <P> Johnson was rushed back in, but the chance for an early knockout was over. The  teams battled on even terms until the fourth quarter, which Dallas began with a  10-0 run, including Derek Harper's back-to-back three-pointers.  </P> <P> Along the way, the Lakers had shocking lapses, such as the one in which they  came out of a timeout, lined up and let venerable, slow Brad Davis the lane,  reach the basket and lay the ball up. Maybe they were emotionally spent from  Houston. Maybe Dunleavy is right about that gut check, too.  </P> <P> "None of us played well," Magic Johnson said. "Sam (Perkins) played a great  half (with 14 points), but that was it."  </P> <P> Everybody is still being polite, but the Lakers' defensive problem seems to  begin at center.  </P> <P> Mychal Thompson started last season and the Lakers generally played straight up  against the opposing center. Thompson, 34, has fallen so far out of the picture  that against Phoenix on Tuesday, he missed a game without being injured for the  first time in his career.  </P> <P> The Lakers began this season with Vlade Divac and double-teamed opposing  centers. Opponents shot them up like Dodge City.  </P> <P> Friday night, Perkins, a forward, got his first start at defensive center. The  Mavericks suggested that the Lakers still haven't found the total answer yet.  </P> <P> Thus ended the Laker tour of Texas. They had an emotional night in Houston, won  a game and got Perkins going but couldn't sustain the effort long enough to  produce the victory that would have meant momentum.  </P> <P> Let's just say, they're a work in progress. The operative word being "work."  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> The Mavericks didn't throw the Lakers any bouquets afterward, either. "Anybody  can look up and see this isn't the Laker team that dominated us for the last  few years," James Donaldson said. "It's still the Lakers on the uniforms but  not the Lakers on the court." . . . The Lakers had won nine consecutive games  from the Mavericks. This was the first time the Mavericks had held them under  90 points. . . . Donaldson and Byron Scott tangled on a jump ball, Scott  actually advancing on his massive opponent. "I'm not afraid of James  Donaldson," Scott said. "He's nobody to be afraid of. That he's 7-0, 260  doesn't mean anything. If he's trying to take advantage of you, that's not  going to happen." . . . The Lakers shot three for 21 from the three-point line.  Poor shot selection? "Absolutely," Mike Dunleavy said. "We played right into  their hands." . . . Terry Teagle shot three for 17 in Texas. . . . In his  return to Dallas, Sam Perkins finished with 18 points, giving him 47 in Texas.  . . . Magic Johnson made six more free throws, giving him 38 in a row, then  missed. . . . The Lakers play host to Golden State Sunday night.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Tough talk on Nafta THE SIDE agreements it is proposed to attach to the North American Free Trade Agreement must raise wages and clean up the environment on both sides of the US-Mexican border, President Bill Clinton said yesterday. Referring to Nafta in language generally used by its opponents, he acknowledged that the pact was 'not simply a trade agreement, this is also an investment agreement'. Because it would make Mexico a 'much more attractive' investment, the Bush administration had negotiated rules protecting intellectual property and investment. 'Shouldn't we also, in the interest of both the economies of Mexico and the US, see that basic environmental standards and labour standards are observed?' he said.</p>

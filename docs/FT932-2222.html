			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Bottomley orders study of top-level ethics rules at NHS ETHICAL RULES at the top of the National Health Service, Europe's largest civilian employer, are to be fundamentally re-examined. The move, announced yesterday by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is a response to financial scandals and concern over the adequacy of non-executive directors' powers. Addressing the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in Bournemouth, Mrs Bottomley said a task force would be set up to 'spearhead an urgent review of the current guidance on corporate governance'. Her speech twice noted the importance of placing 'strong emphasis on the traditional public-service values of open-ness, probity and account-ability'. The immediate catalyst for action - referred to only obliquely by Mrs Bottomley - is a series of severely critical reports by district auditors, pointing to waste of at least Pounds 10m in the West Midlands regional health authority and Pounds 20m in Wessex. Police have investigated in both regions. Four people are awaiting trial in Wessex and the House of Commons public accounts committee is also conducting an inquiry. More broadly, the 1991 NHS reforms devolved financial and other decision-making to hundreds of trusts and district health authority boards. That has raised questions about the relationship between full-time managers and part-time non-executive board members. Questions Mrs Bottomley wants considered include: Giving non-executive directors power to seek independent financial and other advice and direct access to independent audit reports; Appointing audit committees of non-executive directors; Creating a company secretary role in health authorities and trust hospitals; and Maintaining a register of directors' business interests and adopting a code of ethics. Mrs Bottomley said there was a need to look again at the way health authority and hospital chairmen and non-executive directors were appointed, to ensure that the NHS was picking the best people. She has joined regional health authority chairmen in meeting Sir Adrian Cadbury to discuss lessons for the NHS from his 1992 report on corporate governance in the private sector. Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the Audit Commission, who also addressed the conference, said he suspected that fraud and corruption in the NHS were much less widespread than a few cases might suggest.</p>

Government bodies involved in the IPR issue were requested  to  draft explanatory notes detailing their responses and efforts  thus far for presentation to U.S. officials and private bodies  as the government here seeks to consolidate gains from recent  legislation.    The ROC [Republic of China] last April was first placed on a  "priority watch list" of 16 nations ordered to step up measures  against IPR violations or face retaliation under the United  States Trade Representative's package of sanctions known as  Super 301.    Taiwan and Thailand were the only nations retained on the  list when it was revised last August.    On January 3, the USTR's office requested reports from those  two nations prior to a further reassessment.    The officials, representing the MOEA [Ministry of Economic  Affairs], the Ministry of Justice, The Legislative Yuan, and  Ministry of the Interior met yesterday for the 14th session of  the inter-ministerial task force on IPR. The task force meets  about every two months on issues regarding enforcement of  international copyright law.    Concrete progress on IPR issues was reviewed, including full  passage by the legislature of the Cable Television Law last  November and the finalization of amendments to the Intellectual  Property law in December, which combined to significantly  strengthen enforcement of international statutes.    Still before the legislature is a bill on recordings which  will further clarify regulations on the production, purchase and  rental and audio and video tapes.    Other measures include the planned establishment of a  special  intellectual property rights bureau under the MOEA.    The MOEA last night said present efforts of the  inter-ministerial group were focused in the categories of  legislation, prosecution under the law, and spot checks on shops  and entertainment establishments and strengthening customs  enforcement. Those measures have been aided by cooperation with  the U.S. government and private groups including the  International Anti-counterfeiting Coalition, Inc.</p>

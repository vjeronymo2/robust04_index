			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Gaza security chief criticises leadership The commander of the Palestinian security forces said yesterday he could prevent attacks against Israelis by Islamic extremists in Gaza and improve security if he was given the political go-ahead by Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. In an interview in his Gaza headquarters Maj Gen Nasr Yussuf said the Palestinian 'political leadership' had failed to take clear decisions about curbing attacks by Hamas guerrillas and confiscating weapons. He also said the autonomous operations of Mr Arafat's 500-strong armed plain clothes Mukhabarat, or Palestinian Preventive Security Apparatus (PPSA), made security enforcement much more difficult. The remarks expose the frustration within the professional military and police establishments with Mr Arafat's murky security policy and his determination to maintain competing security forces which report directly to him. The rare public criticism of Mr Arafat's leadership is likely to spark a fierce internal Palestinian debate and be seized upon by Israel as evidence that Mr Arafat is not fully committed to his security obligations under the peace accords. Israel has accused the Palestinians of easing up on measures against extremist guerrillas and said yesterday the PLO had released four Islamic activists they say are responsible for the May 20 killing of three Israeli soldiers in Gaza. Gen Yussuf confirmed that all 40 Hamas activists arrested recently had been released from his custody and said: 'The political leadership should identify a clear-cut policy on how to deal with the armed opposition elements and the use of weapons.' He added that 'for sure' his 7,200-strong force could deal with Hamas if given the authority to do so. The general warned that if Hamas was not confronted soon it could grow in strength. He said the police had been operating under a policy of confiscating weapons on the street but that this policy had now been suspended. He said there was an urgent need for a unified and integrated security command. A senior official in Mr Arafat's 'Office of the President' denied there was mounting tension between the military and the PLO chairman but admitted there were divisions of opinion over what measures should be taken against Hamas. 'We can't do what the Egyptians or the Algerians are doing and risk a civil war here,' he said. 'We will not allow people to break the law but there are limits and we can't risk breaking the whole country apart.' Gen Yussuf said his police force was desperately in need of funds to pay salaries and meet running costs. He said he had received only Dollars 880,000 (Pounds 570,000) from 'the political leadership' and had run up debts worth Dollars 900,000 to local traders for food, clothes and furniture. The general said salaries of Dollars 260 a month had led at least four policemen to sell their weapons to extremists in Gaza and he had dealt with a few cases of bribery and smuggling. Britain has pledged Pounds 5m for salaries and equipment, and donors are in the process of organising a special 'cop' fund worth Dollars 7m a month to pay for salaries, training and running expenses of the police as they get set to spread out from Gaza-Jericho to the West Bank. But Gen Yussuf said the money was slow in coming from donors to the PLO and from the PLO political leadership to the police force.</p>

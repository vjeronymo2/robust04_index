			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Barclays to pre-notify customers over charges Barclays Bank announced yesterday that it intends to introduce pre-notification of charges on personal customers' accounts, a service all banks are likely to be required to implement under a revised voluntary code of practice. The bank said no date had been set for introducing the service, which it estimated would cost Pounds 12m a year. The service is already provided by banks including National Westminster, and Lloyds has said it will be introduced this year. Pre-notification of charges is one of the likely changes to the code, which is due to be revised from March. Changes are being drafted by a joint working party of three groups representing banks and building societies. The working party received recommendations from a review committee headed by Sir George Blunden, former deputy governor of the Bank of England. But it is thought to have decided independently to require pre-notification. The working party - of the British Bankers Association, the Association of Payment Clearing Services and the Building Societies Association - intends to publish a draft of the code next month. Although Barclays has publicly argued that it does not think most customers want pre-notification of charges, the service was recommended in several submissions to Sir George's committee from consumer groups and others. The banks introduced the voluntary code in March 1992 after consumer pressure over the quality of service. Barclays bank staff unions are planning to ballot members on proposals for a one-day strike against job cuts, Richard Donkin writes. The strike, proposed for February or March, has been discussed between the Barclays Group Staff Union and Bifu, the banking and insurance union. Barclays announced last week it had increased its five-year job-cutting programme by 3,000 to 21,000 over the next two years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social </F> Democratic Party of Japan, by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] The Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] has proposed that "the Hata Cabinet voluntarily resign en  masse and a new coalition government be formed." Do you think  that can happen?    [Kubo] It is important that the Hata administration  completes its missions first.    [Reporter] How is your party planning to negotiate with the  ruling parties concerning a new government?    [Kubo] It must be done very carefully. The negotiations  cannot make headway if the SDPJ only adheres to its position and  wants other parties to follow it. We will consolidate views  within the party, but a consolidated view should be a flexible  one to gain agreement on it from other parties that will  participate (in the negotiations).    [Reporter] What are the conditions the SDPJ cannot accept at  the negotiations?    [Kubo] As long as we are asking the Hata Cabinet to resign  en masse, "Kaishin" (the parliamentary group) must be disbanded.  We do not mind parties with the same ideas forming a floor  group. But we think they should do so openly so that other  floor groups can see what is going on.    [Reporter] What about the running of the government?    [Kubo] It should be run in a transparent and democratic way.  As the final decision-making body, what we need is (not a  representatives conference but) something like a general council  comprised of 20-30 members, with the number of members  apportioned by the size of the groups they represent.    [Reporter] Will your party submit a no-confidence motion  against the cabinet?    [Kubo] This is not a question of having to choose whether  the cabinet should resign to enable formation of a new  government or the House of Representatives should be dissolved  for a general election. If the Hata administration completes its  missions and we can make headway in forming a new  administration, there will be neither the dissolution of the  House for a general election nor a no-confidence motion. But if  this course of action is rejected, we will go for submission of  the no-confidence motion. As long as we follow that step, I  think the SDPJ can act in perfect union.    [Reporter] Some members of the ruling parties talk about a  large scale cabinet reshuffle. What do you think about that?    [Kubo] There has been no specific proposal for it. Hence I  think commenting on that at this point can be a barrier to  possible new developments. But the cause that resulted in the  SDPJ's departure from the coalition must be eliminated.    [Reporter] What do you think of a move on forming the  so-called conservatives' alliance with conservatives?    [Kubo] This is something we must be most wary about. If a  conservative coalition government is to come, it will be led by  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and this will mean reversing  history.    [Reporter] Can the SDPJ participate in a government  participated in by former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe  of the LDP?    [Kubo] That will be difficult. If the ruling parties reject  an alliance with the SDPJ, we should look for the possibility of  forming a grand alliance between conservatives and reformists.    [Reporter] What is your view on a move toward an alliance  between the LDP and the SDPJ?    [Kubo] I am opposed to the idea of allying with the LDP --  that idea that came in reaction to the thinking that "the SDPJ  should not ally with Shinseito." That will only mean that the  SDPJ will come to play a complementary role in the LDP  administration.</p>

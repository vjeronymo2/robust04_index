			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Berlusconi picks a safe economic team The economic team in the new Italian government led by Mr Silvio Berlusconi has been the one area where all parties in the Freedom Alliance coalition have found common ground. This is less because the various members of the Alliance have identical ideas on economic policy. Rather they were agreed on the type of qualifications necessary for the three posts of the Treasury, finance ministry and budget ministry. Mr Berlusconi, as prime minister designate, found himself short of experienced politicians in his own camp capable of handling these technical portfolios. He also ran up against considerable reluctance among some of the better known economists to enter a government that contained members of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance. He could have chosen his own economic adviser, Mr Antonio Martino, a Chicago-trained economist teaching at the private Luiss University in Rome and a committed free-marketeer. But Mr Berlusconi early on chose to place him at the foreign ministry. Mr Berlusconi also approached Mr Piero Barrucci, the outgoing minister, to stay on but the offer was turned down. This left the field open for the top job of Treasury minister to Mr Lamberto Dini, the 63-year-old director general of the Bank of Italy, with whom the media magnate has been friendly for some time. The League initially raised objections, claiming Mr Dini was too close to the discredited former Christian Democrats. But these objections faded with the lack of a clear alternative. Mr Dini is well known internationally, having spent long years in the International Monetary Fund. He is widely respected as having solid grasp of both domestic and international monetary and financial issues, and is a member of the European Union's monetary committee. Thus his appointment is a clear signal to the financial markets that the new government will pursue a sound economic policy, respecting the need to maintain tight budgetary discipline. By giving the main economic job to a non-politician in what is a political cabinet - unlike the previous Amato and Ciampi governments - Mr Berlusconi had to balance this with a politician in one of the other posts. With the populist Northern League clamouring for recognition and sharing his commitment to the free market, Mr Berlusconi has chosen Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, a League senator and a prominent accountant, as budget minister. Mr Pagliarini, on the previous Senate's budget commission, is brimming with energy and a fervent believer in deregulation and privatisation. The League normally demands iron loyalty from its members and this may make it difficult for him on occasions. But the League recognise him as their sole expert on the economy and this should given him some margin of manoeuvre. The difficulty of finding a finance minister from among the main Freedom Alliance partners, led to the choice of Mr Giulio Tremonti, a former Socialist tax expert who has just broken from the centrist Italian Pact of Mr Mario Segni. The major question now is whether Mr Dini will be treated by Mr Berlusconi as a technician or as a key member of the cabinet taking the political responsibility for economic policy. A secondary but important issue is the fate of the team of Treasury officials built up over the past two years under Mr Mario Draghi, the director-general. They have handled much of the privatisation and also deal with all debt matters. In private some at the Treasury have let it be known that they would find it difficult to work with Mr Dini. At the same time members of the League and the MSI have voiced concern at the power concentrated in Mr Draghi's hands. However, Mr Dini would find it difficult to rebuild a new team quickly, and Mr Berlusconi is anxious to move fast in the first 100 days. Mr Dini's departure from the Bank of Italy also creates a potentially awkward situation at the central bank both in terms of his replacement and on the question of the institution's political independence. There is already a precedent of former governor Guido Carli being Treasury minister. But Mr Dini will now have to deal with Mr Antonio Fazio, the bank governor, on policy issues when the two may not see eye to eye.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                NEO-FASCISTS GIVEN TWO POSTS IN CABINET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Five of the ministers in the government announced by the prime minister designate Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night are from the far-right National Alliance but only two are from the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI), the core party of the National Alliance, and neither was old enough to have been involved in the second world war. One of them, 58-year-old MSI parliamentarian Giuseppe Tatarella, was named posts minister and will also be one of two deputy prime ministers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prime Minister                          Silvio Berlusconi, Forza Italia Deputy Premier                    Giuseppe Tatarella, National Alliance Deputy Premier                          Roberto Maroni, Northern League Foreign                                   Antonio Martino, Forza Italia Defence                                    Cesare Previti, Forza Italia Interior                                Roberto Maroni, Northern League Justice                                    Alfredo Biondi, Forza Italia Treasury                                     Lamberto Dini, independent Budget                            Giancarlo Pagliarini, Northern League Finance                                    Giulio Tremonti, independent Education                             Francesco D'Onofrio, Centre Union Health                                     Raffaele Costa, Centre Union Public Works                               Roberto Radice, Forza Italia Agriculture                     Adriana Poli Bortone, National Alliance Post and Telecoms                 Giuseppe Tatarella, National Alliance Labour                    Clemente Mastella, Centre Christian Democrats EU and Regional Affairs                Domenico Comino, Northern League Foreign Trade                             Giorgio Bernini, Forza Italia Transport                               Publio Fiori, National Alliance Industry                                   Vito Gnutti, Northern League Cultural Affairs                 Domenico Fisichella, National Alliance Environment                          Altero Matteoli, National Alliance Family                                      Antonio Guidi, Forza Italia University and Science                 Stefano Podesta, Northern League Relations with Parliament                Giuliano Ferrara, Forza Italia Public Administration                     Giuliano Urbani, Forza Italia Institution Reform            Francesco Enrico Speroni, Northern League Italians Abroad                          Sergio Berlinguer, independent  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

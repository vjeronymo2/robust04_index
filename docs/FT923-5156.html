			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Tomson Pacific under investigation AN OFFICIAL investigation has been launched into the activities of Hong Kong's Tomson Pacific Group, which is headed by Macao casino entrepreneur Mr Stanley Ho. The financial secretary appointed an inspector yesterday and trading in the three group listings was suspended. The announcement comes three weeks after the Securities and Futures Commission instigated an investigation into share dealings in Mr Lee Ming Tee's Allied group. The SFC recommended the latest investigation into 'a number of specific transactions' carried out by Tomson Pacific and its 33.4 per cent owned associate World Trade Centre (WTC), since 1990. WTC was formerly Mr Alan Bond's Hong Kong investment company Bond Corporation International (BCIL), which was sold in June 1990. His 66 per cent stake was split between Tomson and independent parties. The regulators required proof of the identity of the independent buyers, due to concerns that some might be acting in concert with Tomson, thereby breaching the 35 per cent trigger under the takeover code. Tomson Pacific is 26 per cent owned by Rivera Holdings, whose shares were also suspended, but which is not caught up in the investigation.</p>

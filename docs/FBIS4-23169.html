			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ken Daniels on the "Newswrap" program] </F>   [Text] The dispute in KwaZulu/Natal over the allocation of  portfolios in the provincial executive has been resolved. After  a meeting between Dr. Frank Mdlalose of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] and Jacob Zuma of the ANC, the two leaders announced at a  media conference in Pietermaritzburg today that a satisfactory  solution had been found. The only outstanding issue is the  question of control of the police. Vusi Sithole is on the line  with details of the agreement.    [Begin recording] [Sithole] We asked them about the police  portfolio, which had been the bone of contention, and they said,  unfortunately, there were certain issues in the constitution  which did not allow them to proceed with some of the matters  that they would have loved to finalize today, but that [passage  indistinct]    [Daniels] Is it more favorable to the ANC?    [Sithole] What we got from Mr. Jacob Zuma was that they were  happy with the agreement that they had reached.    [Daniels] So what is the new allocation with the crucial  portfolios?    [Sithole] OK, the portfolios stand like this: Mr. Jacob Zuma  is going to take on the portfolio of economic affairs and  tourism, and then the portfolio of public transport and control  is Mr. S'bu Ndebele, and Dr. Zweli Mkhize will head the health  services portfolio here.    [Daniels] Now some of the Inkatha people that have lost  their  portfolios now -- what's going to happen to them?    [Sithole] We, unfortunately, could not get anything out of  Dr. Mdlalose about that, save to say that agreement has been  reached and that everybody was happy with the latest  arrangement. Dr. Mdlalose said that now Natal -- KwaZulu/Natal  -- had a chance to pick up where it had ended and was looking  forward to a very bright future for the province, and that they  were going to do their best to make this work.

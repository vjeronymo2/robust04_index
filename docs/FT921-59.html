			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / National Gallery acquires Holbein THE NATIONAL Gallery has acquired Holbein's portrait, Lady with a Pet Squirrel and a Starling, for Pounds 10m. The deal with the owner, the Marquess of Cholmondeley, is expected to be confirmed today, Antony Thorncroft writes. Christie's had estimated its auction value at Pounds 15m but on that sum Lord Cholmondeley would have had to pay a substantial tax bill. The Pounds 10m deal means, however, that the gallery has pledged almost all of its purchase grant from the government for the next three years. The painting was due to be sold at Christie's on April 15, but the likelihood that it would be bought by a foreign buyer and leave the country created a campaign, led by the gallery, to organise the private treaty sale with the marquess.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Global deal is sought on Maxwell pensions THE MAXWELL Pension Trust, the government-appointed go-between for former Maxwell company pension schemes and the City, has written to all parties seeking a 'global settlement' involving up to Pounds 440m in disputed funds. The trust, chaired by Sir John Cuckney, was set up in June 1992 and by the end of last year had raised Pounds 6.2m in donations from organisations that had conducted business with the late Robert Maxwell. Since then there has been almost no progress in encouraging the return of contested pension scheme assets from UK organisations and international investment banks. Representatives of the schemes said yesterday that if the latest initiative failed to bring results they were prepared to serve writs against the investment banks. An adviser to one of the schemes said: 'This is a last push. If nothing comes of it over the next two to three months, the writs will fly.' The letter comes amid growing frustration among pension fund trustees and administrators. They had hoped that Sir John would have been able to persuade the banks to negotiate the return of assets instead of forcing the pensions schemes to start lengthy and expensive legal proceedings.</p>

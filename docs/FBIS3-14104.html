This was emphasized to our station by an  authoritative source, who added that the talks also dealt with  the U.S. position on Security Council Resolution 904 on the  Hebron massacre. Jordan asked Washington to explain its  abstention from voting on the paragraph which stated that  Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories and whether this  abstention constitutes a change in the U.S. position on the holy  city.    The House of Representatives strongly condemned the U.S.  position on Jerusalem and denounced what it termed the  continuous U.S. aggression on the Arab nation. It asked the  Jordanian Government not to return to the negotiations before  the siege of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted and so announced at  the Security Council. The deputies said this siege is aimed at  bringing pressure to bear on Jordan with all possible means to  deprive it of its free decision vis-a-vis all issues of concern  to the nation.</p>

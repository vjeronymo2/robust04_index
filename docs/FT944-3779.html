			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Angolan plea for peacekeepers Angolan Deputy Foreign Minister George Chikoti yesterday urged African states to send an interim peacekeeping force to his war-weary country until the United Nations decided to send troops. A shaky ceasefire has been in force since November 22, two days after the Luanda government and Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebels signed peace accords in the Zambian capital Lusaka formally ending the 19-year Angolan civil war. The UN, which plans to send 7,000 peacekeepers to Angola, has delayed their deployment until it is sure both sides are serious about peace. It relies on the war rivals to report ceasefire violations. 'The UN delayed sending them. They should have been in the country by now. There have been violations of the ceasefire but we have not been able to give proof because the verifying force is not there,' Mr Chikotisaid. The UN has already asked South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe to contribute troops to the force, but Pretoria's black rulers are wary of getting involved in Angola given their white predecessors' role on the side of Unita in the 1980s.</p>

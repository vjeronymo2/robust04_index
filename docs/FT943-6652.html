			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Markets: Balancing the book business - The Bottom Line Wednesday started badly for John Napier, finance director of retailing group WH Smith. He turned on the television news to hear a report that he was expected soon to announce a fall in the group's yearly profits from a mis-stated Pounds 144m to Pounds 124m. Headline profits did indeed fall, but from Pounds 114m to Pounds 84m - and that was after exceptional costs of Pounds 41m to cover rationalisation of Do It All, the group's DIY joint venture with Boots, and restructuring costs in the Smith chain. Adding back those costs, underlying profits increased 13 per cent to the forecast Pounds 124m. For Napier, the television's mistake was another example of the difficulties he faces in getting across the message that WH Smith is still growing and that many of the uncertainties holding back its share performance in recent years are now resolved. Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiries into newspaper distribution and compact disc prices gave the retailer a fairly clean bill of health. The Our Price music chain is back in profit after being merged earlier this year with Virgin - a deal in which Smith increased its share of the joint venture with Richard Branson's group from 50 to 75 per cent. Losses are falling at Do It All after the disposal of 100 stores to concentrate on the 137 best performers. Before Napier can sleep easily, however, the fate of the Net Book Agreement has still to be settled. The Office of Fair Trading last week asked the Restrictive Practices Court, which rules on whether agreements between companies are anti-competitive, to review the agreement which allows publishers to set the retail prices of books. Its removal would allow bookshops to compete on price, leading to a squeeze on margins. WH Smith, long an NBA supporter, indicated a shift in stance on Wednesday, saying it would help to finance the defence of the agreement only if large publishers demonstrated they were still committed strongly to it. Already, there are rumours that one or more will pull out by early next year, effectively killing off the agreement even before the court rules. But chief executive Sir Malcolm Field is confident that WH Smith can withstand the end of the agreement. Discounting, he says, would be limited to perhaps 30 best-selling books, and any lost margin would be recouped largely through gains in market share. The other anxiety about the UK business is that consumer demand is expected to remain sluggish. The group plans to compensate for that partly by its biggest-ever expansion programme. It is spending Pounds 50m this year on adding 230,000 square feet of selling space to its present 3.6m sq ft, including new stores and the extension of its flagship Virgin Megastore on Oxford Street, London, into the world's biggest music and video store. It is also working hard to get more out of the market-leading position it enjoys in several sectors. It is targeting its different retail outlets - WH Smith and Waterstone in books; Virgin and Our Price in music, video and games - more carefully at specific groups of consumers, and building up their brand names. On the cost side, removing layers of management in the WH Smith chain will yield annual savings of Pounds 2.4m, allowing it to take on more shop staff to improve service. It is through providing good service and extending 'value-added' features such as Bookfinder - its computer-based book ordering service - that bookseller intends to keep its competitive edge, rather than by copying the everyday low pricing strategy of rivals such as Kingfisher's Woolworths chain. The US, however, could provide the most exciting opportunities for growth. Already, WH Smith is the biggest US airport retailer of books. It plans to expand this business and the Waterstone chain. Where does that leave the shares? With pre-tax profit for this year forecast at Pounds 142m-Pounds 145m, equivalent to a 10 per cent increase in earnings per share, analysts believe they are about 5 per cent undervalued against the market. They have gained ground in the past three days but still look a worthwhile holding.</p>

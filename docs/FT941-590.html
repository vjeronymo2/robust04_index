			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Spanish investors put their money on mutual funds The total volume of mutual funds under management in Spain grew from Pta6,627bn to Pta10,709bn during 1993, a rate of expansion which equals the accumulated growth of the two preceding years. According to the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores, the stock market regulator, the number of registered mutual funds rose from 732 to 822 at the end of last year and the number of participants rose from 900,400 to 1.4m. The figures bare out the conventional wisdom that people save in times of recession (Spain registered negative growth last year and gross domestic product shrank by 1.1 per cent), and save where they will earn most. In essence, the enthusiasm for mutual funds has been fuelled by three forces: reduced interest rates, tax incentives and the sheer strength of the banks' sales drive. The CNMV believes that investors and those who managed their savings were showing three clear tendencies: A switch from short to long-term fixed-income investment. Investment in long-term public debt increased from 20.8 per cent of the total volume of the funds at the beginning of last year to 32.8 per cent by December 1993. A change from fixed-income investment to equities. Spanish funds are strongly pitched towards government debt but during 1993 the percentage of total funds estimated to be invested in equities rose from little more than 3 per cent to more than 5 per cent. A switch from domestic to foreign markets. The weighting of foreign equities and fixed-income investment among funds increased from 2.2 per cent in 1992 to 5.7 per cent. This year - in January and February - the rush by investors into mutual funds accelerated further and the trend into equities was even more pronounced. By the end of February, the volume of mutual funds had risen to Pta11,900bn. One key aspect of the increase in mutual fund investment is the volume growth (51 per cent) of funds putting all or up to 75 per cent of their portfolios into equities. As at January 31, equity and equity mixed funds represented 14.7 per cent of domestic mutual funds under management. The upsurge in equity-weighted funds represents a huge injection of money into the Madrid bourse, a market lacking liquidity and domestic institutional investors. Ahorro Corporacion Financiera calculates that the combination of equity and equity mixed funds, together with so-called 'fixed-income mixed' funds, which allow for a maximum 25 per cent investment in equities, totalled Pta193bn in January. This compares with average daily trading volume of Pta42.4bn in equities on the Madrid bourse in January. According to the CNMV, by the end of this year between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of total fund volume will be invested in equities. Ahorro Corporacion Financiera estimates suggest the figure will be closer to 7 per cent. Either way, the breakdown of the funding volume assures the domestic markets of a clear, and growing, domestic support base.</p>

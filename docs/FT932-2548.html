			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Debt-ridden Norco faces liquidation THE NORTHERN Co-operative Society, north-east Scotland's biggest retailer, applied yesterday to go into liquidation, putting 800 full-time and part-time jobs under threat. Norco, one of the area's biggest employers for 130 years, said last month it was trying to save its debt-ridden business through a merger with the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the main supplier to the whole co-operative movement and the largest co-operative retail-er. But a CWS board meeting on Wednesday decided not to proceed with the merger. Norco said it had not been able to secure adequate support from its bankers and had no choice but to go into liquida-tion. Norco said the CWS decision was of 'immense regret' after the 'substantial progress' Norco had made in reducing its debts in recent months. CWS said it had considered the merger 'seriously and sympathetically' but concluded that Norco's problems were mainly of a financial and property nature rather than concerned with trading, and it was 'extremely late in the day' for CWS to intervene. Norco's 89,000 members, who have shares and savings accounts with the society, and other investors and bondholders are partly protected by the Co-operative Deposit Protection Scheme. The CWS pledged to provide additional funds to ensure all investors received full repayment of their capital. The total involved is believed to be more than Pounds 2m. A liquidator is expected to be appointed today to investigate whether any part of Norco can be saved. The society has a superstore in Dundee and 20 convenience stores in north-east Scotland. It employs 200 full-time and 600 part-time staff. Norco has suffered a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes in three years. In 1990 it was Scotland's biggest co-operative society and its board approved a Pounds 30m development plan aimed at doubling sales to Pounds 130m in 18 months. Bank loans took gearing to 200 per cent, which proved impossible to manage as the recession set in, and the society made a record Pounds 7.4m deficit in the year to April 1992. Under pressure from its bankers Norco was forced to sell assets to pay off its debts. Newly built superstores at Westhill, on the outskirts of Aberdeen, and at Banchory, Ellon and Elgin were sold to Argyll, owner of Safeway, the grocery chain. In March Norco's flagship Berryden store in Aberdeen was sold to Scottish Co-op, the Scottish retail group of the CWS, for about Pounds 15m, and Norco's dairy operations were sold to Kennerty Farm Dairies.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Historic Movie House May Close: The Texas Theater, the Dallas movie house where  Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested after the assassination of President John F.  Kennedy, may be closing soon. The 60-year-old theater was built by Howard  Hughes but its current owner, United Artists, wants to shut it down because  it's losing money. The Texas Theater Historical Assn. is trying to declare the  theater a historical landmark and has asked director Oliver Stone to consider  allowing a special screening at the theater of his new film, "Born on the  Fourth of July," which was filmed in the same neighborhood.

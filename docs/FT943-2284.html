			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kemira aims to raise FM1.5bn in share offer Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, said yesterday it hoped to raise between FM1.5bn (Dollars 305m) and FM2bn through an international share issue to be launched next month. The offer, as part of Finland's biggest ever initial public offering, will cut state ownership in the group from 100 per cent to as little as 71 per cent in line with the government's privatisation programme. It will be accompanied by a listing of Kemira's shares on the Helsinki stock exchange. Kemira said proceeds would be used to cut its FM8bn net debt and strengthen its equity-to-assets ratio from a weak 15 per cent to about 25 per cent. The group will offer a total of 30m ordinary shares at a nominal FM10 each, with an option to increase the size of the issue by 5m shares if demand is strong. The bulk of the shares will be offered to international institutions, with the balance being subscribed by Finnish institutions and retail investors. Many of Kemira's businesses are starting to benefit from cyclical economic recovery and it returned to the black last year after two years of losses following an extensive cost-cutting programme. The group's biggest division includes fertilisers and it has important niche positions in pulp and paper chemicals, water treatment chemicals and titanium dioxide pigments. Mr Heimo Karinen, Kemira's chief executive, said: 'Kemira's profitability and competitiveness have substantially improved following the restructuring of its operations in the last few years. The equity issue will further strengthen the group's financial position and enable us to take full advantage of the recovery that is seen in the chemical industry.' The offer will be launched after publication of eight-month figures on October 10 with final pricing being fixed in the week of October 31.</p>

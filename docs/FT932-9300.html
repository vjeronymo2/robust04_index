			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Heavy toll to bear - Without a European-wide policy on electronic road pricing, chaos could ensue This is the nightmare that could face European motorists in the last years of the 20th century. All over the continent, countries are looking at ways of tackling congestion and raising revenues through the introduction of electronic road tolls. But unless they reach agreement on a common technology, the consequences for motorists could prove not only costly, but chaotic. Drivers could, for example, find themselves having to fit their vehicles with a different type of electronic debiting device for every town or city they regularly visited. On top of that, they could need a separate system for paying electronic tolls on motorways. Different systems again could be required for competing private-sector toll roads. As for motorists driving regularly between different countries, they could find themselves laden with so many electronic devices that their vehicles would be left with little room for anything else. This is one of the difficult issues confronting John MacGregor, Britain's transport secretary, as he contemplates the introduction of road user charges in the UK. Soon, he is expected to bring out a green paper proposing the introduction of tolls on the country's trunk roads and motorways. In the run-up to this event, he has this week been looking at electronic tolling systems in Oslo, Norway, and Gothenburg, south-west Sweden, to see what lessons they can pass on. What he found in Oslo was a curious hybrid between an urban road pricing system and motorway tolls. Since 1990, motorists passing any of 19 entry points to the city have had to hand over NKr11 (Pounds 1.05). (There are discounts for season tickets; lorries pay double.) But the aim is not to ease congestion by discouraging drivers from entering the city. Rather, as with MacGregor's planned motorway tolls, it is to raise money for building roads - in this case, the construction of roads in tunnels under the city to cope with projected traffic growth. At most of the 19 entry points, motorists have three ways of paying the entry fee. Two are manual: typically, one lane allows drivers to hand over money and receive change and another two allow them to throw the exact payment into a basket before driving through. But a third, quicker method, allows drivers to open accounts with the toll-collecting authority and have their vehicles fitted with simple electronic tags, each reflecting a unique radar profile. This means they can pass the toll points without stopping; their tags are read by roadside beacons and their accounts are debited automatically by computer at the toll-collecting authority's headquarters. As with most toll systems, there are no physical barriers at the toll booths; vehicles have their number plates photographed if their drivers fail to pay. In the electronic lanes, every approaching vehicle has its tag number compared with a list on the toll station's computer and if the corresponding account is not in credit, a photograph of the vehicle's number plate is recorded on disc. Once a day, the central computer at headquarters transmits an up-dated list of valid and invalid tags to every toll station computer, and once a day, each tolling station sends back to headquarters the computer data containing the photographic records of apparent offenders. It sounds straightforward enough, but there are drawbacks with Oslo's electronic system. It is not linked to similar systems operating in two other Norwegian cities, Bergen and Trondeheim, so motorists moving frequently between the three need to open separate accounts in each city. Also, the verification system is relatively cumbersome and results in a lot of wasted effort on enforcement. Even in this relatively small city, with its population of around 500,000, the system is clocking up 5,000 violations a day. It turns out that most result from the delay in keeping toll stations up to date with information about motorists' payments into their accounts. In Sweden, the system on trial in Gothenburg - yet to be brought into operation - differs radically from Oslo's in transferring the performance of the financial transaction from a central computer to the vehicle. Here, the driver charges up an electronic smart-card with money (probably at a petrol station) and plugs it into an in-car device that debits payments from the card when triggered by microwave signals from roadside transmitters. There is no transaction with any centralised computer; indeed, the system does not need to know anything about the vehicles that pass as long as the in-car device is working. It only becomes involved if the beacon fails to receive a positive response from an in-car device, at which point the vehicle's number plate is photographed for follow-up action. Some Norwegians are scathing about the Swedish experiment. They believe it is vital to keep road pricing technology as simple as possible at the point of use. Transferring the intelligence from a central computer to the vehicle means transferring not only the cost of the technology to the vehicle owner, they say, but also the risk of electronic or mechanical failure, or tampering. But the Swedes have a persuasive response. The Norwegian system, they point out, requires a constant verification process between toll station computers and a central computer holding details of subscribers' accounts. While this may be feasible on a small scale in a city such as Oslo, the sheer scale of the data transactions involved would make the system hopelessly unwieldy in cities with higher traffic densities and even more so if extended across entire countries. The existence of central computer records of vehicle accounts also raises issues of privacy. Encouragingly, the Swedes recognise the importance of developing a European-wide road-pricing technology and are working with an EC road informatics programme called Drive to evolve common standards. One thing that looks certain is that it is not going to get any cheaper to drive from one end of Europe to the other. But at least it may be possible to do so with just one device inside your vehicle, one smart-card to insert into it, and without anyone knowing where you have gone.</p>

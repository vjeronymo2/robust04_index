			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IRISH TAKE BEST SHOT, BEAT SYRACUSE  </P> <P> Digger Phelps didn't go for the tie because Notre Dame needs victories.  </P> <P> Elmer Bennett made a three-pointer as the buzzer sounded and the Irish, making  their annual run for the NCAA tournament, beat fourth-ranked Syracuse, 66-65,  Saturday at Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> "We wanted the three," Phelps said. "We were going all out and Elmer makes a  great shot on a great pass from (LaPhonso) Ellis."  </P> <P> Notre Dame (14-8) won its first of six road games against ranked teams, ending  Syracuse's 37-game nonconference home winning streak.  </P> <P> Syracuse's last nonconference home loss was to Navy and David Robinson in the  second round of the NCAA tournament in 1986.  </P> <P> The game was played before 32,747 fans, short of the 32,820 who watched  Syracuse defeat Connecticut this season.  </P> <P> Billy Owens' basket gave Syracuse (18-5) a 65-63 lead with four seconds to  play.  </P> <P> The Irish called a timeout with two seconds remaining, but officials added a  second on the clock. That gave Notre Dame enough time for Ellis to get the  inbounds pass upcourt and into the hands of Bennett, who penetrated to the top  of the key and launched an uncontested shot that sent Syracuse to its second  consecutive loss.  </P> <P> "At first, I thought it was going to be long," Bennett said. "It seemed like it  stayed in the air for 20 minutes. Then it went in and it was pandemonium."  </P> <P> Syracuse overcame a 13-point deficit in the final 12 minutes and took a 63-62  lead on Stephen Thompson's layup with 1:02 left.  </P> <P> Ellis made one of two free throws to make the score 63-63 with 43 seconds  remaining.  </P> <P> Bennett scored 18 points, Keith Robinson had 13, Joe Frederick and Monty  Williams added 12 apiece, and Ellis had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the  Irish.  </P> <P> Derrick Coleman scored 16 points for Syracuse, and Thompson and Owens each had  14.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS  </P> <P> No. 1 Kansas 94, Nebraska 67 -- Kevin Pritchard and Rick Calloway awakened the  sluggish Jayhawks, igniting runs of 14-4 and 20-5 that buried the Cornhuskers  in a Big Eight Conference game at Lawrence, Kan.  </P> <P> Kansas (25-2, 8-2) was coming off a defeat at home to No. 2 Missouri earlier in  the week.  </P> <P> The Jayhawks trailed, 22-17, after 10 minutes following a 9-0 spurt by Nebraska  (9-14, 2-8), but a 14-4 run gave Kansas a 44-36 lead at halftime.  </P> <P> Pritchard scored eight points as the Jayhawks outscored the Cornhuskers, 20-5,  to start the second half.  </P> <P> Terry Brown scored 19 points for Kansas, Calloway added 17 and Pritchard had  16.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3. Federal Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the United States, several agencies, including EPA, FDA, OSHA, CPSC, NIOSH,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ATSDR, have been given the mandate to regulate or evaluate public exposure to toxic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals (Tilson, 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3.1. Food and Drug Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDA has the authority to regulate the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food and color additives as well as to determine whether or not various foods are unsafe for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human consumption because of adulteration by environmental contaminants. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer must supply adequate data to establish the safety of the food additives. Before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketing approval, the potential toxicity of proposed food and color additives is established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a battery of animal toxicity studies. During all of these studies, clinical signs of toxicity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including abnormal behavior, are monitored and abnormalities recorded. At the termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these studies, tissues from all organs, including the brain, are sectioned and evaluated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both gross and histopathological changes, in addition to being evaluated for their clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemistry and hematology. None of the routinely required tests is specifically designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assess neurotoxicity. If neurotoxic effects are detected during any of the standard toxicity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests, however, they must be reported. Specific neurotoxicity testing may then be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDA is currently revising its guidelines for the safety assessment of direct food and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> color additives to include neurotoxicity as a routine element in toxicological testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDA is also authorized to regulate substances in food considered to be poisonous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or deleterious. Unavoidable environmental contaminants in food fall into this category. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA determines a level at which the risks from realistically possible intakes are negligible or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable. Based on this risk assessment, an action level or tolerance is established. Once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the action level or tolerance is formally established, the FDA may take appropriate action to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrict adulterated food from the market if these standards are exceeded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDA is responsible for assessing the toxicity of human therapeutic products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many products have been shown to produce adverse effects on the nervous system at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard therapeutic doses as well as at higher doses. Before marketing approval is given,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the toxicity of potential new products is assessed. A battery of animal toxicity study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters relevant to the nervous system, including gross behavioral observation and gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue, are evaluated. This information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to help guide the surveillance of human subjects for adverse effects that are assessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during clinical trials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3.2. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has been given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility to ensure that the working environment is a safe and healthy place of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment. In the early 1970's, OSHA adopted the existing Federal standards, most of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which were developed under the Walsh-Healy Act (including the 1968 ACGIH Threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limit Values), and approximately 20 consensus standards of the American National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards Institute (ANSI) as Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Of the 393 remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original PELs, 145 were set in part to protect the individual from neurotoxic effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the adoption of the initial standards, OSHA has issued new or revised health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards or work practices for 23 substances. Of these, the one concerning lead was based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in part on nervous system effects. Four other compounds, inorganic arsenic, acrylonitrile,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethylene oxide, and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, were cited as causing various disturbances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the nervous system, but the standards for these were based primarily on carcinogenic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1989, OSHA updated 428 exposure limits for air contaminants. Of these, 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances were categorized by OSHA as ``substances for which limits are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoidance of neuropathic effects.'' In addition, 24 substances were included in the category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substances for which limits are based on avoidance of narcosis.'' However, OSHA stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the categorization was intended as a tool to manage the large number of substances being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated and not to imply that the category selected identified the most sensitive or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusive adverse health effects of that substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3.3. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Occupational Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Health Act established NIOSH as a Public Health Service (PHS) agency to develop and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommend criteria for prevention of disease and hazardous conditions in the workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NIOSH also performs research on occupational health issues and conducts worksite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluations of suspected hazards. OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (MSHA) use NIOSH recommendations in the promulgation of new or revised health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In establishing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for chemicals, NIOSH examines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all relevant scientific information about a given compound and attempts to identify exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits that will protect all workers from adverse effects. NIOSH has recommended standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for approximately 644 chemicals or classes of chemicals. For 214 (33 percent) of these,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity was cited as a health effect considered when formulating the REL (NIOSH,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.1.3.4. Environmental Protection Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) provide the legislative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority for EPA to require data collection for premarket approval of chemicals. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 5 of TSCA, after a manufacturer has notified EPA of its plans to produce a ``new''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical that has not yet been listed on the inventory, EPA has the responsibility to assess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible health hazards. Potential neurotoxicity is included in the health hazards assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If there are reasons to suspect neurotoxicologic effects (e.g., from structure-activity analysis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in the literature, or data submitted by the manufacturer), EPA can issue a test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule requiring the manufacturer to develop data directed toward these effects. At the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, EPA can restrict the chemical or prohibit it entirely from entering commerce until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required data are submitted and reviewed. In addition, for ``old'' chemicals (under section 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of TSCA), if EPA suspects neurotoxicity, a test rule would be the mechanism used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining the data. Many other statutes provide authority to regulate chemicals through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting of standards, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neurotoxicity is recognized as a health effect of concern under FIFRA, and there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neurotoxicity testing requirements for premarketing submission of data to EPA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration of a pesticide under FIFRA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

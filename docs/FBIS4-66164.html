			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview by staff reporter with Xu Zhantao (6079 </F> 0594 3447), young economist studying investment; place and date  not given: "Investment Funds: A Popular and Ideal Investment  Means"]    [Text] Investment funds are a form of investment in  which private capital is pooled for commissioned operation by  experts. Investment funds are characterized mainly by:  collective investment, expert operation, decentralized risk, and  joint benefits. Investment funds, through orderly and  decentralized investment packages, optimize investment  efficiency, risk-dispersion efficiency, and expert-operation  efficiency.    In today's China, where our socialist market economy is  developing rapidly, investment has become a keen undertaking for  the Chinese public and enterprises. All sorts of investment  activities, such as buying stocks and bonds, and investing in  self-run enterprises, joint ventures, partnerships, and trusts,  are unfolding. The public asks: Of the many investment forms,  which option is actually the more ideal? In response to readers'  inquiries, I interviewed Xu Zhantao, a young economist studying  this business.    Reporter: While investment is a hedge  against inflation to proliferate assets and earn higher returns,  which makes sense, can the current decentralized, industrial, or  securities direct-investment options achieve this goal?    Xu Zhantao: The popularization of investment  subjects shows that investment subjects have shifted to a deeper  level. The profit-forces incentive of investment to proliferate  assets as a hedge against inflation, the drive of entreprenurial  creativity and aspiration, and the conversion of investment  operating forces, have sharply strengthened the public oversight  and restraint mechanisms for investment, promoting a steady  increase in investment microeconomic efficiency. In contrast to  a single financing means, this is a great advance.    But it needs to be noted that for the ordinary small and  midsize investor, these investment means also involve many  adverse factors. 1. In industrial investment, as the public  lacks the knowledge and skill to do feasibility studies of  projects, the ability to make accurate market analyses and  projections, modern business management techniques, and the  capability to utilize advanced S&amp;T, this unavoidably creates  unchecked and duplicate investment in enterprises, thus making  it hard to avoid poor investment efficiency, and even the risk  of bankruptcy. Moreover, as such investments are small, it is  hard to make decentralized and package investments, thus making  it difficult to disperse and reduce investment risks. Also, due  probably to the ulterior motives and fraudulent fundraising of  certain private enterprises, it is hard to keep public investors  from being cheated and engulfed by unfortunate evil  consequences. 2. In securities investment, as small investors  have no stock market knowledge, and inadequate investment might  for repeated investment in many securities, the investment risks  are obvious. 3. Macroeconomically, small investments are adverse  to a rational pooling of construction funds, the control of  investment scale, the upgrading of investment structure and  improvement of efficiency, the optimum disposition of resources,  the stability and growth of stock markets, and even social  stability.    Reporter: Prosperity leads to thoughts of  investment. Since reform and opening, China's productive forces  have been developed sharply, with public and enterprise  self-accumulation growing steadily. Incomplete statistics show  the Chinese public to now have over 2 trillion yuan in financial  capital, an average of nearly 2,000 yuan a person, and almost  4,000 yuan a person in coastal zones, with enterprise self-owned  assets-accumulation also quite sizeable. What investment means  would you choose to effectively avoid risks and earn higher  returns?    Xu Zhantao: I hold that the development of a new  public pooled trust and investment means--investment funds, is  the more ideal option.    Investment funds are a unique means of fundraising,  differing  from fundraising through either bank savings and various bonds  or through stocks and stock rights, rather using fund shares or  beneficiary documents to raise funds from small and midsize  investors. While they have set terms (which stocks do not), they  do not have fixed, advance-set returns (which deposits and bonds  do). Moreover, they give investors some powers similar to  shareholders.    Investment funds are a unique investment means, being  neither  a simple credit investment or one in the shares of a single  enterprise, but rather a comprehensive investment integrating  creditor rights, property interests, and stock rights.    Investment funds are a unique investment-operation system.  While bank loans are a bonded debt credit system, and stock  investment is an ownership system, investment funds are a pooled  trust system, an expert agent investment-operation system in  which "agents are entrusted with money management."    Investment funds are a unique financial commodity and  investment instrument, being a financial commodity somewhere  between savings, deposits, bonds, and stocks, or a borderline,  composite financial commodity, and a comprehensive investment  instrument integrating stock rights, property interests, and  creditor rights.    Investment funds reflect unique, diversified economic  relations. Financial allocations reflect voluntary distribution  relations, bank deposits and all types of bonds reflect  intermediary relations between bonded debt and credit, and  stocks or stock rights reflect the relations between owners and  operators, while investment funds reflect diversified economic  relations among the four parties of investors, sponsors,  managers, and custodians.    It could be said that investment funds create a public,  pooled, trust-agent investment means between bank-credit  intermediate investment and public and individual direct  investment, being a popular, democratic, and collective  investment means. Their appearance will inevitably set off  another investment-system change, being bound to speed up the  formation of a new fundraising and investment mechanism, to make  the disposition of public resources more efficient and optimal.  This means will be more suited to the public investment needs  of a country like China with a huge population that is just  beginning to prosper, where individual assets are relatively  decentralized, and where most investors are small and midsize.    Reporter: It is understood that China now  has 45 investment funds of all types, with funds topping 4.2  billion yuan. What do you believe is the significance and impact  of the birth and development of this new investment means suited  to public investment?    Xu Zhantao: While its significance is multiple, it  is mainly: 1. It will contribute to further investment-system  change, strengthening public oversight and restraint forces for  investment; 2. It will help to intensify financial reform,  promoting a rational adjustment of our national  financial-capital structure, and lowering commercial-bank risk;  3. It will be favorable to stock market stability and  development, reducing blind with-the-wave transactions by and  short-supply manipulation of small and midsize investors; 4. It  will benefit the attraction of foreign investment, expanding  foreign-investment scale, limits, and targets, without turning  China's foreign-currency debt into a case of killing many birds  with one stone; 5. It will be advantageous to macroeconomic  regulation and control. As investment funds are a standardized  means of public fundraising, the state can regulate, control,  and guide them to regulate, control, and guide stock markets. In  contrast to regulating hundreds of thousands of small and  midsize investors to stabilize stock markets, this will be much  easier and produce much better results.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Delors rekindles Elysee ambitions Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is in two minds about entering the race to succeed Mr Francois Mitterrand as president of France. For at least 12 months, Mr Delors, 68, has disavowed presidential ambitions. The battle to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European union drained him. He has shown more interest lately in a retirement devoted to intellectual pursuits. 'I've been working for almost 48 years,' he has said, 'it's time to hand over to the younger generation.' The resignation of Mr Michel Rocard as head of the French Socialist party changes the picture. Mr Delors has always made clear that he would not run against Mr Rocard and split the Socialist party. Mr Rocard's defeat in a vote of confidence at the weekend thus removes a precondition for an attempt on the presidency. It does not, however, answer the question of whether Mr Delors really has his eye on the Elysee Palace after 10 years in the top Commission post in Brussels - period in which he has helped to set the political agenda for the Continent. Those close to Mr Delors believe that he would find it difficult to resist a call from the Left to become presidential candidate, especially if there was no-one of stature to challenge either Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, or Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, on the Right. Most likely, Mr Delors would seek to avoid being candidate of the Socialist party alone (he prides himself on cross-party appeal with his Christian socialist credentials and fiscal orthodoxy). He would be in a strong position to dictate terms to his party comrades. One worry is how he would react to a presidential campaign. Mr Delors is notoriously thin-skinned about criticism. No wonder aides were stressing yesterday that he would serve out his final term until January 5, 1995. It keeps him in his Brussels power-base, storing up energy for what would have to be a short, sharp campaign. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

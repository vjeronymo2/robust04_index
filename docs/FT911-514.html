			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Markets (At a glance): Two new unit trusts from Prolific Prolific, the fund management group, is launching two unit trusts in an effort to take advantage of the improving conditions in the UK economy. The Prolific recovery unit trust will aim for capital growth by investing in a spread of relatively risky shares that have potentially high rewards. The Prolific UK blue chip unit trust will aim for an above average total return of capital and income, by investing mainly in companies that are part of the FTSE 100 index. Much of the balance of the portfolio will be invested in the second hundred largest companies. The trusts require a minimum investment of Pounds 500 and will be launched on May 25.</p>

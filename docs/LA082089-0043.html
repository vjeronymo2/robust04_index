			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE;  </P> <P> HOTEL GETS A $65-MILLION FACE LIFT  </P> <P> The lobby lounge and cafe at the Regent Beverly Wilshire have been redesigned,  marking the completion of the $65-million first-phase renovation of the  landmark hotel at Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Designed by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm of Gruen Associates, the  renovation restores "the original architectural character of the hotel, which  has been obscured and modified over the years," according to Kurt Franzen of  Gruen.  </P> <P> The major design program is aimed at reclaiming the hotel's place as one of the  "finest in the nation," according to Robert H. Burns, president of Regent  International Hotels, the owner.  </P> <P> Interior designer Glenn Texeira, principal of Project Associates, said his  firm's goal was "to create a truly grand hotel in the finest European  tradition." The lobby is designed in tones of gold, beige and brown marble, he  said.  </P> <P> Also part of the first phase renovation of the 61-year-old building was the  renovation of the Wilshire Wing of the hotel with larger rooms, reducing the  number from 220 to 147. Special acoustical windows have been installed that can  be opened, yet almost completely eliminate traffic noise.  </P> <P> The second phase of the renovation, scheduled for completion by next spring,  encompasses the 235-room Beverly Wing. The wing, constructed in 1971, is  undergoing a "floor-by-floor refurbishment," according to Franzen.  </P></p>

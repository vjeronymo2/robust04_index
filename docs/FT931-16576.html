			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Warning on home repossessions LABOUR warned yesterday that an apparent 15 per cent fall in house repossessions provoked by mortgage arrears was disguising a real increase in the number of families under threat. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said independent analysis suggested there had been a 6 per cent rise in the number of homes under suspended repossession orders. Sir George Young, the housing minister, said actual repossessions were down and the pressure of mortgage repayments on individuals was being systematically eased by the fall in interest rates.</p>

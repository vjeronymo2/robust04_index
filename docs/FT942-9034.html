			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Wiser US to meet chastened Japan / Preview of the resumption of trade talks It is an older, perhaps wiser, Clinton administration awaiting the arrival tomorrow of a somewhat chastened Japanese trade team whose mission it is to help salvage the US-Japan trade relationship. Both sides have had more than three months to reflect on the consequences of the breakdown of bilateral talks. The mood is slightly more optimistic than when talks broke down in February at the summit between President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the former Japanese prime minister, over Washington's insistence on specific indicators to mark the progress of market-opening deals. Yet even at this stage, there are few signs that substantial progress can be made. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, says he has been promised a new plan by Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's new prime minister, which would address the question of 'objective criteria' for measuring market access. 'We have passed the ideological issues,' said another administration official. 'They know we don't want managed trade. The issue now is can we find a way to negotiate around reality.' In the sombre halls of Tokyo's ministry of international trade and industry, officials have allowed themselves to be encouraged. 'The US is sending positive signals in that its rhetoric is no longer as heated as it used to be,' says one trade official. 'If we are realistic, and don't set the hurdles too high from the start, then we may be able to discuss what is needed in order to begin talks on restarting the negotiations.' The US and Japan each have their own reasons for needing to find a way forward. Both have been jolted by the tumbling dollar and climbing yen and Japan remains mired in recession. As Japanese trade officials admit, recent market turmoil has highlighted the negative impact that the chill between Washington and Tokyo has on the markets and on the rest of the world. 'We realise that our actions have an impact on the markets and that for two of the biggest economies in the world to continue to have strained relations is not a good situation,' said one. Japanese bureaucrats are also sensitive to criticism that their intransigence over quantitative indicators of progress in opening Japan's markets to foreign products and services might have been a factor in pushing things to the brink. Next time round, they say, 'we don't intend to take an inflexible stance'. President Clinton is being criticised at home by the right and the left who say he is running messy and contradictory foreign and trade policies. Japan's Asian neighbours have expressed concern about the uncertainty. Trading partners in Europe are also worried. Although neither side can afford another failure, there is little evidence that either will sharply change course. What may be under way is a shift in emphasis from the disputed numerical 'indicators' to an emphasis on macro-economics. The US set out in April a basis for restarting the informal talks. It wants a commitment by Tokyo to a relatively long period of consumer-led growth and macro-economic steps to stimulate the Japanese economy - continued income tax reductions and public investment; as well as increased access for competitive foreign products and services; and objective criteria. For Japan, progress on the first point, along lines that would satisfy the US, is politically difficult. While the trade ministry believes that more should be done on the macro-economic side to stimulate the economy and thereby trade, this will require a difficult decision from a government that is fighting for its survival. Further tax cuts without a guarantee that the revenue shortfall can be made up for through alternative taxes, is strongly objected to by the ministry of finance, which wields enormous power over both the political establishment and bureaucracy. But raising Japan's consumption tax to make up for that shortfall, a scheme favoured by the finance ministry and some politicians, is strongly opposed by the Social Democratic party whose co-operation is crucial for the minority government. Dr Paula Stern, a former adviser to President Clinton, said the administration would probably get concessions on sectoral deals and numerical targets. Washington should be playing to those forces in Japan which have wanted faster growth and deregulation, she added. But despite Miti officials' claims of flexibility, there is unlikely to be any substantial change in their opposition to numerical targets for measuring market-opening. 'There are things that we can give on and things we cannot give on.' Deregulation is perhaps the key area on which the two sides can make progress. It is central to the trade ministry's plans for taking the talks forward. The Japanese government will announce by the end of June specific plans for deregulating the country's markets to improve access and stimulate the economy. It hopes these measures will convince the US that it is serious about opening its markets further. What needs to be done is to leave the rhetoric behind and look at what is realistically feasible, suggests a Japanese trade official. 'The US knows what Japan fears. We know their frustrations,' he says. The key to progress lies in whether each side can 'constructively explore a way forward that takes these concerns and frustrations into consideration.'</p>

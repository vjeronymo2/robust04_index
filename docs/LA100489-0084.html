			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON MAY BE OUT AS METS' MANAGER  </P> <P> Davey Johnson's future as manager of the New York Mets appears to be in doubt.  </P> <P> Frank Cashen, general manager of the Mets, told Newsday that he is close to a  decision concerning Johnson's future with the club, but did not elaborate.  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported Tuesday night that Johnson will be fired. AP said  Cashen confirmed that a decision had been made. "I don't want to equivocate,  but the decision has been made," the report stated.  </P> <P> AP said Cashen would not reveal the decision until he had spoken with the  manager.  </P> <P> But when the New York Times asked Cashen about the AP report, he said: "That  simply isn't true. We have not made any decision."  </P> <P> Joe McIlvaine, the Mets' vice president for baseball operations, said: "The  decision has not been made. I underline that."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, Cashen was quoted as saying, "I don't have any timetable. I  can't even discuss it with Davey. He's off fishing or something."  </P> <P> From Newsday came this Cashen quote: "He's the manager of the team until I tell  him differently."  </P> <P> Newsday said Johnson, convinced he's about to be fired, apparently is refusing  to take calls from Cashen.  </P> <P> It appears the only obstacle to dismissing Johnson appears to be Cashen's  inability to reach his manager, who is believed to be fishing near his home  outside of Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> Johnson, who has two years left on a three-year contract, has not been eager to  speak with Cashen since a meeting last week that Johnson believes was a prelude  to his firing.  </P> <P> Dugout coach Bud Harrelson reportedly is the leading candidate to become the  next manager.  </P> <P> The Mets bid farewell to 35-year-old co-captains Gary Carter and Keith  Hernandez Tuesday. Cashen told both to find different clubs for next season.  They are eligible to become free agents.  </P> <P> At a press conference for the two Tuesday, Carter and Hernandez came to  Johnson's defense.  </P> <P> "I don't think Davey is the guy to point a finger at," Carter said. "It's  everybody's fault."  </P> <P> Said Hernandez: "Davey's big plus is that he works well with young players.  Patience is one of Davey's strong points."  </P></p>

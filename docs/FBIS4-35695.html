			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today, the newspaper TISHRIN  asserts that Syria has participated in the peace process in  response to a U.S. initiative stemming from specific bases and  in exchange for a series of U.S. assurances on the  implementation of the Security Council resolutions, the  land-for-peace principle, and the achievement of a just and  comprehensive settlement on all fronts of the conflict.    TISHRIN notes that, from the very beginning, Syria insisted  that the bases of the Madrid conference should be clear and  unequivocal because it knows well that Israel rejects peace.  Syria also knows about Israel's procrastination, falsification  of facts, attempts to deceive world public opinion, and  expression of intentions that are the opposite of its real  intentions. Yet, even these former intentions were never shown  throughout more than two and a half years of the Washington  talks.    The paper adds: The United States made efforts and  frequently sent its secretary of state to the region. However,  the Israeli intransigence remained unchanged, and the Rabin  government refused to withdraw from the Golan and other occupied  territories, thus rejecting the implementation of the Security  Council resolutions in this regard.    TISHRIN demands that the United States, which committed  itself to playing the role of a full and fair partner, force  Israel to commit itself to implementing the Security Council's  resolutions, so that the entire Golan will return to Syria and  the other occupied territories will return to their Arab owners.  This is because it is in the interest of the United States and  the international community that international law, the  principles of justice, and the UN charters prevail and that  national and human rights be respected everywhere.    The paper asserts that Syria continues to reject calls for  secret talks, and that the Washington talks, which have  continued since the Madrid conference, are the most ideal  framework. Syria continues to declare its positions publicly,  and the Syrian policy has only one face and one consistent  position.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Syria can never be dragged into  partial settlements. It does not bargain over the territories  of Arab brethren, and will not sell out an iota of the pan-Arab  soil.</p>

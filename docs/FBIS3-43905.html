			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Lusaka peace talks are continuing with UN  Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye at the helm. Their  pace has been slow but sure. That slowness is understandable  because of the complexity of the process for the resolution of a  conflict that is, itself, very complex. The first point in the  political talks has to do with the formation of the new national  police force and the two sides have been discussing it since 6  January so they can then discuss national reconciliation issues.  Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] information secretary and the  deputy chief of the UNITA team to the Lusaka peace talks, has  rejected all reports of a deadlock at the talks. He has told  Radio France International that the talks continue to make  progress and that there are clear hopes for an accord.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] Instead of being held in the  style of the Bicesse talks, these talks on the formation of the  new police force have been held in an extremely serious manner,  and from the point (?of view of) [words indistinct] that is  possible and democratic is always on the negotiating table.  That is why people have become accustomed to (?more dynamic  talks) and now, when you see a debate [words indistinct] that is  seen as deadlock. There is no deadlock at all. Rather, there  are serious discussions under way. (?The other side) has  replied to our document and we can say that valid theories for a  legal state (?have been advanced). We hope that the mediators  -- who should be giving us the document today -- will have been  able to reduce the gap between the two sides so that points of  disagreement can be overcome. Nonetheless, discussions are  under way and they are showing progress. There has been serious  progress and, without entering into explanations for the benefit  of the public, (?they should think) that things are moving  forward.    [Unidentified reporter] And when will these police issue  discussions be over, so that other issues can be examined,  notably sharing power (?with) Luanda?    [Valentim] Once this point has been discussed, we will talk  about national reconciliation and, as you can see, that issue is  crucial for UNITA's substantive participation in government.  However, it does not include all the [words indistinct] national  reconciliation. There are various facets to it. That is why,  when we get there, we will also be giving our views on how  Angola should approach the national reconciliation issue.    [Reporter] That might mean, then, that talks could go on for  several weeks yet?    [Valentim] Well, it is not a matter of the talks going on.  These are serious talks. We are walking the burning coals of  political differences. What happens is that many people thought  the main differences would reside in military issues and that  political issues would be easy to settle. In the final  analysis, though, what we want to solve is the Angolan crisis  and, to that end, we must define a political, legal, social, and  economic framework so that the Angolan people can understand and  accept each other.

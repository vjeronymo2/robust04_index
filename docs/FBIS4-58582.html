			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "source" from the General People's </F> Committee for Unity; place and date not given]    [Text] What is happening these days concerning what is  known as the signing of an agreement between the 'Arafat group  and the Israelis on limited self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is a  form of falsification. The Arab Palestinian people have not been  asked its view on this agreement, and therefore what has been  signed is binding only to the signatories who have relinquished  the inalienable and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,  recognized by all the states of the world through international  resolutions adopted at the United Nations, resolutions that  affirm the national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people  to all its land.    This insignificant signing is a unilateral solution that  gives the Israelis rights to what does not belong to them. It  expresses the submission of some Palestinian leaders to the  American-Zionist conspiracy aimed at fragmenting the Arab nation  and enabling the Zionist enemy, by force, to control the Arab  homeland, so that the Israelis may become the foundation of a  Middle East order due to their military might and their weapons  of mass destruction that come under no international control.    In addition, the crusading west, which bears rancor against  the Arab nation and Muslims, continues to supply the Israelis  with the most modern means of destruction, the last of which was  the deal on American strategic bomber jets, which can cover the  distance from Pakistan in the east to Morocco in the west.  Moreover, the Israelis continue their occupation of the Arab  lands from Egypt's Umm al-Rashrash [Eilat] to the Syrian Golan  Heights and southern Lebanon.    The position of the Arab nation is firm concerning a just  and  comprehensive peace, which comes down to the return to their  countries of origin of the Jews which emigrated to Palestine  while fleeing persecution, the return of the Palestinian people  to their own land, and establishing a Palestinian democratic  state on all the territory of Palestine. This solution is the  one that guarantees peace in the region, and spares the Jews the  danger of extermination which the west is seeking to secure  against them.    The emergence of what is called Israel after World War II,  as  a result of this war, must be removed, similar to the other  arrangements, such as the Berlin Wall and the problem of the  people of South Africa.</p>

They have apparently already moved to head off any settling  of scores which might take place after the death of patriarch  Deng Xiaoping.    Chinese sources said that in recent internal addresses, Mr.  Jiang made repeated reference to the way in which the student  movement in Shanghai had been defused in a "peaceful" manner.  Mr. Jiang was party boss of Shanghai before his elevation to  party general- secretary on June 24, 1989.    The speeches were made in the context of measures the  leadership was taking this year to prevent an outbreak of  massive social disorder, the sources said yesterday.    "The central leadership must be careful and judicious in  handling national disturbances," said Mr. Jiang in a  thinly-veiled reference to June 4. "We in Shanghai were able to  neutralise the trouble- making elements without upsetting  stability."    The leadership decided soon after the crackdown to freeze  the  "Tiananmen Square issue", particularly the question of  responsibility, until the death of Mr. Deng.    While the military side of the operation was supervised by  Mr. Deng and Yang Shangkun, respectively the chairman and  secretary- general of the Central Military Commission, Mr. Jiang  played a sizeable role in crisis management, including ousting  then-party chief Zhao Ziyang and other "bourgeois liberals" in  the party.    "Technically, Jiang remained Shanghai party boss till late  June 1989, and he can claim credit for the way the Shanghai  leadership, including then-mayor Zhu Rongji, managed to put out  the rebellion without bloodshed," a source said.    Diplomats in Beijing said that after Mr. Deng's death, three  politicians would be susceptible to be made scapegoats: Premier  Li Peng, Beijing party boss Chen Xitong, and his predecessor, Li  Ximing.    "For the sake of unity, Deng's successors will not finger  their patron," said a senior Western diplomat. "However, just  as the Gang of Four were accused of misleading Chairman Mao, the  two Li's and Chen might be stigmatised for giving Deng the wrong  advice."    According to party sources, Li Ximing, who retired from the  Politburo and his position of Beijing party boss in late 1992,  recently tried to exonerate himself in a seminar on recent party  history. "Historical events, including those in the party, were  never caused by a small group of people," Mr. Li reportedly said.    The party sources said Mr. Deng's assessment of the severity  of the student demonstrations in April and May 1989 were partly  based on verbal accounts given to him by Mr. Li and Mr. Chen,  then mayor of Beijing. Premier Li became the symbol of the  suppression partly because he declared martial law in Beijing on  May 20, 1989. However, the sources said, because he was not as  close to Mr. Deng as Mr. Yang, Mr. Jiang or Mr. Li, his role in  the decision to use drastic measures against the students might  have been less than expected.    The sources said National People's Congress chairman Qiao  Shi  could benefit most from the "blame game" that would be played  after Mr. Deng's demise. At a crucial meeting of the Politburo  Standing Committee in late May, Mr. Qiao abstained from a vote  on whether to move the troops to the capital.</p>

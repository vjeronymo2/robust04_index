			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF: ;  </P> <P> ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> ** 1/2 Queensryche, "Empire," EMI. A critic's dilemma: Seattle's Queensryche is  a politically correct heavy-metal band, non-sexist, anti-oppression, anti-drug,  involving its huge teen audience in its relatively sophisticated analyses of  social problems.  </P> <P> Yet here the band is absolutely mainstream, with the kind of bombastic power  ballads, sappy hooks and screeching Dio-esque vocals -- waaaaaah!!! -- that  tend to inspire anybody but the converted to snap the radio to an all-talk  station. But someone is listening. The album only took two weeks to break into  the national Top 10. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

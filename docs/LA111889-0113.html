			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Amdahl Corp. Lays Off 400: The Sunnyvale maker of mainframe computer systems  blamed steep price discounting by International Business Machines, its primary  competitor, and the strong U.S. dollar for the cuts, which were effective  Friday and will hit about 5% of its work force. About 80% of the layoffs will  be made at the company's plants in the Silicon Valley. Amdahl becomes the  latest of several computer makers to resort to layoffs as conditions in the  computer industry tighten.  </P></p>

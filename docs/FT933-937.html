			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Appeal on Trinidad terms Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, yesterday called for a further strengthening of the Trinidad terms for giving debt relief to the poorest developing countries, writes Peter Norman. In a speech to the policy-making interim committee of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Clarke said the waiting period during which countries qualified for a reduction of their stock of official debt should be cut from the present three to four years. He later suggested that 12 months might be sufficient for countries with a good record of economic reform. Mr Clarke also said the rate of debt reduction should be increased to two thirds, from 50 per cent.</p>

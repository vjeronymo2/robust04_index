			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Norway, Finland lead European markets Scandinavian equity markets showed impressive performances last week, with Norway and Finland in particular standing out. In spite of losses in Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Hong Kong, strength elsewhere left the FT-Actuaries world index up 1 per cent in local currency terms. Norway and Finland have both been lifted recently by sharp cuts in domestic interest rates: as a result Oslo's all-share index put on 8 per cent over the week and Helsinki's Hex index added 4 per cent. Mr Peter Tron, senior manager at Unibank Securities in London, said that there was noticeable evidence of foreign liquidity driving the Norwegian market last week, while the strength of the dollar also helped lift sentiment. Finland, he added, witnessed another base rate cut and investors remained confident about the prospect for corporate earnings following the depreciation of the Finnish markka. In Sweden, results from SKF, which came in better than expectations, helped to restore confidence. A rate cut on Thursday also contributed to the Affarsvarlden index's 3.5 per cent weekly gain. Denmark, of all the Scandinavian markets, remarked Mr Tron, shows the greatest potential for earnings growth, having so far done little to reduce interest rates since the realignment of the ERM. He forecast a 20 per cent upside in the market's all-share index by the end of the year, coinciding with a cut in short-term interest rates from the present 12.8 per cent to 4.75 per cent by the middle of 1994. Among other global equity markets, Mexico pulled back some of its losses earlier in the week on Friday on news that a satisfactory conclusion had been reached in negotiations on side accords to the North American Free Trade Agreement. New Zealand, still a strong performer over the year to date, suffered from weakness in Telecom shares.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change   % change in                  % change in local currency**    sterling**  USDollars**              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of     Start of                                           1993      1993         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +1.33    +10.06    +38.88   +25.59    +22.88       +18.45 Belgium      +0.49     +1.24    +26.79   +21.76    +14.74       +10.61 Denmark      +1.97     +5.88    +17.83   +28.62    +18.37       +14.11 Finland      +6.65    +18.22   +136.60   +80.80    +66.26       +60.28 France       +0.30     +8.85    +25.49   +18.50    +12.16        +8.12 Germany      +1.96     +5.09    +23.32   +23.09    +20.90       +16.55 Ireland      +1.79     +6.09    +41.91   +44.16    +25.54       +21.02 Italy        +0.21     +5.92    +68.40   +44.58    +36.11       +31.20 Netherlands  +2.23     +4.71    +26.02   +21.86    +19.35       +15.06 Norway       +8.11    +11.40    +48.10   +37.23    +31.88       +27.13 Spain        +3.67     +9.10    +40.74   +31.83    +10.25        +6.28 Sweden       +2.96    +10.97    +56.60   +29.48    +16.27       +12.09 Switzerland  +1.27     +2.79    +36.51   +20.03    +19.53       +15.22 UK           +1.38     +6.56    +33.75    +7.90     +7.90        +4.02 EUROPE       +1.47     +6.37    +33.12   +17.48    +14.23       +10.12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +0.81     +2.70    +13.57   +15.57    +18.38       +14.11 Hong Kong    -0.57     +5.00    +21.13   +32.61    +37.34       +32.39 Japan        +1.55     +1.82    +49.30   +27.47    +61.54       +55.72 Malaysia     -0.03     +8.63    +55.90   +35.10    +43.60       +38.44 New Zealand  -2.01     +9.29    +28.39   +23.49    +37.52       +32.57 Singapore    +3.06     +9.26    +41.96   +24.45    +31.62       +26.88 Canada       +1.80     +2.61    +10.35   +12.09    +12.43        +8.38 USA          +0.34     +0.87     +8.12    +3.38     +7.24        +3.38 Mexico       -1.33     +4.15    +18.51    -1.90     +1.93        -1.74 South Africa -1.82     -3.51    +26.90   +26.44    +35.34       +30.47 WORLD INDEX  +0.98     +2.62    +24.90   +14.42    +23.91       +19.46  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on August 13th 1993.

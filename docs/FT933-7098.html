			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Raise status of vocational training Sir, While I agree wholeheartedly with the views expressed by Mr J E Troth regarding the stigma of the work-based vocational route for 16-year-olds ('Training on job needs better image', August 18), I would suggest that there are two main obstacles to progress. The first is the absurdity in which schools get a full year's money for each pupil entering sixth form, even if the pupil leaves after a few weeks; the second, a careers service that is both under-resourced and falls under the quasi-political control of the local education authorities which still control most schools. One solution would be to make the careers service independent and give each 16-year-old a training credit (as advocated by the Confederation of British Industry), which could be used to pay for training at school, college or via youth training with an employer who offers a full-time job from day one. Payment would be made only on the achievement of results. Real progress towards giving 16-years-olds a genuine choice will be made only when we have a combined department of education and training that puts equal value on all post-16 education and training.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 28 Mar (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella today admitted that the U.S. Government "is exerting  pressure" to ensure passage of the law on pharmaceuticals  patents. He pointed out, however, that "no law is promulgated to  please that country."    In remarks to the Continental radio station, Di Tella said  the Argentine Government "sent the draft bill to Congress two  years ago because Argentine interests called for this  procedure." He added: "A law is not promulgated to please the  United States."    "This is not done in exchange for something. We cannot  attract high technology or investors without having a law to  protect patents. It is in Argentina's interest to sanction this  law," he emphasized.    He also said: "A group of enterprises is waiting for the  patents law to be approved to decide whether or not to invest in  Argentina." He added: "This law goes beyond the pharmaceuticals  issue."    Di Tella said Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's election  to  the OAS secretariat general "resulted from a phone call made by  President Carlos Menem."    Di Tella asserted that Argentine support "determined" the  Colombian president's decision to run as a candidate.    "We could not campaign in his favor unless he presented his  candidacy. This is what he did and the results were very good,"  Di Tella said referring to Gaviria's elections as the new OAS  secretary general.    The foreign minister explained that the "OAS has progressed  very much in the last 10 years." He pointed out that the  organization "helped several countries leave behind undemocratic  situations." He added: "UN cooperation has been very effective."    Di Tella concluded by saying: "We need an OAS working side  by side with the United Nations. With Gaviria's presence, the  OAS will be in a more important position to participate in  discussions about the economy of the region."</p>

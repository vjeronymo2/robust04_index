			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Abdul Rahman Sulaiman] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Dr. Mahathir  Mohamed Thursday met with Cambodia's Co-Prime Ministers Prince  Norodom Ranaridh and Hun Sen for discussions to further enhance  the growth of ties between the two countries.    The prime minister was accompanied by Foreign Minister  Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Primary Industries Minister Dr. Lim Keng  Yaik and other officials to the talks held at the Cambodian  prime ministers' office.    Cambodia, which is undergoing economic rehabilitation and  reconstruction following the restoration of peace and stability,  is said to be keen to emulate Malaysia's economic success as  well as that of its other ASEAN neighbours.    Dr. Mahathir, here for a two-day official visit at the  invitation of the Cambodian Government, arrived Thursday morning  together with a 23-member official delegation.    Also with him was his wife Dr. Siti Hasmah Mohamed Ali and  69  Malaysian businessmen.    The business delegation, led by Arab Malaysia Merchant Bank  Berhad [Limited] executive chairman Azman Hashim, is here to  further explore business and investment opportunities in this  former socialist state whose potentials are still largely  untapped.    Despite Thursday being the Cambodian new year and public  holiday here, the prime minister and his entourage were given a  rousing welcome on arrival at the Pochentong International  Airport, near here.    Dr. Mahathir and Dr. Siti Hasmah were received by First  Prime  Minister Prince Ranariddh and his wife.    Later, the prime minister had an audience with King Norodom  Sihanouk who had just returned home from medical treatment  abroad specially to welcome the Malaysian leader.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, 28 May (TANJUG) -- The Serbian Internal  Affairs Ministry has detained representatives of the "Kosovo  Illegal Chamber of Commerce" who unlawfully tried to set up a  "Kosovo Chamber of Commerce."    As a meeting of the "executive committee" of this illegal  organization was due to start the police stormed the premises,  prevented the meeting from taking place and arrested Ismailj  Kastrati and Sulejman Ahmetaj, the "president" and "secretary"  of this Albanian "chamber", together with 11 "committee"  members. The first two were detained while the others were  released after interrogation.    Reporting on this incident, the newspaper BUJKU said that  the  police acted correctly. The paper also recalls the statements  by Serbian officials saying they will not tolerate any  organization of parallel power in Kosmet.    BUJKU admits that the Serbian authorities granted licenses  to  14,000 private enterprises whose owners were mostly ethnic  Albanians, but they cannot accept their being organized outside  official institutions.    The Chamber of Commerce of Kosovo and Metohija does exist in  Pristina. It represents the interests of all economic subjects  regardless of their nationality. Ethnic Albanians are also  members, and some of their private entrepreneurs are even using  the premises that they leased from the Chamber.    However, the political group rallied round Ibrahim Rugova is  trying to establish the parallel forms of power and thus prove  that Kosovo is outside Serbia and that it is allegedly "a  separate independent state."</p>

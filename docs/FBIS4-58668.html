			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Vienna, 5 May (KUNA) -- Austrian economic and  trading circles have received warnings from Kuwait that the  contacts between certain trading and industrial companies in  Austria and other European states and the Iraqi regime may have  a negative effect on the future of cooperation between Kuwait in  particular and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries in general  with those companies.    A well-informed Austrian source told KUNA here today that  Kuwaiti officials have expressed deep concern over the contacts  between some Austrian companies and a delegation from the Iraqi  Ba'th Party which visited Austria recently under the leadership  of former ambassador 'Abd al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, the director of  foreign affairs in the Ba'th party.    The source also said that Kuwait is closely following these  contacts and officials consider that "the relevant Austrian and  other European companies are in breach of the international  sanctions imposed on Iraq" at a time when the Iraqi regime is  not committing itself to implementing the UN resolutions as a  condition for lifting the economic sanctions imposed on it since  it occupied Kuwait in 1990.    Kuwaiti officials do not rule out the possibility of  interrupting cooperation with those companies if they continue  their contacts and cooperation with the Iraqi regime before it  implements all the UN resolutions.

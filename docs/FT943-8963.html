			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / A harp, a wreath and a sentence in Siberia: Chrystia Freeland's favourite aunt recounts how she survived a 'child's sentence' in Stalin's labour camps My favourite great-aunt spent 10 years in Stalinist labour camps for two crimes: buying a funeral wreath and playing the harp at a dinner party. The funeral wreath was purchased in 1944, when Oleksandra Blavatska, my Aunt Lesia, was 19 years old. She had pursued her childhood dream of becoming a businesswoman by enrolling in the newly-established Soviet Trade Institute. She had been studying for only a few months when Metropolitan Sheptytsky, head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, died. He was revered, Lesia says, as 'the holiest of holies' for his defiance of both the Nazis and the Soviets during the Second World War. Raised in a patriotic and activist Ukrainian household, Lesia's response was automatic: she called together her classmates and collected money for a wreath. 'We bought a beautiful wreath with red linden at the centre, as was the Ukrainian national custom,' Lesia recalls. With what is almost a girlish giggle, my 69-year-old aunt explains why her funeral flowers were so provocative: 'And on a black band draped across the wreath we wrote 'To the unforgettable defender of Ukrainian youth from the students of the Soviet Trade Institute.' The Bolsheviks - not known for their sense of humour - could never forgive me for that.' The day after the funeral, she was expelled from the institute and the midnight interrogations at KGB headquarters, which began for Lesia as soon as the Soviet army took over the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, intensified. But a dinner party a few months later was the last straw. When a delegation of Soviet Ukrainian writers came to Lviv they were entertained by Lesia's mother, the city's most accomplished hostess in the old days of Austro-Hungarian, and later Polish, rule. While Mrs Blavatska charmed the writers by chatting in French, her daughter, the only harpist in the city (the harp was a ploy to get Lesia into the conservatory after she had been expelled from the trade institute) provided a musical accompaniment. A few weeks later, Lesia was arrested on her way to the conservatory and she began an education of a different sort. Over the next decade she progressed from KGB interrogation cells to a tour of Soviet labour camps. Along the way, she gave birth to my second favourite aunt, Vira, 'Faith', who spent her early childhood separated from her mother in a Soviet orphanage. The only time Vira, now a professor of engineering, refers to her unorthodox upbringing is in laughing apology for her preference for trousers over skirts and lack of the culinary talent. 'I was raised by Soviet commandants, how could I be properly civilised?' she tells me to excuse the store-bought cakes served with tea - a true crime in a proper Lviv household, especially when the visitor is a relative from Canada. Lesia, a vigorous lady who upholds the family name by plying me with home baking, is equally matter-of-fact in describing KGB interrogation tactics to me, the sheltered Canadian granddaughter of her cousin (my grandfather) who got away in 1939. 'The KGB cell had an open window and it was winter, so there was ice and snow on the floor. It was full of rats. It was exactly seven steps wide: I know because I paced back and forth all day and all night.' After 18 days in the isolation cell, Lesia collapsed. 'I was young and I loved to dance but I told myself that if I was ever again able to walk I would never dance. I've kept that promise.' Unconscious, Lesia was carried into a larger, crowded jail cell, where she spent two months, and then she was sentenced. 'Because I was so young and they really couldn't find anything at all to accuse me of I was given what we called 'a child's sentence;'' just 10 years of hard labour and five years of exile in Siberia. The journeys between camps were the worst part. 'A hundred prisoners would be herded into locked cattle cars with a hole in the middle to use as a toilet. Every day we were given one slice of salted herring, a piece of bread and a bottle of water,' Lesia says. 'I couldn't bring myself to eat the herring and maybe that was what saved me.' Early in her sentence, when she was in a labour camp in the Baltic state of Estonia, Lesia was conned by more savvy inmates into selling part of her food ration in exchange for promised assistance to escape. 'This was, of course, very stupid, because no one ever escaped Stalin's camps. But I was tricked and I sold them some of my food. My body began to decay and one day the work captain said he would no longer accept me, so I got even less food. Slowly, I began to die.' Saved by a sympathetic doctor in the prison infirmary, Lesia recovered and was sent to the labour camp in Mordova in northwestern Russia where she would serve most of her sentence. Vira, born in the Estonian prison, was initially kept together with other children in a camp adjacent to their mothers but when the children were 18 months old they were sent to an orphanage in Siberia. 'If the caretaker at the orphanage was very kind, once a year she would send me a letter about my daughter. Three times the prison wardens called me and asked me to give her up for adoption, but each time I refused and began a hunger strike. Eventually, they gave up,' Lesia says. While Vira grew up, her mother devoted herself to survival. 'It was a very select camp: we had the prima ballerina of the Minsk ballet, Hitler's private secretary, a few Parisians and some Moscow girls who had married diplomats.' The diplomats' wives, Lesia remembers, 'laughed at themselves. They used to say, 'we are here because we had too great a weakness for stockings and chocolate and so we married American men'.' 'There's no doubt about it, though, it is hard to get out of a labour camp alive.' Lesia preserved her body with a rapidly acquired public cunning - no more selling her food to other inmates - and her soul with small acts of private defiance. She proudly shows me the relic of one such gesture: a misshapen gold wedding band, her mother's, which Lesia hid from the prison wardens during a decade of body searches by wearing it under a dirt-encrusted bandage on one of her toes. 'For 10 years I didn't take that bandage off. It was so dirty and disgusting and rotten it made my skin crawl to look at it. But the guards couldn't bear to examine it too closely either, so I still have my mother's wedding ring. I think I might be one of the only people who ever managed to hide something from Stalin's police.' It is a struggle to reconcile this tough political prisoner, whose bald head and emaciated body caused Vira, reunited with her mother after a seven-year separation, to run away in terror, with my charming, very proper aunt, who prefers Vienna - 'that is Europe, that is culture' she rhapsodises - to the sky-scrapers and consumer paradise of my native Edmonton, Alberta, proud home of the world's biggest shopping mall. My cousin Lesyk, her grand-son, barges in to announce that the tea is getting cold and the tortes will dry out. 'Don't be a Bolshevik,' Lesia commands. 'Wait until the lady has finished speaking.' With a guilty glance at my tattered jeans and bare feet, I realise that the woman in question is me. I also realise that the old-fashioned politesse on which my aunt Lesia so sternly insists is part of the defiance which brought her out of the labour camps alive. Much of Lviv still wears the grey, hang-dog expression which characterised all Soviet cities, but in hercrammed flat, Lesia has preserved a bygone corner of central Europe. One last question: how did you survive? 'I'm not sure. We former political prisoners often tell each other that the experience has warped us all somehow. That's probably true, but I think that I still appear to be quite normal. Maybe it was because my mother was such a strong disciplinarian and always insisted on good manners. Even in the labour camps, I never learned to swear, although many did; I never learned to smoke, although many did; and, unlike the more cosmopolitan girls from the big cities, I never became a lesbian.' I think guiltily of the cigarettes hidden in the bottom of my hand-bag and vow to wear a dress the next time I visit. Perhaps I should even learn how to bake.</p>

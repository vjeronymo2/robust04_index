			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Merrett may set up outside Lloyd's The Merrett Group confirmed yesterday that it could set up a new underwriting business outside of the Lloyd's market, following its withdrawal last year from the active management of Lloyd's syndicates. The group, which is chaired by Mr Stephen Merrett, the former deputy chairman of Lloyd's, transferred management of its syndicates to rival agents after losing the backing of Names, the individuals whose assets support the market. It subsequently restructured its activities around its loss-adjusting and insurance services companies and is conducting a sizeable 'run off' business  -administering the payment of claims on business underwritten by its syndicates in previous years. Merrett said yesterday: 'The group has been considering various opportunities . . . However, while the strategy is firm, the structure and constitution of any new Merrett-linked insurance vehicle remain under discussion.' Meanwhile, 39 Names who were members of syndicates managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency have dropped their legal action against the corporation of Lloyd's, the body which regulates and administers the market. After a six-year legal battle, the Names face a heavy legal bill, with costs estimated at about Pounds 1m, or an average of Pounds 26,000 a Name. The Names alleged that supervisory failures by Lloyd's were responsible for their insurance losses of more than Pounds 6m incurred in the early 1980s. They had been due in court on February 28 to attempt to prove that they were owed a legal duty of care by Lloyd's.</p>

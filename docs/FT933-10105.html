			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Romanian coalminers defiant Thousands of Romanian coalminers yesterday vowed to continue a strike in the Balkan state's Jiu Valley mines until the government agreed to their pay demands, Reuter reports from Petrosani. Mr Miron Cosma, who brought the area's 45,000 miners out on strike on Monday and has led the miners on violent marches through Bucharest over the past three years, renewed a call to Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu to visit the Jiu Valley. The miners have demanded a doubling in pay, increasing basic monthly wages to up to 224,000 lei (Dollars 280), which with bonuses would give the miners up to 500,000 lei, 10 times the national average wage.</p>

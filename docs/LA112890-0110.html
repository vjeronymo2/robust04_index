			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUELAS WINS STATE FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE  </P> <P> Rafael Ruelas of Arleta won the state featherweight championship Tuesday night  by stopping Richard Abila of Los Angeles in the seventh round of a scheduled  12-round fight at the Country Club in Reseda.  </P> <P> Ruelas, 19, ran his record to 22-0 with his 19th knockout.  </P> <P> It was the first time he fought for a title.  </P> <P> Ruelas knocked Abila down midway into the seventh round with a straight left  and the referee stopped the fight. Ruelas dominated the fight, winning each  round easily as Abila (16-7) threw few punches and didn't land many.  </P> <P> Earlier, former middleweight contender Alex Ramos, a New Yorker living in Simi  Valley, weathered a severe beating early in the fifth round and stopped Roberto  Rosiles at the end of the round.  </P> <P> It was Ramos' second victory in two fights since a two-year layoff. A member of  the 1980 U.S. Olympic team, he spent more than 20 months in state prison on an  assault conviction.  </P> <P> He was taking a pounding in the fifth when he landed a right under Rosiles'  left ear and followed it with a right to the body.  </P> <P> Rosiles went down from the second punch. After the bell, his handlers asked the  ringside doctor to stop the fight.  </P> <P> Ramos is 30-8-2. Rosiles, of Mexicali, Mexico, is 21-12-1.  </P> <P> In another preliminary bout, heavyweight Rocky Pepeli of Burbank, knocked down  by a left hook to the chin in the second round, came back to stop William  Morris of Ontario in the third round.  </P></p>

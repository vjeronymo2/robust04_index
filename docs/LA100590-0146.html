			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BINGO!;  </P> <P> FOR DIE-HARD FANS OF THE GAME OF CHANCE, CHARITIES OFFER THE LURE OF A  RED-LETTER DAY  </P> <P> The devotees start staking out their lucky chairs in the Edison High School  cafeteria about 3:30 every Monday afternoon. They come with their lucky charms,  their snack food and vacation pictures, their cigarettes.  </P> <P> By 5 p.m., chatter and smoke fill the room. Most of the 240 or so people are  regulars. They split into their usual cliques and gab about families, or the  money they almost won the night before.  </P> <P> The first round of games starts at 6:30. From that point on, no one budges.  </P> <P> Last year, the auditorium suffered a power outage one night and the devotees  played on, using their cigarette lighters to illuminate the cards. A few weeks  ago, a pregnant woman went into labor during the "Early Bird" set. She stayed  until intermission.  </P> <P> Over the ensuing four hours, 26 people (more, when ties occur) yell the magic  word:  </P> <P> "Bingo!"  </P> <P> Barbara Dykes whoops with joy as she rockets from her lucky chair waving her  lucky red dauber, which is an oversized felt-tip pen used to mark the calls.  The crowd does not exactly share her enthusiasm, although it quickly regains  its optimism -- there's always the next game.  </P> <P> Floor manager Dan Campbell, a volunteer for the football team's booster club,  counts the $250 kitty into Dyke's eager palm: "$20, $40, $60. . . ."  </P> <P> Dykes is one of an estimated 21,000 bingo fans in Orange County and Long Beach,  according to the monthly Bingo Bugle. Nearly every city council in the area has  voted to allow the game of chance as a fund-raising device for nonprofit  organizations. Bingo was legalized in 1976 through an amendment to the state  constitution, but it is regulated by local governments.  </P> <P> "I play as often as I can get away with it -- three or four nights a week,"  Dykes, 53, says. "My husband thinks it's a game for little old ladies. He  doesn't like bingo; I don't like golf."  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach housewife spends $70 to $100 per bingo venture: "Shhh,  don't tell my husband that. I use his money to play, but when I win, it goes  into my account.  </P> <P> "I play only because it's for a worthy cause, yep. I'm being tongue-in-cheek,  in case you couldn't guess," she adds.  </P> <P> Certainly, however, Dykes' five-year romance with bingo is not solely for love  of money; her occasional $250 bounties have yet to fulfill any champagne wishes  and caviar dreams. "I'm still in the red," she says, "but I'm about to break  even any day now."  </P> <P> The land of opportunity for bingo aficionados was expanded in January when  Garden Grove's City Council finally approved the game -- five years after  Westminster and Huntington Beach became the county's first inductees.  </P> <P> Garden Grove Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan cast the only dissenting vote, saying,  "I don't think it's the way to teach our children about how to make money."  </P> <P> Donovan said he is "philosophically opposed to gambling, including the lottery"  -- though, he admitted with a chuckle, "I buy tickets.  </P> <P> "Their (the booster clubs') argument is that you can only sell so much candy  and wash so many cars to raise money," the mayor said. "I'm sympathetic with  that. I just wish there were a better way to do it than bingo."  </P> <P> Newport Beach and Costa Mesa continue to hold out.  </P> <P> "The school board doesn't think that a form of gambling is an appropriate  activity to have on school facilities," said Tom Godley, assistant  superintendent of budget facilities for the Newport-Mesa Unified School  District.  </P> <P> But bingo fans need not worry about a shortage of arenas for their sport. On  any given night in Orange County, eight to 10 schools, churches and clubs  conduct the game.  </P> <P> Bingo mushroomed in the '80s when charitable organizations were forced to  pursue fund-raising more aggressively due to federal cutbacks, said Roger  Snowden, president and founder of the Seattle-based tabloid Bingo Bugle. "The  Reagan Administration gave bingo a big shot in the arm," he noted.  </P> <P> Forty-six states have legalized bingo, and about 58,000 Americans a week  partake of it, Snowden said: "About $5 billion a year are wagered on bingo, and  about 25% of that is returned to charities."  </P> <P> John Healy, editor of the Orange County-Long Beach edition of Bingo Bugle, has  watched his newspaper's circulation grow from 15,000 to 21,000 over the past  four years. New bingo locations constantly crop up in the county, making  organizations increasingly competitive for a slice of the pie.  </P> <P> The Bugle, available free at games, is stuffed with advertisements such as the  one for Buena Park High School:  </P> <P> "OVER $16,000 PAID NIGHTLY . . . $1,000 CASH DRAWING . . . FREE COFFEE &amp;  SNACKS . . . UNIFORMED POLICE . . . FOUR TV MONITORS. . . ."  </P> <P> Because bingo in California is operated by individual cities rather than by a  state board, the total revenue brought into Orange County can only be  estimated. "About 2,000 people a night play, and they probably spend about $50  each," Healy said. That totals about $100,000 a night or $36.5 million a year.  After costs, some $9 million goes to the various organizations.  </P> <P> "In five years, we've paid out $1 million to the clubs," said Nancy Wyckoff,  Edison High bingo president. The wealth is divided among 26 booster clubs for  activities ranging from basketball to the student senate.  </P> <P> By state law, organizations that conduct bingo games must rely on an  all-volunteer staff -- with the exception of cafeteria workers, security guards  and accountants. Each of the booster clubs at Edison drafts one parent per  bingo night to sell cards, empty ashtrays and pass out popcorn.  </P> <P> The maximum booty that a single card can reel in is limited by law to $250,  though door prizes and drawings can pay up to $1,200. Most organizations keep  grand prizes a bit below that amount to forgo paperwork; the IRS requires  winners of $1,200 or more to fill out forms on the premises.  </P> <P> One-dollar "pull tabs" produce about half of Orange County schools' bingo game  income. The tabs -- which pay from $1 to $250 -- are similar to lottery  tickets, except they can be sold only during bingo games.  </P> <P> On the recent Monday night at Edison High, early arrivals passed pregame down  time plucking their way through stacks of pull tabs.  </P> <P> "I won $100 off a pull tab!" enthuses Jan Petrow, a San Diego loan underwriter  who was in Orange County on business.  </P> <P> Frequently, avid fans seek out their hobby while traveling through alien  territory. "I was sitting in my hotel room and I thought, 'I'm so bored -- I'll  go find a bingo game,' " Petrow says.  </P> <P> She plays three or four nights a week in San Diego. "I guess I have the  gambler's spirit," she shrugs.  </P> <P> Edison High's basic game package costs $15, which provides a total of 48 cards  -- six for each of eight games. But rare is the person who stops at $15. Most  buy "early bird" and "late bird" packs for another $5 each. Most buy a dozen or  so pull tabs. A lot buy two or three game packages.  </P> <P> Nobody concentrates on only one card at a time, like in the old days. Daubers  have replaced pinto beans and buttons as card markers. And disposable paper  sheets, each illustrated with three to six cards, have replaced the reusable  single cards. The two innovations make multiple-card scanning the norm.  </P> <P> With impressive hand-eye coordination, one woman on this particular night  simultaneously supervises 18 cards each game -- wielding a dauber in each hand.  </P> <P> "I've seen people play 24 cards at a time," Wyckoff says.  </P> <P> Phil and Elena Navarra of Costa Mesa scoff at such tactics. "We don't play 80  million cards like some people, so that we can visit with our friends," says  Elena, 78. "We come here mostly to socialize."  </P> <P> Still, such altruism does not preclude the Navarras from bringing along their  good-luck doll, Drucilla -- nor from claiming the same good-luck table every  night. "Nobody better sit down here or else they get killed," warns Phil  Navarra, 76.  </P> <P> "Bingo players are superstitious people," observes widower Bill Gruble, 75, who  religiously attends the Edison games with his best friend, Diana Poundstone.  "If you're on a losing streak, you switch to a different color of dauber or  something."  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach buddies exchange a "lucky handshake" before braving a new  set of games. "I always wear the same jewelry," says Poundstone, 66. She and  Gruble sit in Edison's nonsmoking room, linked by television monitors with the  bingo emcee across the hallway. It holds half as many participants as the  bustling auditorium where the smokers congregate.  </P> <P> "We're in the minority," Gruble says. "But some of the people over there are 80  years old -- it's hard to tell them that smoking is bad for your health."  </P> <P> Just minutes before winning her $250 bonanza, Barbara Dykes had been cursing  the five-letter word soon to become her victory cry.  </P> <P> "Who invented bingo? I'd like to kill him. Or her," she grouses, puffing  another cigarette. "He's as bad as R.J. Reynolds."  </P></p>

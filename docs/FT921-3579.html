			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / European Property 11: The market has hit rock bottom - Britain / One estimate suggests there is enough office space in central London for 10 years THE longest economic recession in almost 50 years has taken its toll on the UK property industry. The sector's shares fell 18 per cent last year compared with a 15 per cent uplift in the overall market. Half a dozen companies have collapsed and a score of leading names are suffering the indignity of a rating among the 'penny share' brigade. It is all a long way from the late 1980s boom, when rents soared and the construction industry went into overdrive. And therein lies the biggest problem: leading markets are weighed down with huge space surpluses. One estimate suggests there is enough office space in central London to last a decade. Even a recovery would take years to make an impact on rents. The one straw keeping most investors afloat is the fact that the market has hit bottom. Total returns have recovered strongly, finally going positive again in the last six months of 1991 to reach 2 per cent, says the benchmark index produced by Investment Property Databank (IPD). The market is very patchy, however. Central London offices sank to minus 19 per cent, reflecting a 22 per cent drop in rent levels. Industrial premises in the north and Scotland were the star performers for the second year in succession, recording a 12.4 per cent positive total return. Fund managers are even beginning to believe in the future again. 'Institutions are planning to step up their net investment in property over the next 12 months,' says IPD. But that confidence has not spread to London, once the honeypot for every European investor. With the possible exception of the West End they will be looking to unload offices. The City of London's standing has taken such a knock that annual rents of Pounds 37.50 per sq ft are now comparable with Madrid, Frankfurt and even the newly-revived Berlin, says property consultant Richard Ellis. Hefty property taxes and service charges takes the overall cost to Pounds 66 (Pounds 78 in the West End), however, well above levels in other European centres. Landlords are crunched between a rock and a hard place. Returns have been cut to the bone - and then trimmed even more with long payment holidays and generous break clauses. But still the tenants will not bite. Some cannot afford extra occupation costs when profits are being squeezed; others cannot re-let their old space. Investors may salivate over the UK's unique system of 25-year leases but occupiers feel the downside when competing against acres of brand new space at bargain rents. Mr Jeremy Trice of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks believes that the amount of central London space has fallen marginally, but that still leaves more than 32.5m sq ft available compared with a take-up which fell 40 per cent last year to 9m sq ft. The end of recession may be nigh, however. Starts have more than halved, to 3m sq ft. Future performance may depend on how the industry handles stored-up plans for further building. Mr Geoff Marsh of Applied Property Research has noted more than 50m sq ft of existing planning permissions and another 29m sq ft of applications. 'In other words, the overall development pipeline stands at over 100m sq ft - sufficient to increase the existing stock by 50 per cent,' he says. While little of this is likely to be built in the foreseeable future, the threat alone could depress yields for the rest of the decade. Meanwhile, immediate weaknesses make any prospects of short-term rental growth unlikely, says Siobhan Pandya, head of commercial research at Savills. But there may be a light at the end of the tunnel. Occupiers are paralysed as much by uncertainty as poverty, and the forthcoming general election should at least clear their vision about the future. If the Conservative Party retained power, it would put lenders' minds at rest; a recent survey by Chesterton revealed that most finance groups feared a Labour Party victory would hit the property market. But the future may not be that simple. Richard Ellis predicts that office rents would rise 2.8 per cent more per year if power changed hands (although other property might suffer). Siobhan Pandya also suggests that a Labour Party government would not necessarily be detrimental in the long term. For the moment, however, UK property appears to be raising its head above the tide which swept it from favour. Although average yields remain at an historic high of more than 9 per cent, Savills predicts 5 per cent total returns this year - still well below the performance of gilts and equities but at least back in the black. 'This improvement will come about through a general stabilisation of yields and even a marginal improvement in certain sectors, including retail warehouse and industrials,' it says. Investors will need all their wits about them to take advantage of low prices - and a great deal of courage to brave prospects of meagre returns. But if they choose well and look long-term - as all good property investors are meant to do - the prospects are there for some exciting deals in 1992.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ADDITIONAL PROPERTY COSTS  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Landlords costs in letting  Agents fees: 10 per cent of first year's of a building               rent + 17.5 per cent VAT                             Legal fees: variable  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tenants costs in leasing    Agents fees: up to 10 per cent of first of a building               year's rent.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norman West] </F>   [Excerpts] The army has been selling thousands of rifles  and pistols at bargain-basement prices to defence force members  for personal use. Despite a national outcry against a  proliferation of weapons, .303 rifles are being sold for as  little as R34.10 [rand]. The price is less than the cost of a  packet of 20 cartridges at dealers or the R50 revenue stamp on a  police licence to possess a firearm legally. Ammunition for the  .303s is sold by the army at 28c [cents] a round.    Many serving officers and citizen force members, the  majority  white, have jumped at the offer, and some have resold the  weapons as hunting rifles through gunshops, making hundreds of  rands profit out of the ex-army stock.    Lieutenant-Colonel Brian du Toit of the Directorate of  Communications of the army confirmed that the sale of the .303s  was continuing. He said that, in terms of army regulations, the  following people qualified to buy the weapons:     -  Serving members of the permanent force, citizen force and  commandos who have completed five years' continuous service;    -  Members of the permanent force who are retiring after 20  years;    -  Veterans of World War 2 if they can provide a service  certificate.        In the past .38 Special revolvers were also sold in the same  way but were no longer available, Lieutenant-Colonel du Toit  said.    ANC MP and former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing] commander Ronnie Kasrils, who served  on the defence sub-council of the TEC and works closely with  Defence Minister Joe Modise, said yesterday he was taking up the  matter immediately with Mr Modise with a view to having the sale  of the weapons investigated. [passage omitted]    Ministry of Defence spokesman Das Herbst said he believed  the  sales were "a continuation of an old policy". [passage omitted]</p>

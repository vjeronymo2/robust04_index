			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Zambia asks UK to write off debts PRESIDENT Frederick Chiluba yesterday stressed his government's commitment to economic reform and sought British backing for Zambia's appeal to creditors to reschedule or write off its Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.4bn) external debt. Mr Chiluba, on a two-day official visit to London, put Zambia's case for debt relief and new aid in a meeting at Downing Street yesterday with Mr John Major, the British prime minister. Mr Major told President Chiluba, who came to power last October in Zambia's first multi-party elections for 22 years, that Zambia would be eligible for debt relief under the Trinidad terms, set out in 1990 by Mr Major when he was chancellor. The prime minister told the Commonwealth conference in Harare last October that Britain was prepared unilaterally to implement the terms, which envisage writing off two-thirds of the export credits owed by the world's poorest countries. The two men signed agreements, negotiated after Mr Chiluba's election victory, rescheduling Zambia's 1992 debt obligations to Britain, and releasing Pounds 10m balance of payments support from Britain which had been frozen pending the economic reforms.</p>

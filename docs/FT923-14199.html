			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Letter: Banks can mitigate high cross-border transaction costs Sir, Mr Alan Mackie (Letters, July 7) has reason for complaining about the cost of his Anglo-French transaction when he had a Pounds 180 cheque cashed on a French bank. However, for banks to handle one-off transfers without notice involves them in much manual handling. Perhaps if Mr Mackie had enquired beforehand about the most cost-effective way of making this transaction, he would have avoided at least some of the cost he actually bore. Opening up the Automated Clearing Houses (the equivalent of BACS in the UK) around the EC to all EC-registered banks, as should happen when the Second Banking Directive is implemented on January 1 1993, will enable banks to improve their cross-border payment services quite markedly, at least for repeat business. In fact, several UK banks, Barclays included, have already done this, using ACHs for more effective transmission. Perhaps because cross-border payments form such a small part of the overall payments made up by most individuals and businesses, many people do not know how best to use the banks. It is usually worth inquiring before making the transaction. At the very least, the admittedly steep costs can be revealed, if there is no way of avoiding them. R G Bullen, transborder services director, Barclays Global Payments, PO Box 120, Longwood Close, Westwood Business Park, Coventry CV4 8JN</p>

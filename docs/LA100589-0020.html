			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAR VANDAL HITS, RUNS TO ENFORCE PARKING RULE  </P> <P> Residents of a Simi Valley residential complex who do not strictly conform to  the parking regulations of their planned development have been finding their  cars vandalized, apparently by a townhouse vigilante with a relish for rules  who issues written warnings.  </P> <P> "Everything is supposed to be nice and pretty. Now there's tires being  slashed," said Debbie LaScala, 31, whose Ford Fiesta was splattered with an  acid-like liquid, as were the cars of her parents and brother.  </P> <P> Simi Valley police say similar acts of vandalism within the Oak Tree townhouse  development have been occurring since at least March 7, the date of the  earliest reported incident. Some drivers have been victimized more than once.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warning Note  </P> <P> On Monday, residents said they found warning notes taped to their doors and  mailboxes.  </P> <P> According to Simi Valley Police Sgt. Kenneth Tacke, chief of detectives, the  notes read:  </P> <P> "If your vehicle is seen parked outside your garage for any unreasonable length  of time, your vehicle will be added to the hit list."  </P> <P> LaScala said the note also boasted of an ability to "slash four tires within 25  seconds, day or night, and I will do it."  </P> <P> Tacke, who said similar notes have appeared in some earlier cases, said police  have 16 reports of car vandalism involving an estimated $12,000 in damages.  LaScala claimed that the damage has been greater, that as many as 80% of the  cars in the 95-unit complex have been attacked.  </P> <P> Police are centering their investigation on the development of detached  two-story houses, which are virtually identical and connected by small gardens.  The development lies off the 5400 block of Cochran Street near the Simi Valley  Freeway.  </P> <P> "It seems apparent at this point that the suspect is probably someone who lives  in the complex. At least, that's the tone of the notes that have been  received," Tacke said.  </P> <P> "There's been some finger-pointing, but until we confirm it one way or the  other, I don't want to release any names."  </P> <P> The vandalism came up at the Aug. 31 meeting of the Oak Tree homeowners  association and is expected to be raised again at the Oct. 16 meeting. But the  development's management company, Dahl Davis Inc. of Westlake Village, has  advised the board of directors to leave the matter to police, association  manager Janice Needham said.  </P> <P> Under the development's regulations, aimed at preventing cars from being  blocked in place, residents are required to park in their two-car garages and  avoid using the shared lots reserved mainly for visitors. One vehicle per  residence may park in the guest lots, if it is driven off the site on a daily  basis. Also, residents may not park outside their garages -- most of which open  directly onto the courtyard-like, shared parking lots -- unless they live in  one of the few houses with a driveway.  </P> <P> Oak Tree resident Brian Lipe has so far avoided vandalism and generally parks  both his car and his wife's in their garage. But he confessed that he sometimes  leaves one of the cars out of the garage when he takes his motorcycle for a  spin.  </P> <P> "If everybody cooperates, it's OK," he said, and if someone is blocked in "you  can go ask your neighbor to move his car."  </P> <P> Still, Lipe said the vandalism attacks concern him.  </P> <P> "It's scary that someone would decide to take matters like this into their own  hands," he said. "It's just not what America's about. I think the guy should go  live in a cave."  </P></p>

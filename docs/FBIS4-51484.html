			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wan Chengcai (8001 2052 2088)] </F>   [Text] Moscow, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin, in an interview with XINHUA after he returned to  Moscow this evening, said that he was "very satisfied" with his  China visit. He said that Russia will implement in a "timely  and prompt" manner the bilateral agreements signed in Beijing  governing cooperation between Russia and China in various fields.    Prime Minister Chernomyrdin flew back to Moscow from Dalian,  winding up his four-day official visit to China.    He said that he held talks with Chinese leaders including  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng and that he signed  seven agreements on further promoting bilateral relations. The  task now is to implement these documents in a timely fashion.    Chernomyrdin also stressed that Russia and China, which both  are great countries, are embarking on reform. Although the two  countries' situations differ, they can help each other make up  their deficiencies. The cooperation between them will solve not  only some of the issues that have appeared in the Asia-Pacific  region but also many international ones.    Chernomyrdin asked XINHUA to convey his appreciation and  regards to the Chinese leaders and people.</p>

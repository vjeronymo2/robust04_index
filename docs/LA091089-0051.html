			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BEST SOUVENIRS  </P> <P> We just wanted to thank you for telling us about Student Travel International's  escorted tours to Europe, which was described in Tours &amp; Cruises (March  19). Our granddaughter just returned from her STI tour of Europe, happy and  exhausted from her travels and just bubbling over with stories about the  wonderful places she'd been to and the people she met. She has come home with  the best sort of travel souvenirs -- lots of happy memories and new friends!  </P> <P> MARJORIE SEICHI  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

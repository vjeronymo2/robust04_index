			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Discussions continued with the litigants and NRC, and in February 1993, an agreement was reached to settle the pending litigation and the administrative proceeding, avoid potential future litigation, and otherwise agree to a potential approach to regulations of NRC-licensed non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites. See 58 FR 17230 (April 1, 1993) (notice announcing settlement agreement under CAA section 113(g)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The settlement agreement adds comprehensive detail to, and thereby continues, the approach set forth in the MOU. If implemented, the settlement agreement will result in the expeditious control of radon-222 emissions at non-operational uranium mill tailings disposal sites without the delays and resource expenditures engendered by litigation and contentious administrative process. It will enable EPA to fulfill the requirement of section 112(d)(9) that EPA find, by rule, that the NRC regulatory program protects public health with an ample margin of safety. It does this, in part, by changing EPA's UMTRCA regulations such that public health will be as well protected under UMTRCA as would implementation of subpart T under the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the agreement, the pending litigation will not be dismissed until after certain terms in the agreement are fulfilled. Moreover, the agreement does not legally bind or otherwise restrict EPA's rights or obligations under law; rather, by its terms (paragraph 12), there is no recourse for a court order to implement the agreement. Indeed, the only remedy for failure to meet the terms of the final agreement is activation by the litigants of the underlying litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Rationale for Proposed Rule to Rescind 40 CFR Part 61 Subpart T for NRC and Agreement State Licensees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the new statutory authority provided EPA by section 112(d)(9) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA met with NRC and the affected Agreement States to determine whether, with certain modifications to its regulatory program under UMTRCA, the NRC regulatory program might provide an ample margin of safety. If so, subpart T would be rendered superfluous and, therefore, needlessly duplicative and burdensome such that rescission pursuant to CAA section 112(d)(9) would be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In applying the risk methodology for CAA section 112 to the risk assessment for subpart T, EPA has already determined that the baseline that would result once the 20 pCi/m2-s UMTRCA standard is met protects public health with an ample margin of safety. Thus, if the regulatory program implemented by NRC assures that sites will achieve the baseline (20 pCi/m2-s) as soon as practicable considering technological feasibility and factors beyond the control of the licensee, then the NRC program would protect the public to the same extent as subpart T, and subpart T would not be necessary for these facilities. More specifically, appropriate modifications to the UMTRCA regulatory scheme as implemented by NRC and the affected Agreement States to ensure specific, enforceable closure deadlines and monitoring requirements such that compliance with the baseline will occur as expeditiously as practicable considering technological feasibility and factors beyond the control of the licensee, would protect public health with an ample margin of safety. In so concluding, EPA relies wholly upon the risk analysis it conducted in promulgating subpart T. EPA is neither revisiting that analysis here, nor does the Agency seek comment on that analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Regulatory Scheme Under UMTRCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a supplement to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, UMTRCA (42 U.S.C. 2022, 7901&hyph;7942) was enacted to comprehensively address the dangers presented by uranium mill tailings, including their disposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> uranium mill tailings located at active and inactive mill operations may pose a potential and significant radiation health hazard to the public, and *&blank;*&blank;* the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare *&blank;*&blank;* require[s] that every reasonable effort be made to provide for the stabilization, disposal, and control in a safe and environmentally sound manner of such tailings in order to prevent or minimize radon diffusion into the environment *&blank;*&blank;*.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. 7901(a); see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> American Mining Congress  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Thomas <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 772 F.2d 617 (10th Cir. 1985),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 426 U.S. 1158 (1986). As to uranium mill tailings disposal sites in particular, UMTRCA gives the Department of Energy (DOE) the responsibility to clean up and dispose of certain (i.e., Title I) sites, and gives NRC the responsibility for those (i.e., Title II) sites that are owned and operated by its licensees. EPA is responsible for promulgating the generally applicable environmental standards to be implemented by both NRC and DOE. 42 U.S.C. 2022(a), 7911&hyph;7924;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> AMC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , 724 F.2d at 621. EPA promulgated its final UMTRCA regulations on December 15, 1982 for Title I sites and on September 30, 1983 for title II sites. 48 FR 590 and 48 FR 45926 (codified at 40 CFR part 192).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Parts of EPA's final UMTRCA regulations are directed to the permanent disposal of uranium mill tailings. See 40 CFR part 192, subpart D (subpart D). Among the requirements of subpart D is the mandate that radon releases from the disposal sites not exceed a flux of 20 pCi/m2-s. 40 CFR 192.32(a) and (b). Other aspects of subpart D pertain to ground water, monitoring, design, and duration of closure. See 40 CFR 192.32 and 192.33. With the exception of the ground water provisions at 40 CFR 192.20(a)(2)-(3), all of subpart D was upheld by the Tenth Circuit in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AMC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Thomas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 772 F.2d at 640. EPA is currently engaged in rulemaking to address the ground water remand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because NRC implements EPA's general UMTRCA standards for its licensees (as do its Agreement States), it has promulgated its own implementing regulations in the form of ``criteria.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See generally  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10 CFR part 40, appendix A. While these criteria set forth a variety of specific requirements_financial, technical, and administrative_to govern the final reclamation (i.e., closure) design for each disposal site, they also provide for ``site-specific'' flexibility by authorizing alternatives that are at least as stringent as EPA's general standards and NRC's criteria, ``to the extent practicable'' as provided in section 84c of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at Introduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

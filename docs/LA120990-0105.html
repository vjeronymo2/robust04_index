			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ESPERANZA WINS TITLE ON SECOND-HALF HEROICS;  </P> <P> DIVISION III: SLOTBACK JAROD SMITH SCORES THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN FINAL TWO  QUARTERS. THE AZTECS BEAT ST. PAUL, 25-7, TO COMPLETE A PERFECT SEASON.  </P> <P> Jarod Smith wasn't exactly elated when his 75-yard touchdown run on the second  play from scrimmage was called back on a motion penalty.  </P> <P> And the Esperanza High School slotback wasn't exactly jumping for joy when he  fumbled the ball after catching a 13-yard pass from Keith McDonald a few plays  later.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what was going to happen after I had messed up in the first  half," Smith said. "At halftime, the coaches told me to go out and just run."  </P> <P> Smith did just that, running for three second-half touchdowns to lead Esperanza  to a 25-7 victory over St. Paul in the Southern Section Division III  championship game Saturday night at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Smith, who had 46 yards in 11 carries, scored on runs of five, 16 and two yards  in the second half as the Aztecs (14-0) capped the first perfect season in  school history.  </P> <P> "It's beyond my wildest dreams that we'd be 14-0 right now," Esperanza Coach  Gary Meek said. "We set a goal to win two Southern Section games this year."  </P> <P> They won four.  </P> <P> It was Esperanza's first section title since 1979. The Aztecs lost in the  finals in 1980, '82 and '84.  </P> <P> "This is a great team," Meek said. "And this group is in some pretty fast  company when you're talking about winning."  </P> <P> St. Paul (8-4-2) lost not only the game but also defensive back David Toruno,  who apparently broke his leg while breaking up a pass in the end zone with 2  minutes 22 seconds left in the third quarter. The game was stopped for 15  minutes while officials waited for paramedics to arrive.  </P> <P> Two plays after Toruno was injured, Smith scored on a five-yard run to give  Esperanza a 10-7 lead.  </P> <P> Smith scored his second touchdown on a 16-yard run around the right side with  with eight minutes left in the game. Smith also ran in the two-point  conversion, giving Esperanza an 18-3 lead.  </P> <P> The touchdown was set up by Esperanza defensive back Mark Parlin, who  intercepted a pass by Al Borunda at the St. Paul 29-yard line and returned it  to the 16.  </P> <P> Smith's third touchdown run also was set up by an interception. Derrick Reaves  intercepted a Borunda pass at the Esperanza 46, and the Aztecs drove 52 yards  in six plays before Smith scored from two-yards out with 3:57 left in the game.  </P> <P> "We dominated St. Paul up front," Meek said. "Our front seven did a great job,  and when we forced them to throw, the secondary made some great plays."  </P> <P> The Aztecs rolled up 109 yards total offense in the first half, but they  couldn't find their way into the end zone.  </P> <P> St. Paul had problems too, gaining only 56 yards total offense in the first  half. The Swordsmen drove to Esperanza's 15 late in the first quarter, but a  sack by the Aztecs' Josh Gale and a pass breakup by Jason Perez stalled the  drive. Rick Camarena's 44-yard field goal attempt early in the second quarter  fell five yards short.  </P> <P> Esperanza broke open a scoreless game late in the second quarter. The Aztecs  got the ball at the Swordsmen 26-yard line with 39 seconds left in the first  half after a 21-yard punt by Matt Lenzen.  </P> <P> A pass interference call on St. Paul's Tom Vasquez and a 13-yard pass from  Keith McDonald to Marcus Tayui gave Esperanza a first-and-goal at the St. Paul  eight with 20 seconds left. After McDonald twice threw incomplete into the end  zone, Clay King kicked a 25-yard field goal as time expired.  </P> <P> St. Paul took a 7-3 lead on the first possession of the second half. Shawn  McKinney capped an 11-play, 68-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown run with  7:09 left in the third quarter.  </P></p>

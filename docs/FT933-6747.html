			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / France to bring peace forces home FRANCE will withdraw its peacekeeping troops from Somalia by the end of the year and from Cambodia by the end of next January, Mr Francois Leotard, the French defence minister, said yesterday, writes John Ridding from Paris. Speaking in an interview with Radio France Internationale, Mr Leotard said the withdrawal of troops from the two countries had been scheduled and was in line with the United Nations' timetable for ending operations there. According to Mr Leotard, France would maintain its troop presence in the former Yugoslavia. But he said that he wanted to see stronger UN command in the field to increase the safety of the 6,000 troops stationed there. He said that French troops would continue to be available for other UN missions. France has about 1,400 troops in Cambodia. It has been active in seeking a solution to the civil war there, co-chairing the Paris conference in which the four conflicting factions signed a peace accord.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A public communique issued by the Kosova Democratic  Alliance [LDK] Presidency condemns the murder of Selman Daci by  the Serbian Army at Hani i Elezit and considers it as an  organized state crime of Serbia against Albanians.    The communique states that whenever the international  community undertakes concrete steps against the Serbian policy  and Serbia, such as the case of downing of four Serbian aircraft  in the war in Bosnia, the Belgrade regime increases the police  and military repression against the Albanians in Kosova.    Alongside the repression, raids, imprisonments, and daily  harassments by the Serbian police, yesterday's murder in Hani i  Elezit seems to warn the escalation of organized state terror  with unprecedented consequences for Kosova and the Balkan  region. The LDK Presidency warns the international public that,  besides the increase of police forces, movements of considerable  military forces that check the unarmed population have recently  been observed in Kosova.</p>

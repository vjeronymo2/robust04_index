			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / How to Spend It: Starck naked and simply stylish - A bidet based on the design of a bucket, and a bath costing more than Pounds 4,300 are part of a new collection admired by Lucia van der Post There seems no end to the inventiveness of Philippe Starck. He is, for those whose minds have been on higher things these last many years, the famously shabby and cuddly Frenchman who speaks English with a Peter Sellers French accent and who made a lavatory (the one with mirrors in the Cafe Costes in the Place des Innocents) one of the most visited sites in Paris. He is, just in case that has not made it clear, a designer. Or rather he is what most of us would call a designer but he, in his playful, provocative way denies it hotly. He is, he insists, a political activist, a radical changer of the way people live. Be that as it may, the man who gave us the ultimate lavatory brush, the most expensive lemon squeezer in the world, the most eccentric kettle and the most uncomfortable chairs in Paris is in designing mode again and this time he has turned his attention to bathrooms. As you can see from the photographs, he has managed, as with almost everything he touches, to give the standard components that we all know and use, baths, basins, lavatories and bidets, a fresh look. It is a look that, alas, comes with a hefty price tag - but being at the cutting edge of design never did come cheap. Commissioned by Duravit, a German manufacturing company, to produce his own vision of contemporary bath-ware, Philippe Starck went back to basics. How, he asked himself, did early man wash and keep himself clean? He would scoop water from streams and lakes by cupping his hands. Later, as he provided himself with a few comforts and artefacts, he built round washing bowls (all those heavily decorated Victorian bowls were almost all perfectly round) based on the simple round shape of cupped hands. Water in primitive communities was (and sometimes still is) collected by hand-pump and he has used this shape as the inspiration for the wash-basin mixer. The lavatory and bidet are based on old buckets. The bath, a simple free-standing oval, is modelled from the old-fashioned tub, rather like the ones we see in old Westerns or nostalgic photographic essays of vanished working-class life. But do not be fooled by this artless vision - the inspiration may go back to early Arcadian days but the technology, of course, is white-hot new. The lavatory, for instance, in true eco-chic style, flushes properly with only six litres of water - most, it seems, need nine and even the newer more conservation-conscious models need 7 1/2 . The manufacturers are excited by the tap on the basin. This is based on the lever action of the hand-pump which means flow and temperature can be operated with one-hand but it required the development of a new small mechanism to make it work efficiently. The bath, too, sitting serenely in the middle of the room, required some new technology to enable the taps to fit neatly on to its rim. For those who like their baths to do fancy things it is possible to have Venturi massage jets, an air injection system or a combination of the two. The bath itself is made from reinforced acrylic, the rest of the equipment from ceramic, but where wood is used (as in the basin with cupboards below) it has a pearwood veneer and a black melamine interior. What appeals to me is the simplicity of the aesthetic - it is cool, clean, tranquil, with nothing pushy or aggressive to disturb the eye. When properly installed not a vestige of plumbing is to be seen. Yet it is clearly practical - for instance, around the oval bath runs a polished chrome rail so that a towel or even clothes are always at hand. For those whose notions of a proper bath include the possibility of drinking the odd glass of champagne, there is a broad ledge. If you like to buy a bathroom as a package, there is a range of accessories  -everything from simple hooks and a sleek toothbrush holder, to towel rails, lavatory paper holders and a mirror. The collection, as I have already intimated, is not cheap. The bath, being the most innovative technically and, of course, the largest piece of equipment, is the most expensive at Pounds 4,361.60. The floor-standing (there are also wall-mounted versions) bidet and lavatory together are Pounds 1,024. The wash-basin is Pounds 529.93 and there is a shower tray at Pounds 1,314.82. The complete range can be seen at CP Hart, Newnham Terrace, Hercules Road, London SE1 7DR. The range is new and is available to order only - currently the waiting time is 12 weeks but CP Hart hopes to get this down to more like six weeks shortly. Later in the year it will also be available from other bathroom suppliers. Tel: 071-902 1000 for details.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Utter contempt There are various reasons why the government of one sovereign state might wish to give Pounds 234m to that of another, as the UK promised Malaysia it would in 1989. There might be general considerations of foreign or trade policy: Malaysia is a country of growing wealth and influence, whose government, headed by a notoriously prickly prime minister, has important contracts in its gift. That gives Britain an interest in keeping him sweet. Or again there might be a specific interest in securing a particular contract, in this instance a Pounds 1.3bn arms deal. We know that such a linkage was explicitly made in a protocol signed, but subsequently repudiated, by Lord Younger, then defence secretary. The UK's modest overseas aid budget, however, has a more restricted application. An act of parliament says that the primary purpose of money disbursed under this heading must be the economic benefit of a foreign country or welfare of its people. That still allows a considerable latitude. The Malaysian government claims to be convinced that the Pergau dam will benefit the country and add to its people's welfare. The British government could, in theory, have agreed. How ministers must wish that Sir Timothy Lankester, then permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, had done just that, instead of advising the foreign secretary, then as now Mr Douglas Hurd, that funding the dam was an abuse of the aid programme. It is rather to their credit that Sir Timothy's career does not seem to have suffered: he now heads the much larger Department for Education. But his authoritative view on Pergau remains on file, and last week the High Court decided that in overriding it Mr Hurd broke the law. There the matter should have ended. Clearly Britain cannot now get out of paying Malaysia the money it has promised. Equally clearly, that money should not come out of the meagre aid budget, which is badly needed for more deserving causes. It must come from somewhere else - the obvious place being the defence budget. So much of this is already devoted to keeping British arms manufacturers in business that an extra Pounds 234m would hardly be missed, whereas that sum could still meet the basic needs of quite a few people in the world's poorest countries. Alas, that conclusion is apparently not so obvious to British ministers. Treasury officials, presumably so instructed by their political masters, are now examining a scheme whereby the payment to Malaysia would come out of the Treasury's contingency fund, and the ODA budget would be cut by a corresponding amount. Thus the letter of the High Court's judgment would be respected, its spirit flagrantly and deliberately ignored. Such is the humility and respect for the law which Conservative politicians have learnt during 15 unbroken years in office.</p>

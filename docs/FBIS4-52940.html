			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Dear Foreign Minister, Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet has just concluded his official friendship  visit to the Union of Myanmar [Burma]. This is the last country  in Southeast Asia that our Prime Minister has visited. Would you  please elaborate on the significance of the visit?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] We are continuing to implement our foreign  policy of diversified diplomatic activities in various forms.  In implementing this policy, we have attached importance to  developing relations with regional countries. Myanmar is a  country in Southeast Asia that has many similar features,  historically and culturally, to Vietnam. People of the two  countries have supported and assisted each other during the  struggle for their national independence. I would like to  recall that 36 years ago, Uncle Ho visited this country. During  the past several decades, due to changes in the region that  include the war in Vietnam and upheaval in Myanmar, relations in  various fields between the two nations did not develop well.  Now, the trend of cooperation and development is prevailing in  our region, and we are striving to strengthen relations with all  Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar.    Our prime minister's visit to Myanmar this time is aimed at  consolidating the existing relations between the two nations  while asserting our wish to develop the bilateral relations in  the new stage to truly serve the trend of development in the  region.    [Correspondent] Dear Foreign Minister, you just stressed the  significance of the visit. Would you please elaborate on the  concrete results of the visit?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] Our ancestors are correct in saying that  we  will see things precisely on the spot. Reading books on  realities of a nation, we can see but a general view; when we  visit the country, see its realities, and get in touch with its  people, we understand more about that country. Through the  visit to Myanmar, the Vietnamese delegation could see its  realities and exchanged views with our Myanmar friends to  correctly assess the trend of development and cooperation  between the two countries. First, I would like to say that this  visit has helped in strengthening the mutual understanding,  thereby creating a profound mutual trust. Through the visit, we  clearly see the Myanmar people's sentiment toward Vietnam. The  Myanmar government and people extended a very warm welcome to  the Vietnamese delegation. Tens of thousands of people lined up  the streets, waving Vietnamese and Myanmar flags to welcome the  Vietnamese guests from the airport to the guest house and along  streets leading to various production establishments and  localities. Generally speaking, the Myanmar people went to the  streets to express their sentiment toward the Vietnamese  delegation and people.    During our meetings with the Myanmar leaders and people,  they  have expressed their respect for Vietnam by saying that the  Vietnamese people have a very strong determination in the  struggle for national independence and national construction and  defense. The Myanmar people also have such a quality, thereby  they highly respect the Vietnamese people and admire the latter  for their creativity and the spirit of self-reliance in building  the Vietnamese nation. They also hope that Myanmar will develop  successfully in the same spirit. This has strengthened the ties  and mutual trust between the two nations. I should say that  this is very important especially when our two countries are in  the process of developing their respective nations. While  Vietnam and Myanmar are facing numerous difficulties and their  capabilities in developing their nations are low, they are  striving to find ways and means to help each other. Through  various meetings and talks, both sides have agreed to cooperate  with each other in various fields. Myanmar has a very vast  forest area. The country has an area of more than 770,000  square km or two times larger than Vietnam, 58 percent of which  are forests, mostly the precious timber trees. As a result,  Myanmar has extensive experience in protecting, managing, and  exploiting forests, thus we can learn this from our Myanmar  friends. Myanmar also has ample experience in exploiting and  producing precious stones. Myanmar has great potential in  producing these stones, thus it has vast experience in  exploiting, fixing prices, and selling these precious stones and  in making them into valuable ornamental items. Myanmar has  expressed a willingness to share its experiences with Vietnam in  this regard.    In addition, it must be said that though  Myanmar's economy is still developing and facing financial  difficulties, the government and people attach great importance  to cultural heritage and make due efforts to preserve national  traits. Therefore, they spend money to restore ancient cultural  relics, including the ancient imperial city in Mandalay and the  Shwe Dagon Pagoda, which is both a cultural and religious relic  that has existed for more than 2,500 years now. Apart from  their great cultural value, these relics are of practical  important significance because they serve as very important  tourist attractions.    We can cooperate with Myanmar in another field. By this, I  mean Myanmar's due concern for environmental protection. This  can be seen through the government's efforts to keep urban areas  and other parts of the country green. Well-defined plans and  long-term projects have been worked out to meet this goal to  serve future development. On this occasion, we agreed to  cooperate with Myanmar in tourism. At the same time, we also  agreed to exchange experiences in the preservation and  restoration of cultural and historic relics.    As far as the Myanmar side is concerned, it also showed keen  interest in our country. The Myanmar government fully realizes  that our country used to be a major rice importer but has now  become an important rice exporter. Therefore, the Myanmar side  wished to cooperate with us in agriculture and wanted us to  exchange seedlings, first of all rice varieties and silkworm  breeders, that we have great development potential. At the same  time, it wanted to learn from our water conservancy experiences,  including our hydroelectricity-generating experiences. Thus,  the two sides realized that they could cooperate not only in the  economic field but also in cultural and artistic activities.    [Correspondent] Based on your above-mentioned remarks, is it  correct to say that in the immediate and far future, the  friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Myanmar will  develop well?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] I am positive about that. Though the  results I have just mentioned are only initial ones, they serve  as the groundwork for both sides to further broaden bilateral  relations and take practical steps to ensure effective results  for the two countries. It must be said that this visit has laid  the groundwork for a new developmental step in the relations  between Myanmar and Vietnam. It must be said that in addition  to those traditional relations, both sides need more conditions  to create a new development step in bilateral relations. This  is a very important move. It is certain that thanks to the  aforementioned practical results, the trends of cooperation and  development in the region, and particularly, the mutual  understanding between the two countries, mutual trust will be  further strengthened. This will serve as the basis for  broadening bilateral relations in all fields. It is also certain  that this factor will benefit not only the development of  Vietnam and Myanmar but will also contribute greatly to the task  of turning Southeast Asian into a region of peace, stability,  and development.    [Correspondent] I would like to ask you one last question,  Mr. Minister. You have visited many countries. As far as your  recent visit to Myanmar is concerned, what are your personal  impressions of the capital city of Rangoon in particular and the  Union of Myanmar in general?    [Nguyen Manh Cam] This is my first visit to Myanmar, and it  has left profound impressions on me. In my opinion, Myanmar is  not a poor country but a nation with great potential. To me,  what is more important here is the fact that the people of  Myanmar display a high spirit of independence, sovereignty, and  self-sufficiency. Based on such time-honored relics like the  Shwe Dagon Pagoda that has lasted for more than 2,500 years now  and on such modern facilities like the Parliament Building where  every architectual pattern reflects national traits, I can say  that even though many difficulties still lie ahead, the  development potential of Myanmar and the creativeness of its  people are by no means limited. Therefore, in the framework of  world development, it is certain that Myanmar will develop at a  very fast-breaking pace. I was also impressed by the fact that  the government of Myanmar has succeeded in linking ancient  national character with modern development. There is every  reason to believe that thanks to their cretiveness and spirit of  independence and self-sufficiency, the people of Myanmar will  achieve a fast-breaking national development pace.    [Correspondent] Thank you, Minister.</p>

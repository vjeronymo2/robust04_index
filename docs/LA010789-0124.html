			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Paltex Editing &amp; Production Systems Ltd. in London has completed its  purchase of the video editing division of EECO Inc. in Santa Ana for $375,000  and a promissory note for an unspecified amount. All 22 employees who worked in  EECO's video editing division reported for work Tuesday at Paltex's U.S.  subsidiary, California Paltex Corp. in Tustin. The sale, completed Dec. 30,  makes Paltex the biggest independent manufacturer of video and audio editing  systems, which are used in the communications industry. The sale also rids EECO  of one of its two unprofitable divisions. EECO's other unprofitable division,  which is expected to be sold within 3 months, makes computers that manage the  operations and billings of hotels. EECO is concentrating on its original line  of work -- electronic switches and keyboards for computers.  </P></p>

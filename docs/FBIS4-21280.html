			<p>Assistance,   Palmerola Base   <F P=102> PA1904200594 Tegucigalpa Voz de Honduras Network in Spanish  1630 GMT 19 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA1904200594 </F> <F P=104>  Tegucigalpa Voz de Honduras Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Bonilla and Roberto Reyes at the </F> Government House in Tegucigalpa--live relay]    [Text] [Bonilla] Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina, who is the vice  president of the Congress and brother of President Carlos  Roberto Reina, has confirmed the report this station released a  few minutes ago from the Government House. That report noted  that within the next few hours the National Security Council  will discuss the Honduran Armed Forces' plan to break the  Military Assistance Treaty with the United States -- a treaty  that dates back to 1954. Reporter Roberto Reyes has more details  on this.    Reyes: Dr. Jorge Arturo Reina specifically noted  that the legislative and executive branches today intend to  review the Military Assistance Treaty between the United States  and Honduras. Here is what he said when asked about this topic:  [begin recording]    Unidentified reporter, in progress: ...on what is  a review of the Military Assistance Treaty with the United  States?    Reina: No, the meeting we attended did not deal  with that issue. At this time, we are coming from a meeting the  president held with the deputies from Francisco Morazan  Department, but we did not touch on this topic.    Reporter: Will there be a National Security  Council meeting to review this topic?    Reina: I think the president has proposed the  advisability of a National Security Council meeting, but not  only for that purpose, but also to address the problem of  violence in an effort to get an overall view of this problem and  a joint decision from all sectors of society [words indistinct].    Reporter: When will this meeting be held?    Reina: I do not know. That will be announced by  the president.    Reporter: Do you agree with the [words indistinct]  of the Armed Forces about the U.S.-Honduran military agreement?    Second unidentified reporter: Will [words  indistinct] to citizens of the country?    Reina: Well, I have seen how the world has  changed. A few years ago, we proposed the advisability of  (reviewing) treaties. At that time, that was a taboo subject.  Now it is prudent for Honduras to review any and all treaties  to determine whether they are providing benefits and whether  they are consistent with the nation's sovereignty.  Nevertheless, I do not think we should portray this as a  serious problem, because conditions exist for reviewing every  international relationship, and, if the countries agree, they  can discuss such topics.    Reporter: What about the situation that arose  today in Congress because of the questioning of the ENEE  [National Enterprise for Electric Power] manager? What is goal  of Congress in this?    Reina: I think that in all of these cases -- in  both the invitation Congress extended to the ENEE, as well as to  Cohdefor [Honduran Corporation for Forest Development] -- there  is no other goal but to have them explain to the Honduran people  how difficult it is to resolve the country's extremely serious  problems.    Reporter: Now that you are in government, can you  guarantee to the Honduran people that you are going to review  the treaties and do what you always said you would do -- things  you said you would do even before you were a university leader  and [words indistinct]?    Reina: Well, we continue to maintain the same  unwavering position. That has never changed. World conditions  have changed, however. In terms of the U.S. Palmerola base, to  which I assume you are referring, it has been proposed that it  be turned into a base for combating drug trafficking instead of  a military base in the old sense of the word -- the kind of base  that has traditionally existed in Latin American countries.    Reporter: Congress has had a commission discussing  this. At least Mr. Rafael Pineda Ponce spoke about this in a  report we aired.    Reina: That is correct. We think treaties must be  reviewed in terms of today's climate and based on the [words  indistinct] most advisable for Honduras' national interests. In  this sense, I think that there will be unity among the Honduran  people and that, in the end, the best thing will be done.    Reporter: [words indistinct] the North Americans?    Reina: I think that recently the North Americans  have been maintaining a symbolic troop presence. However, I  also think there is something more important. The presence of  U.S. forces during the Cold War had a significance that was very  different from what it now has that the Cold War no longer  exists. In addition, the idea that has been proposed to turn  Palmerola into a base from which to wage a war against  international drug trafficking, which is a transnational crime,  completely changes the nature of the symbolic U.S. presence and  would give Honduras greater control of the installations, which  would be used precisely to fight drug trafficking.    Reporter: But these are foreign troops in the  country, regardless of their objective.    Reina: The presence of a large number would make  no sense. Any assistance needed to operate equipment and needed  to train Hondurans to operate equipment would be highly  beneficial for Honduras and the region.    Reporter: In short, would Congress be supporting  the review of that military treaty with the United States?    Reina: Well, the discussion of that topic has not  been concluded. It has to be discussed more carefully, but you  can be sure that the executive branch and the Congress are  defending Honduras' national interests above anything else.    Reporter: What is the (position) of the executive  branch in this case? What has the president told you in this  regard?    Reina: About what?    Reporter: About [words indistinct].    Reina: We have not discussed this topic. We have  only commented on how conditions have changed and on how it is  now possible to discuss any topic without this being seen as an  unfriendly act against another country.    Reporter: [words indistinct]    Reina: He will be the one [words indistinct]. [end  recording]    Reyes: This is what Congress Vice President Jorge  Arturo Reina has said. He confirmed that the National Security  Council will be meeting specifically to discuss this topic and  that the executive and the legislative branches are willing to  review the issue of U.S. military assistance to Honduras.</p>

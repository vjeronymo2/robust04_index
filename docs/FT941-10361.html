			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / New ploy by French in quest for jobs French employees will be able to convert money from company profit-sharing schemes into paid holiday if another government plan designed to reduce the country's record unemployment wins approval. The proposed money-for-time exchange is included in an update of the 1966 worker participation law proposed by the French cabinet yesterday. Another feature of the scheme, yet to be approved by parliament, would allow employees to take profit shares early provided they spend the money on a car or home improvements. The government's use of worker participation legislation not only to promote industrial democracy but also to encourage consumption and counter unemployment illustrates its determination to leave no stone unturned in its quest for jobs. However, with that interest in worker participation that distinguishes the Gaullist RPR party from UK conservatives, Mr Edouard Balladur's government is also proposing to give employees holding more than 5 per cent of their company's capital (including profit-sharing schemes) the right to call a general shareholders' meeting to elect worker representatives to the board. Company chiefs are forecasting that investment will have risen by 3 per cent in January, reversing a steady fall since 1991, according to a survey by Insee, the government statistics agency.</p>

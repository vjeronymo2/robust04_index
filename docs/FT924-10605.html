			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Dire effects of a failure to communicate: What caused the London Ambulance Service computer system to crash COMPUTERISED control of ambulance despatch in London has a troubled history. The computers at the heart of the current controversy replaced a first attempt that never worked properly and led to legal action against the principal supplier and sub-contractors to recover costs. A computerised command and control system keeps track of staff, machines and materials, making it easier for managers to deploy resources effectively. In a typical ambulance despatch system of the kind used by Surrey, West Yorkshire or Berkshire, telephone calls from the site of an emergency are routed through the public network to ambulance headquarters, where an operator at a personal computer takes details. A telephone number is enough to place the incident and set the ambulance on its way. Software experts yesterday agreed that a combination of computer difficulties and staff tensions within LAS appeared the most obvious causes of the London failure. There are questions over the suitability of a tiny software house such as Systems Options, with no record of success in ambulance systems, to act as prime contractor in such a crucial contract. The company, whose managing director is listed as Mr James Pedroza, and whose other directors are given as Mr Julian and Ms Helen Stringer and Mr David Wolfe, is now about 20 strong. Mr Tony Lewis, membership director for the Computing Services Association, the trade association for the UK leading computing services companies, said brilliant software was often written by very small companies but he was concerned about the lack of visibility of Systems Options. Mr Geoffrey Westcott, a software specialist at LAS, who has responsibility for ensuring the system meets its users requirements, yesterday defended the decision to use Systems Options. He said no other company could have done any better in developing a system to meet London's requirements. Compared with the several hundred calls a day experienced by country ambulance services, London received an average of 2,300 calls a day. Earlier this week calls rose to a peak of 2,900. Mr Westcott made clear, however, that tensions in the ambulance service were not helping. An example of the kind of problems the service is experiencing, which are unrelated to software errors, involves 'exception messages' which are flashed when part of the organisation fails to meet a particular deadline - say an ambulance failing to acknowledge a command. The result is that senior staff spend precious time dealing with the exception messages while other tasks are neglected. Critics of the London system point to examples of this kind as evidence that the system is over-sophisticated and over-complicated, but say too little effort has been put into persuading ambulance staff of its advantages.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- What should happen when a 999 call is made  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. A 999 call made from the scene of an emergency is routed through the    public telephone network to ambulance headquarters, where a    'receiver' at a personal computer takes the essential details and    enters them into the system.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. The information is transmitted over a local network to an 'allocator'    also at a computer, who can despatch an ambulance using a map of the    area showing the location of each emergency vehicle and its    availiability. Ambulances radio their position to headquarters    continuously &amp; automatically.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Ambulance crews receive either written instructions at a station or    are alerted through an on-board computer. All activities are    monitored &amp; timed; failure to follow an instruction generates    warning messages at the centre.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

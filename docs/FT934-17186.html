			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Nigerian reform promised CHIEF Ernest Shonekan, leader of the military-backed interim government of Nigeria, yesterday pledged rapid implementation of the country's stalled economic reform programme and the repeal of recent decrees to curb press freedom. Speaking on the country's 33rd independence anniversary, he acknowledged that reform had been 'hamstrung by the political crisis of the past several months.' The government was determined to reduce the budget deficit, the chief said, 'by curtailing extra-budgetary expenditure'. This was an implicit reference to the diversion of the proceeds of an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil per day to so-called designated accounts not subject to independent auditing. 'Fiscal co-ordination and transparency in public financial management' would be a priority, said Chief Shonekan. A campaign against the annulment of the June presidential poll and the extension on military rule until a fresh poll, due next February, fizzled out yesterday. The main city, Lagos, was mostly back to normal as support fell away for a three-day stayaway organised by the Campaign for Democracy (CD), which began on Wednesday. Support was poor from the start of a campaign which began with a march to deliver a petition to the Lagos state governor. Police fired teargas to break it up and CD leaders said 58 people were arrested. Chief Moshood Abiola, who returned on Friday after eight weeks abroad seeking support for his claim to the presidency, has not been prominent. He did not take part in the protests on Wednesday. These were mostly limited to cities in Chief Abiola's south-western home region.</p>

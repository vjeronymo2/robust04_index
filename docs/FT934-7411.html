			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Former Lehman head recruited MR J. Tomilson Hill, the former co-chairman of US securities house Lehman Brothers, has joined the Blackstone Group, the Wall Street mergers and acquisitions boutique. Blackstone, founded in 1985 by two former Lehman executives, said Mr Hill would sit on the investment committee for the firm's merchant banking fund, and play a key role in the development of its financial services business. Mr Hill's return to investment banking is timely: after years of inactivity, the M&amp;A business in the US is enjoying an impressive revival. Companies in important industries, such as telecommunications, entertainment, health care and banking, have been engineering a host of lucrative mergers and takeovers. Blackstone said it had been seeking to recruit a top Wall Street investment banker since one of its senior partners, Mr Roger Altman, left the firm last year to become deputy Treasury secretary in President Clinton's administration. Mr Hill made his name at Shearson Lehman as an M&amp;A specialist during the 1980s, advising a roster of blue-chip clients that included Pillsbury, Time Inc and RJR Reynolds. His success as head of mergers took him to the top of the firm in 1990, when he was made co-chief executive with Mr Richard Fuld. After the Shearson broking and asset management business was sold to Primerica last year, however, Lehman was left with two leaders, which the firm's parent, American Express, felt was one too many. The result was Mr Fuld's appointment as sole head of Lehman, and Mr Hill's abrupt departure from the firm he had joined in 1982. Since leaving Lehman, Mr Hill has worked as fund-raiser and adviser to Mr Rudolph Guiliani, the Republican politician elected the new mayor of New York City this month.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Observer: Driving force The last amateur cricketer to lead a county championship winning side, Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie, faces a challenge of a different order as head of the management buy-out team at insurance brokers Holmwoods. Ingleby-Mackenzie, who won national sporting fame when he led Hampshire's successful side during the late 1950s and early 1960s, is skippering the Pounds 33m move for Holmwoods, a subsidiary of merchant banking group Brown Shipley which has hitherto specialised in finding insurance for private schools. Already solidly profitable, it seems well placed to take advantage of the increasing flexibility with which public-sector schools are being run. Among the 50-strong management team involved in the buy-out is another former county captain, Nick Pocock, a successor of Ingleby-Mackenzie at Hampshire, while Carl Openshaw, director of finance and development, is a third cricketing buff - albeit a Kentishman.</p>

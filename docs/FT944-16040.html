			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Council workers win rises up to 6% Nearly 1.5m local-government employees will get pay rises ranging from 4 per cent to 6 per cent spread over 19 months for blue-collar staff and 21 months for white-collar staff. The two-stage deal, which was agreed yesterday, brings together the settlement dates for both groups and ushers in a harmonisation of conditions. Mr Jack Dromey, national official of the TGWU general union, welcomed the step as 'the end of second-class status for blue-collar workers'. Although the pay offer was increased slightly yesterday it is at the lower end of settlements, especially for white-collar staff.</p>

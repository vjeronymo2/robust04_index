			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Sage growth continues with rise to Pounds 9.66m Shares in Sage Group closed up 31p at 475p as the Newcastle-based accounting software and stationery supplier continued an unbroken run of growth in turnover, pre-tax profits and earnings per share since going public in 1989. The City was relieved that Sage made pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.66m, 9 per cent ahead of last year's Pounds 8.85m and only Pounds 1.2m under expectations, after a profits warning in July. Turnover rose 51 per cent to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 27.3m), split between the UK (Pounds 22.1m), the US (Pounds 14.3m) and France (Pounds 4.9m). Earnings per share increased by 5 per cent to 32.5p (30.9p) while a final dividend of 6.6p lifts the total to 9.92p (9.02p). Despite acquisitions costing Pounds 5.8m, year-end cash balances were Pounds 4.2m, compared with Pounds 7.2m last time. Mr David Goldman, chairman, said that the group had taken action to deal with problems in several parts of the business in a generally unhelpful year: 'Current trading trends indicate that Sage should see continuing growth and an improvement in profitability this year'. Sage specialises in accounting software for medium-sized and smaller businesses. It has recently entered the important but low margin SoHo - small office, home office - sector with a version of its Sterling accounting system. Mr Goldman noted: 'Maintenance income amounted to Pounds 7.8m, an increase of 41 per cent over the previous year with one in five of our registered users opting to buy ongoing support services from the group'. COMMENT Sage has a hard won reputation for sound, undramatic management but it has had its work cut out to cope with problems in its US acquisitions DacEasy and Remote Control International. It has also had to accelerate the migration of its existing products from the DOS operating system to Windows, Microsoft's graphical interface. It now seems to have solved distribution problems for DacEasy in the US - which had caused a 'bloodbath' according to Mr Kevin Howe, DacEasy chief executive - continued the development of RCI's Telemagic telephone marketing system and launched Windows versions of the critical programs. Analysts were mollified by the speed with which Sage tackled these problems and are looking for Pounds 12.5m in pre-tax profits next year. The shares still look undervalued compared to the sector and should be set to advance further.</p>

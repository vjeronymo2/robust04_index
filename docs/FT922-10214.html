			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Snecma plans to expand US interests Snecma, the French state-owned aircraft engine company, is expanding its US interests by taking a majority stake in Speco, one of the world's oldest aircraft-parts makers. The companies are still finalising the terms of the deal, under which Snecma, which already has extensive US interests, would emerge as the controlling shareholder in Speco. The French company is expected to bring in at least one other investor as a partner. Speco, based in Springfield, Ohio, specialises in the production of helicopter power transmissions, flight control actuator systems and accessory drive systems. It made a substantial loss last year on sales of Dollars 36m. It has a workforce of about 300. When the deal is completed Speco will become part of Valaroche, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Snecma. It will liaise with Hispano-Suiza, another Snecma susbsidiary, on technical and commercial issues. Recently Snecma has suffered from the problems of the international aerospace sector. It recently reported a net loss of FFr68m (Dollars 12.1m) in 1991, against profits of FFr208m the previous year, on turnover of FFr23.9bn. The group also warned that the level of new orders had fallen 30 per cent.</p>

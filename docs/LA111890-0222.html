			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION 3-A VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> LA HABRA WINS TITLE, BEATING EL MODENA  </P> <P> La Habra High School found some strange new ways to celebrate its second  consecutive Southern Section 3-A girls' volleyball championship Saturday.  </P> <P> There was Zrinka Kristich, the Highlanders' 6-foot-5 outside hitter, lifting  Principal Tom Triggs off his feet after he handed her the gold medal.  </P> <P> Then there was Coach Sandy Blumenthal, who held the championship plaque aloft,  only to let it slip through her fingers and cut her lip.  </P> <P> All in all, it was another interesting day for the top-seeded Highlanders, who  raced past third-seeded and previously unbeaten El Modena, 15-7, 15-1, 15-12,  in the final at Cerritos College.  </P> <P> Kristich had 18 kills and middle blocker Missy Clements added 16 as La Habra  (19-0) extended its two-year winning streak to 41 matches. Middle blocker Marni  Hichborn led El Modena (18-1) with 14 kills.  </P> <P> La Habra, which needed five games to beat Agoura in last year's final, had  reason to celebrate. The victory left the Highlanders as Orange County's only  undefeated team.  </P> <P> "This one was just as sweet as last year,"said Blumenthal, who's in her 20th  year coaching at the school. "Although it is a little more painful."  </P> <P> Blumenthal really didn't mind the small cut above her lip. After all, she and  the Highlanders advanced to the state tournament, where they will defend their  Division II championship.  </P> <P> Perhaps the state tournament will provide some competition for La Habra, which  has played only a few matches that lasted longer than three games this season.  </P> <P> It was the second time in the past three years that El Modena has been swept in  the 3-A final, having lost to Sunny Hills in the 1988 championship game.  </P> <P> El Modena provided little more than target practice for La Habra.  </P> <P> Kristich had 10 kills and Clements had eight in the first game as La Habra  built leads of 8-3 and 12-4.  </P> <P> Blumenthal said La Habra's tall front line of Zrinka Kristich, Clements (5-10)  and Ana Kristich (6-1) caused El Modena problems.  </P> <P> "We had a big advantage being so tall," Blumenthal said. "But this team also  has been playing together so long that they work well together."  </P></p>

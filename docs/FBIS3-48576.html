They belong to the first batch of 263 returnees from Japan.  Most of them are young people from Kien Thuy, Do Son town and  Le Chan precinct of Hai Phong Port City. These returnees are not  beneficiaries from the fund provided by the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees because they illegally left the  country after Sept. 27, 1991.</p>

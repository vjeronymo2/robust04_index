			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Racal Electronics rises to Pounds 23m - Shares fall 6% after downward revision of margins prediction Racal Electronics' share price fell 6 per cent yesterday, after the company revealed that it would fall substantially short of its stated target for profits from its data communications division this year. In June, the communications, radio and network services group predicted profit margins of 'well over 5 per cent' for the division, on about Pounds 400m of revenue. It admitted yesterday that margins were more likely to be 4 per cent, and most analysts reduced full year profit forecasts from Pounds 70m to Pounds 60m. The shares closed 13p lower at 203p. For the six months to October 14, Racal reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 23.5m compared with losses of Pounds 400,000, after taking account of a Pounds 26.8m loss from discontinued operations. The company has been restructuring its data communications business, which had over-extended in a highly competitive market. However, poor data product sales in Germany and Italy, combined with difficulties in merging two manufacturing operations in the UK, have reduced projected profits. It has made significant advances in network services, which will benefit from the National Lottery contract, and provide a steadier revenue stream. However, divisional operating profits fell from Pounds 2.93m to Pounds 834,000. At the year end, Racal will have spent Pounds 10m on a restructuring, reducing staff by 400 to 11,200, which will benefit the second half. Group turnover rose to Pounds 487.3m (Pounds 430.2m), including Pounds 4.91m from acquisitions and Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 14.4m) from discontinued activities. Operating profits from continuing operations increased from Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 25.2m, including Pounds 993,000 from acquisitions. Marine and energy division sales suffered from the impact of a weak oil price, and profits fell from Pounds 7.54m to Pounds 3.48m. However, specialised businesses profits grew by 51 per cent to Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 8.95m). There was a net cash outflow of Pounds 64.5m, reflecting acquisitions, and costs associated with the National Lottery but it should be cash positive in the second half. At the interim stage gearing was 14.3 per cent, against 10.4 per cent 12 months earlier. The interim dividend is raised to 1.75p (1.5p) from earnings of 5.71p (losses 0.07p). COMMENT The danger of giving profit forecasts is that investors get upset when they are not reached. It is hardly surprising that Racal's failure to achieve its own targets should swamp some positive factors in its performance. On reduced forecasts of Pounds 60m for 1994-95, Racal is on a p/e of 15.1. If management is right, profits could hit Pounds 78m next year, leaving the shares at a discount to the market. But credibility is hard to win back, and Racal operates in tough markets, with the pressures of developing a steady stream of products with short lifespans. The lower rating looks deserved.</p>

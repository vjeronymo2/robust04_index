The miners, representatives of nearly all the coal mines in  the country, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday [29 March].    Shouting slogans "Repay our wages!" and "Our families on the  verge of starvation!", the miners demanded that the government  repay long standing debts to the coal industry and provide  appropriate subsidies.    The angry miners told reporters that they had sent a letter  to President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin calling them to a meeting with their  representatives.    The picket protest action is scheduled to last until Friday.</p>

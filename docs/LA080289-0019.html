			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY ALLOTTED AN OFFICIAL 3RD WORD  </P> <P> Is the community above Hansen Dam known as Lakeview Terrace or Lake View  Terrace?  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council ended the confusion Tuesday. The name, which often  appears on city reports and correspondence, is now officially Lake View Terrace  -- that's three words, all beginning with capital letters.  </P> <P> Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the community, said in a motion that  city records and maps show that the community is three words, not two, and  ordered that all further references be accurate.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> STILL TOO MANY QUESTIONS  </P> <P> The war on drugs is being waged on some mean streets where law enforcement  officers may have to make quick judgments in tense situations where they or  others may be in danger. Most civilians understand that and are sympathetic to  the police officer's challenges. But so far, there are more questions than  answers in the fatal shooting by police of a suspected drug dealer last  Wednesday outside a convenience store in Tustin.  </P> <P> Why did plainclothes police officers from the city of Orange resort to deadly  force when witnesses have said that Jesus Ramos Gonzalez, 27, of Santa Ana, was  slowly backing up his pickup truck after allegedly participating in a drug  transaction? A drug suspect would not necessarily assume that an armed person  ordering him to halt was in fact a police officer, and these particular  officers were from another city and working under cover. Nor is it necessarily  true that any driver in that situation would have responded instantly to such  an order while pulling out of a tight parking space, as witnesses have said  Gonzalez was doing.  </P> <P> Moreover, police sources have said that Gonzalez was not armed with a knife or  gun when the undercover officers opened fire on him. Two witnesses have said  they did not see a weapon either, and that the truck did not appear to be  moving toward anyone before the shooting. So why were there four quick bullet  holes in a pickup's windshield and a dead driver on the other side? Officers or  citizens in the parking lot should have been clearly in danger for such a  shooting to occur.  </P> <P> Orange police, who rely on state Penal Code sections in such situations, really  should have their own well-defined policy to guide them. But even the guidance  they have from a 1977 state Supreme Court ruling says that deadly force should  be used only when there is reason to believe that someone might get hurt.  That's a common thread in firearms policies, even though most are designed to  give discretion to officers in the field.  </P> <P> There is reason to wonder whether too much license was used in this shooting  incident. The Orange County district attorney routinely investigates such  shootings and must pay special attention to that possibility.  </P></p>

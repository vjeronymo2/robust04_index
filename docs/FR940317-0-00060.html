			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To address disclosure issues involving conduit financings in a comprehensive fashion, however, legislation addressing the exempt status of conduit securities under the federal securities laws is necessary. Bonds used to finance a project to be used in the trade or business of a private corporation are, from an investment standpoint, equivalent to corporate debt securities issued directly by the underlying corporate obligor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Payments on these types of conduit securities are derived solely from revenues received by the governmental entity under the terms of a contractual agreement, typically a lease or a note, from a private enterprise, rather than from the general credit and taxing power of the governmental issuer. The tax-exempt status of interest payments does not alter the fundamental analysis that these are private obligations, in which the investor looks, and can look, only to a private entity for repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Money Market Fund Release, 58 FR at 68588 (proposal to subject tax exempt money market fund investments in conduit securities to restrictions similar to those applicable to securities of comparable obligors offered to taxable funds).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The private nature of many conduit enterprises distinguishes them from traditional municipal financings. The incidence of bond default appears to be inversely related to the degree a financed project represents an essential public service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A study conducted by the PSA on non-rated issues that defaulted found that 75% were issued by local authorities in the areas of health care and industrial related sectors such as energy, chemical, pollution control and industrial development. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Kenny Default Report at 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PSA Default Report at 12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Given the essentially private nature of non-governmental industrial development financings, investors need the same disclosure regarding the underlying non-municipal corporate obligor as they would receive regarding any corporate obligor, and the same regulatory and liability scheme should apply.

Ruder, Chairman, SEC, ``Disclosure in the Municipal Securities Markets,'' Before the Public Securities Association (Oct. 23, 1987) at 17&hyph;18; Letter from John S.R. Shad, Chairman, SEC to Representative Timothy E. Wirth, Chairman, House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection, and Finance (March 12, 1985); 124 Cong. Rec. 21, 639 (1978) (letter from SEC Chairman Harold M. Williams to Senator Harrison A. Williams). There were two bills introduced, one in 1975 and one in 1978, that would have repealed the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The 1978 bill would have subjected certain industrial development bonds to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the filing and qualification provisions of the Trust Indenture Act and the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Neither bill was enacted.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Municipal Securities Full Disclosure Act of 1976,'' S. 2969, 94th Cong., 2d. Sess. (Feb. 17, 1976).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governmental industrial development financings, which would have retained their exempt status under prior proposals, include those financings in which the bonds are repaid from the general revenues of the governmental unit or the project or facility is a public facility (or part of a public facility) and owned and operated by or on behalf of the governmental unit. The prior proposals to register conduit financings would not have affected the separate exemption for securities issued by non-profit charitable organizations in Section 3(a)(4) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(4)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pending amendment to the securities laws to eliminate the registration exemption, the disclosure provided by such non-governmental conduit borrowers should be substantially the same as if such conduit borrower were subject to the information requirements of the federal securities laws applicable to the particular conduit borrower. For example, financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board should be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Disclosure in the Secondary Market for Municipal Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While significant progress has been made in primary market disclosure practices in recent years, the same development has not taken place with respect to secondary market disclosure. The GFOA issued separate secondary market disclosure guidelines in 1979, but they have not yet achieved the broad acceptance accorded its primary offering guidance. In the last five years, the NFMA, the National Council of State Housing Agencies, and the Association of Local Housing Authorities have published sector specific guidelines for secondary market disclosure; the National Advisory Council of the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers (``NASACT'') is in the process of preparing such guidelines for adoption by the states. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The GFOA's longstanding Certificate of Achievement program recognizes issuers that have prepared comprehensive annual financial reports meeting its guidelines. The NFMA's Award of Recognition Program likewise recognizes issuers that have committed to provide continuous disclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 84 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Guidelines for Information Disclosure to the Secondary Market  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (1992) (``Local Housing Guidelines''); National Council of State Housing Agencies,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Quarterly Reporting Format for State Housing Finance Agency Single Family Housing Bonds  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (1989) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Multi-family Disclosure Format  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (1991) collectively (``State Housing Guidelines''); NFMA Handbook.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Healthcare Financial Management Association,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of Principles of Public Disclosure of Financial and Operating Information by Healthcare Providers  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (Exposure Draft dated Aug. 1, 1993) (``Healthcare Disclosure Principles'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

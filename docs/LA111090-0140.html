			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY FOR PC INDUSTRY TITANS;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: TAKING STOCK AS THE COMDEX TRADE SHOW OPENS, SOME OBSERVERS DOUBT  THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH BRIGHT SPOTS TO COMPENSATE FOR A GLOOMY TREND.  </P> <P> As the personal computer industry gathers in Las Vegas for its huge Comdex  trade show starting Monday, companies of all stripes are anxiously scanning the  heavens, wondering if the gathering clouds of recession will gently rain on the  PC parade or unleash a devastating storm.  </P> <P> For months, there have been indications that the industry is in for some rough  weather. Market research shows domestic personal computer sales growth dropping  below 5% for 1990 -- far below the double-digit growth of recent years -- and  booming overseas markets have begun to sag. Price wars have broken out. Many  computer stores are struggling to stay afloat.  </P> <P> Yet a few glimmers pierce the gloom. Optimists cite the popularity of  notebook-size computers that can do anything a good desktop machine can do, and  about a dozen companies are expected to show high-powered new notebooks at  Comdex.  </P> <P> Corporate customers are still buying the powerful -- and expensive -- PCs that  link networks of traditional PCs, while consumers have responded well to  economical new products from Apple Computer and International Business  Machines. Comdex, the largest trade show in the country, will be brimming with  imaginative new uses for Microsoft's hugely successful Windows software.  </P> <P> But many believe that these bright spots will not be enough to counter the  downward trend -- at least in the short term.  </P> <P> "There are two conflicting tensions," says Ed Anderson, president of  Computerland, a chain of computer stores catering to businesses. "There's the  attitude that computer networks are too strategic (for corporate buyers) to cut  back on. And then there's the opposite, the board of directors saying that the  banks are going to clamp down on credit, so it's time to postpone (computer)  projects."  </P> <P> Anderson believes that growth in the $27-billion U.S. PC industry has all but  ground to a halt in recent months. Slow sales have led most manufacturers to  cut prices by 20% or more for mainstream desktop PCs, and dealer incentive  programs are getting more aggressive. "Last year, the trend was to offer neat  bundles of software" with PC purchases, said Michael Rusert, executive vice  president of Computer City Supercenter, a large retailer in Garden Grove. "This  year, it's cash rebates. The prices have really dropped out. It's astounding."  </P> <P> He said color machines that used the popular Intel 286 microprocessor as their  brain were selling for as little as $1,300, and machines equipped with the  higher performance Intel 386 microprocessor could be had for $1,700.  </P> <P> The discounting has helped keep volume growing at Rusert's store, which caters  primarily to home computer users and small businesses. But Joeann Stahel,  president of the market research firm Storeboard, says the price cuts could  lead to a "blood bath" for the manufacturers, and she cautions that the full  impact of recession-related corporate buying cutbacks has not yet been felt.  </P> <P> Pricing pressures have also sent manufacturers "scrambling to find where the  margins still exist," noted Andrew Seybold, an analyst at Dataquest. One place  they exist -- at least for the moment -- are in high-performance notebook  computers.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, Compaq Computer, Texas Instruments, Epson and AST Research  have all introduced notebook computers that use Intel's fast 386SX  microprocessor, and dozens of new varieties of notebook and laptop machines are  expected at Comdex.  </P> <P> Many of those products will be from Japanese, Taiwanese and Korean  manufacturers, ranging from well-entrenched players such as Toshiba and NEC to  big-name newcomers such as Nippon Steel to complete unknowns. Many Asian  vendors, strong in critical flat-screen technologies and component  miniaturization, view the portable arena as the ideal entry point into the U.S.  PC business.  </P> <P> The high end of the market will also be attracting attention at Comdex with the  debut of new "servers" -- machines designed to control large networks of  computers -- that use Intel's most advanced microprocessor, the 486. IBM will  show new high-end servers that were announced two weeks ago, and Advanced Logic  Research will be showing its new clone of Compaq's successful Systempro network  server.  </P> <P> Computer buyers looking for power and speed will also be able to peruse a host  of new desktop machines that are based on a design licensed from Sun  Microsystems. Sun's workstations, as well as the emerging group of Sun clones,  use the efficient but complicated Unix operating system to control basic  functions. They've traditionally been sold to engineers and scientists.  </P> <P> But Sun has been pushing hard to sell its workstations as an alternative to  personal computers for many mainstream business applications, and the company  will have a "drastically larger" presence at Comdex this year than in the past,  a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Another highlight of the show will be new equipment to bring pictures and  moving images onto personal computer screens.  </P> <P> The tens of thousands of Comdex attendees will be hoping that these and the  hundreds of other new gadgets on display will be enough to keep the industry  moving forward. And in a go-go business accustomed to rapid growth, there are  still plenty of people who consider the outlook sunny.  </P> <P> "We think the business grew 20% in the third quarter, and we see 20% in the  fourth quarter," said Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy Jr., chairman of Santa Ana-based  Ingram Micro D, the nation's largest computer products distributor.  </P> <P> Even Anderson of Computerland, a short-term pessimist, is "unabashedly  optimistic" about the industry's long-term prospects. But he, like many others  in the business, is waiting anxiously for the country to "get past the Middle  East crisis."  </P></p>

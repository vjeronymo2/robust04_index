			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Biocompatibles for market with Pounds 80m valuation Biocompatibles International, a research company that has developed a new type of contact lens, is planning to float later this month as its products begin to go on sale. The company, which is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 80m, is seeking up to Pounds 40m through the issue of new shares. Of the total, Pounds 25m will be placed firm, with the balance available to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, shows that the company had accumulated losses of Pounds 9.77m at the end of June. It warns that investment in the company involves a higher than normal degree of risk. Mr Alistair Taylor, chief executive, stresses that the company is not a biotechnology operation, but a maker of medical devices. It has Pounds 7m of cash, which would last for a couple of years if it continued at its present pace. But it expects to spend Pounds 25m next year as it moves its contact lenses into the French, German, and US markets and increases the pace of development of other devices. The existing shareholders, including Johnson &amp; Johnson with 8 per cent, Biotechnology Investments, Cygnus Ventures and 3i, will retain their shares for at least a year. Biocompatibles was established in 1984 to develop products using phosphorylcholine, or PC, a substance present in red blood cells and the primary natural material responsible for biocompatibility. PC was identified by Professor Dennis Chapman, of the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London, who holds 4 per cent of the equity. The PC-based soft contact lens, to be known as Proclear, is aimed at people who want to use contact lenses, but have found them uncomfortable. The company says the lenses resist dehydration and cut the risk of bacterial infection. Mr Taylor expects the company to be generating cash in 1998, mostly from the sale of contact lenses, which begins commercially this month. The company has a licensing and co-operation agreement on eye care with NOF Corporation of Japan. Last month it acquired Lombart Lenses, a contact lens maker in the US, which accounts for half of the world market. Sponsor to the issue is Robert Fleming and the broker is Smith New Court.</p>

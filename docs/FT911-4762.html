			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Tories attacked on tourism TOURISM'S importance to the British economy is not recognised by the government, Mr Prys Edwards, chairman of the Wales Tourist Board, said yesterday, Anthony Moreton writes. Mr Edwards told the all-party Commons tourism committee that the government also failed to offer sufficient support to attract foreign holidaymakers. 'Tourism is now the number three industry in the UK but the government has still not fully recognised its importance to the general economy and the balance of payments,' he said. He described the Pounds 10.1m budget allocated to the British Tourist Authority for marketing Britain abroad as 'totally inadequate'.</p>

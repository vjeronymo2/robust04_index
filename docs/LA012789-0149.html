			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COURT SAYS DAD MUST POSE HARM TO BE DENIED VISITS  </P> <P> In a victory for parental rights advocates, an appellate court ruled Thursday  that a father must pose an actual harm to his child -- not merely show  negligence -- to be denied his fundamental visitation rights.  </P> <P> The finding came as the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, reversing a  lower court, restored visitation rights to an unidentified Costa Mesa man who  had failed to see his young son for more than a year.  </P> <P> Legal specialists in family law called the decision an important declaration  that a parent's right to see a child is an essential one that cannot be  dismissed haphazardly unless there is a clear danger to the child. But experts  differed over how the ruling fits into current family law trends -- some seeing  it as a clear break, others as a continuation of the status quo.  </P> <P> Last year, the Orange County mother in the dispute, identified for reasons of  confidentiality as Beverly S., went to court to have her current husband adopt  her son and to deny the boy's birth father -- her ex-husband -- any visitation  rights.  </P> <P> She charged that the ex-husband, identified by the court as Scott C., had in  effect abandoned 7-year-old Jason because of his sporadic visits and through  his failure to pay child support while unemployed.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis agreed. Finding that the father had failed  to exercise his visitation rights for 13 months, with the exception of a single  "token" appearance, the judge cut off the father's visits.  </P> <P> But in an opinion written by Justice Edward J. Wallin and released Thursday,  the 4th District Court of Appeal faulted that decision. The court ruled that  the father's negligence alone could not justify the severe step of cutting off  visitation rights altogether; the parent must pose an actual harm to the child.  </P> <P> "It makes no sense to effect such a drastic result without first requiring a  finding that the continuation of Scott's rights would be detrimental to Jason,"  the court ruled. "No evidence was presented to show this."  </P> <P> The court said its adherence to this higher standard is designed "to safeguard  parental rights."  </P> <P> Tony Testa, president of an Orange County support and legal counsel group  called Fathers United For Equal Justice, called the decision an important  victory.  </P> <P> "The message that's being sent here is that it is in the best interests of a  child to see and be with his father," Testa said.  </P> <P> Testa and others active in fathers' rights issues argue that negligence cannot  be used to justify cutting off visits, because often it is the mother who  prevents the father from seeing his child.  </P> <P> Shelley L. Albaum, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in family law and  represented the father in the case that was the subject of Thursday's ruling,  characterized the decision as "bucking the trend" of recent legal rulings.  </P> <P> "I see it as the only clear ruling in the 4th District -- even in the state --  to say that a finding of detriment to the child is needed (to sever  visitation); a benign harm won't do it."  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Elections hit SA mines Output from all South African mines was falling because of the first all-party elections, Mr Gary Maude, chairman of Gengold, the country's third-largest gold producer, said yesterday. Another Gengold official estimated that gold production was down by as much as 5 per cent in the first quarter. 'This is not a conscious go-slow,' said Mr Maude. 'But there is an expectant atmosphere and people are not working with their usual concentration.' There had also been a unusual rash of wildcat strikes about industry issues over which mine managers had no influence. All Gengold mines will shut on April 26, the first election day. Mr Maude said there might be increased militancy after the elections but he felt sure that the new government would want to ensure a continued flow of revenues from gold.</p>

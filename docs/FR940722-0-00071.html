			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation has been amended from the NPRM to include 23 U.S.C. 303(g) which allows the use of NHS, STP, and highway bridge replacement and rehabilitation (HBRR) funds for development and establishment of the management and monitoring systems required under 23 U.S.C. 303. In addition, section 149(b) has been deleted since this regulation does not apply to funds made available under this section of title 23, U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 420.101&blank;Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section states the purpose of this regulation. It indicates that the provisions of this part apply to subrecipients of States, including MPOs. Language has been added to indicate that it also applies to activities undertaken with NHS, STP, and Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program (HBRRP) funds for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303 and 23 CFR part 500. Use of NHS and STP funds for such purposes was included in the NPRM definition of FHWA planning and research funds; the use of HBRRP funds is being added to the definition as discussed below. A reference to the additional requirements for RD&amp;T programs and studies in subpart B of this part is included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 420.103&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section includes the terms defined in 23 U.S.C. 101(a) and contains additional definitions for terms used in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The term ``FHWA planning and research funds'' includes SPR funds, metropolitan planning (PL) funds, and the optional use of NHS, STP, and Minimum Allocation (MA) funds for planning and RD&amp;T purposes. It also includes the use of NHS, STP, and HBRRP funds for development, establishment, and implementation of the management and monitoring systems required by 23 U.S.C. 303. The definition has been amended from the NPRM to include funds apportioned under 23 U.S.C. 144 for the HBRRP when such funds are used for development, establishment, and implementation of the bridge management system required by 23 U.S.C. 303. This category was inadvertently not included in the NPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although this rulemaking does not change the definition of grant, one commenter believed that new readers may not be familiar with the difference between a contract and a grant and, therefore, suggested that a definition of grant be included to reduce confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA agrees and has added definitions of ``grant agreement'' and ``procurement contract.'' These mechanisms for agencies to make awards to recipients are adaptations of definitions in Chapter 63, Using Procurement Contracts and Grant and Cooperative Agreements, of title 31, CFR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A ``grant agreement'' is defined as a legal instrument between an awarding agency and recipient where the principal purpose is to provide funds to the recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A ``procurement contract'' is defined as a legal instrument between an awarding agency and recipient where the principal purpose is to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the awarding agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

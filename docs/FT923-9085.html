			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Letter: No changes seen in Italy Sir, Robert Graham continues to show stubborn optimism ('Amato plays the chaos card', August 4) that the recent election results in Italy will lead to substantive changes in the system.

Onesimo Alvarez-Moro, Pontejos 2, 2 puerta 6, 28012 Madrid, Spain</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Financial regulation proposal divides the City THE CITY was sharply divided yesterday over a government proposal to move the policing of large parts of Britain's financial sector from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Treasury. The move, which has been driven by ministerial concern to strengthen the regulatory framework for large financial conglomerates, was broadly welcomed by many top City figures. Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, welcomed the proposal, which would bring regulation in the UK into line with other leading financial centres. 'The securities industry is getting increasingly intertwined with the wider banking and financial services industries,' he said. 'It would make a good deal of sense.' However, senior figures in the insurance industry, the only part of the financial sector directly overseen by the DTI, were concerned about being brought under the Treasury's wing. The DTI - which has come under widespread criticism in recent years over its failure to prevent a number of City scandals - is widely seen as a sympathetic regulator of insurance companies. Insurers fear the loss of a relationship which they believe has worked in their favour. The Association of British Insurers said banking and insurance regulation 'should be kept separate, so that bank depositors should not be disadvantaged compared with insurance policy holders, and vice versa'. The planned shake-up also raises the question of whether Lloyd's, the troubled private insurance market which regulates itself, would be brought under external control. Existing self-regulatory bodies in the City also generally seemed concerned about any upheaval in their relationship with government. There was concern in some quarters about the overlap that would result between the regulation of companies, which would remain at the DTI, and other aspects of financial regulation. 'It would be a terrible muddle,' one City regulator commented. 'Who would handle a Blue Arrow or Guinness investigation?' The Conservative manifesto indicated this week that if re-elected, the Conservative government would transfer to the Treasury oversight of the financial services industry, including the Securities and Investments Board, the chief investment watchdog, the stock exchange and insider dealing. The proposal is also widely believed in Whitehall to cover the insurance industry. The City's relations with the DTI have fluctuated sharply in recent years. Concern has been expressed about the way investment regulation was amended under the Financial Services Act and mixed feelings surfaced over the way deregulation in the City was handled in the 1980s. The relationship between the Treasury and the banking sector has been smoother as the Bank of England has acted as a buffer between the two. Senior ministers said the proposal marked a recognition that the creation of multipurpose financial conglomerates had blurred the previous distinctions between banks, building societies and other businesses in the financial services sector.</p>

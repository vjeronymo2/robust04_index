			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by observer Aleksandr Golts under the "Topic of the </F> Week" rubric: "The Time for Real Partnership Has Come. And Not  Only With the West"]    [Text] "To heed the call of the future" -- Boris Pasternak  considered this essential for a poet. Likewise, the ability to  pick up signals for the future in rapidly changing situations  and on a daily basis, is the most important quality for someone  in politics. I do not think I will go far wrong if I say that  this week, for Russia, this call of the future was concentrated  in the word "integration." At the same time, there were precise  manifestations of two integrative aspects which, in my view,  will also determine Moscow's policy in the foreseeable future.    First and foremost, it is a matter of our country's further  accession to the global economic system now emerging, the  guarantee of Russia's maximum participation in the formation of  European and world security. And here, some highly important  steps were taken. Above all, the matter concerns the agreement  signed by Boris Yeltsin in Corfu on cooperation between Russia  and the European Union [EU]. After that -- the formalization of  Moscow's relations with NATO, which took place in Brussels.    These days, the demand for integration on another level made  itself heard in the most insistent manner. It cannot but be  noted that the pivotal question of the presidential election  campaigns both in Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus] (and it is  highly noteworthy that the matter concerns republics whose  leaders finalized the disintegration of the Union in 1991) was  the question of reintegration with Russia.    However, listening to an insistent demand resounding from  the  future is only half the task for a politician. The newspaper  SEGODNYA recalled an extraordinary incident which occurred in  the sphere of Russian diplomacy almost two centuries ago. Soon  after the conclusion of the Tilsit Peace, it emerged that France  had no intention of honoring the commitments which Napoleon had  given in a conversation with Alexander I. In response to  Russia's protests, a cynical Talleyrand replied: "Politics is  just like music. A tune which has not been inscribed on paper,  and a tune which has not been determined in note form, is no  more than an empty noise." But the role of a politician is to  transform trends favorable to his country into specific  treaties, into a clearly prescribed position.    However, this is something we succeed in doing far from  always, and with great difficulty. It is no coincidence that it  took so long -- almost two years -- to elaborate the agreement  with the EU. After all, unlike a similar agreement signed in  1989 with the USSR, it enshrines not just general principles,  and not just wishful thinking about cooperation. It is a matter  of specific economic commitments. The key provision is the  possibility of free trade between the EU and Russia as of 1998.  The fact is that by contrast with, say, Ukraine, Russia is  deemed to be a country with a transition economy. This gives it  the opportunity, in relations with West European partners, to  obtain the very same benefits which are enjoyed by states within  the GATT framework. At the same time, the EU "has understood  the position" of Russia and agreed that it can continue to  protect the most socially vulnerable spheres with the aid of  tariffs and import duties for a certain amount of time.    Each of the agreement's signatories had to traverse his own  section of the road to reach it. EU countries were able, for  the sake of strengthening stability in Europe, to fight the  egotistical urge not to allow foreign goods onto their own  markets. Moscow agreed that various restrictions will operate  for certain categories of goods and services (textiles, steel,  aluminum, fissionable materials, commercial use of launch  vehicles). It would be too optimistic to state that efforts to  isolate us are a thing of the past. This is proved not only by  the restrictions which have been retained, but also by the fact  that Russia is not seen as one of the countries earmarked for  admission to the EU (where room has been found for the East  European states.)    Less obvious is the success in establishing genuine  partnership relations with NATO. Ultimately, Moscow, as  promised, signed a framework document on NATO's "Partnership for  Peace" program. And, in my view, this will bring our country  nothing but good, no matter what fairy tales Russian  conservatives may be conjuring up on this score. Admittedly,  Russia failed to attain the formalization of relations with the  North Atlantic Alliance which would have corresponded to its  role as a nuclear state exerting a definite influence on  European and world security. It had to be satisfied that the  possibility of setting special terms beyond the framework of the  "partnership" program is enshrined in the protocol on the  results of the discussion between the Russian Federation foreign  minister and the North Atlantic Council. The protocol is no  more than a very vague melody, which has yet to be painstakingly  transformed into a "tune" of specific agreements and mutual  commitments by our diplomats and our military, and their NATO  colleagues alike.    But be that as it may, this integrative aspect looks very  specific. If only because Moscow's aims here, as a rule, are  obvious both to Moscow itself and to its partners. The picture  regarding relations with the former Soviet republics, where the  question of the fundamental reinforcement of relations with  Russia has already been placed on the agenda, looks different  altogether. Just as, three years ago, some politicians tried to  use to their ends the aspiration for sovereignization which  suddenly overwhelmed their peoples, today others are trying to  harness the trend toward reintegration. The Belorussian  [Belarusian] premier's lightning visit to Moscow on the very eve  of the presidential elections clearly had the purpose of  demonstrating to the people this very contender's special  relations with Russia. This is not the only example.    Meanwhile, in Russia itself, isolationist ideas are  spreading  widely, their thrust being that it is not worth our weak, but  not defunct economy's taking on the burden of other states'  problems. Official Moscow is still playing a waiting game,  preferring that its partners themselves should define the level  and nature of the relations they would like to have with Russia.    This was the only possible approach yesterday, in the period  of sovereignization panic. But today, the time has come to  formulate more clearly just what Russia's state policy is on  this issue. Does Moscow want a new and closer association than  the CIS presupposes? If so, then on what terms in the sphere of  politics, economics, and security guarantees could this come  about? A clear position here is important not least because it  will block the road to demagogues and political speculators.  The collapse of the Union created difficulties for the millions  and millions of family and friendship links. It is this, in the  experts' view, which became one of the main reasons for the  terrible economic slump. And now, when the task ahead is, if  not to halt this slump, then at least to slow it down, the issue  of restoring old relations on a new and mutually advantageous  basis appears pertinent to the highest degree.    Many people in the West understand the need for this. At the  very least, the agreement between Russia and the EU provides for  preserving preferential economic regimes in relations with  Moscow and CIS countries. "Russia's future might will depend  upon its ability to guarantee security and its own influence  everywhere where geography offers such a possibility." This is  the view of Helene Carrere d'Encosse, member of the Academie  Francaise and a recognized expert in Russian affairs, which she  expressed recently in LE FIGARO. It would seem that she has  picked out the call of the future. The ball in in Moscow's  court.</p>

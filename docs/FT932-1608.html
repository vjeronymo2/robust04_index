			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Financial crisis hits biggest rail union THE RMT transport union, which represents 105,000 workers mainly in the rail and maritime sectors, faces a financial crisis. The union spent Pounds 3.6m more than its Pounds 6.4m income in 1991, the last year for which it has provided figures. The crisis is likely to be exacerbated by a significant cut in income from its core membership in British Rail. Officials say it could face a cut of more than Pounds 1m in income following BR's decision to stop 'check-off' facilities - the automatic deduction of union dues from pay packets. The union has won a new reputation for militancy in the past few months with two one-day strikes against rail privatisation and a decision to hold a ballot on industrial action over the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit. As a result of the industrial action against privatisation BR said it would withdraw check-off, which has existed since 1965. It had been expected that BR might change its mind, but the union executive has pre-empted this and decided it does not want to continue with check-off as long as it can be used as a weapon against the union. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's leader, put a brave face on the move. He said: 'Leaving check-off could be a blessing in disguise, we are going to have to re-learn some old organisational lessons.' The union hopes that a majority of members will switch to direct debit payments from their bank accounts, but a sizeable minority of 30 per cent to 40 per cent are expected to pay union collectors. One official said that between 10 per cent and 25 per cent of the 68,000 members in BR were likely to stop paying dues altogether. The same official admitted that the union had financial problems but stressed that the 1991 deficit was partly a result of the cost of mergers and said the figure was substantially lower last year. 'The danger is that the income loss from ending check-off could push the deficit back up,' he said. Like many unions the RMT's expenditure - Pounds 10m in 1991 - was not initially cut in line with the fall in membership income caused by large job cuts on the railways. The union has assets of more than Pounds 12m, but most of that is tied up in property.</p>

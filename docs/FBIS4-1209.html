			<p>BFN     [Text] Ventersdorp April 24 SAPA -- The Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] has  rejected the accord on Afrikaner self-determination. "The AWB  rejects the pathetic little sham masquerading as `a historic  agreement' signed between the Freedom Front [FF], African  National Congress and the National Party," the AWB's Executive  Council said in Ventersdorp in the north-eastern Transvaal on  Sunday [24 April].    The accord, signed in Pretoria on Saturday, makes provision  for a 20-member volkstaat [homeland] council to constitutionally  pursue the establishment of a white homeland.    FF leader General Constand Viljoen had "reached new depths  in  political naivety and plain duplicity by announcing this  agreement as a breakthrough and virtually regarding it as an  acceptance of a volkstaat by the African National Congress," the  AWB said.    "The ANC leadership has said repeatedly a volkstaat is not  acceptable, and Gen Viljoen himself has gone so far as to state  there is no `instant volkstaat' and that in such a state  `non-citizens' or non-Afrikaners would also be involved in  governing and direction of the state.    "How can this be the self-determination for which he says he  stands?"    The volkstaat meant nothing, the AWB said.    "Gen Viljoen knows it. The FF is in the election for no  other  purpose than to try and cash in for their own financial benefit."</p>

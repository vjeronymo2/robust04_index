			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays results fail to upset equities TRULY terrible results from Barclays and the absence of a rate cut from the Bundesbank threw cold water yesterday over the London stock market's moves to new peaks. However, share price losses were modest and the Footsie held on to the 2,900-plus territory in a session showing every sign of a consolidation phase. At the day's low the Footsie brushed against 2,904.4, still several points above the previous trading high set on Wednesday. The FT-SE 100 Index closed 13.8 off at 2,904.8, with the heavy fall in Barclays finally accounting for just over 4 points of the setback. The dividend cut and very heavy debt provisions by the bank dealt a severe blow to the share price. The effects were muted to some extent by immediate suggestions by sector analysts that either Barclays shares were a buy at last night's close or that investors should switch into other UK bank stocks. Extremely heavy volume in Barclays shares made up nearly 8 per cent of total equity turnover. Stocks opened lower, slipping back in the face of a weaker pound and Barclays' results. The market steadied, however, and it was not until the Bundesbank policy meeting had come and gone that share prices began to sag. At worst the Footsie was down by 16.1 but selling was slight and strategists were cheered to see the 2,900 mark well held. Underlying optimism ahead of the UK Budget on March 16 was reflected in renewed demand for the second line stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed 10 points to an all-time high of 3,087.9. However, trading in non-Footsie stocks remained relatively light, constituting only about 58 per cent of the day's Seaq volume of 660.1m shares. On Wednesday, Seaq turnover of 710.6m translated into Pounds 1.48bn of retail business. The absence of the rights issue predicted at the close of the previous session brought only brief respite. There were stronger rumours last night that a company in the Footsie list planned an equity funding move today. The satisfactory reception for equity rights issues over the past fortnight was reinforced yesterday by dis-closure of a 93 per cent-plus take-up for Commercial Union's rights offer. With downside pressures on the market offset to some extent by the switching within the banking sector and also by further strong US demand for ICI shares, most of the leading blue chips stayed close to overnight levels. Oil issues, having had a good run over the past few sessions in London, settled easier yesterday following a cool per-formance from Wall Street, both overnight and in early trading in the new session; the Dow Industrial Average was down 8 points in UK dealing hours. Poor results and workforce lay-offs at Philips Electronics had only marginal effect in London. Store and retail issues were a shade easier but confidence in a cut in base rates at Budget time remained solid and there were few sellers of these interest rate-orientated stocks. Across the range of the market, analysts remained confident that the move to new peaks on the London stock market was justified by expectations of lower interest rates in Europe and the expectation of a recovery in the British economy.</p>

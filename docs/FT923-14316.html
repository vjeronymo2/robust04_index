			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Fears raised on reliability of equipment: Defence white paper analyses lessons from Gulf war Women may move closer to front line RELIABILITY of army land vehicles during the Gulf war was criticised yesterday in the annual defence white paper. It says unreliability had considerable implications for operations and was overcome only by a disproportionate application of maintenance and spares. Equipment and spares had to be borrowed or purchased from allied and friendly countries. In spite of such handicaps, preliminary lessons from the conflict suggested that no big changes in British military doctrine and organisation were required. The white paper says the Gulf campaign exposed a number of shortcomings, although those should not detract from an outstandingly successful operation. It highlights difficulties during the campaign, providing the services with opportunities to lobby for particular projects such as the the European Fighter Aircraft and the army's new anti-tank helicopter. The performance of Challenger 1, the British army's battle tank manufactured by Vickers, is described merely as 'effective'. The tank's reliability and fire-control system were limiting factors, the white paper says. Since the conflict, the Ministry of Defence has put in an order for about 130 new-generation Challenger 2 tanks. The white paper says older support and engineering vehicles were unable to keep up with more modern equipment and had been left behind. The report also lobbies for a replacement for the Lynx anti-tank helicopter. It says the aircraft lacked the ability to withstand ground fire which is required in a dedicated attack helicopter. The army has indicated a strong preference for the American AH64 Apache. Westland of the UK has reached an agreement with McDonnell Douglas of the US for a British-assembled version. The Midge drone, used to provide airborne surveillance, proved unreliable and unable to provide real-time information. A new remotely piloted vehicle, called Phoenix, is due to replace the Midge in 1993. The white paper attempts to explain why the Royal Air Force lost six Tornado GR1 jets, but says it was not because they were flying low to use the airfield-denying weapon, JP233. Only one jet was lost on a JP233 mission. However, four of the aircraft were lost at low level, the only height where the jet's sensors and weapon systems could be effectively employed. The report concludes that the conflict demonstrated a need for a more flexible approach to future RAF training requirements. It also argues that the campaign showed the importance of achieving air superiority and the value of an agile British intelligence organisations are cleared by the white paper of misreading Saddam Hussein's intentions. Intelligence resources at the time were focused on the changes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The whole campaign cost the UK about Pounds 2.5bn, according to the paper. The Ministry of Defence said yesterday that about Pounds 1.5bn had already been supplied through burden-sharing and it expected approximately Pounds 500m to be provided before the end of the year.</p>

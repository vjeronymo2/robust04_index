			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Brandon Hire jumps to Pounds 610,000 Pre-tax profits at Brandon Hire jumped from Pounds 99,000 to Pounds 610,000, on sales doubled to Pounds 4.69m, in the six months to October 31. Mr Brian Nathan, chairman of the Bristol-based hirer of power tools and catering equipment and distributor of industrial fasteners, described the period as the most significant in the company's history. Mr John Laycock became chief executive in May when his company JSL Fasteners was acquired by Brandon Hire, in which he now holds 42 per cent of the share capital. Mr Nathan said Mr Laycock had 'set out on the promised path without delay and a programme of controlled expansion is proceeding'. He added: 'I do not wish to be over-optimistic but I look forward to the future with considerable enthusiasm.' In October, Beechwood Hire and Sales, with seven branches in south Wales and one in Bristol, was bought for Pounds 1.8m. Winchester Tool Hire was acquired earlier this month. Earnings per share were 3.3p (0.86p). The company is changing its year-end from April 30 to December 31 and the current trading period will cover the eight months to end-December. It intends to declare a combined interim and final dividend for that period.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany's agricultural income falls by 16% GERMAN AGRICULTURE suffered a 16 per cent drop in income in 1990-91 and most full-time farmers face the prospect of no improvement in the current year, according to the government's latest annual agricultural report. However, a recovery in both output and prices for cereals, rapeseed, potatoes and wine should mean an overall improvement in farm incomes of between 5 and 10 per cent, to claw back some of the losses, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, the agriculture minister, said yesterday. In spite of all the European Community rules, agricultural incomes in Germany are still determined primarily by market forces, he said. Pigmeat prices were good, because there was no over-supply, whereas beef prices were falling because surpluses were piling up in the warehouses. The only way to ensure a lasting improvement in farm incomes was to bring order to the markets, he said. The other black spot for German agriculture was the virtual collapse of production and employment in the former East Germany, although reliable output statistics have yet to be produced. As far as farm jobs in the east were concerned, only 300,000 out of a former workforce of 850,000 still had jobs on the land at the end of 1991, and 158,000 of those were on short-time: most of the latter are likely to be declared unemployed in the coming months. The relatively cautious pessimism of the annual report, and its forecasts for the present year, were immediately condemned by the German Bauernverband, the farmers' union, as over-optimistic. The economic situation in many agricultural enterprises in the former East Germany, in particular, it described as 'catastrophic'. The union estimated the drop in incomes at 21 per cent, and forecast that incomes for the animal feed-based sectors - including dairy, fatstock, and sheepmeat - were more likely to fall this year than rise. Mr Kiechle said in his report that the number of agricultural enterprises in Germany fell by 5.5 per cent in 1991, to about 595,000, compared with a four-year average since 1987 of 3.4 per cent per year. Full-time farms now account for slightly less than half of all enterprises, and German agriculture remains dominated by small units, even where they are full-time operations. The average size of full-time farms was 31.4 hectares, and of part-time operations 19.1 hectares. The minister avoided any comment on the current Uruguay round of negotiations in the Genral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, over which he has been fighting a rearguard action to ensure open-ended income support for German farmers, in place of price subsidies. The German government remains split between Mr Kiechle and Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the Economics Minister, who is pushing for greater concessions on agriculture to ensure a successful outcome to the negotiations. Mr Kiechle has managed to protect his farmers this year, by negotiating additional income support measures to replace the 3 per cent VAT rebate (an exclusively German national measure), which expired at the end of 1991.</p>

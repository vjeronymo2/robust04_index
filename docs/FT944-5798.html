			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (14): Geographical complexity  -Case study / Nutreco The Dollars 425m sale earlier this year of British Petroleum's animal and fish feeds divisions was the largest management buy-out since the purchase of Gardner Merchant, the contract catering company, from Forte in 1992. But it was also one of the most complex buy-outs in recent years because of the wide geographical spread of the business and the need to transform the 150 disparate legal entities involved into a coherent corporate structure. The Nutreco buy-out involved 20 operating companies employing 5,700 people at 250 main sites in 19 different legal jurisdictions. Combined annual turnover of the businesses is more than Dollars 2bn. The top tier of 70-80 senior managers own 11.5 per of Nutreco's shares, although there are plans to encourage wider share ownership among employees. The buy-out was the final piece of a Dollars 1.5bn disposal programme begun by BP in 1992, when the company decided to focus on its core activity as an integrated oil and natural gas company. The companies slated for sale were grouped under the BP Nutrition Division, although their products ranged from shampoo to fish feeds. They included such household names as Purina Mills, one of the largest animal feed operators in the US, as well as small specialist companies operating in worldwide national or regional markets. Most of the businesses in the Nutreco buy-out are involved in fish and animal feeds, although there are also abattoirs as well as poultry breeding and pork processing operations. In some ways they were a strange mishmash of companies,' said one adviser to the deal. 'They represented the rump of BP Nutrition,' he added. But Simon Rowlands of CINven, which jointly led the buy-out with Baring Capital Investors, says Nutreco's broad portfolio of products and geographical spread were part of its appeal. So, too, was its presence in fish foods, a fast growing sector worldwide. Although Nutreco is often described as being basically an animal feeds business, Mr Rowlands says it is 'rapidly becoming a fish feeds business with animal feeds attached'. But the benefits of a broad geographic spread also created problems in structuring the deal. 'There was the whole question of control and management cultures,' says Mr Rowlands. 'We had to take a view on whether to go forth as a single international company or as a series of national barons.' The decision was to form a more coherent company under Richard van Wijnbergen, chief executive, with headquarters in Boxmeer in the Netherlands. But the task of transforming the business at the same time as structuring the deal proved tricky. One problem for the 20 operating companies was the shock of leaving the BP fold. 'Severing the cord to mother BP proved to be a painful process for some of the companies,' says one adviser. The lack of detailed information on the businesses became evident at a relatively early stage, says Mr Rowlands. 'BP's information availability was not as extensive as one would have liked,' he says. An extensive due diligence exercise put considerable pressure on the local managers of the companies. But the information it uncovered led to a change in the structure of the deal as well as in its price. It also caused some delays. Chris Berisford, a partner in the London corporate finance department of accountants KPMG, said the unusual nature of the disparate markets served by the various businesses complicated the exercise. 'Some businesses were purely international, like fish feeds, while others, such as slaughterhouses, had a very regional focus,' he said. Many of the companies also had complex contracts with their customers that were related to the cyclical commodity markets in which they operated, but which were difficult to understand. Such complexity meant that 'the numbers kept changing all the time,' according to Mr Berisford. The structure of the deal also caused some anxiety among the national companies, in large part because the buyers wanted to put the debt into the various operating divisions. Mr Rowlands at CINven said executives at many continental European operations found it difficult to understand why their companies had to assume a portion of Nutreco's debt. 'The Spanish operating company would ask 'why are people in London and Holland imposing this on us?'' The geographic spread of the businesses meant that the closing of the deal had to be carefully planned. Alastair Dickson, of London lawyers Dickson Minto, said the deal structure called for tiers of acquisitions to be executed within a short period over time zones that stretched from Australia to South America. The deal closed on September 30 after two days of transfers, notarisations and banking transactions. Mr Rowlands says it was the sheer complexity of the Nutreco deal that resulted in another unusual feature of the buy-out; the fact the two financial institutions led the deal. 'It was the first time that two financial institutions had worked so closely together,' he says. But it is unlikely to be the last. He believes more joint deals will emerge in the future as buy-outs become bigger and more complex.</p>

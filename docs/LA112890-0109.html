			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WBC ENJOINED FROM PUNISHING HOLYFIELD  </P> <P> A judge in Paterson, N.J., ruled that the World Boxing Council cannot strip  heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield of his title for fighting former  champion George Foreman, pending arbitration.  </P> <P> Acting Tuesday on a suit filed by Main Events-Monitor Production, Inc., and  Holyfield, State Superior Court Judge Amos Saunders ordered the WBC to show  cause why it should not submit to arbitration with the plaintiffs "in  accordance with the plaintiffs' demands for arbitration filed with the American  Arbitration Assn."  </P> <P> Saunders also enjoined the WBC from withdrawing championship recognition from  Holyfield "pending completion and resolution" of the arbitration.  </P> <P> Holyfield knocked out Buster Douglas in Las Vegas last month to take the title,  and signed a contract to make his first defense against Foreman April 19. The  WBC had threatened to strip Holyfield of his title if he does not defend  against Mike Tyson first.  </P></p>

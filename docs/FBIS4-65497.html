			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Paul Brown report: "Plea To Raise Aldermaston Secrecy </F> Veil"]    [Text] The Cold War mentality perpetuated by the Ministry  of Defence is denying people who live near the Aldermaston  atomic weapons establishment in Berkshire the right to know what  dangers they face from its activities, a leading civil rights  lawyer says in a report to be published today.    The report, "Secrecy versus Safety," by Helena Kennedy QC,  follows an inquiry set up by Reading council in March to give  local people and organisations a chance to air their concerns.    Its main recommendation is that Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence  Secretary, set up a public inquiry into safety at the base to  inform people of the risks.    Ms Kennedy says the establishment, "like many other British  government institutions, seems to be suffering from a very  British disease -- the need to cover even its most mundane  activities in a cloak of official secrecy.    "This is very much a remnant of the Cold War mentality which  is being perpetuated by the Ministry of Defence. Consequently,  however much the management genuinely wish to be more open, they  will run up against superiors who seem to have little concept of  public feeling in and around Aldermaston.    "If any one factor is clear from this inquiry, it is the  fact  that the concerns and anxieties will not go away. Furthermore,  it is difficult to see why they should. People have contracted  fatal illnesses for which they and their families have received  no satisfactory response, waterways are threatened with  pollution and the environment is seen to be constantly at risk.    "As most of the witnesses stated there may be nothing to  fear  from AWE's activities, but then again there might. Without any  information the fear, anxieties and rumours will continue and  expand. There is no greater way to encourage such feelings than  for a government institution to hide behind the Official Secrets  Act at every turn and refuse any independent monitoring of its  activities."    Ms Kennedy says local people need to be able to make  informed  choices about work, housing and schools. These concerns could  be satisfied only by a full, independent public inquiry covering  all aspects of the establishment.    The report suggests the inquiry should start before the end  of 1994. Reading council will today forward the report to Mr  Rifkind with a request that one be set up.    Natalie O'Toole, a spokeswoman for the council, said local  people had no proper means of communicating with the plant.  There was a liaison committee on which the council had a  representative but it had met only twice and the public had no  access to it.    The council is planning to set up a community forum on  Aldermaston to raise locals' concerns. The council would then  ask for answers on their behalf at the liaison meetings.    Ms O'Toole said: "Getting answers out of Mr Rikind on these  matters is like chipping away at a block of granite."</p>

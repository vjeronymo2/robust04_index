			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dong Shukui: "The New Tax System Will Attract </F> Even More Foreign Business Investors"]    [Text] Since the start of reform and opening up, our  country has all along used two tax systems governing  domestically funded enterprises and foreign-funded and foreign  enterprises respectively, levying separate taxes on them. In  regard to turnover tax, the uniform industry and commerce tax  was levied on foreign-funded and foreign enterprises in  accordance with the Provisions for the Uniform Industry and  Commerce Tax of the People's Republic of China (Draft) which was  adopted in principle by the 101st meeting of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] in 1958 and  which was promulgated and put into effect on a trial basis by  the State Council. On the other hand the product tax, value  added tax, and business tax were levied on domestically funded  enterprises in accordance with the relevant draft tax  regulations promulgated and put into effect on a trial basis by  the State Council in 1984 with the NPC Standing Committee's  authorization.    In 1993 our country comprehensively reformed the industry  and  commerce tax system, promulgating provisional regulations on the  new value added tax, consumption tax, and business tax. At the  same time, the fifth meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing  Committee decided: "Beginning on 1 January 1994, the provisional  regulations on the value added tax, provisional regulations on  the consumption tax, and provisional regulations on the business  tax promulgated by the State Council will be applicable to  foreign-funded enterprises and foreign enterprises," and "the  Provisions for the Uniform Industry and Commerce Tax of the  People's Republic of China (Draft) will be abolished at the same  time." In this way turnover taxes levied on domestically funded  enterprises and foreign-funded and foreign enterprises have been  unified. This reform is sure to play a positive role in  enhancing economic exchanges between our country and other  countries, in expanding the opening to the outside world, in  utilizing foreign capital to a greater extent, and in promoting  the development of foreign-funded enterprises. The new tax  system has created a favorable taxation environment for foreign  business investment in China.    1. Levying a uniform value added tax, consumption tax,  and business tax has evened out tax burdens on domestically  funded enterprises and on foreign-funded enterprises. The  uniform industry and commerce tax rates for 94 of the 141  industries and product categories subjected to the previous  uniform industry and commerce tax were higher than the rates of  the product, value added, and business taxes levied on  domestically funded enterprises; in some cases the differences  were substantial. For instance, in the case of beer, the uniform  industry and commerce tax rate was 40 percent, whereas the  product tax rate was only 25 percent; in the case of cotton  yarn, the uniform industry and commerce tax rate was 23-26  percent, whereas the previous value added tax rate was 14  percent, with an effective tax burden of around 5 percent; in  the case of electronic watches and quartz clocks, the uniform  industry and commerce tax rate was 20 percent, whereas the  previous value added tax rate and the part-of-price tax rate  were 14 percent, with an effective tax burden of around 5  percent. In addition, some industries granted tax-break  preferences to domestically funded enterprises; for instance,  domestically funded flour mills and feed-processing plants were  completely exempted from taxes, whereas foreign-funded flour  mills and feed-processing plants had to pay a 10-yuan or 5  percent uniform industry and commerce tax. After the reform of  the tax system, the value added tax, business tax, and  consumption tax are levied on domestically funded enterprises  and foreign-funded and foreign enterprises in a uniform manner,  thereby eliminating unfairness in tax burdens.    2. Tax burdens created by most of the products produced  by foreign-funded enterprises have been reduced or remain  unchanged. According to a survey of 1,253 enterprises in  Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Wuhan, Qingdao,  and Dalian, tax burdens on 70 percent of the enterprises have  declined somewhat or remain unchanged after the tax reform. The  products which create reduced tax burdens mainly include: beer,  refrigerators, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, videocassette  recorders, electronic clocks and watches, wrist watches,  electric fans, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.    3. The value added tax has eliminated the previous  uniform industry and commerce tax's problem of duplicate  taxation. A common feature of the previous industry and  commerce tax and the new value added tax is the levying of tax  on every phase of production and business operation. That is, if  a commodity has to go through the production, processing, and  marketing carried out by five independent enterprises before  finally entering consumption, taxes will be collected five  times. However, the previous uniform industry and commerce tax  was levied on the total sales revenues; the more phases of  production, processing, and circulation a commodity has to go  through, the heavier the tax burden will be. The value added tax  is levied only on the value added at each phase; the amount of  tax burden created by a commodity is directly related to how  much value has been added, but is not significantly related to  the number of phases of production, processing, and circulation.  This is conducive to the specialization, coordination, and  socialization of production.    4. Conducive to foreign-funded enterprises' production  of products for export. In order to encourage the entry of  their own countries products into the international market and  to enhance the competitiveness of their own countries' products  on the international market, most countries follow a no tax  policy toward products for export. Since the start of the  opening to the outside world, our country has all along followed  a policy of exempting exports produced by foreign-funded  enterprises from the uniform industry and commerce tax. As the  uniform industry and commerce tax was levied on the total amount  at each phase, it was not clear how much tax on raw materials  used for producing exports was collected; consequently exports  had to be exempted from the final round of taxation. The  provisional regulations on the value added tax promulgated in  December last year stipulate that the tax rate for exports be  zero. It is also stipulated that "in exporting goods for which  the applicable tax rate is zero, taxpayers may apply for the  refund of tax paid on the exports at taxation agencies on a  monthly basis by showing the relevant certificatory documents  such as customs declaration forms, after going through customs  formalities for exports." That is: there can be a refund of the  value added tax collected at all the phases, from that of raw  materials to that of finished products, which exports have to go  through. The implementation of this policy will doubtless  enhance the competitive position of products produced by  foreign-funded enterprises on the international market, and is  therefore conducive to foreign-funded enterprises' production of  products for export.    5. Foreign businesses' vested interests related to  their investments in China will be protected. The idea  behind the design of this round of reform of the tax system is  that reform should neither increase burdens on enterprises nor  reduce the state's fiscal revenues, keeping the overall tax  burden at the preexisting level. Nevertheless, because of  changes in the structure of the tax system, simplification of  tax rates, and reform of the arrangement regarding the phases on  which taxes are levied, a small number of foreign-funded  enterprises will still see increases in their tax burdens  despite the fact that tax burdens on most foreign-funded  enterprises will be reduced or remain unchanged. In order to  ensure that foreign-funded enterprises will not suffer  economic-interest losses because of the reform, the Eighth NPC  Standing Committee has decided to adopt appropriate measures to  resolve the problem of likely increases in tax burdens on  foreign-funded enterprises. That is: if their tax burdens are  increased because of the change into levying the value added  tax, consumption tax, and business tax, those foreign-funded  enterprises which were approved and established before 31  December 1993 may receive the refund of the additional amount of  tax paid because of the increase in their tax burdens for the  approved period of operation, after their relevant applications  are approved by taxation agencies; they may receive such tax  refunds for a maximum period of five years. A value added tax in  kind and, under the existing regulations, the mining-area use  fees will be levied on the crude oil and natural gas recovered  by offshore oil-exploiting enterprises, but the resource tax  will not be levied on them for the time being. The value added  tax rate will be 5 percent.    6. The foreigner-involved tax preference policies  formulated by the state since the start of reform and opening up  will, in principle, all remain unchanged. The Income Tax on  Foreign-Funded Enterprises and Foreign Enterprises Law of the  People's Republic of China adopted by the NPC in 1991 will still  be applied to foreign-funded enterprises and foreign  enterprises. A reduced income tax rate of 15 percent will be  applied to enterprises in the special economic zones and  foreign-funded production enterprises in economic and  technological development zones; a reduced income tax rate of 24  percent will be applied to foreign-funded production enterprises  in coastal open economic regions and open cities; foreign-funded  production enterprises will be exempted from the income tax for  two years, and will enjoy an income tax rate which is reduced by  half for three years, beginning in the year in which they start  to make profits. All the preferential policies on the enterprise  income tax will continue to be followed.    With regard to turnover tax, the preferential tax policies  regarding the uniform industry and commerce tax which were  formulated by the state previously, such as those of exempting  machinery, equipment, and parts imported by foreign-funded  enterprises within the confines of the total volumes of  investment from the import-phase turnover tax, of exempting the  raw materials imported for the purpose of producing exports from  the import-phase turnover tax, and of granting tax preferences  to the bonded zones, will all be continued.    All this shows that the new tax system has not increased tax  burdens on foreign investors but rather created a fair, relaxed,  and favorable taxation environment for foreign investors, and  that thus it is sure to induce even more foreign businesses to  invest in our country.</p>

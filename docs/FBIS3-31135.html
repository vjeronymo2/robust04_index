			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] About five minutes ago, editor Agata Stanekova  returned from Brussels. The Slovak Republic signed today, as  the seventh state of the postcommunist countries of Central and  East Europe, the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program at NATO  headquarters in Brussels. It was signed by Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar.    Agata Stanekova asked Meciar what the significance of this  document was:    [Begin recording] [Stanekova] Prime minister, the Slovak  Republic officially confirmed by its signature today its joining  the Partnership for Peace program. What does the partnership  offer to Slovakia and vice versa?    [Meciar] The PFP offers certain guarantees. Above all, it is  the condition of this partnership to accept human and citizens'  rights, and, to prevent arguments about interpretation, when  meeting Mr. Clinton, it was guaranteed that we understand them  as individual rights. Another condition of the partnership is  recognition of the current frontiers. This does not create any  problems for us; on the contrary, we welcome it.    The PFP provides the opportunity for political  consultations.  The PFP provides the opportunity, in case of a feeling of  threat, to carry out consultations with the other countries of  NATO, although it does not bind NATO countries to military  support or joint action. The PFP offers the chance to build the  Army so that its organizational structure corresponds to the  structure of the NATO Armed Forces. It provides the opportunity  to participate in military planning, but also finance, and it  provides the opportunity to set up joint units and joint  training.    The Slovak side has expanded its offer of our arms industry  because, sooner or later, the armies of NATO countries will  unite their equipment, and we would like to take part in this  process and to provide our production capacities. We have  likewise offered to establish centers for the training of  officers of the units, which will be common within NATO, in the  Slovak Republic. Similarly, it will be possible to use training  areas in our country. So, it is a process that has opened and  has been prepared. We have stated our approach to the offer  that we received, and, further, there will be talks at home  about the treaty, which we should conclude and which will give  rise to clear bilateral rules between Slovakia and NATO.    [Stanekova] The signing of this document was the first step.  If this treaty was signed, what should be the basis for  specifying further steps?    [Meciar] This was, in fact, an invitation to cooperation,  which we accepted and signed. [passage omitted] For us it is  important that a delegation of NATO high commissioners should  come to our country soon. It has been promised by both Mr.  Shalikashvili and U.S. representatives, and by the NATO  secretary general. This delegation should have talks about the  conditions of the treaty. After its conclusion, a bilateral  treaty relationship will come into being. [passage omitted]  The duration of this treaty will determine whether the country  will be accepted as a member of NATO. The first step is behind  us, and we have just started the second one.    [Stanekova] Despite all of this, some senior politicians,  when speaking about new countries joining NATO, usually mention  only Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, leaving out  Slovakia.    [Meciar] This has happened to some politicians. However,  yesterday, for instance, I met German Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe, who had also done this. We have clarified everything,  and his immediate reaction was to invite the defense minister of  the Slovak Republic to visit him, and he himself visited the  Slovak Republic. Sometimes we have blown out of proportion  something that has not always been done on purpose, taking it as  a political precedent or a political intention--though this has  never, in fact, been the case. I can say with pleasure that  everything was clarified and that Slovakia is being fully  accepted and fully relied upon.    Our geopolitical position clearly earns us such a position  that we cannot be left out. Interest in the Slovak Republic is  going to grow gradually. However, we have to take into account  that the Federal Republic of Germany shares its borders with  Poland and the Czech Republic, and their joint military  exercises may take place there. Despite this, there is no  reason to believe they are not interested in Slovakia. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

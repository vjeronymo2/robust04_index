			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada to ask EC to curb trawler catches CANADA IS dispatching a senior diplomat and a team of scientists to Brussels next week to protest against a vast increase in the amount of fish caught by Spanish and Portuguese trawlers in the north-west Atlantic. The mission will coincide with the expected announcement of a drastic cut in northern cod quotas for the domestic fishery, following an alarming drop in the catch within Canada's 200-mile fishing zone. The dwindling catch forced Newfoundland's biggest fish processing company, Fishery Products International, to close one of its processing plants last week, putting 1,000 people out of work. Mr John Crosbie, the fisheries minister, said that Canada would ask the European Community to respect a moratorium on cod fishing outside the 200-mile limit. During a special debate in Parliament on Wednesday, opposition MPs also urged the government to extend unilaterally Canada's fishing zone. Canada estimates that Portuguese, Spanish and Panamanian-flagged vessels caught 48,000 to 50,000 tonnes of cod outside the 200-mile limit last year, more than double the 1990 catch of 22,000 tonnes. The government is concerned that the spirit of understanding and compromise that marked discussions with the EC early last year appears to have evaporated. 'The Commission, faced with choices, is choosing to do very little,' one official said yesterday. Concern about fish stocks centres on an area stretching northward from the south-east coast of Newfoundland to about halfway up the coast of Labrador. Commercial and scientific evidence began appearing last autumn of shortages in the northern part of this area, as well as a sudden drop in the proportion of older fish. A scientific advisory committee has urged the government to cut the northern cod catch in the first half of this year to 25,000 tonnes from 50,000 tonnes in the first six months of 1991. The entire catch for last year of 127,000 tonnes was well below the quota of 190,000 tonnes. The government has previously been reluctant to order a heavy cut in quotas in order to minimise the short-term damage to economic activity in Newfoundland, which is Canada's poorest province. There now appears to be a widespread realisation that the long-term health of the fishery requires immediate measures to allow stocks to recover.</p>

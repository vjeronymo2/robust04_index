			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Labour raps grant aid to Tory council Labour yesterday accused the government of giving Wandsworth council an unfair share of grants. It said the share-out would allow the London borough  -a Conservative 'flagship' - to set a low council tax. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said Wandsworth was receiving 11.6 per cent of the government's total 'non-needs' grants for England even though the borough has only 0.9 per cent of the population. The move put council tax at the centre of Labour's local election campaign in London. Labour attacked Wandsworth's high figures for transitional relief - intended to shield individuals who had a low poll tax from sharp annual increases - and the 'buffering' grant it had received to minimise the impact of changes in the formula for distributing grant. According to Mr Straw, these two subsidies were equivalent to Pounds 474 for each Wandsworth council taxpayer. 'The favouritism shown to Wandsworth this year is a consequence of the way in which the government has stuffed central government grant into the borough over the past few years,' he said. 'It is because government grant kept the poll tax and then the council tax artificially low in the borough that it is to receive so much relief this year.' Westminster, a neighbouring Conservative borough, has set the current lowest council tax in England, at Pounds 245 for properties in band D, which represents a Pounds 50 cut since 1993-94. Most other London local authorities are likely to set their council tax next week. County councils yesterday attacked the local government minister's assertion that improving the current two-tier system of local government is not allowed by law. The comments, made by Mr David Curry at a conference of the Association of District Councils on Tuesday, dashed counties' hopes of a compromise outcome to the local government review, which would see counties devolve some of their powers to districts. Mr Curry said the legislation allowed only for the continuation of the two-tier status quo or for all-purpose unitary authorities. However, counties now seem set on continuing their call for less radical reforms of the existing structure. Ms Josie Farrington, leader of the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, claimed Mr Curry had 'missed the point'. She said: 'It is now clear that the local government commission can recommend a continuation of the two-tier structure. 'Obviously, where that structure ought to be improved it can be. However, contrary to what Mr Curry said, there is no need to change the law to enable this to happen.'</p>

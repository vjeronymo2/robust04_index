			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets We apologise to readers for the fact that yesterday's World Stock Markets Page failed to carry 1992 high and low price information. In addition, incorrect closing indices were given for the US and Canadian markets. In each case, the index figure published related to the day before the date printed at the top of the tables.</p>

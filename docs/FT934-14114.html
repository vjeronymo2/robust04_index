			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / BT hopes for Pounds 2bn revenue from video BRITISH Telecommunications could generate revenue of about Pounds 2bn a year by the end of the decade from video-on-demand services offered across its telephone network, according to an internal company memorandum. That would yield it profits of about Pounds 600m, assuming a base of about 8m subscribers, each paying about Pounds 250 a year at today's prices. The memorandum - obtained by the FT's Telecom Markets newsletter - is further evidence of BT's determination to enter the home entertainment market, despite a government ban on it doing so before the year 2001. Last week's Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.5bn) takeover of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest American cable TV company, by Bell Atlantic, the US regional telephone group, will strengthen BT's resolve, as the biggest indication yet that the telecommunications, cable, and entertainment industries are converging. BT argues that video-on-demand is not covered by the existing prohibition. If - as seems likely - its board decides to go ahead with a pilot project, it will face a protracted legal and regulatory battle, particularly with cable companies (mostly US owned) building combined phone and cable TV networks in conurbations. The Independent Television Commission does not believe that BT needs a special broadcasting licence to offer video-on-demand. But Oftel, the regulatory authority, will have to clarify the terms of BT's licence. It has still not been approached by the company. BT projections of the size of the potential home entertainment market are far more ambitious than those of most City analysts. They appear to represent the views of those in the company lobbying hardest for a video-on-demand service. There is also doubt as to the technical capacity of the BT network to provide a video-on-demand service. It plans to test its capability next year in Colchester, Essex. Digitally-compressed signals will go through the telephone wire at the same time as the spoken word, with special decoders to translate them into pictures. If the trials succeed, a large scale pilot project will follow to cover about 25,000 homes by the spring of 1995.</p>

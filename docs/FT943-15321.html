			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Quarter-finals could hang on the ninth team - The World Cup referees have had more of an influence on some games than the players There are only nine teams left - seven from Europe, one from South America and the referees. The eight World Cup teams that have made the quarter-finals know what they must do to reach next Sunday's final. The nine remaining referees, all eager to officiate in Pasadena on July 17, must be pretty confused. The referees dominated the second-round matches. Kurt Roethlisberger, the Swiss who harboured realistic hopes of refereeing the final, fell on his sharpened pencil after the Germany-Belgium match, confessing that he had missed Thomas Helmer's penalty-area trip on Josip Weber. His public mea culpa did little good. He will not officiate again in this World Cup. Fifa, soccer's governing body, does not look kindly on officials who miss offences that television catches. But what of poor Arturo Pablo Brizio of Mexico and Jamal Al-Sharif of Syria, who refereed last Tuesday's two matches like poker players pulling cards from their pockets at every opportunity? Surely they were doing Fifa's bidding? Apparently not; neither has been kept on for the last three rounds. Fifa is using its referees to conduct a re-education programme of players. All sorts of things they are used to doing are no longer allowed. Want to kick or trip an opponent? Yellow card. Want to dive, feign injury, shoot when I have blown for offside? Yellow card. Almost the only offence that does not seem to attract a yellow card is waving your hand in the referee's face to demand a yellow card for an opponent. The effect on play can be disastrous. If a referee books a player for a silly offence, there is a chance he will find himself with no choice but to send him off for another silly offence later. Al-Sharif found himself expelling Emil Kremenliev of Bulgaria for little reason in Tuesday's match against Mexico. You could almost feel Al-Sharif's relief when Luis Garcia, booked earlier for shirt-tugging, raised a boot a little high in pursuit of a bouncing ball. Normally this would have been an indirect free-kick, but Garcia was sent off. This left the match deflated but evenly balanced at 10-a-side. Al-Sharif was guilty of embarrassing Fifa - a cardinal sin - by doing their bidding too enthusiastically. In big play-off games in north American ice hockey and basketball, referees are often reluctant to call all but the most blatant fouls. Their motto is: 'Let the players decide.' Al-Sharif and Brizio did more to shape their matches than any player. Whether Fifa succeeds in changing the way soccer is played depends very much on whether the national football associations follow their lead. They should, but it would mean a season of seven-a-side games in England while players and referees adjusted. Strangely, the teams that seem not to have adjusted have not suffered in this World Cup. The Italians have had two players sent off, yet are in the last eight. The Bulgarians have collected 16 yellow and two red cards. The Romanians: nine yellow and one red. Yet the last two could engineer the first-ever all-Balkan final. In spite of the huge number of yellow cards, only four players, by Fifa's reckoning, are suspended for the quarter-finals. Another 22, including five Italians, carry one yellow card and will be suspended if they are booked again. If the last World Cup is anything to go by, the fear of missing the next round is not as great as the fear of elimination. In Italy four years ago, players with yellow cards still committed fouls when opponents were in threatening positions. Some, like Paul Gascoigne, fouled even when opponents were not in scoring positions. The pick of the quarter-finals is Brazil's match against Holland in Dallas today. Brazil will be without Leonardo, suspended for the rest of the tournament following his assault on Tab Ramos of the US. Leonardo was Brazil's best defensive mid-field player, but, given the insipid form of that group, will not be much missed. The Dutch attack suddenly gelled against Ireland. Dennis Bergkamp and Marc Overmars found their most exhilarating form and Peter Van Vossen continued to flourish. They should, at last, give the Brazilian defence a serious examination. It seems incredible that in this World Cup of goalkeeping bloopers, Brazil's Claudio Taffarel has not yet contributed to the bloop-score. It is because he has not been tested. In defence, Ronald Koeman, the one Dutchman with a yellow card, continues to look slow, but he is the only man in the tournament who seems able consistently to shoot the new adidas Questra ball low and with power. Alongside him against Ireland, Stan Valckx gave a workshop on the types of physical contact the rules still allow, leaving Tommy Coyne battered, frustrated and flailing with his elbows. Brazil's Romario and Bebeto, even if they receive few good balls, will be a different matter. Neither of these teams has strung together a series of authoritative wins combining swaggering attack with rock-solid defence. But then the same goes for the other six. None has looked like champions, though it is not unusual for winning teams to find their form in later rounds. Italy did it midway through a second-round group game against Brazil in 1982 and went on to win the World Cup with Paolo Rossi hitting six goals in the last three games. That is why Roberto Baggio's pair against Nigeria is seen as such an omen by the normally pessimistic Italians. Today they meet Spain in Boston. Spain lack stars, but in Javier Clemente they have an astute manager. His team have looked more convincing with each match. One team that has not looked convincing are Romania, who adopted rope-a-dope tactics to beat Colombia and Argentina. Both opponents landed plenty of blows but could not find the knock-out, while Romania were uncannily accurate on the counter-punch. It is an approach that would inspire more confidence if the Romanian defence did not look so porous. The Swedes, less talented but better-drilled than either of the south American sides, are unlikely to fall for that trick. Bulgaria adopt a similar approach with a better defence. They are an unappealing lot. Even so, given vaguely sensible refereeing by Al-Sharif against Mexico they would have achieved their aim of a 1-0 win with some comfort. Nevertheless, the success of Luis Alves Zague in turning defenders in the Bulgarian penalty area will have inspired Germany's Jurgen Klinsmann and Rudi Voller. Unlike Alves, Klinsmann and Voller can shoot.</p>

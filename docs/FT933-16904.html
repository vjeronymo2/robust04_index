			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / GEC advances 4% on lower sales STRONG growth in orders for turbines and trains coupled with careful cost control helped GEC, the UK industrial group, push pre-tax profits to Pounds 863m last year, 4.1 per cent up on 1992. Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, expressed pessimism about the immediate and medium-term prospects for the UK economy. 'Nothing much is going to happen. Even when the recession ends, it will never get back to where it was. Politicians are doing their best to damage confidence in investment.' Trading conditions both in the UK and overseas, where the company had 67 per cent of sales, were poor. Turnover fell to Pounds 9.41bn from Pounds 9.43bn, while operating profits slipped to Pounds 702m, against Pounds 695m, in the year to March. Earnings per share rose nearly 6 per cent to 19.7p. An increased final dividend of 7.62p will be paid, taking the total to 10.3p, up 7.3 per cent. The company's efforts to contain costs and improve efficiency incurred Pounds 90m in redundancy and restructuring charges, Pounds 25m more than the year before. About 9,600 jobs were shed during the year, reducing staff costs by 7 per cent and leaving the head count at 138,000. The results were broadly in line with analysts' expectations. With the market judging the performance to be sound but unexciting, the share price gained 1p to close at 339p. Lord Prior, GEC chairman, said the company was investing heavily in the Far East and south east Asia, winning big contracts for power generation plant and other equipment in China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia. The UK government was showing more willingness to back its exporters through export credits in the style to which the UK's principal competitors were accustomed. 'This change is to be welcomed, although Britain's manufacturing base is now unfortunately too small to bring about a rapid reversal of our large adverse balance of payments. To do this, consistent and supportive policies are required over a period of years,' he said. The company closed the year with net cash of Pounds 1.2bn, a Pounds 415m increase. In addition, the group's share of net cash in joint ventures and main associated companies was Pounds 985m, giving total cash of Pounds 2.18bn. Interest income was Pounds 149m, up 42 per cent despite lower rates. The year-end order book stood at Pounds 12.3bn, 16 per cent higher than 1992. Lex, Page 24; Background, Page 27</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TF &amp; JH Braime declines 25% A 25 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 283,410 to Pounds 214,090, was announced by TF &amp; JH Braime (Holdings), the finished metal products, forging, pressing and stamping group, for the half year to June 30. Demand from UK customers remained at last year's depressed levels, the company said. In such circumstances the performance of Braime Pressings, the core business, had been 'satisfactory.' However, overseas demand, particularly in the US and France, fell substantially. Turnover dropped to Pounds 2.78m (Pounds 3.51m). Investment income added Pounds 75,677 (Pounds 59,165) but there were interest charges this time of Pounds 17,408 (nil). Earnings emerged at 9.65p (12.87p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.25p.</p>

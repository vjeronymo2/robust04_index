			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Traitor's Shirking of </F> Responsibility"]    [Text] According to a report, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam,  at a meeting of receiving reports on the so-called work plans  for this year on 13 January, babbled that industrial peace  should be maintained and an atmosphere for restraining wage  hikes should be made to prevail this year, thus pretending that  this would be measures to win in international competition.    This is a cunning, shameless tactic which only the traitor  turning away from the people, a filthy flunkyist nation-seller,  can mention. As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  promised the U.S. masters toward the end of last year to totally  open the South Korean rice market. At the Uruguay Round  negotiation as well, the clique agreed to all the demand for  opening markets.    The grave consequences of the nation-selling treachery which  the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique committed, including the  opening of the rice market, will come not only in rupturing the  South Korean agriculture and leading the 6 million peasants to  destruction. It will seriously affect other sectors of the  economy as well, bringing about catastrophic results.    The Daewoo Economic Institute said that with the settlement  of the Uruguay Round negotiation, the small and medium  industries, whose competitiveness is fragile, could go bankrupt,  and that unemployment will become a major social problem. The  Samsung Economic Institute also predicted that imports will  increase in such areas as foodstuff, textile, and machinery,  bringing about grave consequences. These economic institutes  had good reason to make such predictions.    The market opening will thus lead the South Korean economy  to  irreversible catastrophe, increasing unemployment and leading  the lives of workers to further destitution. Traitor Kim  Yong-sam raved about the maintenance of industrial peace and  restraining wage hike as if they were some effective measures to  win in international competition. However, it is impossible for  the South Korean economy to win international competition, for  the South Korean economy has nothing of its own worth mentioning  but consists of the vulnerable colonial subjugated economy in  which it can carry on only such a thing as bonded processing  trade with others' capital, technology, facilities, and  materials.    The puppets are raving about international competitiveness  only to shirk responsibility for the catastrophic crisis that  will result from opening markets. The Kim Yong-sam clique raved  about maintenance of industrial peace and restraining wage hikes  with a sinister purpose of forcing obedience and sacrifice upon  the workers and further stepping up suppression of the labor  movement so as to stabilize its power. The puppet traitor on  that day stressed the need to persuade the labor unions of the  major business groups, which lead the labor movement for wage  hikes. Before this, he stressed the need for the relevant  departments to actively cooperate for the settlement of  industrial peace. He also said that although the workers'  strike is not against the law, he will have the right of  emergency coordination exercised. All this proves his said  sinister purpose.    Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a rare fascist tyrant who does not  hesitate anything if it serves to fill his personal greed for  power. He is a politico, a filthy impostor who habitually  deceives and mocks the people. He disguises himself under the  mask of a civilian regime and pretend to do something for the  people, but he is a more cunning and shameless person than his  predecessor military dictators.    It is expected that the workers will wage a more vigorous  struggle in South Korea this year resisting the puppets'  flunkyist nation-selling economic policy and antipeople labor  policy. Fearing this, the puppets are attempting to prevent  their struggle by means of temptation, coercion, appeasement,  and deception. This, however, will not work. The South Korean  workers will not move off from the struggle out of fear of  suppression.    The criminal will be punished according to the crime he  committed. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which is habitually  engaged in nation-selling treachery and suppression of the  people, turning away from the country and the nation, will  certainly be subjected to the people's stern judgment.</p>

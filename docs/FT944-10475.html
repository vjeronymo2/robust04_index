			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / C&amp;W up 11% as Mercury faces shake-up: Telecoms group to cut jobs and costs - HK unit surges Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, yesterday announced a 'substantial cost and head-count reduction programme' at its UK-based Mercury Communications subsidiary while reporting an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Lord Young, chairman, declined to be drawn on the scale of the likely job cuts. However, the National Communications Union said it believed job losses at Mercury would total around 1,100 and analysts suggested that up to 2,000 of Mercury's 11,400 jobs could be at risk. Pre-tax profits increased in line with expectations to Pounds 567m in the six months to September 30 from Pounds 507m a year ago on turnover which grew by 9 per cent to Pounds 2.33bn (Pounds 2.54bn). The shares closed down 7p at 392p. The results were underpinned by the continued strong performance of Hongkong Telecom, which is 57.5 per cent owned by C&amp;W and contributed Pounds 417m (Pounds 365m) to overall operating profits of Pounds 592m. Improved group profits came in spite of a surprise Pounds 3m decline in first-half operating profits at Mercury, which fell to Pounds 96m on turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 797m. Mercury's decline came in spite of a 21 per cent increase in call volumes and a 50 per cent increase in customer lines to 2.1m. Growth in residential customer lines was particularly strong at 54 per cent. Lord Young said that although Mercury continued to gain market share it had been hit by the effects of regulatory change, which had resulted in pricing pressure and substantially higher access deficit charge payments to British Telecommunications. 'Clearly we are disappointed by Mercury's financial performance but we do not intend to rely on regulatory change alone to ameliorate the position,' he said. 'We are therefore restructuring Mercury which will enable us to introduce a substantial cost and headcount reduction programme.' Lord Young said details of the restructuring measures would be announced within the next month by Mercury's new chief executive, Mr Duncan Lewis, appointed earlier this week. In spite of the setback at Mercury, Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, insisted the group's results 'were a good performance marred only by the difficulties of Mercury'. Operating profits grew by 17 per cent in spite of the underlying cost pressures which meant that operating costs as a percentage of turnover edged up to 30.7 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 11.9 (11.1p) and an interim dividend of 2.83p (2.6p) per share was declared, a 9 per cent increase on last year. Lex, Page 24; Details, Page 26</p>

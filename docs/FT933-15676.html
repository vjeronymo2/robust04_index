			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Mackay to advertise for judges WANTED: judge to sit on northern circuit. Must be prepared to travel and accept substantial drop in earnings. Knowledge of the law an advantage. Preferred age 45-55. The Lord Chancellor is an equal opportunities employer. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, finally bowed to pressure last night in agreeing to end the secrecy in England's judicial appointments system by advertising judges' jobs and holding open competitions for specific judicial posts. Speaking to a packed house of his judicial brethren at the lord mayor's annual judges' dinner, Lord Mackay said he still believed he was the best person to make judicial appointments but, having consulted senior colleagues, he had decided changes were needed. His announcement follows complaints from Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, of a serious shortage of High Court judges which resulted in the appointment of an extra 10 in March. Lord Mackay said he would be putting machinery in place to help in forecasting the numbers of judges and the expertise required at different levels. Specific job descriptions would be drawn up detailing the work involved and the qualities required. Initially, only jobs up to circuit judge level would be advertised, but if this experiment worked, the Lord Chancellor would consider extending it to senior judicial posts. Lord Mackay said he was anxious to see if there were further measures he could take to encourage applications by female, black and Asian lawyers. He would also explore the scope for involving non-lawyers in the selection process. Lay people with experience in the justice system might be asked to sit on interview panels. Lord Williams of Mostyn QC, Labour's legal affairs spokesman in the Lords, who last year called the current judicial appointments system 'bizarre and farcical', said he was delighted Lord Mackay had finally seen the force of the argument for a more open system.</p>

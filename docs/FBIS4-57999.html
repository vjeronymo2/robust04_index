			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"; speakers identified via </F> captions]    [Text] Today, 650 Medellin Commune militiamen turned in  their weapons. A peace treaty was signed a few minutes ago with  the government following five months of negotiations.    The ceremony for the signing of the peace process that  involves 650 militiamen from three groups in this city is going  on right now at El Granizal Playground of Medellin's Nororiental  Commune. There are thousands of people at the playground. They  are the guarantors that the peace process that begins today  becomes a reality. The militiamen will turn over their weapons  as soon as the government minister and the governor of Antioquia  arrive. They will deliver 150 weapons and at the same time they  will become part of a process in which they will work for the  community.    [Begin Medellin Mayor Luis Alfredo Ramos recording] The  national government has the commitment of contributing to the  continuation of this process, to a permanent presence in the  process, and to a continuous evaluation of the process to insure  its continuation. [end recording]    The process that concludes in Medellin today is the  beginning  of a new one which involves a dialogue with five other militia  groups in Medellin.    Early this morning, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  [FARC] militants who chose not to participate in this process  protested by carrying out terrorist activities in Medellin.  Eight urban buses were set on fire in several parts of the  city, causing losses amounting to 120 million pesos. The urban  guerrillas have threatened transport owners and have paralyzed  20 percent of the transportation services to the downtown area.  The situation returned to normal around 1000.    The militiamen who did sign the agreement are optimistic.  With the agreement, they secured not only guarantees that their  lives will be respected but also committed the state to making  social investments in the communes. During the past five months  of direct conversations with the state, the 650 young Medellin  militiamen promised to turn over their weapons in exchange for  social investments. This is what they secured:    [Begin reintegrated militia man Felipe recording] The  creation of the Technological Institute, the [words indistinct],  the creation of the Carpinelo Health Center. [end recording]    In addition to this, the national government must create  more  health centers, a human rights office, and family offices, and  it must improve education centers and control the creeks in the  Nororiental Commune. During the next two years, the  reintegrated militiamen will earn 150,000 pesos monthly, will  receive loans for 3.5 million pesos for mini enterprises, will  have a two-year insurance policy, and militiamen in prison will  be pardoned. The church will employ 50 of them in church social  work.    [Begin Father Hector Fabio Henao recording] The militia's  citizen security work, which includes providing security to some  neighborhoods, has been acknowledged. They also won something  else that is very important: They can become a political  alternative and they also can be a tool for making social  well-being and investments available to the communities, if they  remain in the framework of democratic participation and if they  are able to open communications channels with the communities,  as is expected. [end recording]    But the big and new reward of the militia agreement is that  it definitely sets in motion the law that created the  Cooperatives for Community Protection. The young militiamen  will now use their weapons with the blessing of the state to  protect their neighborhoods.    The Adult Education Center of Santa Cruz Neighborhood will  be  the main headquarters of the Cooperatives for Community  Protection. From this center, 300 young persons will patrol six  zones of the Nororiental Commune. They will wear a uniform and  carry a weapon. The people will continue calling them The Boys.  Starting today, they will show their faces and everybody will  know their names.    [Begin cooperative Director Diego Restrepo recording] Our  men  are trained to handle any kind of weapon. Now that we have  become legal, we have to behave in line with different  guidelines and must have a change of attitude. We are going to  work with a different strategy. [end recording]    They have taken seven months of human relations and  community  work courses. They will take care of the streets of six  neighborhoods of the Nororiental Commune, the same streets they  used to protect when they were militiamen.    [Begin commune leader Juan Sepulveda recording] The state  has  legalized the protection of these neighborhoods by creating a  protection corps. These young people will be under the control  of the Private Protection Superintendency. We are going to know  how many young people there are, in what zones they work, what  kind of weapons they have, and what kind of identification  markings they and their vehicles have. [end recording]    They will work together with the police. They will support  each other. The community gave them a location to set up their  headquarters. Some neighbors still have their doubts.    [Begin Luiz Mila Taboada recording] Some people trust what  they see and what the militia people will do, but other people  just do not believe and are afraid. [end recording]    This will be the country's largest protection cooperative.  It will be supervised by the townspeople and The Boys trust.  From now on, they will not have to scrawl the names of their  dead on the walls of the neighborhoods.</p>

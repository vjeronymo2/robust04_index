			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ORGANIZATIONS UNDECIDED OVER NEA AWARDS  </P> <P> Pacific Chorale has been awarded an $11,500 grant from the National Endowment  for the Arts, but chorale officials were unavailable Friday to comment on  whether they would accept the grant in light of a controversial anti-obscenity  pledge required by groups receiving 1990 NEA funds.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Opera Pacific officials have postponed until Aug. 16 a decision on  whether to accept an $18,000 NEA grant.  </P> <P> The decision was to have been made at a Thursday board meeting, but other  issues took precedence on a crowded agenda, company general director David  DiChiera said Friday.  </P> <P> An NEA spokeswoman said the delay would not jeopardize the Costa Mesa-based  opera troupe's grant, since recipients have several months to decide whether to  accept the funds.  </P> <P> The embattled NEA, under fire for subsidizing a handful of allegedly obscene or  sacrilegious artworks, is requiring all 1990 grant recipients to sign a form  pledging that they will not produce artworks that could be judged obscene and  that fail to meet undefined standards of artistic excellence.  </P> <P> In protest to the requirement, several artists or arts organizations across the  country have rejected their grants or taken further action. Los Angeles  choreographer Bella Lewitzky said Thursday that she will reject a $72,000 NEA  grant and file suit against the federal arts agency over the anti-obscenity  pledge.  </P> <P> All other Orange County arts organizations notified of 1990 NEA grants have  said they will accept the funds. Officials at the Newport Harbor Art Museum,  however, have said they will protest the anti-obscenity pledge either by  striking it from grant acceptance forms or by attaching a letter to the forms  noting their non-compliance with the pledge.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government yesterday rejected the PRC decision  to conduct a new nuclear bomb test, and also the DPRK's  reluctance to allow inspection of its nuclear installations by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The PRC decision has led the Chilean Government to summon  the  PRC diplomatic representative today. Special Policy Director  Pablo Cabrera will express to him the government's concern.    Concerning the North Korean position, it was reported that  Chile cosponsored the IAEA resolution that imposes drastic  sanctions, including the withdrawal of assistance to programs  for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, except for aspects  related to medicine.    The IAEA was assisting North Korea with $240 million for  such  programs.    The Chilean Government reaction to these two situations is  in  line with its traditional position and with instructions from  President Eduardo Frei on the matter.    A clear step was taken in this regard on 18 January of this  year when Chile, a signatory of the treaty proscribing nuclear  weapons in Latin America, became an active member of the  Tlatelolco Treaty, in order to begin immediate negotiations with  the IAEA seeking agreement on safeguards through which all its  activities in the nuclear field would be subjected to control by  the IAEA.    The government has been following attentively what has been  happening in North Korea. In addition to the North Korean  position, which is repudiated by Chile, is the fact that this is  a Pacific Rim country with which excellent political and  economic relations have been maintained.    Due to international pressure the DPRK Government had  recently announced its immediate withdrawal from the IAEA, thus  making even more remote any international control of its nuclear  activities.    The North Korean reluctance to allow international  inspections has been one of the factors, not to say the main  one, preventing a stronger bilateral relationship.    The tension generated by the sanctions imposed by the IAEA,  and the statements made by the United States, Japan, and South  Korea, have prompted fear that the confrontation could become  aggravated or even lead to war.    It is a dangerous situation, but "the real interpretation"  made by the Chilean Foreign Ministry is that it is not as  dramatic, as it considers the tough North Korean position to be  a subterfuge aimed at obtaining a greater advantage in  negotiations.    Special Policy Director Pablo Cabrera will convey today to  the PRC diplomatic representative the Chilean Government's  concern over the PRC decision to test a new nuclear weapon in  the Lop Nor testing ground, in the western province of Xinjiang.    In a public statement lamenting the PRC decision, the  government states that this explosion can be added to another  explosion conducted by the same country last year.    "The Chilean Government hopes, once again, that these  nuclear  tests will end definitively, seeking to achieve the total  proscription of nuclear weapons for the benefit of international  peace and security, a hope much desired by mankind now that we  are on the doorstep of the third millennium," the note ends.</p>

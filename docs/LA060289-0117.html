			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RILEY WANTS A PISTON REMATCH RATHER THAN 'EASY WAY OUT'  </P> <P> The Lakers' opponent for the National Basketball Assn. championship series has  yet to be determined, but the Lakers are practicing at Westmont College as if a  rematch with the Detroit Pistons is inevitable.  </P> <P> Coach Pat Riley, in fact, said Thursday that he will be disappointed if the  Pistons do not beat the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals because  he wants the Lakers to prove that last season's seven-game series victory was  no fluke.  </P> <P> "We've got five days to develop a mind-set," Riley said. "(The Pistons) are so  committed to the revenge thing. Their mission is to beat us. They are  challenging us more than anyone's ever challenged us. We've got to want them  more than they want you.  </P> <P> "If we go in there and say we just want to 'three-peat' and win one for Cap  (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), then you don't have the right competitive attitude.  You've got to stimulate (the players') minds more, bring back all the little  things that were said last year, bring back some videotapes. You got to bring  it all back, otherwise they forget. Then, after the first or second game,  they'll realize what it was like."  </P> <P> The Lakers would have the home-court advantage against the Bulls, but Riley  wants a higher degree of difficulty. "It would be the easy way out to play  Chicago, because we'd have the home court," he said. "This is the pursuit of  pleasure versus the avoidance of pain. People have a tendency to avoid (the  difficult) and move to what's easier. We want to move toward that which is  difficult because we have a point to prove."  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Arts: The Lowbury Piano Trio - Concert This was the first time I have visited the Wigmore Hall since it has been so delightfully renovated and expanded and I was gratified to note the acoustical advantage that the hall still wonderfully lends to chamber musicians. The Haydn E major trio (H. 28) with which the Lowburys opened their programme came across with a clarity that was forceful without being harmfully analytical. This bold and concise three-movement late work of Haydn's went off bustlingly well. The classical preamble was apt for the new (to London) trio for the same instruments (piano, violin and cello) by Robert Simpson which followed. Completed in 1989, this ambitious and lengthy (36 minutes), work in four continuous movements is absolutely characteristic of its composer in its determined attempt to re-inhabit classical form and re-invent classical rhetoric. Nobody alive today pursues such aims with such gusto; and one could not but be struck by the note-working skill and unmisgiving neo-classical assurance with which Simpson marshalls his motifs, weaves his sinewy counterpoints, and pushes through his formal stereotype to the bitter end. The textures are predominantly spare, and the opening leggerio exchanges suggested a genially conversational tone or perhaps a musical version of thinking out loud. Gradually, though, one began to suspect that the composer was really striving after a Shostakovich-like searing bleakness of utterance but adherence to classical propriety held him back. Though the Vivace second movement had appealing bursts of chordal punchiness from the pianist (Elizabeth Burley), and the Adagio semplice some searchingly fraught descants for the first violin (Pauline Lowbury), the Allegro finale was decidedly diffuse, and the overall impression was colourless. Simpson's harmonic idiom is that of a no-man's land between tonality and atonality; and in his devotion to classical form he has quite missed out on content. Ravel's great A minor trio, with an account of which (alas, all too barnstorming) the concert ended, was a reminder of the primacy of content. If the Simpson work seemed to have drained music to a hospital pallor, here all the art-form's colour and life-blood came surging back.</p>

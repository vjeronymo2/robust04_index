			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT  </P> <P> Second City Looks for New West Coast Home: The comedy improvisational troupe  Second City will give its last Santa Monica performance at the renovated  Mayfair Theatre on Sunday and has begun looking for a new local home. Andrew  Alexander, Second City president and executive producer, blamed the closing on  declining attendance, an earthquake-proposal requirement and alleged  deteriorating conditions in the area.  </P> <P> "The ongoing problems of the homeless and crime in the beach area have served  to create a depressed atmosphere, which in turn keeps the night business away,"  said Alexander. Responding to the comment, Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane said,  "I'm very surprised to hear that assessment. . . ." He said the Third Street  Promenade area was revitalized with the success of several new movie theaters  and restaurants. "The Improv is doing well," he added. "The scene on the street  weekends is lively, with many people around." Alexander said that the closing  does not mean an end to the performance wing of Second City. He's scouting  locations in Hollywood and West Los Angeles. Meanwhile, after Sunday the  Mayfair will be dark. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

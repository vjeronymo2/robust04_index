			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 302 of MCCA added section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) to the Social Security Act, which required States to provide mandatory eligibility to groups of pregnant women and infants up to one year of age with incomes at or below 75 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines, effective July 1, 1989. Those States that, as of enactment of MCCA, offered eligibility to pregnant women and infants with incomes at 100 percent of the poverty level (or at some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower income threshold between 75 percent and 100 percent) were required to continue eligibility at this level. A State had to provide an income level that reflected at least the percentage of poverty specified in an amendment to its State plan to cover these groups (whether the amendment had been approved or not). Even if there was no percentage specified in the State plan, the maintenance of eligibility requirement also applied to percentages established under a State's authorizing legislation or provided for under the State's appropriations in order to provide Medicaid to these individuals before July 1, 1989. MCCA also provided that, effective July 1, 1990, mandatory eligibility was required for groups of pregnant women and infants under age one with incomes at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines. In addition to creating mandatory groups of pregnant women and infants, the MCCA eliminated the requirement in section 1902(1)(4) that States cover both pregnant women and infants in order to cover either group and to cover both groups in order to cover children. We have interpreted this MCCA amendment to allow States to cover optional groups of pregnant women and infants separately and with different income levels. Coverage of groups of pregnant women or infants, or both, with incomes above the mandatory percentages (75 percent, effective July 1, 1989, and 100 percent, effective July 1, 1990) but at or below 185 percent of the poverty level and children age 1 year to age 8 years with incomes at or below 100 percent of the poverty level remained optional under the MCCA provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MCCA also amended section 1902(e)(7) to provide continued coverage to all of the revised groups of children under section 1902(1) until the end of their inpatient stays. It also amended section 1903(f)(4) to exempt from the FFP income limits all of the redefined mandatory and optional groups in section 1902(1) and specifically made the use of less restrictive income and resource methodologies under section 1902(r)(2) apply to several groups, including the mandatory groups of women and infants in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), and to all optional categorically needy groups, including the optional group of women, infants, and children in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes made by section 302 of MCCA applied to payments for medical assistance for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 1989, with respect to eligibility on or after that date. The effective date applied whether or not we had promulgated final rules to interpret the provisions by that date. However, a State could, under certain circumstances, request a delayed implementation date in order to enact State legislation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6401 of OBRA '89 revised the provisions under MCCA by further amending the eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women, infants, and children up to age 8. First, section 6401 changed the income criteria for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory eligibility groups of low-income pregnant women and infants up to age 1 under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) of the Act by increasing the income level criteria from no less than 100 percent of the Federal poverty income level to no less than 133 percent of the Federal poverty income level, effective April 1, 1990. The law mandates that a State use a percentage greater than 133 percent (but no greater than 185 percent) of the Federal poverty income level if the State had such a higher percentage for optional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorically needy groups of pregnant women and infants as of the date of enactment of OBRA '89 in its State plan (whether approved or not) or established by State authorizing legislation or State appropriations. Second, OBRA '89 established under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) of the Act a new mandatory eligibility group of low-income children age 1 up to age 6. The State was required to establish an income level for this group that equaled 133 percent of the Federal poverty income level. States could continue to cover as optional categorically needy other low-income children age 6 up to age 7 or, at State option, up to age 8 who are born after September 30, 1983. The income level for this group of children age 6 up to age 8 would continue to be established at a level not to exceed 100 percent of the Federal poverty income level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

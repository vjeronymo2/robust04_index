			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Economic overheating approaches the danger level Taiwan may be experiencing too much of a good thing as its economy gains speed, the country's planning ministry warned yesterday. The economy showed signs of overheating in October for the second consecutive month, the cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development said. The council's coloured signal system for measuring economic health flashed a 'yellow-red light', indicating fast growth but danger that the economy may be overheating. Until September, a yellow-red signal had not been used since August 1989. A green light, meaning steady growth, was posted for nine consecutive months before September. An October business confidence survey showed 65 per cent of manufacturers taking part believed the economic climate would remain stable for the next three months, unchanged from a month earlier. Businessmen who felt the economy would improve in the next three months fell from 23 to 21 per cent; those expecting it to worsen climbed from 12 to 14 per cent. Last week the government's central statistics office said growth in gross national product reached 6.08 per cent in the third quarter of this year, up from 5.62 per cent in the second quarter. The forecast for the fourth quarter was raised to 6.9 per cent from 6.44 per cent, based on improved export performance and strong domestic investment. The statistics office forecast GNP growth would reach 6.1 per cent in 1994 and 6.52 per cent in 1995. In 1993 Taiwan's GNP rose 6.02 per cent. Taiwan's negotiators blamed counterparts from their arch-rival China yesterday for failure of six days of bilateral talks in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, Reuter adds. Returning to Taipei's international airport, Mr Shi Hwei-you, Taiwan's chief negotiator, said the Chinese side had raised new questions that prevented final agreements being signed. 'Both sides in principle agreed on the structure and resolutions for an agreement,' said Mr Shi, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). 'But (China's) Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) raised many new questions and that led to the failure of signing a final agreement,' the semi-official Central News Agency quoted Mr Shi as saying.</p>

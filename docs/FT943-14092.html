			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / US bonds limit rise for dollar The dollar continued its cautious recovery on the London foreign exchange market yesterday, although it eased slightly against the yen in New York last night under pressure from weaker US bond prices. Earlier in the week, the US currency had fallen to fresh lows against both the yen and the D-Mark after last weekend's decision by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations not to announce any programme of dollar support. The improved inflationary outlook in the US, which supported the bond market on Thursday and early yesterday, spread to the UK, where the Bank of England announced a long-dated conventional gilt auction after a period of shorter term, non-conventional funding. Share prices in the UK were also firmer, with the FT-SE 100 index closing 24.4 points higher at 3,074.8, bringing the total gain for the week to 112.4 points. After closing in London nearly a pfennig firmer in London against the D-Mark at DM1.5558, the dollar held its ground in New York trading, where it stood at DM1.5531 last night. Against the yen, however, the dollar fell in London to Y97.9050, and eased further to Y97.75 later in New York after a modest retreat in bond prices. Analysts were sceptical yesterday, though, about whether the US currency was experiencing anything more than a temporary correction. Investor sentiment towards the currency remains bearish.

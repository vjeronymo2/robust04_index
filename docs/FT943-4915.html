			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK factory output at highest level for four years The increasingly healthy nature of the UK economic recovery was highlighted yesterday with official figures showing that monthly manufacturing output rose to its highest level for about four years in July. With much of this growth coming from factories producing raw materials for industry and capital investment goods, the data provided further indications that the recovery is shifting further from consumer spending towards a more investment driven upturn. Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, will hold their monthly monetary meeting today and are expected to discuss whether base rates should rise to curb inflationary pressures generated by this growth. But in spite of City assumptions that interest rates will rise this year, the recent benign economic data have left analysts doubtful that rates will change today. The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing output rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in July, compared with June, and now stands only 2 per cent below its last peak in March 1990. Measured on a three monthly basis, output rose 1.3 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months. This yesterday led the CSO to revise its trend estimate for the annual manufacturing growth rate to 5 per cent, up from the 4.5 per cent growth previously estimated. The level of overall industrial production, which also includes the utilities and energy sectors, remained unchanged in July compared with June. This was because manufacturing growth was offset by a fall in North Sea production, the CSO said. The Treasury yesterday welcomed the data as evidence of the 'continued recovery in manufacturing', and noted that whereas the consumer sector had previously provided much of the economic growth, the investment and raw materials sectors were now outpacing the consumer industries. The output of capital investment goods, such as computers and industrial plant, grew 0.7 per cent in the three months to July, compared with the previous three months, with a strong performance from the electronics sectors. The output of the intermediate goods sector, which provides the fuel and materials for industry, grew 2.7 per cent in this period. Consumers industries' output, however, grew by only 0.4 per cent, with falls recorded in the cars and clothing sectors. This relatively weaker performance of the consumer sector was yesterday echoed by figures showing that new UK car registrations in August, the most important new car sales month of the year, rose by only 2.8 per cent year-on-year to 452,566. The total was well below earlier motor industry forecasts for registrations of 475,000 to 500,000. By contrast, registrations of new commercial vehicles rose last month by 19.9 per cent year-on-year.

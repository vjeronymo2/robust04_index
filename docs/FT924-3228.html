			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour worries on Smith emerge RUMBLINGS of impatience with Mr John Smith's softly-softly leadership style were emerging openly yesterday with some backbench and extra-parliamentary critics urging a higher profile for the Labour leader. While loyalists remain insistent that Mr Smith has plenty of time before the next election to put his stamp on the party, there has been criticism behind the scenes for some time that Labour has not yet seized the agenda from a widely discredited government. Mr Bryan Gould, the MP for Dagenham who was defeated in July's leadership election, yesterday openly addressed the question in a BBC radio interview. While praising Mr Smith's abilities as a debater and a 'reassuring figure', he added: 'It is pointless to pretend that there is not some degree of unease in the party about what is seen as a lack of direction, perhaps even a lack of vision.' His remarks were echoed by Mr Peter Hain, the Tribunite MP for Neath, who appeared to single out Mr Gordon Brown for criticism without directly mentioning the shadow chancellor by name. 'We are fine in attacking the shortcomings and shambles of Norman Lamont's policies and the prime minister's economic programme, but we are not offering a clear and distinct alternative,' he said. Both the Labour Co-ordinating Committee - the constituency activists' grouping - and the Fabian Society are preparing strategy papers intended to fill what they see as a policy vacuum. Supporters of the leadership say Mr Smith has had little inclination or opportunity to grab the headlines because of the stream of damaging newspaper articles about the government. They say policy documents on Labour's union links and electoral reform are due in January. The promised independent Commission on Social Justice, covering tax and benefits, will be announced shortly. Mr Smith is expected to make an important speech soon on constitutional reform.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVES ON CIVIL RIGHTS;  </P> <P> 'SELF-HELP' JUST WON'T DO IT ALL;  </P> <P> AS LONG AS THE EFFECTS OF WHITE OPPRESSION EXIST AND AS LONG AS RACISM LINGERS,  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WILL BE NECESSARY.  </P> <P> Weary of colonial rule, the angry activists stood on the banks of Boston Harbor  on a cold December evening, lugged about 340 crates to the river's edge and  pitched more than $10,000 worth of tea into the brisk, bustling waters.  </P> <P> The action of American patriots at the Boston Tea Party -- which helped launch  the American Revolution -- was, incredibly, a pitch for affirmative action.  </P> <P> America's 18th-Century revolutionaries were affirming their right to  self-determination and equal opportunity. Surely, we have not forgotten their  rallying call, "No taxation without representation." Or Patrick Henry's  impassioned, noble cry, "Give me liberty or give me death."  </P> <P> This is why we bristle at the current "controversy" over the value and benefits  of modern-day affirmative action.  </P> <P> Affirmative-action critics suggest that such policies have not benefited poor  blacks, have impeded the development of coalitions for social programs and have  inhibited black Americans through a deep sense of inferiority.  </P> <P> These notions would be comical if they weren't so dangerous.  </P> <P> The irony is that these well-trained -- if misguided -- academicians have the  opportunity to espouse such nonsense is itself due to affirmative action.  </P> <P> Would they have been trained at some of the nation's leading colleges without  it? Would they be professors at predominantly white universities? Would they  not feel the racist sting of Jim Crow's piercing whip? Would they be published  in some of America's most influential periodicals?  </P> <P> They fail to realize that affirmative action is simply any action taken to  ensure, or affirm, equal opportunity for oppressed or previously disadvantaged  groups.  </P> <P> What's wrong with that? If a society discriminates against a people for  centuries -- enslaves them, lynches them, oppresses them, denies them access to  jobs, homes, a good education, the political process, etc. -- the just way to  offer remedy is to give that people an equal opportunity.  </P> <P> The affirmative-action debate often gets mired in the issue of numerical goals  and timetables, which are often disparagingly called quotas by critics and  opponents.  </P> <P> The NAACP has never promoted the concept of so-called quotas. In fact, goals  and timetables would never have been necessary if corporate and municipal  leaders had been willing to follow the letter and spirit of the law.  </P> <P> Goals and timetables came about because of the failure of parties to be sincere  in their efforts to provide equal opportunity. They were built in by judges who  tired of the stances of interposition and nullification. The "we can't find  any" argument was most often an attempt by corporate and municipal leaders to  skirt the law. So judges had to construct goals and timetables to keep parties  from making a mockery of the federal court. Critics who negate or ignore white  America's duty to help solve black America's problems misrepresent the issue,  mislead the public and subvert the struggle.  </P> <P> While we recognize that heightened "self-help" efforts among blacks will lessen  our plight -- and we at the NAACP promote such efforts -- we believe what the  Kerner Commission said more than 20 years ago still rings true:  </P> <P> "What white Americans have never fully understood -- but what the Negro can  never forget -- is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White  institutions created it, white institutions maintain it and white society  condones it."  </P> <P> In their near-exclusive focus on what blacks should do, critics largely  overlook the responsibility of government, big business and the courts in what  is purported to be a fair and democratic society.  </P> <P> When blacks have done all they can to save themselves, white society must still  do the right thing. If racism, discrimination and unequal opportunity pervade,  lone efforts by blacks will remain virtually ineffective.  </P> <P> Certainly, critics who suggest that black Americans need to develop their  individual skills and must not eternally regard themselves as victims are not  totally wrong. Neither are they wrong when they urge young blacks to study, be  disciplined and conscientious, and to reject the notion that achievement  somehow diminishes blackness.  </P> <P> But they are totally wrong when they suggest, implicitly or otherwise, that  acknowledged black leaders are not pushing these concepts as well. We are. So,  at best, these critics are doing no more than parroting our views.  </P> <P> I make hundreds of speeches a year in which I preach the gospel of hard work,  discipline and achievement. Other leaders do the same. To suggest otherwise is  a gross distortion and disservice.  </P> <P> While self-responsibility and self-determination must play heightened roles in  our communities, we believe government cannot shirk its role.  </P> <P> I hasten to add that I am curious as to how this issue evolved as a controversy  in the first place. Goals and timetables are as American as apple pie.  </P> <P> You must pay your taxes by April 15. You must not drive more than the posted  speed limit. You must register to vote or apply for a passport by certain  dates. Car manufacturers must ensure their cars meet certain emissions  standards by certain times.  </P> <P> America operates by goals and timetables -- and we all acknowledge and accept  that. It is only when it comes to human resources that we bristle at this  concept.  </P> <P> Naturally, we at the NAACP promote the concept of self-help. And the fact is  that blacks have committed to self-help since the slave ships first docked on  America's shores.  </P> <P> In 1990 America, we see the benefits of that self-help concept and affirmative  action efforts. We have black mayors, elected officials, police officers,  firefighters, journalists, judges, doctors, lawyers, captains of industry and  thousands of other professionals.  </P> <P> More importantly, we have office clerks, secretaries, laborers, court employees  and literally millions of everyday working people whose jobs are indirectly and  directly linked to affirmative action and self-help.  </P> <P> These would have been the people mired inextricably in poverty and despair were  it not for coalition-building and affirmative action.  </P> <P> The critics who benefited from but oppose affirmative action obscure the legacy  of exclusion and discrimination that prompted such remedial efforts. They  should be ashamed.  </P> <P> As the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights once noted, just as medical treatment is  based on the diagnosis of an illness, affirmative action stems from diagnosis  of a social sickness.  </P> <P> The remedy cannot be divorced from the illness. Critics write much about some  "corrosive effect" of affirmative action but very little about the racism,  oppression and discrimination that necessitates it -- and which is much more  corrosive and destructive.  </P> <P> We shall at the NAACP always promote self-help, but will never waver in our  push to insist that government play its role and do its part. For how long? For  as long as necessary.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ONE TERM IS ENOUGH  </P> <P> The excellent letter to the editor from Harry Godley, published Aug. 14,  expresses the increasing frustrations the public feels with our government. The  situations that Godley cites are symptomatic of the crying need to limit  government officials to a single short term in office, without the possibility  of subsequent reelection or reappointment.  </P> <P> In addition, lobbying activities by paid lobbyists should be a criminal  offense, with the same type of penalties that are now applicable to the crime  of jury tampering. Removing the pressures of peddled influences and of  reelection or reappointment would permit our government officials to  concentrate on representing and serving the public. With these simple reforms,  the costs of all levels of government would be dramatically reduced.  </P> <P> WILFRED C. MILLER  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: USE BAKED FILLINGS WITH STUFFED VEGETABLES  </P> <P> A microwave oven cooks stuffed vegetables, such as peppers, in about half the  time it takes to bake them in a standard oven.  </P> <P> But because vegetables cook so quickly by microwave, use cooked fillings that  need nothing more than a quick reheating. Otherwise, the vegetables will be  reduced to mush.  </P> <P> To brown the top of the stuffing, place the stuffed vegetables under a broiler  after microwaving. Use a ceramic casserole that can withstand intense broiler  heat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEEF- AND BULGUR-STUFFED RED OR GREEN PEPPERS  </P> <P> 4 large sweet red or green peppers  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, minced  </P> <P> 1 large clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 3/4 pound lean ground beef  </P> <P> 1/2 cup uncooked bulgur or cracked wheat  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups tomato or spaghetti sauce  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon water  </P> <P> Slice stem ends off peppers. Remove cores and seeds, then set peppers aside.  </P> <P> Mix oil, onion, garlic and beef in microwave-safe 2-quart casserole large  enough to hold peppers upright with 1/2 inch between. Push meat mixture into  doughnut shape around edge of casserole.  </P> <P> Cover with wax paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 7 to 8 minutes,  stirring at half time to break up beef and cook until no longer pink.  </P> <P> Mix in bulgur, 1 cup tomato sauce, Worcestershire, salt and red pepper flakes.  Cover with vented plastic wrap and microwave on HIGH 5 minutes. Stir, cover and  microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 4 1/2 to 5 minutes until bulgur is tender-firm.  Let stand, covered, 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Fill peppers with meat mixture and arrange 1/2 inch apart in same casserole.  Add water and cover casserole with lid or vented plastic food wrap. Microwave  on HIGH 7 to 8 minutes until peppers are barely tender, rotating casserole 180  degrees at half time. Let stand, covered, 3 minutes (peppers will continue to  cook).  </P> <P> Lift peppers to heated serving plates. Discard casserole liquid and pour in  remaining 1/2 cup tomato sauce. Cover and microwave on HIGH 2 minutes until  uniformly hot. Spoon some sauce over each pepper before serving. Makes 4  servings.  </P> <P> Variation:  </P> <P> For Beef- and Rice-Stuffed Peppers, prepare as directed, substituting 1/2 cup  uncooked converted rice for bulgur.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RICE- AND CHEDDAR-STUFFED TOMATOES  </P> <P> 4 medium (2 1/2 to 3 inches in diameter) firm-ripe tomatoes  </P> <P> 1 small onion, minced  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 cup cooked rice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup coarsely shredded sharp Cheddar cheese  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons minced canned green chiles  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> Slice 1/4 inch off stem ends of tomatoes and discard. Scoop seeds and pulp into  bowl. Drain tomatoes upside-down on several thicknesses of paper towels.  Discard tomato seeds. Drain tomato pulp and coarsely chop. Set aside.  </P> <P> Microwave onion and butter in wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe 1-quart  casserole on HIGH (100% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes until glassy. Mix in tomato  pulp, rice, cheese, chiles, 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste and pepper. Stuff  tomatoes with rice mixture, dividing evenly. Arrange 1 inch apart in 9-inch  microwave-safe pie plate, leaving empty space in center.  </P> <P> Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM-HIGH (70% power) 7 to 9 minutes, rotating pie  plate 180 degrees at half time, and cook until tomatoes are just tender. Check  for doneness after 7 minutes (don't pierce or tomatoes will lose juice and  shape). Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

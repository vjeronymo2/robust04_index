			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Arts: Maria Stuarda - Opera It is surprising that nobody north of the border has thought of bringing together a mini festival of the best-known Scottish operas. Not operas by Scottish composers of course, as there are not enough; but those early 19th-century Italian operas set in Scotland, which were so popular at a time when anything wrapped in tartan was fashionable. The leading contender has to be Donizetti's Maria Stuarda, however diluted its Scottish blood may be. Schiller wrote the play, traducing historical facts as he went, and there is no local colour in either the music or the drama. At times, one could be dealing with the stock characters that people most of Donizetti's historical operas, except that between them composer and dramatist did create a genuinely noble and suffering personality for their heroine, Mary Stuart. It is a shame that Scottish Opera should have given her one of its least convincing productions of recent seasons. Donizetti follows Schiller by making a fictitious confrontation between Mary and Elizabeth I the high point of his opera and Stefanos Lazaridis's production never lets us forget it: a revolving platform centre-stage is divided with Mary's door on one side and Elizabeth's on the other, each popping out as the occasion demands, like figures in a weather clock. When Elizabeth swings into view, we know stormy weather is on the way. The soprano Michie Nakamaru lets fly at the role wildly and gives more than her voice - not a large or lustrous instrument - might reasonably be expected to deliver. In contrast, the appearance of Mary forecasts placidity. Yvonne Kenny in the title-role gets all the best music and treats it with due care, shaping lines thoughtfully, shading the voice sensitively (except at the top, where the tone becomes harsh). History's Mary Stuart was haunted by many ghosts from the past, but anybody singing the role in Britain today need fear only one: Janet Baker, whose performances in the 1970s are stamped on the memory of all who saw them. Kenny is not in that league. Her Mary Stuart was sometimes touching, sometimes beautiful, but never memorable. There is a reasonable supporting cast. Peter Bronder was best when Leicester was at his most forceful. Stafford Dean was a Cecil who delivered Mary's sentence of death with suitably funereal tone; David Ellis made an adequate Talbot. Richard Armstrong performed a more complete text of the opera than usual and conducted it all with invigorating fervour. Some imaginative decorations would have been welcome in the second verses, but this was not primarily an evening for fans of trills and scales. Lazaridis's intention (as producer and designer) was to give the audience something to think about, a course which can backfire with Donizetti. Too many arty ideas - like 'shadow queens' running about playing Mary and Elizabeth in their youth - can sink a bel canto opera under the weight of their own cleverness. Better just to play the opera as it stands. Never mind about history. Donizetti rarely did. Sponsored by the Peter Moores Foundation. At the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, until November 8, then on tour to Newcastle and Edinburgh</p>

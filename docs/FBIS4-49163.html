			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST political desk] </F>   [Text] China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs  yesterday hosted a meeting in Stanley of a Beijing-appointed  local executive while still having had no official contact with  the British administration since his arrival.    After a brief appearance at the Bank of China reception to  celebrate the issue of new Hong Kong banknotes at 8 am, Lu Ping  returned to the villa at No 6 Stanley Beach Road owned by XINHUA  (the New China News Agency).    In a basement-level room with heavy red curtains, Mr Lu  chaired the meeting of the political sub-group of the  Preliminary Working Committee, the organization charged with  speeding up preparations for Beijing's takeover of Hong Kong.    While Governor Chris Patten has ridiculed the committee as  inconsequential, people within and outside the British  administration have voiced their concern that it would appear to  be China's power base in the territory.    Mr Lu, the Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office and secretary-general of the committee,  only smiled when asked whether it would be a violation of the  Memorandum of Understanding with Britain if he continued to  dodge Mr Patten.    The memorandum, which dealt with the airport project,  stipulated that there should be regular contact between the two  sides.    One opportunity would have been at the Bank of China  function, but bank director Wang Qiren said Mr Patten had not  been invited because the organizers thought he was too busy.    "Mr Patten has such an important job to do as the Governor,  we would not bother him with an invitation to the ceremony,"  said Mr Wang, former deputy of Mr Lu.    Mr Lu's meetings on political matters relating to the  handover ended at 5.30 pm, and the whole group dashed off to  Central to join their colleagues from the economic sub-group at  a dinner hosted by the Bank of China.    Mr Patten was again missing from the guests, but two members  of his Executive Council, Raymond Chien Kuo-fung and Tung  Chee-hwa, were there.</p>

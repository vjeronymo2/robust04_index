			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / WMI raises Pounds 438m from global shareoffering WASTE Management Inter-national yesterday raised Pounds 438m from the international offer and placing of 20 per cent of its shares, valuing the group at just over Pounds 2.2bn. After expenses and underwriting commissions, Pounds 33m, or 7.5 per cent of the total raised, net proceeds came to Pounds 405m. Shares in the UK were placed at the slightly lower than expected price of 585p, against an indicated range of 530-645p. The shares rose 20p in trading to close at 605p. Merrill Lynch, global co-ordinator, said the success of the multi-tranche deal, the first of its kind in this country, would act as a benchmark for further international equity offerings, such as Guinness Peat Aviation, which is to be floated in June. The pricing was described by Merrill Lynch as having been led by institutions in the US, where Waste Management Incorporated, the parent company, is based. The offering of Waste Management International's shares involves a placing of 26.2m shares in the UK market; an offer for sale of 30m shares in the US, packaged as 15m American depository shares; and an offer of 18.7m shares in other markets. In New York, the shares were priced at Dollars 20.4, implying a price of Dollars 10.2 for each share in the international offering. An adviser for the group said it was pleased with the response in spite of some criticism that the shares had been priced too high. The shares are now trading on a multiple of 32 times the pro-forma 1991 earnings per share.</p>

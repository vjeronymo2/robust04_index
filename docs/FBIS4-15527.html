			<p>BFN     [Text] Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev has  completed his visit to Japan. The main purpose of the visit was  to obtain prearranged credits and to sell his country's  resources to business circles. In his opinion, this has been  achieved. As he told ITAR-TASS on his arrival on 6 April,  Alma-Ata [Almaty] did not set any other tasks. Calling for  cooperation in the future, Nursultan Nazarbayev, well known for  his passion for hunting, realized that a bird in the hand is  worth two in the bush. That is why the securing of Japanese  promises on credits for $220 million in aid of reforms and 12.88  trillion yen for the development of the infrastructure were  described as the main successes of the visit.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UN protest over Iraqi weapons The United Nations Security Council is protesting to Iraq for stalling on destruction of equipment to produce Scud missiles, Reuter reports. Council president Thomas Pickering of the US said he would convey 'deep concern' to Iraqi diplomats. Earlier, a UN team reported that Iraq continued to withhold information about its weapons of mass destruction and nuclear capability. Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the commission charged with dismantling Iraqi armaments, said undeclared ballistic missile materials were found at two sites even as discussions were taking place with Iraqi officials in Baghdad last weekend.</p>

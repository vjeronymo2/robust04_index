			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Hang Seng soars 28% HANG SENG BANK, the 61 per cent subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, yesterday reported a 28.5 per cent rise in 1991 net profits to HKDollars 2.8bn (USDollars 363.6m) from HKDollars 1.18bn in 1990. Sir Q. W. Lee, chairman, said he was 'conservatively optimistic' about the prospects for 1992. He said 1991 had been a very good year for banks in Hong Kong. Two weeks ago, the Bank of East Asia reported a 30 per cent growth in 1991 earnings. In common with all banks in the colony, Hang Seng's was struck after an unknown transfer to 'inner reserves'. Variations in the amount transferred - or, indeed, drawn down if the year is poor - allow the colony's banks great latitude in the profits they declare. However, analysts said that Hang Seng's results boded well for Hongkong Bank. Already, Hongkong Bank has published results for it US subsidiary which show a halving in losses and now Hang Seng has reported a near 30 per cent growth in earnings. Mr John Mulchay, head of research at Peregrine, a local brokerage, said he expected the Hongkong Bank to report earnings of about HKDollars 4.6bn - up nearly 50 per cent on 1990's HKDollars 3bn, but still less than the bank's record of HKDollars 4.7bn in 1989. He pointed out that banks in Hong Kong had their margins on mortgage lending boosted by 10 per cent last June after the government decided not to lower home lending rates when it cut deposit rates at that time. This margin still exists today. 'Underlying growth in bank profits last year has been significant,' he said. 'They are suffering an embarrassment of riches, and I suspect their transfers to inner reserves have been substantial.' Hang Seng, whose earnings rise was in line with market expectations, surprised with a one-for-four bonus issue. It declared a 75 cents final dividend, making HKDollars 1.25 for the year - up 25 per cent on 1990's pay out.</p>

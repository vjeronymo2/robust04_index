			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Over Half Dissatisfied With </F> the Government"]    [Text] Although the government led by Prime Minister Esko  Aho (Center Party) has increased its popular support, a majority  53 percent of Finns are still dissatisfied with it.    According to an opinion poll conducted by Gallup of Finland  for the [Oulu] newspaper KALEVA, less than one-fifth of  citizens, or 18 percent, are satisfied with the government, and  of these, only 2 percent said they were extremely well  satisfied.    All told, the proportion of those satisfied with the  government has risen by 4 percentage points since the December  survey.    One-fourth, or 26 percent, of those interviewed said they  were extremely dissatisfied. Another full one-fourth refused to  state an opinion as to whether they were satisfied or  dissatisfied.    The satisfaction of farmers with the government has risen by  one-fifth since the previous poll. Of this occupational group,  nearly half -- or 46 percent -- give the government a good  grade.    Aho's own personal performance was also rated as  satisfactory  by around one-fifth of citizens. The prime minister's approval  rating has risen by 4 points since December.</p>

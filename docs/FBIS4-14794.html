			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian-mediated Georgian-Abkhazian  consultations, underway in Moscow, have produced a joint  political declaration and a draft agreement on the repatriation  of refugees. If nothing happens to interfere, both documents  are to be signed next Monday. President Yeltsin's emissary for  Abkhazia, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, made this  statement in an exclusive interview with Interfax Friday.    The Georgian delegation is led by a special representative  of  the Georgian head of state, the Chairman of the Committee on  Ethnic Minorities Issues and Human Rights Aleksandr Kavsadze,  and the Abkhazian - by a special representative of the chairman  of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet Andrey Djerghenia.    Pastukhov also said that on Sunday the UN  Secretary-General's  emissary for Abkhazia Eduard Brunner would be expected to arrive  in Moscow to play a role in the negotiating process.    The consultations were very complicated because, said  Pastukhov, the delegations made phone calls to their leaders to  coordinate positions almost every other minute. But they had  made substantial progress and the repatriation agreement would  hopefully be signed as early as next Monday.    In addition to Georgia and Abkhazia, Russia and an emissary  of the UN High Commissioner on Refugees are to sign the  agreement. Russia gave has seen the inflow of many refugees from  Abkhazia.</p>

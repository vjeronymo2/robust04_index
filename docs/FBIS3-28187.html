Early in February 1934 during the anti-Japanese armed  struggle, President Kim Il-song went to then Mipo-Myon, Onsong  County, North Hamgyong Province, and called and guided the  conference of party and revolutionary organisations in the  homeland.    Yi Kun-mo, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong provincial  committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the  North Hamgyong provincial people's committee, made a report.    The reporter said:    At the conference, the great leader set forth the task to  forcefully conduct the work of building party organisations in  close combination with the armed struggle and the mass struggle.    He also put forward the task to set up regional guidance  organs such as district party committees in the regions where  many basic party organisations had been formed and skillfully  apply in party leadership principles and methods of underground  work suited to the conditions of secret activities.    The great leader expounded the questions of thoroughly  applying the principle of democratic centralism in party  leadership, ensuring the purity of the party ranks and their  unity in ideology and purpose, extensively forming anti-Japanese  mass underground organisations and fully ensuring their guidance  by party organisations, enhancing the militant function and role  of party organisations at all levels and giving effective  assistance to the anti-Japanese guerrillas and guerrilla-held  zones.    Indeed, the conference was a historic one which marked a new  milestone in lifting the work of chuche-type revolutionary party  building to a new higher stage and a significant one which gave  a strong impetus to the development of the revolutionary  movement as a whole.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Serco moves away from defence and hits Pounds 5.2m SERCO GROUP, the task management company, yesterday announced a 21 per cent increase to Pounds 5.2m in pre-tax profits in the year to end-December, in line with forecasts made ahead of the October rights issue. The company, which lists among its contracts the maintenance of Ministry of Defence radars, one in three of London's traffic lights and 108 Marks and Spencer stores, said progress last year was 'very satisfactory'. Turnover improved 33 per cent from Pounds 78.4m to Pounds 104.9m. Mr George Gray, chairman, said about Pounds 10m of the increase came from new contracts. All main contracts which came up for review were renewed. Defence-related business, which provided 75 per cent of turnover when the company floated in 1988, has fallen to 47 per cent following diversification. Since 1990 Serco has provided services to government and local councils and started operations in Australia and New Zealand. UK defence budget cuts will affect the group in the longer term. But Serco expects its defence business to increase this year as contracting out to reduce costs becomes more popular. Following the rights issue, which raised Pounds 9.6m, Serco is looking for acquisitions. The company is continuing talks with British Telecommunications about the purchase of International Aeradio, its aviation services subsidiary. This would provide Serco with a natural route into aviation services, Mr Gray said. Earnings per share increased to 30.2p (26.1p). A recommended final dividend of 8p makes a total for the year of 12p (11p). The company's shares - which had risen strongly since August  - yesterday gained 9p to a high of 624p.</p>

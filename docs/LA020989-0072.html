			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ASSEMBLYMAN MURRAY UNDER FIRE ON OPPOSITION TO BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES  </P> <P> When Willard D. Murray ran for the state Assembly last fall, voters in this  city overwhelmingly supported the former civil rights activist and political  consultant. Now, some of the same people are at odds with their new legislator  over the issue of gun control.  </P> <P> Murray (D-Paramount) is opposed to gun control. In Compton -- where the latest  people to die from semiautomatic weapon fire were a 2-year-old boy, a  19-year-old man and a 32-year-old man walking along a residential street --  there is widespread support for outlawing the weapons, officials and residents  say.  </P> <P> Last month the City Council unanimously voted to ban the sale or possession of  the semiautomatic military-style assault rifles within municipal boundaries.  </P> <P> Murray says, however, that he will not support a move in the state Legislature  to outlaw or restrict the sale of such semiautomatics as the kind of military  assault weapon used in the killing last month of five Stockton schoolchildren.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Better Support It'  </P> <P> "He'd better support it," Compton Mayor Walter R. Tucker said. "If he doesn't,  he'll be a one-term assemblyman just like the guy before him."  </P> <P> Murray ousted Republican incumbent Paul E. Zeltner of Lakewood. The National  Rifle Assn. endorsed Murray shortly before election day after Zeltner, a former  Los Angeles County sheriff's captain, was quoted as saying that he would favor  some kind of restriction on the sale of such semiautomatic military-style  assault weapons as the Uzi and the AK-47.  </P> <P> Military-style assault rifles sold on the civilian market are high-powered  weapons that can fire one round for each squeeze of the trigger. Although  assault rifles are generally more compact than hunting rifles, they carry more  bullets. For instance, one magazine for the Uzi holds 32 rounds. Several police  organizations want them banned.  </P> <P> Depending on the "Maybe he got some NRA money," Tucker said while trying to  explain Murray's stance.  </P> <P> Murray and an NRA official insisted that the assemblyman did not receive NRA  contributions.  </P> <P> The organization expects a legislator that it endorses to uphold the  Constitution's Second Amendment guaranteeing a citizen's right to bear arms,  said Ted A. Lattanzio, the NRA's director of state and local affairs.  </P> <P> Murray said in a recent interview that "Gun control would only keep guns away  from the good, law-abiding citizens. And the bad people would get guns because  they would not obey the law."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Infringes' on Liberty  </P> <P> Murray, sounding the same theme he used during his campaign, said he is opposed  to any further restriction on the sale of weapons because it "infringes on  another person's liberty." He said he would not vote for a ban on the sale of  semiautomatic assault weapons nor would he support a compromise legislative  proposal to make buyers wait 15 days from the date of purchase to the time they  take possession. State law requires buyers of pistols to wait 15 days so that  law enforcement agencies can make a background check on them.  </P> <P> "I am opposed to any additional restrictions," Murray said. "I have heard no  evidence that gun control has reduced crime anywhere in this country."  </P> <P> The way to deal with the weapons issue, Murray insisted, is to punish those who  use them during crimes. Murray said he has already introduced a bill in the  Assembly that proposes longer prison sentences for people convicted of assault  with semiautomatic assault weapons and machine guns.  </P> <P> Existing law provides for sentences of two to four years for assault with a  firearm, Murray said. If his bill becomes law, he continued, assault with a  semiautomatic assault weapon would carry a prison sentence of four to 12 years  and assault with a machine gun could be punishable with a life sentence. He  said he is drafting other legislation to cover murder and armed robbery  committed with semiautomatic assault weapons or machine guns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Says Stand Is Political  </P> <P> Murray's old friend, Compton Councilman Maxcy Filer, said he believes that  Murray's stance on gun control is a political one taken to court the NRA.  </P> <P> "I think he should really look into what he's doing when he says he would not  ban semiautomatic weapons," Filer said. "He's saying, 'Then, fine, anyone in  the city of Compton can have a weapon.' And we don't believe that.  </P> <P> "(Gun advocates) use the term freedom. What about the people getting killed?  What about their rights? Those that are staying in their houses because they're  afraid -- what about their constitutional rights and their freedom?"  </P> <P> In Compton neighborhoods, the sound of gunfire from semiautomatic assault  weapons is common.  </P> <P> "It's so loud you don't know when to fall to the floor," says Brenda Sykes,  president of a block club in the Killen Place-Killen Court neighborhood in the  city's northeast corner.  </P> <P> She recalls the Sunday morning she returned home from church services to find  her neighbors nearly hysterical. A 15-year-old boy, ignoring children romping  on front lawns, had chased another boy down the street, firing an assault rifle  at him.  </P> <P> "There were 7- and 8-year-olds playing out here and they didn't know what to  do," said Sykes, who wants the weapons taken out of circulation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ban Strongly Supported  </P> <P> At the opposite end of town, Bernard Stephens, president of the West  Lantana-Bennett Block Club, said people in his neighborhood strongly support  the city's ban on military-style assault weapons.  </P> <P> "The AK-47s and the Uzi," Stephens said, "we're for those people getting those  off the street, out of existence. Those guns are made to kill people. Those  guns are not to hunt with."  </P> <P> NRA spokesmen have said that they will file a legal challenge to Compton's gun  ban. If the ordinance does not survive the court challenge, Compton residents  will have to depend on state legislators to ban or restrict the sale of the  weapons.  </P> <P> In that case, Stephens said, he does not know what action his block club will  take. "We'll have to think about writing letters or something to them," he  said.  </P> <P> The Rev. Arthur Atkins, a member of the Compton Block Club Commission, which  the City Council established to promote the neighborhood watch groups, said:  "We're going to have to do something about changing (Murray's) mind. Once he  understands the problem, he'll (listen) to us because he wants to continue  being an assemblyman."  </P> <P> Compton voters will break ranks with Murray over the issue of gun control, said  Atkins, pastor of Heavenly Rest Missionary Baptist Church on Bullis Road.  Getting the weapons off the street, he said, is a constant topic of discussion  at block club meetings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Very Distressed'  </P> <P> Sidney Bowen, vice chairman of the block club commission, said he was "very  distressed" to learn that Murray is opposed to a ban on the weapons. "I did not  know that when I voted for him," Bowen said.  </P> <P> He also said that he will introduce a motion that the commission send Murray a  letter asking him to change his position "and represent us and not the NRA. I  don't think the assemblyman is representative of the majority of the  constituents in his district because we are the victims of these weapons,"  Bowen said. "We are in fear to walk the streets."  </P> <P> If the authors of the Second Amendment, Bowen said, saw today's gang shootings  and weapons, "they would be ashamed if we didn't do anything. Never in their  wildest imagination did they envision this amendment being a provision that  criminals could hide behind and (that) innocent people would become the  hunted."  </P> <P> Pressure also is coming from other quarters for Murray to modify his position  on gun control. He recently met with municipal judges in Compton for an  informal discussion about legislative issues and got an earful on the subject.  The judges made it clear that they want the Legislature to enact some kind of  restriction on the availability of the weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Concealment Argument  </P> <P> Murray tried to explain why state law allows people to buy AK-47s and Uzis in  five minutes but makes them wait 15 days for a pistol. The rationale is, Murray  said, that pistols are more dangerous because they can be concealed.  </P> <P> "Garbage," retorted one unidentified judge.  </P> <P> Murray, whose 54th Assembly District also takes in Lakewood, Bellflower,  Paramount and a slice of Long Beach, said that he is not feeling pressured to  change his mind on gun control.  </P> <P> "I'm not jumping on what I guess some perceive as a bandwagon," he said.  </P> <P> In 1982, there was a statewide gun-control referendum on the ballot, Murray  said, and the majority of Compton voters went against it. He said he believes  that they would do the same thing again. The City Council tried two years ago  to pass an ordinance banning handguns, but reversed itself under pressure from  the NRA and Compton citizens.  </P></p>

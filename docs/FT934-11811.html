			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Darkest hour before dawn: The travails of Reuters' futures trading system Globex, the international electronic network for dealing in the world's fast-growing 'futures' market, may offer a foretaste of the shape of financial trading in years to come. But at the moment its own future is far from certain. The volume of trade on the system, developed by Reuters, the London-based news and information group, in conjunction with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, the world's two largest futures exchanges, is well below target. Apart from the Matif, the French futures market, it has failed to attract members elsewhere. Part of the problem is the rivalry between futures exchanges, which are reluctant to join a system run by their competitors. But there is also a more fundamental question: whether the market for futures - instruments which commit the holder to buy or sell commodities, shares and bonds at a later date - will ever be sufficiently global to make the system profitable. Doubts over the system have this week prompted discussions between Reuters and the CME over possible changes. A renegotiation of the agreement between all three partners is due in April. Reuters has most at stake. It contributed Dollars 75m (Pounds 49.6m) towards Globex's Dollars 80m development cost. Though the idea was conceived in 1987, stock market analysts forecast that Globex will not make a contribution to Reuters' revenues until 1995. Mr Brian Newman, of stockbrokers Henderson Cross-thwaite, says the project is 'intellectually important, but not vital for short-term profits'. Globex's failure, however, could weaken Reuters' efforts to dominate the market for financial trading systems: without Globex, it would have to rely on its currency and equity dealing systems. In April, Reuters has the option to pull out because its partners have failed to reach the pre-agreed target of 50,000 of their contracts traded every day on the system. (The current volume is only about 5,000 a day.) Its commitment to its partners has been severely tested. Mr Pat Arbor, the CBOT chairman, did not help relations by describing, during a Globex marketing trip to the Far East, his exchange's own after-hours electronic dealing system, Project A, as 'less expensive to introduce and easier to use'. But withdrawal in April seems unlikely because Reuters is keen to recoup its investment. Reuters is believed, however, to be looking for a radical restructuring with the aim of diminishing the role of the CBOT and CME so that other exchanges are encouraged to join. In particular, it needs to win the backing of large players such as the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. Yet such changes will only ensure Globex's success if the initial concept of a global network for trading futures proves viable. Globex was conceived to allow round-the-world trading of futures and options, 24 hours a day. Its backers got one thing right: futures markets have become an increasingly important part of world financial markets. Because futures offer a cheaper and quicker means of dealing, they frequently drive price changes in stock and bond markets. The value of financial products and commodities traded via futures contracts on the world's exchanges has reached an estimated Dollars 140,000bn a year. Most of this business takes place in trading pits during local working hours by men and women in brightly coloured jackets signalling prices to each other across the floor. Before Globex, futures trading stopped when markets closed. That meant, for example, that if the US president suffered a heart attack outside hours, traders in Japan or London were unable to react by buying or selling US Treasury long bond futures during their own trading day. In the late 1980s, when the trend across all financial markets was towards increased internationalisation, Globex seemed a logical development. Now the atmosphere is more sober, even among its backers. In spite of the rapid growth of cross-border trading and investment, few financial markets are truly global. Only currencies are traded actively 24 hours a day. Other markets, even the extremely liquid US Treasuries market, trade mainly during the working hours of their own country. This means that it may be difficult for Globex to attract heavy volume, except in exceptional circumstances. For example, when President Boris Yeltsin dissolved the Russian parliament after France's Matif had closed for the day, 61,000 contracts in French government bond futures were traded overnight on Globex. The counter argument put by Globex's backers is that it has the advantage of being the only electronic trading system for futures. Moreover, regulatory hurdles in many countries have slowed the system's spread around the world, and until screens are in place on more traders' desks, its value will not be fully appreciated. 'How can we be measured at this point when we only just got approval to put screens in the Pacific Rim? How do you sell hotdogs in Japan when you don't even have a hotdog stand there?' asks Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman. 'We are making a long journey here and you don't do it in two years,' he says. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, managing director of Reuters transaction products, says: 'The key to transaction products is gaining a critical mass; that takes time.' Reuters says it is confident about Globex's future. But it is keen to improve the system's marketability. That concern will be at the centre of Reuters' discussions with its partners in April - although it is possible a resolution could come earlier. The group has been reticent so far about strategy but it admits change is probable. 'We want to explore all the various avenues and opportunities,' says Ms Wilton. A possible scenario is an agreement that Reuters will have overall charge of running the system with all member exchanges - including the two founding partners in Chicago - having equal influence over the day-to-day operations. Mr Arbor of the CBOT hints that he would be prepared to go down that road, adding that after the agreement is renegotiated, Globex 'will look more open, more like a utility. I think the present structure may be too restrictive.' Such an accord may require Reuters to take a stronger hand in dealing with the two Chicago exchanges, which have bickered over the handling of negotiations with other exchanges. If a deal can be struck, however, any additional members would bring new products and new users to Globex. It would be at least a first step towards allowing the system the opportunity to prove its worth as a trading tool that could survive into the 21st century.</p>

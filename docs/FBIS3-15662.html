Azerbaijan General Prosecutor Ali Omarov has issued a  sensational statement: "An attempt to execute an armed coup  d'etat planned to take place in the republic on 5 March has been  thwarted by investigative organs." According to him, the  weapons and munitions seized in the PFA headquarters and in the  apartments of certain rayon branch leaders had been assembled  for the coup.    The PFA described the Prosecutor's Office actions as a  provocation. A statement issued by the PFA asserts that "the  PFA has nothing to do with the weapons found." The version of  events advanced in the document is that the arms cache was  planted in the building by the police.    Both the statement about an imminent coup and the PFA's  attempt to dissociate itself from the arsenal in its own  building are regarded with suspicion in Baku.    The opposition has used this episode to attack the  government. The PFA, the Musavat party, and the Azerbaijan  Democratic and Independent Democratic Parties have adopted a  joint statement in which they accuse the republic authorities of  repressing opposition forces. In their opinion, the authorities  are doing this to shift the blame for the relentless  deterioration in the economic and military situation onto their  opponents' shoulders.    The PFA has been in existence six years. It has headed the  democratic movement in the republic. It held power in  Azerbaijan from June 1992 through July 1993. However, this  period was marked by a host of mistakes in both foreign policy  and the economy, caused the Front to disintegrate into various  political parties, and hastened the resignation of ex-President  Abulfaz Elchibey's team.    When the PFA was in office it had more than 80,000 members;  today its ranks have thinned considerably. But even bearing in  mind the PFA's sapped authority, it is premature to write it  off. Having adopted its principle of organizational building  from the Communist Party, the PFA has a ramified network of  organizations in all rayons and population centers of the  republic. The unchanged chairman of the Front is ex-President  Elchibey, who prefers to call it a movement. After his forced  resignation he withdrew to his home village of Keleki, in the  Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, and he continues to "lead the  Front's activity" from there.    The PFA was and remains a fervent opponent of Azerbaijan's  joining the CIS, seeing the Commonwealth as harboring the threat  of restoration. For that reason and also because it disagrees  with President Geydar Aliyev's course, the Front, in coalition  with certain political parties, stands implacably opposed to the  current authorities.    As far as weapons are concerned the Front, particularly in  the last two years, has had an abundance of them, and it is  unlikely they have all been voluntarily handed over to the  law-enforcement agencies.    However, this fact can scarcely serve to justify accusing  the  Front of preparing an armed coup.</p>

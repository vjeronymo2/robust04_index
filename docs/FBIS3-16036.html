This document says that "the country has approached the  limit  beyond which there is national catastrophe, economic ruin and  civil war." It also says that Ukraine needed a new political  course and successful democratic elections.    The Inter-Regional Bloc of Reforms urged the population not  to allow the bankrupt authorities, who are planning to foil the  elections, to deceive them. If the Ukrainian citizens do not  come to the polling stations on March 27, the policy which has  pushed them to the verge of extinction, will be continued, says  this bloc's appeal.</p>

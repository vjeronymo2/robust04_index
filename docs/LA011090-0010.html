			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEFENDANT DENIES MAILING LETTERS IN 'PAY OR DIE' SCHEME  </P> <P> After more than a year in jail and several weeks of trial testimony, a former  Lancaster aerospace worker took the witness stand in San Fernando Superior  Court on Tuesday for the first time and denied mailing extortion letters to  hundreds of prominent Antelope Valley residents.  </P> <P> Richard Faroni's testimony painted the prosecution's case as being built on  misinterpretation of innocent acts.  </P> <P> The "pay-or-die" letters mailed in late 1988 demanded millions of dollars, but  no money was ever collected. Faroni, 27, was charged along with 28-year-old  Roman Makuch with attempted extortion and conspiracy, based on evidence of  surveillance and other activities that prosecutors portrayed as incriminating.  </P> <P> Judge Ronald S. Coen rejected a motion to dismiss the case two weeks ago,  saying the prosecution had convinced him the defendants are guilty.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Faroni contradicted prosecution testimony that he bragged about an  ongoing surveillance project, saying he conducted surveillance activity only  once when he used a camera and tape recorder to spy on a neighbor with whom he  was feuding. And he denied owning a long-range listening device known as a "big  ears," which a neighbor said he saw the defendants load into a car before  late-night drives, during which prosecutors believe they gathered information  on victims.  </P> <P> Faroni said he owned an old-fashioned flashbulb holder that could be mistaken  as a long-range microphone. He also testified that he never heard of some of  the prominent letter recipients -- including two well-known hotel owners and a  Lancaster businessman who is the chairman of the state Republican Party --  until after his arrest.  </P> <P> "I don't get into politics," Faroni said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven L. Cooley has asserted that Faroni and Makuch had a  motive for the extortion plot because they were angry that local leaders had  failed to support the Antelope Valley Film Commission, on which they worked as  volunteers.  </P> <P> Faroni, who was known to friends as "Rocky" while Makuch was known as  "Bullwinkle," has been described by detectives and prosecutors as a bright,  eccentric former Army communications expert believed to have masterminded the  plot. He was animated and talkative on the stand, recalling the exact dates of  events.  </P> <P> Cooley, who begins cross-examination today, called Faroni's statements "weak  and preposterous. . . . I'm looking forward to the opportunity to question  him."  </P> <P> Defense attorney Clark said he believes Faroni's testimony undercut a  prosecution case based on circumstantial evidence.  </P> <P> "Alternative explanations were given," Clark said. "They can ask any question  they want, but they are not going to get more than they have."  </P></p>

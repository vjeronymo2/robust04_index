			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (16): The gateway to a haven is still ajar - Offshore investment or offshore financial centres, as they prefer to be called - played a starring role in every financial scandal of the 1980s. They offer a climate of secrecy and non-accountability in which white-collar crime festers and thrives. But that is a slightly unbalanced perspective on the offshore financial services business. Shrewd UK investors have used tax havens legitimately for decades as a means of avoiding tax and protecting their assets. They still do, although the UK is gradually closing the door. Successive Budgets have severely limited investors' options. The biggest blow was the 1984 Finance Act, which outlawed the practice of deferring tax indefinitely on dividends from offshore 'roll-up' funds, ending the billion-pound bonanza enjoyed by Rothschild's Old Court and similar Channel Islands funds. The 1991 Finance Act imposed taxes on capital profits made from offshore trusts set up after April 5, 1991, a long-expected restraint on the nouveaux riches who hoped to squirrel away their wealth in the manner of the aristocracy. A more ominous measure, if implemented, is contained in the 'Domicile Bill'. This would render taxable the offshore holdings of thousands of rich foreigners resident in the UK. But Ruritanian princesses need not hold their breath. The Bill, which would deem them 'UK domiciled' - thus subjecting their worldwide assets to UK tax - is unlikely to come into force. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, offshore opportunities proliferate. A simple expedient, for the super-rich, is to invest in an offshore fund or deposit account. These pay dividends and interest gross, on which tax is not payable until you have filed your tax return. Wealthy investors may thus receive 'interest on their interest' until they file. Another windfall derives from the enduring notion of 'distributor status'. Such status is conferred annually by the Inland Revenue upon offshore funds which pay out dividends equal to 85 per cent of net income. Income from funds with distributor status is taxed as if it were capital. While UK investors in offshore distributor funds must pay tax on dividends, any disposal is treated as capital gain. Thus they receive the first Pounds 5,800 free of capital gains tax (this tax bonus was significantly greater when income tax rates were above CGT rates). The famous 'roll-up' fund is still a ubiquitous feature of the UK's traditional tax havens (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man). Jeffrey Burton, managing director of Guernsey International Fund Management and chairman of Guernsey Fund Managers Association, says that roll-up funds still provide 'a significant deferral of tax'. One example is the UK investor planning to retire abroad, who places his assets in a roll-up fund, and then sells the holding, free of tax, after he has left the country. It is a simple way of cocking a snook at the Inland Revenue while making full use of the UK's public utilities. Alternatively, roll-up funds appeal to those who anticipate their income being relegated from the higher to the lower tax band. Such people would invest in a roll-up fund while in the higher tax band and dispose of their holdings under the lower, avoiding higher-rate tax exposure altogether. Currency funds are perhaps the most popular offshore vehicle, because they pay close to money-market rates of interest. Like derivative funds, they are available chiefly offshore. Mr Burton explains: 'The regulations covering unit trusts have not really made it possible to introduce them in the UK.' Offshore financial advisers say that most wealthy people in the UK use one or more of these methods of investing. 'We would certainly hope so,' said one fund manager in Jersey. 'Assuming that Barings, Hambros and Schroders manage a similar investment performance offshore as they do onshore, there is a strong argument that you should invest offshore to receive dividends gross,' he said. A director of a Guernsey company said, however, that 'we don't market products purely on tax advantage, we don't think investors should invest purely on tax criteria - but it is an argument which applies'. But do the risks outweigh the attractions? No, according to Channel Islands practitioners. Both Jersey and Guernsey have introduced investor protection legislation in recent years, which compensates investors up to Pounds 50,000 and Pounds 60,000 respectively on losses derived from fraud or negligence. Both islands classify funds into two groups: those recognised by the Securities &amp; Investments Board, and marketable in the UK, and those available elsewhere. Neither island has a depositor protection scheme, unlike the Isle of Man, whose scheme is as generous as that applying in the UK. But the Channel Islands take much comfort from the fact that they have never had a significant banking failure. Indeed, both refused BCCI a banking licence, and Jersey last year received an AAA credit rating from Standard &amp; Poor's. Secrecy laws are as strict as Switzerland's, and money-laundering rules are identical to those recently introduced in the UK. 'Investors have to be introduced by a reputable professional,' says Mr Burton. 'We would always look to the source of the referral.'</p>

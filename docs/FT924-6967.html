			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Spens plea on 'innocence' LORD SPENS, a former finance director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, was deprived of any prospect of clearing his name by the premature ending of the second Guinness trial, two High Court judges were told yesterday. The judges are reviewing the refusal of Mr Justice Henry, the trial judge, to acquit Lord Spens after the trial collapsed because of the deterioration in the mental health of Mr Roger Seelig, his co-defendant, Mr Justice Henry ordered the charges against Lord Spens of conspiracy and false accounting to lie on the file. He also refused to order legal costs, for which Lord Spens is claiming Pounds 365,000, to be paid from public funds. Mr Andrew Collins QC, for Lord Spens, said the trial had been aborted through no fault of the banker. 'In these circumstances he has now been deprived of any prospect of establishing his innocence.' Mr Justice Henry had been wrong not to order his formal acquittal because the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution, had said it would offer no further evidence, he said. Lord Spens had been left with a cloud hanging over him and in a position where people could think there was no smoke without fire. The hearing continues today.</p>

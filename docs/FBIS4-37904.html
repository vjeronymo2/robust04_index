			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  today stated that Egypt is holding contacts with UN Secretary  General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and OAU Secretary General Dr.  Salim Ahmed Salim on the situation in Rwanda.    He said that he met today with the French ambassador in  Cairo, because France came up with the initiative of sending  troops and observers on a humanitarian mission to Rwanda.    Regarding the meetings of the Damascus Declaration  countries'  foreign ministers in Kuwait on Tuesday, 28 June, 'Amr Musa said  that all the countries in the Damascus Declaration support a  cease-fire in Yemen. Egypt will declare its stand on the matter  from this perspective.    He added that some working papers will be presented to  bolster cooperation among the countries of the Declaration. He  affirmed that the Damascus Declaration is in better condition  now than it was before. All the member countries now want to  activate and revitalize this Declaration; to increase  coordination and bolster cooperation among the countries,  especially since this grouping consists of eight countries that  are members of the Arab League. These countries meet within the  framework of the Arab League's charter and the charter of Arab  economic cooperation.    He clarified that it is important and necessary for such a  grouping to discuss all the problems in the region and the Arab  world and to attempt to find a common approach on how to deal  with these problems.    'Amr Musa said: We agree with the need to stop the fighting  in Yemen and to start a dialogue.    On the possibility of further measures being taken by the  Security Council with regard to the Yemen problem, Musa said  that the issue depends on the secretary general's report, which  he will submit to the Council. The secretary general's report  will be based on the report he receives from his special envoy  Lakhdar Brahimi in light of the discussions he recently held in  Cairo.    The foreign minister affirmed that the continued fighting in  Yemen, despite the Security Council's calls to stop it,  constitutes a problem. This is what makes the intervention of  the Security Council probable.    On the possibility of convening a mini-Arab summit to  discuss  the situation in Yemen, the foreign minister said this has not  been proposed so far.    Answering a question on protecting the lives of Egyptians in  Yemen, 'Amr Musa said that protecting Egyptians in Yemen and  elsewhere is one of the major duties the Foreign Ministry is  shouldering.    He added that the Foreign Ministry works in coordination  with  the cabinet to secure the return of Egyptians from Yemen because  the issue pertains to the whole country.    Answering a question on whether Egypt had received a  Palestinian or Israeli proposal to host the Palestinian-Israeli  negotiations in Cairo, 'Amr Musa said that Egypt had not yet  received such a request. He said it is ready to host the  negotiations should the two sides ask it to do so.</p>

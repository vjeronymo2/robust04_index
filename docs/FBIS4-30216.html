			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata </F> with unidentified domestic correspondents at the prime  minister's official residence in Tokyo -- live]    [Text] The enactment of the 1994 budget has been delayed  for a long time. Compared with past budget deliberations in the  Diet, the 1994 budget was deliberated in the Diet for a very  short time. The 1994 budget, that directly affects the  livelihood of the people, was enacted today in the Diet. I  would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to both the ruling  and opposition parties for cooperating with each other in  enacting the budget. I believe it is important to implement the  budget steadily and early to stimulate the economy. Taking  advantage of this opportunity, I would like to state my views.    The situation at home and abroad is very grim. I believe  that in order to overcome the difficult situation, it is very  important to establish an administration based on a solid  foundation. The ruling coalition parties have begun policy  discussions with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and  other parties. I intend to leave issues, including the question  of my resignation as prime minister, to the policy discussions.  In any case, political parties that share the same political  beliefs and policies should cooperate with each other in  overcoming various obstacles while setting the final conclusion  of the political reform as their biggest goal. I believe this  is the way to overcome the present difficult situation and meet  the people's wishes. I have stated my views.    [Dean of the Press Corps] As dean of the Press Corps, I  would  like to ask you some questions. The current Diet session has  only a few days left, and political parties have begun moving at  long last. The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  formally submitted a no-confidence motion against the Hata  cabinet at the Diet this evening. Mr. Prime Minister, how are  you going to deal with the no- confidence motion?    [Hata] I have served as prime minister for about two months.  Since I took office, I have said things must be done the same  day. I, my cabinet members, and other officials have worked  together to sincerely tackle tasks facing us every day from  early morning to late night. I believe what I have tackled,  proposed, and actually implemented deserve the people's  approval. I also believe that my cabinet members and I have  done our best to meet the people's goals or wishes.    [Dean of the Press Corps] Now, the ruling coalition parties  are engaged in policy discussions with the SDPJ. SDPJ Chairman  Murayama, however, has said the SDPJ Central Committee has  decided to demand a general resignation of the Hata cabinet, and  the general resignation of the Hata cabinet is a precondition  for the SDPJ to return to the ruling coalition. Mr. Prime  Minister, you have just said you would leave the question of  your resignation as prime minister to the policy discussions.  How do you plan to deal with the SDPJ's demand for the general  resignation of your cabinet?    [Hata] As for how to deal with the SDPJ's demand for the  general resignation of my cabinet, both the ruling coalition  parties and the SDPJ are discussing the question. I believe  that I will have an opportunity to discuss the question with  Chairman Murayama. I intend to hold frank and sincere talks. I  would like you to understand my feelings when I say that I will  entrust all the issues, including my future course for political  career, to the talks. In any case, I intend to seek to make  Chairman Murayama understand my position by telling him that I  will leave the question of my resignation as prime minister, and  other issues, to the policy discussions.    [Dean of the Press Corps] Sakigake stated today [23 June]  that it agreed to the policies presented by the SDPJ, and called  for the establishment of an administration headed by SDPJ  Chairman Murayama. What do you think of this?    [Hata] Well, I think each has its own view. Therefore, I  would like to refrain from commenting on the question. I think  Sakigake members have various views. However, when my cabinet  was formed, Sakigake stated they would support the cabinet from  outside the coalition, and that its position is not that of an  opposition party. I will not say anything more about this.    [Reporter] You said you would leave everything, including  your future course as prime minister, to the policy talks. I  dare to ask you: If the situation concerning voting for a  no-confidence motion against the cabinet becomes delicate, do  you have any intention of a voluntary cabinet resignation en  masse as one option?    [Hata] The question is not whether I have such an intention  or not. As I said, I would leave my future to the decision of  the policy talks, I believe that a direction will be indicated  through future talks.    [Reporter] The SDPJ reportedly has a view that, if the  cabinet resigns en masse voluntarily, it will support you, Prime  Minister Hata, as the next prime minister. I think, in this  case, the resignation en masse itself is a ruse in a bid to take  power. What do you think of the SDPJ's idea?    [Hata] I have not yet had direct talks with the SDPJ.  Through talks with SDPJ leaders, including Chairman Murayama  and Secretary General Kubo, I intend to inform them of my  feelings. However, tasks that we have to tackle from now on  include: political reform, economic restructuring, tax reform,  administrative reform, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks,  the DPRK issue -- progress has now been made on this issue --  Japan's stance on the Naples summit, and policies toward the  agricultural agreement under the Uruguay Round talks. All of  these are very difficult issues. I believe it is necessary to  form a stable administration to deal with them. I would like to  explain my frank views on this point [to SDPJ leaders].    [Reporter] There was an argument within the ruling coalition  that it would cope with the political situation by carrying out  a drastic cabinet reshuffle. At present, do you rule out this  possibility?    [Hata] If I answer the question now, this will please you.  However, I intend to convey my views to them at policy talks  from now on, while hearing their opinions. As I intend to leave  the question of my resignation to the policy coordination talks,  I would like to deal with the talks with a clean slate.    [Reporter] I dare to ask you this question. If the future  policy talks decide to name Mr. Hata as the next prime minister  after the cabinet resigns en masse, would you accept the offer  to become the prime minister?    [Hata] I am sorry but I cannot answer the question now. At  any rate, this is an issue that will decide the future course of  Japan. There will be opportunities for party representatives  with various views to talk with each other. Since the  discussion on the framework of a new administration are now in  progress, I believe a direction will be indicated through this  discussion.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, the LDP says that underlying  its presentation of a no-confidence motion against your cabinet  is the fact that the Cabinet is a minority, and therefore is not  able to meet the people's expectations. What is your view of  the LDP's reasoning?    [Hata] On this issue, I want to say that the reason the SDPJ  separated from the coalition is not policy matters. As I have  stated at Diet sessions, although I regret to say it, the SDPJ  separated from the coalition in such a short period due to  misunderstanding each other and a matter of wording. Therefore,  I realize that the reason for the SDPJ's separation from us is  not its sharp conflict over my policies as prime minister. To  this day, I have managed the government while sincerely  maintaining each of the policies agreed with the SDPJ.  Therefore, I believe the SDPJ will be understanding in that  respect.    [Reporter] You said you would like to leave everything,  including the issue of your resignation, to the decision at the  talks. I think what you have said is very important. I want to  ask you again what the primary reason is that you have decided  so. Also, did you make the decision today?    [Hata] Concerning this issue, well, as I said earlier, the  issues that we are facing now, or those we will face in the  future, are all very difficult problems. They include political  reform, economic reform, which I mentioned earlier, and  administration and financial reforms. Administration reform  includes decentralization of power. There are also external  problems in connection with the Uruguay Round of talks and  agricultural agreements. These are really difficult problems.  However, no matter how difficult they are, Japan should not  avoid them. To make progress in these issues, it is necessary  to establish a stable administration. The most important thing  is for the government to work to make progress in these issues  while seeking again an agreement with others in the process of  talks on basic ideals and policies. I decided to leave  everything, including the issue of my resignation, today, just  before this news conference.    [Reporter] You said you need to establish a strong  government to tide over difficulties. But I think it is normal  for you to decide to dissolve the House of Representatives for a  general election. Why did you not decide so?    [Hata] I did not because I have doubts about the need to  dissolve the house now. There is another reason. I attended  the meeting of the House of Councillors' Special Committee on  Political Reform yesterday and the meeting of the House of  Representatives' Special Committee on Political Reform the day  before yesterday. As you know, political reform bills cleared  the Diet under the former Hosokawa cabinet. But to enforce  them, electoral constituencies have to be redrawn. The  electoral redistricting panel on new constituency boundaries has  submitted to the Diet a list of basic standards for redrawing.  While observing Diet deliberations and arguments over the  standards, the panel will soon start work to draw new  boundaries. I think it is inappropriate to ignore this  development and hold a general election under the current medium  constituency system.    If the election is held under the current system, the  political reform laws, which we have finally enacted, will mean  nothing. The government will not be able to seek cooperation in  resolving the issues I mentioned earlier if it avoids carrying  out tasks that entail pains. In this context, it is necessary  for the government to work out a bill to draw new constituencies  based on the panel's recommendation, submit it to the Diet for  deliberations, and enact it. I think the election should be  held after these tasks have been completed. Otherwise, we will  repeat the same thing over and over again.    [Reporter] If a no-confidence motion is submitted to the  plenary session and is adopted, will you still choose  resignation en masse, not the dissolution of the house?    [Hata] I would like to refrain from answering your question.  Anyway, what I have always said is that the Japanese prime  minister is not given the veto power as the U.S. President, who  uses the power when he wants to kill bills. Therefore, the  final resort for the prime minister to confront the Diet is the  right to dissolve the House of Representatives. I do not deny  the right to dissolve the house. I am just worried that if the  election is held not in accordance with the political reform  laws despite the fact that we have held much discussion on them,  we will repeat the same thing again. Although I do not deny the  right, I would like to avoid using it, if possible. Allow me to  use the word 'if' in answering your question.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. You have said that you  have not so far made mistakes in running the government and have  dealt with issues in all sincerity in the belief that what must  be done has to be done the same day. But you said that you have  made a decision to leave everything, including your resignation  -- taking it like a man -- to negotiations between the ruling  parties and the SDPJ. What is your honest feeling now?    [Hata] Well, looking back, I have suffered considerable  criticism. But in the past two months, my cabinet has made  great efforts every day to tackle new issues and to seek new  policies. From early in the morning -- from 7:30 AM or 8:00 AM  for example -- and almost every day I have attended various  councils or meetings. Even with regard to the issue of public  utilities charges or the issue of the prices of goods, as well  as improving the people's living conditions and creating our  nation's diplomatic policies that can win the international  community's understanding, I am personally confident that I have  taken considerable leadership, and that those who sincerely  supported my action appraise what I have done. The issues the  government has to deal with are very important. There is the  fact -- although it was regrettable -- that when my cabinet was  inaugurated, it failed to take action in concert with the SDPJ,  and now my cabinet -- it may be inappropriate for me to say my  government is fragile -- is in a very difficult situation. To  settle this issue, I think I should give up my position and  leave the matter to negotiations, and then the door to a new  course for the government will open.    [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have said that you hope  to form a more stabilized foundation for the government. In  connection with bringing new political forces together, there  has reportedly been a strong view -- particularly within  Shinseito -- calling for creating a conservatives-conservatives  alliance, in addition to another view calling for the SDPJ's  return to the ruling coalition. Although you seemed to have been  calling for the SDPJ's return to the coalition, what is your  view on such a call for forming an alliance with other  conservatives?    [Hata] Underlying the call is the hope to form a new group  with those who seceded from the LDP. For example, right before  I was chosen as prime minister there was a call for forming a  group with those led by Mr. Watanabe of the LDP. I think it is  alright for us to get along with other conservatives in such a  framework. However, I do not mean that I have a hostile feeling  against the LDP itself but I honestly felt that if we formed an  alliance with the LDP itself, Japan's politics would return to  that established in 1955. Although you said there was a call  within Shinseito, I think the members of Shinseito had the same  feeling. If some members should leave the LDP to work for  carrying out new politics, we are ready to frankly talk with  them. In this sense, I think forming an alliance with the LDP  will lead to bringing Japan's current politics -- which is  drastically changing -- back to that created in 1955. Although I  do not fully know what you mean by conservatives- conservatives  alliance, this is what I feel about the idea of forming an  alliance with other conservatives.    [Unidentified moderator] It is time to conclude the press  conference.    [Hata] Thank you very much.</p>

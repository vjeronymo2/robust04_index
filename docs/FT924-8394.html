			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Higher raw materials prices add to fears on inflation A SHARP JUMP in the price of imported raw materials, reflecting the devaluation of sterling in mid-September, has raised the spectre of higher inflation in the UK. Official figures yesterday showed that the prices of raw materials and fuels used by UK manufacturers rose to their highest level for two years in October. Input prices rose 2 per cent on September, which took the year-on-year rate of increase also to 2 per cent. Economists fear that the higher cost of raw materials will flow through to retail price inflation. They warned that manufacturers would not be able to absorb higher import costs indefinitely, and would have to raise prices. 'We are seeing the first stages of an inflationary pick-up,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at SG Warburg Securities. Until September, input prices had generally eased since July last year. This helped push manufacturing output prices - sometimes referred to as core inflation - to their lowest levels since the 1960s. But since September 16, the pound has fallen sharply, particularly against the dollar in which most raw materials and fuels are priced. The Central Statistical Office figures showed that hard-pressed manufacturers have so far absorbed the higher costs of imports resulting from the weaker pound, frightened that raising prices in the recession would further reduce sales. The price of manufactured goods leaving UK factories rose by only 0.1 per cent last month, taking the annual rate of increase to 3.3 per cent, compared with 3.4 per cent in the year to September. 'We can take some confidence from the output price series, but that is a lagging indicator and in time it will start to rise,' Mr Richardson said. The Treasury said improved unit labour cost performance should help ease some of the upward pressure on producer prices that inevitably follows a fall in the exchange rate.

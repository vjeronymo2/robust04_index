			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Erna van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 20 SAPA -- The descendants of an  African National Congress co-founder and former president had  switched allegiances to the National Party [NP] due to the ANC's  "violence and intimidation", the NP said on Wednesday [20  April]. Robert Makgatho and his mother Elsie, among at least 11  members of former ANC President Sefako Mapogo Makgotho's family  who would vote for the NP, were introduced to the media at an NP  news conference in Pretoria.    A former Mamelodi councillor, Mr Makgotho said he had been a  member of the United Democratic Front, a front organisation for  the ANC, until 1990 when its "noble ideas had deteriorated into  violence".    The practices of the ANC and its allies were "atrocious", he  said, adding that he did not agree with strikes, disruptions of  education and intimidation.    Some of his former colleagues had tried to discourage him  from voting for the NP and he had received death threats. Three  dockets had been opened against his intimidators, Mr Makgotho  said.    While still a councillor he had been "intimidated out of his  job" by ANC-aligned civic organisations that, among other acts,  twice petrol-bombed his house.    Mr Makgotho said he believed if his great-grandfather had  been alive he too would have voted for the NP because the ANC  today bore no resemblance to the party he had helped found. "We  believe he would have been appalled by the destruction of black  education carried out by the ANC and its comrades in the name of  revolution.    "We believe he would have been ashamed of the violence and  intimidation carried out by those same people against anyone who  dares to disagree with them."    Mr Makgotho said he had found a political home in the NP  because of its ideals to create a peaceful and tolerant society.  Although he was unemployed, his np support did not stem from  material gain but "comes from my heart and soul".    Mr Makgotho's mother Elsie, 62, said she would also cast her  vote for the NP because ANC comrades had sent people to  intimidate her at her place of work because of her son's former  councillorship and NP allegiance. "They also stole my car, and  when I got another one, they burnt it out."    NP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] election  candidate Nana Masango, who organises in the Mamelodi community  where the Makgothos reside, told the news conference the  township was a NP "stronghold".    ANC supporters had been won over to the NP because of the  ANC's intimidatory, disruptive and violent tactics and  lawlessness, she said. "If the comrades, civics and self-defence  units carry out their activities while they are not in power  yet, what will they do if they are?    "We cannot allow these atrocities to continue.    "The ANC is so power-drunk they will drive the country into  anarchy," she said.    ANC President Nelson Mandela had named his second son after  Mr Sefako Mapogo Makgotho as a sign of respect, his  great-grandson said. Mr Makgatho founded the African Native  Political Union in 1906 and the Transvaal African Teachers  Association shortly thereafter, according to a biographical  document issued by the NP at the news conference. "He was one of  the eight-strong caucus which called the conference in  Bloemfontein in January 1912 out of which the ANC emerged.    "He became a senior vice-president at that meeting and  president of the ANC for a seven-year term in 1917.    "He was a close friend of Chief Albert Luthuli (another  former ANC president) and a father figure to many of the new  wave of activists that emerged in the 1940s -- among them Mr  Nelson mandela.    "He died in 1951 and is buried in Mamelodi."</p>

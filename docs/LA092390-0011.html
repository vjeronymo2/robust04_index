			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING CLEAN  </P> <P> You are to be congratulated on bringing the heartache of recovery to your  readers in "Coming Clean" (July 29). More important is making them aware that  recovery is possible.  </P> <P> Author Marita Hernandez is to be complimented on such an in-depth study.  However, I felt the article didn't clearly emphasize the positive aspects of  coming clean and also needs some clarification.  </P> <P> Seventy-five percent of Impact's services are free to the person who cannot  afford treatment. Four of the six people in the article are clean and sober as  of the writing of this letter. The article dramatized and focused on some  isolated situations -- signs, handcuffs, et cetera -- that in reality rarely  occur.  </P> <P> The author could have mentioned her visit to a completion ceremony for the 60  people who joined almost 10,000 other Impact alumni on a new road to life.  </P> <P> Impact is one of the toughest and most respected programs in the country, not  just Los Angeles. This is because of its uncompromising commitment to dealing  with a living problem, not just a drug problem.  </P> <P> Yes, recovery is difficult but not impossible. It is unfair to those who face  the struggle every day to imply that a new start in life is not possible and  only filled with heartache. Many are succeeding "one day at a time," bringing  joy to themselves and their families. They know that recovery is possible with  proper treatment and support.  </P> <P> JOSEPH S. SILVERMAN  </P> <P> PRESIDENT, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, IMPACT  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three Hebron Muslim Waqf officials will testify  before the Shamgar Commission next Sunday [10 April], after  habeas corpus warrants were issued against them. They were  placed in costudy until they give their testimony. The three  Waqf members who have so far refused to cooperate with the  commission, will be released from custody only if they post bail  to guarantee they will show up for the hearings. This was  reported by our legal affairs correspondent Hadar Wismonsky.</p>

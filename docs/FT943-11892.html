			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Seoul and Beijing in air accord An aviation agreement signed yesterday between South Korea and China removes an air transport bottleneck in the fast-growing north-east Asian region. The provisional pact, reached after almost two years of talks, opens direct scheduled flights between Seoul and the northern Chinese cities of Beijing, Shenyang, Qingdao, Tianjin and Dalian. The accord will end cumbersome routes between the two countries and almost halve flight times between Seoul and Beijing. The agreement could also eventually allow South Korean carriers to acquire overflight rights through Chinese airspace, reducing flight times to Europe by two hours and helping to transform Seoul into a regional aviation hub. The establishment of beyond-point rights will be subject to future talks. Scheduled flight services, which will replace charter flights between the two countries, are likely to begin in three months after technical arrangements have been completed and a treaty is signed. But disputes remain over flights between Seoul and cities in southern China, including Shanghai. The main stumbling block to a Sino-South Korean aviation pact has been disagreement over the location of the flight control transfer point, which is linked to territorial rights over sea boundaries and airspace. China has agreed to establish the flight control point in the northern region at 124 degrees longitude, in accordance with South Korea's demands and a 1963 ruling by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. But Beijing is still insisting the control point in the southern region should be established at 125 degrees longitude, which Seoul regards as an invasion of its boundaries. Until the issue is resolved, flights to Shanghai will rely on charter services using the air corridor between Japan and China. It is forecast that the opening of regular services will boost air passenger traffic on the Sino-Korean routes to 300,000-400,000 persons a year, from 150,000 last year, 75 per cent of whom were South Koreans. Airlines from both countries will share services equally. These will include 18 weekly flights between Seoul and Beijing. South Korea is expected to open talks soon with Taiwan on the resumption of direct scheduled flights, which were suspended following the severing of diplomatic ties in August 1992 after Seoul recognised Beijing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Susana del Calvo from the "Evening Information </F> Review"]    [Text] Cuba and the UN Population Fund signed two  agreements aimed at carrying out research on the territorial  distribution of the population and the dissemination of  information regarding the various forms of contraception  available to the Cuban population.    The ceremony is linked to the activities that will be  conducted in Cuba on the occasion of world population day on 11  July. Both programs will receive a contribution of almost  $730,000 from the UN Population Fund and almost 2 million pesos  from the Cuban Government. It is part of the cooperation  program, which the UN Population Fund maintains with the island,  which in the last four years has reached $4 million. (Reiner  Rosembaum), the UN Population Fund's director for Mexico,  Bolivia, and Cuba, told us the following:    [Begin (Rosembaum) recording] I am very pleased to be able  to  practically initiate my work in Cuba with such a significant  ceremony. Not only is it a great incentive for me, but with  this program, we are in a position to fulfill the mandate of the  UN Population Fund here in Cuba. We are also going to be able  to meet the financial ceiling assigned to this country. [end  recording]    One of the programs includes research work in rural areas in  order to propose a coherent population distribution policy that  can promote the stability of the population and its link to the  social, economic, and environmental development of its  surroundings. The object is also to seek new forms of  territorial planning based on a greater and more efficient  participation of citizens and institutions. This program will  be carried out by the Physical Planning Institute of the Economy  and Planning Ministry.    The other program is aimed at providing the largest amount  of  information to women and men of reproductive age about the  various forms of contraceptive methods and family planning,  which the country has available for its citizens. Among the  purposes of this program is to voluntarily decrease the number  of unwanted pregnancies and the dangers they present for women,  especially for those under the age of 20. This program will be  carried out by the National Sex Education Center linked to the  National Assembly of the People's Government, the Public Health  Ministry, and the Federation of Cuban Women.</p>

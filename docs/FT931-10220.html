			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Storehouse chief quits to join US fashion retailer MR DAVID DWORKIN, chief executive of Storehouse, is leaving the retailing group to become chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, one of the largest fashion retailers in the US. Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, had been expected to make an announcement today about the future of Mr Dworkin - who is widely credited with having turned the group around - after its shares fell 11p to 194p on rumours he was about to resign. But Carter Hawley Hale announced last night that Mr Dworkin was to take over from Mr Philip Hawley as president and chief executive officer from April 1. Storehouse refused to comment on the announcement. Mr Samuel Zell, general partner of Zell/Chilmark Fund, CHH's principal owner, said Mr Dworkin's appointment was a 'tremendously significant and exciting development for CHH. David Dworkin is a proven star in the retailing industry'. Mr Dworkin, a 49-year-old American born in Cleveland, Ohio, was recruited to head the BhS group in November 1989 from Bonwit Teller, the US department stores group, and became Storehouse chief executive in July 1992. Analysts said the challenge at Carter Hawley - a successful retailer in the 1980s which had problems controlling its debt and emerged last October from 18 months in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection - would be just the sort Mr Dworkin would relish, having laid the foundations for recovery at Storehouse. Mr Dworkin has reduced the size of the business, selling Habitat and Richards, and focusing on BhS and Mothercare. He has also introduced management reforms which have led to a consistent increase in sales and margins at BhS. Storehouse made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.1m for the half-year to October, against a Pounds 13.9m loss in the previous first half. There is no obvious successor to Mr Dworkin at Storehouse and the group is expected to look outside for a replacement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak President Michal Kovac returned home this  evening from Great Britain and France, where he took part in the  50th anniversary celebrations of the Allied landings in Normandy.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  President,  the purpose of your visit was, above all, to honor the memory of  those who fell during the historical event of the Normandy  invasion. However, how do you assess the importance of this  visit and your meetings with many important politicians from the  foreign policy angle?    [Kovac] It was an opportunity to establish personal contact  with a whole range of state representatives, mainly with those I  had not met until now. [passage omitted] Of course, it was also  an opportunity to deepen still further those contacts that  already exist. I have in mind the meeting with President Bill  Clinton. I had the opportunity to listen to their interest in  Slovakia. They wanted to know what is happening in Slovakia.  They expressed an understanding of our policy. They were  interested to see the continuation of the Slovak transformation,  of building friendly relations with neighboring states, and they  want Slovakia to contribute toward the stability of the Central  European region.

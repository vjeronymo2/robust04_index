"In  times of East-West detente, our people can no longer be told that military air  maneuvers must continue at their present extent," Spaeth said. Canada revealed  that the F-18 jets were involved in an interceptor flight, a simulated chase,  and said that such flights will be suspended pending an investigation.  </P></p>

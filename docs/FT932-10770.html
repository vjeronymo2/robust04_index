			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / City crime cut by armed road blocks ARMED road blocks and other anti-terrorist measures undertaken by the City of London police have contributed to a big reduction in crime in the Square Mile, Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner, said yesterday. He said that although the security measures failed to prevent last month's Bishopsgate bombing they had generated a significant spin-off in other areas. Crime in the City fell by 10.6 per cent last year, he said. The reduction so far this year was running at 16 per cent. The City is an unusually small force and comparisons are difficult, but last year's reduction in crime was the greatest in the country. Senior officers attribute it to high-profile armed road blocks mounted in the City since last year and the presence of more uniformed officers on the streets. Mr Kelly, presenting the force's annual report, said he was very disappointed that the Bishopsgate bombing had succeeded. However, he added that no police force other than the Royal Ulster Constabulary had made efforts as strong as the City's to prevent terrorism. City officers are particularly anxious to stress their force's effectiveness at present because Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is examining the future structure and organisation of the police service. There is concern that the Bishopsgate bombing might provoke the government into merging the City force with the much bigger Metropolitan Police in an effort to demonstrate that it is taking steps to improve security in the capital. The 800-strong City force was allowed to recruit an additional 36 officers after the Baltic Exchange bombing last year. A request for a further, larger increase in resources has been made following last month's Bishopsgate attack and Mr Kelly said he believed this would receive sympathetic consideration. The force's report shows a drop in the total amount of money obtained or attempted to be obtained by fraud from Pounds 946m in 1991 to Pounds 514m last year. It says Pounds 493m of the Pounds 514m was recovered or saved from attempted fraud. These figures do not include the as-yet unassessed losses from the BCCI, Maxwell and Wallace Smith Trust inquiries. Police reports of racial incidents in south-east London more than tripled in five years to reach 811 last year. Mr Charles Wardle, home office minister, said in reply to a written question from Mr Peter Bottomley, the Tory MP for Eltham, that the figures - covering the boroughs of Southwark, Lewisham, Bromley, Greenwich and Bexley - also show a doubling of incidents recorded between 1990 and 1992.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       SERIOUS FRAUD STATISTICS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1992           1991           1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- New crime investigations               85            105             62 Crime investigation carried forward from previous years           116             81             57 Miscellaneous inquiries on behalf of other agencies              163            225            191 Arrests                               129            155            119 Money obtained*                    pounds         pounds         pounds                                57,766,348     60,785,395     40,767,820 Money recovered*                   pounds         pounds         pounds                                36,206,834     50,085,191     32,819,618 Money attempted to be obtained*                          pounds         pounds         pounds                               456,892,506    886,054,142    417,529,658 Total money obtained and attempted to be obtained*          pounds         pounds         pounds                               514,658,854    946,839,537    458,297,478 Money recovered and saved from attempted fraud*              pounds         pounds         pounds                               493,099,340    936,139,333    450,349,276  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Excluding the Bank of Credit and Commerce International inquiry, the Maxwell inquiry and the collapse of the Wallace Smith Trust which are all yet to be assessed.

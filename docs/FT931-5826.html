			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Midlands attracts advice shops GOVERNMENT plans to set up a network of one-stop business advice centres have taken off better in some parts of the country than in others. If the locations of the business partnerships applying to run the centres is reflected in eventual contract awards, there will be a disproportionately large number of 'one-stop shops' in the Midlands and the north of England. The response in the south and the south-west has been less strong. Most of the partnerships are led by Training and Enterprise Councils, the employer-led bodies that deliver government training schemes in England and Wales. Interviews to select 15 pilot outlets, announced last December by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will begin shortly. The DTI has received a total of 57 applications. Mr Heseltine hopes the shops, which will eventually number 200, will revolutionise support for British companies. The outlets will bring together the business services of chambers of commerce, local authorities, local enterprise agencies and the DTI. Mr Heseltine has allocated Pounds 3.5m for the 'one-stop shops' from the Tecs' budgets and the government hopes that the services, many of which are now free, will be charged for. Mr Heseltine was asked in the Commons last year whether the pilots would be spread to represent regions of high business failures. He replied that the basis for choosing the successful bids would be 'one of quality'. The UK has received more US overseas direct investment since 1987 than any other country, a study said yesterday. Some 21 per cent of US overseas investment came to the UK, which also received 9 per cent of Japanese overseas direct investment, ahead of any country except the US. The study, by the Centre for Economics and Business Research on behalf of the CBI, shows that nearly a fifth of the Pounds 220bn invested in British industry since 1987 came from abroad.</p>

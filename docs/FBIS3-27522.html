A tense  situation that lasted more than 10 days was eventually  mitigated, and people might be able to relax a little. Public  opinion holds that Russia played an important role in settling  the Sarajevo crisis.    On 9 February, NATO issued an ultimatum demanding that the  Bosnian Serbs withdraw their heavy weapons from areas around  Sarajevo before the deadline; otherwise, NATO would launch air  strikes against their positions. After NATO issued the  ultimatum, Russia reacted rapidly. Foreign Minister Kozyrev  sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, explicitly  expressing Russia's opposition to the NATO action. Then, Russia  carried out a series of diplomatic activities, and reiterated  again and again its position on peacefully settling the conflict  in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the ambit of the United  Nations. On 15 February, Russian President Yeltsin pointed out  after meeting with British Prime Minister Major that Russia must  not be excluded from the process of settling the conflict in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. On 16 February, Russian Vice Foreign  Minister Churkin, as the Russian president's special envoy, flew  to Belgrade and continued to influence the Serb leaders and  conveyed to them President Yeltsin's new proposal on settling  the Bosnia crisis. The proposal not only satisfied the  requirements of the NATO ultimatum, but also gave a sense of  security to the Serbs and was acceptable to them. Russia's  mediation broke the impasse between the Serbs and NATO. On 17  February, Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic announced that they had  accepted Russia's new proposals on settling the crisis, and had  begun to withdraw their heavy weaponry in large quantities from  positions around Sarajevo. At the same time, Russia dispatched  400 troops stationed in Croatia to Sarajevo to participate in  the peacekeeping mission and to help supervise the Serb  withdrawal. On 20 February, President Yeltsin and President  Clinton reached an agreement in principle in a telephone  conversation, thus avoiding imminent air strikes.    Public opinion held that Russia opposed air strikes against  the Bosnian Serbs and played an active mediating role in the  Bosnia conflicts mainly due to the following considerations.  First, Russia held that the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina  could only be solved by political means, and air strikes would  only intensify the military conflict and damage the Bosnian  peace process. Second, air strikes would be NATO's first  military action outside its defensive sphere since its founding.  As the new European pattern has not yet taken form since the  end of the Cold War, Russia held that this event would be  extremely unfavorable to itself in strategic terms. Third, in  history, Russia has had its own interests in the Balkan  Peninsula. Russians and the Serbs are both Slavs, and both hold  the religious beliefs of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The two  nations have traditionally had close ties. If Russia sat idly  by and did not care about the Serbs mired in a predicament, its  influence in the Balkan Peninsula would be greatly weakened.    In the last two years, Russia has always tried to coordinate  its position with the Western countries in the course of  approaching problems in former Yugoslavia, and has sometimes  even made concessions. In May last year, the "Russian program"  for settling the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina was turned into  a "five-nation program" of Russia, the United States, Britain,  France, and Spain through consultations and compromises. This  was clear evidence of Russia's position. However, this time,  Russia resolutely opposed NATO's planned air strikes. The  foreign press held that this reflected Russia's new diplomatic  tendency.    After NATO set aside its air-strike plan, the Sarajevo  crisis  has temporarily eased, but the overall situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina remains extremely serious. However, people  have noticed that Russia and the United States have been more  deeply involved in mediating efforts, and Western European  countries such as Britain and France had also adjusted their own  policies to various degrees in the hope that Russia and the  United States would exert their influence on the Serbs and  Muslims. Therefore, it seems that a new ray of hope for the  prospect of a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  problem has appeared in people's minds after the end of the  Sarajevo crisis.</p>

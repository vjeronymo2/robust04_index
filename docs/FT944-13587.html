			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Accountants warned on ties to Tories The accountancy profession should distance itself from the Conservative party and the interests of the big firms, one of the six leading trade bodies has urged. The deputy chief executive of Cipfa, the public services accountancy institute, warned in a provocative speech that the profession was seen by many as 'overly political'. Mr Richard Morris said: 'The profession has a considerable number of Conservative MPs, tends to act through Conservative spokesmen, but not always, and this encourages its perception as being part of the establishment.' The speech acknowledges that efforts by the six professional bodies to agree reforms to the profession through the Bishop committee have 'stalled'. Coupled with recent moves by other professional bodies, the speech indicates a widespread belief that the committee is unable to break the deadlock over institutional reform. As a result Cipfa has decided to 'give new focus to the debate' by setting out some controversial issues. Cipfa, with members in both public and private sectors, has been deeply affected by government policies on privatisation within local government. Mr Morris told a conference at the University of Bristol that competition between the bodies was driving down standards because of the desire to increase financial resources and student numbers. He warned against the interests of the profession being aligned too closely to the big firms' commercial interests. 'The two are not the same and can be in direct conflict,' he said. On party political affiliation he said: 'This is not in the long-run interests of the profession, and it ought to be much more neutral in its political posture.' Mr Morris said that rising costs had forced the professional bodies to compete to generate income, and they had had to take on regulatory roles in conflict with the interests of their members. He attacked the 'conservative education and training policies' of the bodies and their reluctance to embrace change in the form of devolved or continuous assessment. 'They are reluctant to move down the NVQ route and they are reluctant to give authority over educational matters to other bodies which are specialists in education, such as universities.' With technical knowledge developing fast Mr Morris sees the need for regular assessment of the membership, say every five years, to ensure standards are maintained.</p>

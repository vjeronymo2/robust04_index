			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Plans to curb Thai military: Parliament votes to amend constitution as Suchinda is forced out THE THAI parliament moved hurriedly yesterday to amend the country's constitution, reducing the influence of the armed forces, after the weekend resignation of the prime minister, General Suchinda Kraprayoon. He was forced to quit over the killing of at least 46 pro-democracy demonstrators by troops last week. The amendments meet the demands of the opposition by requiring the prime minister to be an elected member of parliament, reducing the powers of the military-appointed senate, making the speaker of the elected house of representatives the parliament's president, and providing for two full sessions of the parliament each year instead of one. Gen Suchinda, the former supreme military commander, overthrew the elected government last year. He was chosen by the five pro-military parties which formed a government after elections in March. His whereabouts were unknown last night. Parliament yesterday passed the first reading of the amendment bill by 533 votes to nil, with nine absentions, and the second reading by a show of hands. The third and final reading is due on June 10. Although the vote was a victory for the pro-democracy movement, several issues arising from last week's violence have yet to be resolved. Opponents of the government are seeking to overturn an amnesty decreed by Gen Suchinda shortly before he resigned, because it covers not only the arrested demonstrators but also those responsible for the shooting of unarmed protesters. Pro-democracy activists are insisting that Gen Suchinda and his colleagues and relatives in the armed forces be tried for the action they took to suppress the demonstrations. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the parliament during yesterday's debate, chanting 'Where are the killers?' Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme military commander, and Gen Issarapong Noonpakdee, the army chief and Gen Suchinda's brother-in-law, were among those who failed to appear for the parliamentary session in their capacity as senators. Another unresolved issue is the identity of the new prime minister. Pro-democracy demonstrators are angry not merely with the military establishment but also with the government politicians who allowed the generals to do as they pleased last week. It is possible that the five-party governing coalition will collapse, paving the way for a prime ministerial candidate from one of the parties now in opposition.</p>

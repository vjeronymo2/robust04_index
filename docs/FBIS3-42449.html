Panyushkin, candidate of military sciences]    [Text]  <H5>  One Must Remember! </H5>   Successful crossing of a water obstacle is possible if:    1. Crossing of the first echelon on a wide front at the  required times is ensured.    2. Bridge crossings are prepared by no later than  H-hour+2.*    3. Crossings are prepared in a timely manner on routes of  movement and maneuver of troops with crossing capacities  corresponding to crossing capacities of troop routes.    4. Repeated duplication of crossings is accomplished.    5. Reserve of crossing forces and assets is allocated.    6. Measures for camouflage and concealment of crossings  are conducted.    7. Maneuver by crossing forces and assets is prepared.    The first two points pertain only to a forced crossing of a  water obstacle during the course of a counteroffensive  (offensive) engagement.    *On wide and large water obstacles, ferry (assault-ferry)  crossings with traffic capacities ensuring crossing within the  prescribed times may be set up instead of bridge crossings.    The methods are intended for consolidated calculation of  crossing several water obstacles in fighting and in dislocation  of troops.    The make it possible to determine the time for crossing  troops over a water obstacle, the time for constructing  low-level bridges and piling lines, and calculate the maneuver  of crossing forces and assets along the front (at one water  obstacle) and from one water obstacle to another.    A particular feature of these methods is the fact that they  make it possible to conduct the calculation without using  formulas, graphs, or nomographs based on pre-developed tables  contained in the attachment.    The chief of the engineer service may require the following  data to conduct the calculations:     -  what the battle formation of the large unit (unit) will be  before each water obstacle;    -  the average rate of advance or  required times for crossing of the large unit (unit);    -  the  characteristics of water obstacles on forced crossing sectors  and at spots where routes intersect a water obstacle;    -  the  distance of crossings from line of contact of the sides at the  staging area;    -  the types, number, characteristics, and locations  of existing crossings;    -  the types, number, characteristics, and  locations of crossings provided by the senior commander and also  the times for crossing them;    -  the supply of bridge structures by  the start of executing the mission and the possible pace of  their preparation or the available amount of lumber;    -  the forces  and assets allocated for preparing and maintaining the  crossings.       Before the chief of the engineer service begins the  calculation, he must take into account the recommendations which  if carried out will make it possible to ensure crossing of the  water obstacles by the troops.  <H3>  5.1. Methods of Consolidated Calculation of Crossing Water  Obstacles in an Counteroffensive (Offensive) Engagement </H3>   The calculation should be made in the following sequence.    5.1.1. Make the calculation of crossing the first water  obstacle from the forward edge of the defense. To do this,  determine:     -  the time required for crossing first- and second-echelon  subunits (Table 5.1);    -  the forces and assets that can be used on  a water obstacle, including taking into account a maneuver from  other areas (from other water obstacles):    -  the forces and assets  that must be distributed to prepare and maintain crossings at  the water obstacle and in reserve;    -  the time for constructing  low-level bridges and piling lines (tables 5.2 and 5.3).       In fact, after accomplishing this point, complexes of  crossings will be formed at forced crossing sectors and at  places where the routes intersect water obstacles. (A complex of  crossings includes the primary and several alternate crossing.)  The must be plotted on a work map.    Next, based on the availability of forces and assets, the  situation at hand, and the time of completing construction of  low-level bridges, determine the method of crossing troops  (assault-ferry-bridge or assault-ferry).    To do this, one must know the estimated time for crossing  first- and second-echelon units (tables 5.4 and 5.5). The same  tables can also be used to calculate the crossing of first- and  second-echelon large units having a battle formation depth of  15-18 km. In this case, the crossing time obtained using the  table must be increased 2-2.5-fold.    If the time obtained is greater than the required time and  the coefficient of mission performance is less than 0.8  (coefficient of mission performance is defined as the ratio of  the required crossing time to the estimated time) or  concentration of efforts is necessary on the axis of the main  thrust, redistribute forces and assets (taking into account the  possible maneuver of them along the front) (Table 5.6). Again,  determine the estimated time for crossing first-echelon large  units (units). The recalculation is accomplished until the  coefficient of mission performance reaches 0.8-1.0.    After this condition has been fulfilled and the bridge  crossings have been prepared in a timely manner (at least two or  three for an army or corps; at least one for a division,  brigade, or regiment), further calculation of crossing a water  obstacle may not have to be done--a formation, large unit, or  unit may execute the crossing at the required times.    5.1.2. Determine the time of free the crossing forces and  assets at the first obstacle.    If the time obtained is greater than the required time and  the coefficient of mission performance is less than 0.6  (coefficient of mission performance is defined as the ratio of  the time required for crossing to the estimated time) or it is  necessary to concentrate efforts on the axis of the main thrust,  redistribute the forces and assets taking into account the  possible maneuver of them along the front (Table 5.6).    5.1.3. Determine the time of freeing the crossing forces and  assets, making it possible to execute a maneuver to the next  water obstacle (Table 5.7).    5.1.4. Make a calculation of crossing subsequent water  obstacles (done similarly to the estimate of crossing the first  water obstacle) taking into account the maneuver of crossing  forces and assets from the previous water obstacle.    5.1.5. Allocate forces and assets for preparing and  maintaining crossings on routes lateral to the front.    The effect of crossing conditions differing from normal  (summer, daylight, lack of causes complicating the crossing) is  taken into account by the coefficients of conditions, the values  of which are given in Table 5.8.  <H3>  5.2. Methods of Consolidated Calculation of Crossing Water  Obstacles in a Defensive Engagement </H3>   It is recommended to perform the calculation in the  following  sequence.    5.2.1. Determine the necessary system of crossings with  reference to the hydrographic network in the defensive area and  the planned network of routes.    Determine the necessary degree of duplication of each  crossing in the defensive area. In doing so, it is recommended  to accomplish the following: On the main movement and maneuver  routes, at least a two-fold duplication; on routes of advance to  the line for executing a counterattack, duplication is at the  rate of one alternate crossing for two primary crossings.  Duplication may not have to be done on withdrawal routes from  the defensive area.    5.2.2. Make a calculation of crossing each water obstacle.  To  do this, determine:     -  the required capacities of crossings in accordance with  the capacities of the routes (roughly 200-250 units/hr for a  large unit and 100-200 units/hr for a unit);    -  the crossing forces  and assets, and distribute them for preparing and maintaining  complexes at the intersection of routes with the water obstacle  and to the reserve;    -  the time for constructing low-level bridges  and piling lines (tables 5.2 and 5.3);    -  the traffic capacities of  crossings being prepared (Table 5.9), compare them with the  required capacities, and if necessary redistribute forces and  assets taking into account the possibility of a maneuver from  other areas (Table 5.6).       5.2.3. If necessary, make a calculation of the maneuver of  crossing forces and assets to another water obstacle (Table 5.7).    5.2.4. Make a calculation of crossing the next water  obstacles (done similarly to the estimate of crossing the first  water obstacle).  <H3>  5.3. Methods of Consolidated Calculation of Crossing Water  Obstacles During Displacement of Troops </H3>   The calculation should be performed in the following  sequence.    5.3.1. Make the calculation of crossing the first of the  planned water obstacles. To do this, determine:     -  the required traffic capacities of the crossings in  accordance with the traffic capacities of the routes (roughly  200-250 units/hr for a large unit and 100-200 units/hr for a  unit);    -  the crossing forces, and distribute them for preparing  and maintaining crossing complexes at the intersection of routes  with the water obstacle in question and to the reserve (the  crossing complex includes a primary and several alternate  crossings);    -  the time for constructing low-level bridges and  piling lines (tables 5.2 and 5.3);    -  the traffic capacities of the  crossings being prepared (Table 5.9), compare them with the  required capacities, and (if necessary) redistribute the forces  and assets taking into account the possibility of a maneuver  from other areas (Table 5.6).       5.3.2. If necessary, make a calculation of the maneuver of  crossing forces and assets to the next water obstacle (Table  5.7) and use the column "Time Executing Maneuver").    5.3.3. Make a calculation of the crossing of subsequent  water  obstacles (done similarly to the calculation of the crossing of  the first water obstacle, taking into account the possible  maneuver of crossing forces and assets from one water obstacle  to another).    5.3.4. Allocate forces and assets for preparing and  maintaining crossings on routes lateral to the front.  <H5>  Attachment: Table for Calculating Crossing of Water Obstacles </H5>   Table 5.1.

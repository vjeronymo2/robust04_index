			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The morning of Bairam [Muslim holiday] in Bihac has  started with heavy artillery attacks by chetniks from the nearby  hills on all parts of the town, especially on Prekounje district  and the industrial zone, as well as on the suburbs. Shells were  fired from tanks, howitzers, and mortar-launchers. There is no  peace on the front lines either. Since early this morning shell  explosions and small-arms fire can be heard from this direction.    Fighters of the Bosnian Army's V Corps and members of the  Internal Affairs Ministry and the Croat Defense Council are  successfully repelling all attacks by aggressors who have been  trying to break through our fighters' defense lines for over a  month without success.    By the time of this report we have not received information  on any casualties in this morning's attack. The shelling of the  town and the suburbs stopped when NATO planes were seen flying  above. The same happened during the night when NATO planes were  swarming the skies above Bihac.    Muhamed Mulic reporting from Bihac for Bosnian Radio and TV.</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Estonia tightens rules for Moscow trade / Examine the new bureaucratic problems of Baltic commerce BACK IN the centrally planned days when Moscow had enough muscle and merchandise, it dictated all terms of trade with its compliant Soviet republics. Local companies got their orders from their ministries, which in turn received strict guidelines from Gosplan, the state planning ministry, on where, how much and the value of the merchandise they were going to trade. But now some republics, such as Estonia, are trying to break out from under the constraining wings of Moscow. Estonia is attempting to exercise its own control through the use of a licensing bureau monitoring which, and at what level, exports can leave its economic border. Other republics and smaller-scale districts are following the same pattern, such that one Bank of Estonia official described the USSR as being engulfed internally by a vast and complex amount of trade barriers: 'The USSR is becoming a country made up of many Albanias.' Estonia's year-old Licence Department, backed by the muscle of its customs officials, is an attempt to eliminate the danger of chronic shortages of commodities, as well as an expression of its desire to mark out greater political and economic autonomy from Moscow. Shortages of basic goods in Estonia have arisen, thanks to extreme differences in relative prices between the different republics of the Soviet Union. Thus it has become a profitable trade to buy in bulk from one republic at a relatively cheap price, and sell dear in a neighbouring republic. Items in greatest demand from Estonia include meat, sweets and other foodstuffs. In Latvia it is electronic equipment and vans, while in Lithuania it is refrigerators and television sets, according to Mr Rein Voog, an official with the Bank of Estonia. 'A person can become rich very fast if he trades in the USSR. For example, if you can buy meat in Estonia and take it to Leningrad you can make a lot of money since meat in Leningrad is twice as expensive. This is why (Estonia) must keep a certain degree of control over what leaves the country,' said Mr Voog. To make sure no-one empties a market at the - by western and black-market standards - ridiculously low regulated prices, republics like Estonia have issued their inhabitants with a purchasing card. A Latvian cannot, for example, buy meat at an Estonian market. Mr Voog admits that trade with the west is much easier than within the Soviet Union, since the rules are clear and simple to follow. Estimpex, which has lost its monopoly as the sole Estonian export organisation, still functions. The Bank of Estonia official felt that for some companies it may be easier to do business with Estimpex, which is known in some business circles in the west. It may also be easier to get an export licence through Estimpex. Since Gosplan has been undermined by the unstable economic situation in the USSR and by inefficient price controls, Soviet republics such as Estonia have established barter committees, state-run bodies, to carry out trade with other republics. The export quotas of the Estonian barter committee are regulated by the Licence Department. Mr Mati Jurgens, general-director of the Estonian Licence Department, says it granted 1,700 export licences last year, and will double that in 1991. Most of the licences are for furniture and building materials. About 60 per cent went to Russia, the rest to the Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania. Each barter deal between the Estonian and other Soviet republic barter committees is done on a case-by-case basis. There are no standard ratios or values which the Estonian barter committee uses or agreements on which value a certain commodity will have. These factors are determined by forces of 'demand' and 'what is in great shortage', according to Mr Jurgens. If a company's export papers are in order, getting an export licence should take no longer than 15 days. 'A recent barter deal we approved with Russia involved an Estonian furniture company, which purchased the steel to build the chairs. These chairs were sold back to Russia for 70 roubles a piece,' explained Mr Jurgens. Other examples of trade can involve cash roubles. An Estonian state, collective or co-operative farm may need to buy a tractor. According to Mr Jurgens, the seller of the tractor may ask as much as 30,000 roubles for such a vehicle or two tons of meat in payment. Arguing over the price of the meat, they may agree on 10 roubles a kilo, which would add up to 20,000 roubles' worth of meat. The remaining 10,000 roubles could be paid in cash. Mr Jurgens says there are still staffing problems in effectively controlling Estonia's economic borders. A great deal of merchandise is getting out without official permission; the Estonian-Latvian customs checkpoint at the small town of Moisakula has one local policeman on patrol, who has permission to use a revolver. One can cross the Estonian-Latvian border on the smaller roads without being stopped by any customs officials.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Iran to pay British creditors Iran's central bank will soon begin making overdue payments to British creditors, Iran's official news agency Irna said yesterday. Irna quoted a source at the central bank as saying debts of up to Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,000) would be repaid immediately and payments involving bigger amounts would start in coming weeks. Iran chalked up more than Dollars 10bn in foreign debt arrears by the start of this year after weak oil prices lowered its income. It rescheduled Dollars 8bn of the debt in agreements with its creditors led by Germany and Japan.</p>

			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Ministers face spending squeeze to meet targets THE Treasury will tell cabinet ministers this week that there must be sharp cuts in departmental spending programmes if the government is to meet its stated targets for public expenditure in the next financial year. Negotiations over the government's 1993-94 spending programme will start at a meeting of the cabinet's public expenditure committee, which convenes for the first time on Thursday. Ministers have already said they will keep to the Pounds 244.5bn planning total for government expenditure set out in the Budget in March. But since then the economy has grown more slowly than the government expected, and the rise in the numbers claiming unemployment benefit will take a larger share of the public purse than forecast. Thursday's meeting, to be chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be held against a background of rising concern about the immediate prospects for the UK economy. Many UK economic indicators are due out this week, all of them likely to underline the weakness in the UK economy. Ministers are bracing themselves for another sharp rise in unemployment when the latest statistics are released on Thursday. July's industrial production figure, due out on the same day, is likely to show a modest upturn at best. As ministers prepare to divide up the public expenditure planning total for next year, they have been told to expect a tough squeeze on public sector pay. A final pay norm has not yet been set, but the expected fall in UK inflation over the next year could mean average public sector pay rises are about 2 per cent in 1993-94. A severe squeeze on public investment in housing, roads, the inner cities and other construction projects is also expected. Some of the projects that have been under Treasury review - including a three-year programme to invest Pounds 7bn in motorways and trunk roads - appear-ed as pledges in the Conservative manifesto. But the Treasury is arguing that nothing can be immune from scrutiny because of the threat to the economy posed by soaring public debt. Anthony Harris, Page 21 Currencies, Page 29</p>

			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / John Smith hurt while climbing Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, has severely damaged the ligaments in his right ankle and has cancelled his engagements for the coming week, his office announced yesterday. He injured himself while climbing in the Scottish Highlands on Wednesday. He will be unable to attend the Commons this week. In 1988, Mr Smith suffered a severe heart attack from which he appears to have made a complete recovery. Since then Mr Smith has taken to climbing in the Highlands - particularly the 'Munro' mountains, those over 3,000 feet. He slipped in the snow while climbing with friends his 108th Munro, Eididh nan Clach Geala, in Wester Ross. The name means 'web of white stones'.</p>

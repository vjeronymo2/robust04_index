			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 TIPS FOR BETTER BARBECUE: PATIENCE, PRACTICE AND PREPARATION  </P> <P> Chef Buddy Hungerford recalls the time that a friend tried to barbecue a whole  pork butt and wound up with a bonfire instead.  </P> <P> It was "one of those (get-togethers) where you're cooking outside and drinking  inside and you go back out and your barbecue's afire," Hungerford says with a  laugh. Pork butt is a fatty cut of meat and "the fat just dripped right down in  the charcoals and (ignited). We had to get the fire extinguisher."  </P> <P> Not all barbecue mistakes are this spectacular, but many back-yard chefs find  barbecuing a hit-and-miss proposition (anyone who has suffered through raw  hamburgers or steaks charred beyond recognition can testify that it is not an  easily mastered art).  </P> <P> That is why the experts say that those who are really serious about barbecuing  need to remember the three "Ps" -- patience, practice and preparation.  </P> <P> "Let's say we have a standard barbecue at home, that we're going to do chicken  breasts," says Hungerford, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and  executive chef at Caliente in Irvine.  </P> <P> A common error is to jump the gun, he says, to start before the fire has cooled  properly or to bathe the raw meat in sauce. Hungerford says the fire -- whether  gas or charcoal -- should be a medium heat, not too hot to hold your hand over  for 5 to 10 seconds. And to avoid burning, the chicken breasts should be cooked  at least a minute on each side before any sauce is applied.  </P> <P> He says a general rule of thumb is to apply barbecue sauce only once during  cooking, either halfway through the process or at the end, and to apply it  sparingly. Extra sauce can always be served on the side.  </P> <P> (Many cooks sidestep all the problems by baking the chicken beforehand,  marinating it in barbecue sauce and using the barbecue grill to singe and heat  before serving.)  </P> <P> Jim Traywick, general manager of R.J.'s The Rib Joint in Newport Beach and a  connoisseur of the Southern-style barbecue of his youth, stresses the  importance of patience.  </P> <P> "Cook it slow and low," Traywick says. "We cook our ribs here at 250 degrees  for 3 1/2 hours. To get the true Southern barbecue, you need that longer period  of time to get the meat to be tender and to have the smoky flavor that you  want."  </P> <P> He points out that meat dries when cooked at high temperatures while slow  cooking produces a self-basting process that keeps it moist.  </P> <P> Learning how to regulate a fire is a key to successful barbecues, the experts  agree. Traywick suggests purchasing an inexpensive oven thermometer (available  in most grocery stores) and using it to monitor charcoal temperature, adding  coals as needed.  </P> <P> He also recommends a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of  poultry, inserting it into the thickest part of the chicken or turkey and being  careful not to touch bone. "Once it reaches 160 degrees, it's done," he said.  </P> <P> Christian Rassinoux, who began cooking in his native Paris, France, and is now  executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, prefers to test the doneness  of meat by practiced touch.  </P> <P> "If the meat is very soft," he says, "the meat will be rare. If it's harder, it  will be medium, and if it has a hard touch, it's well done.  </P> <P> "On chicken, I would suggest that if you are not sure of the result, make an  incision in it. If you see some blood coming out, that means the chicken is not  done."  </P> <P> Rassinoux notes that many people have difficulty barbecuing fish, which he says  requires "a very, very clean barbecue," a hot fire and brushing the fish  lightly with oil to prevent sticking.  </P> <P> "It's also better for fish to have the skin on," he says, "unless you have a  thick steak of bass or halibut or tuna."  </P> <P> (Another method of preventing the fish from sticking to the grill is to place  the fish on aluminum foil on the grill for a few minutes and then slip the foil  out.)  </P> <P> Rassinoux points out that the time it takes for the coals to cool down also  allows the starter fluid to fully dissipate. He suggests you wait at least 30  minutes before you put the food on the grill.  </P> <P> And if it's a distinctive flavor you want, he recommends sprinkling a few fresh  herbs, such as rosemary, on the coals, or using mesquite or hickory chunks or  chips in the fire.  </P> <P> The chips, which can be used with charcoal or gas barbecues, should be soaked  in water for an hour, put in a shallow dish or pan and placed on the cooler  side of the fire and not directly under the meat, Traywick says. They will  slowly smolder and give meat a smoked flavor.  </P> <P> Marinades also can provide zesty flavor, in addition to acting as tenderizers  when the meat is left in them for 24 hours.  </P> <P> Rassinoux recommends a simple marinade of olive oil, fresh herbs, onion and a  touch of sherry, or perhaps olive oil with roast garlic, lemon, thyme or  rosemary.  </P> <P> For many people, barbecue just isn't barbecue without sauce, and practice and  preference are what's important here.  </P> <P> "In California," Traywick says, "people tend to lean a little more toward the  sweeter barbecue." He suggests taking a "store-bought" sauce and experimenting  by adding honey, orange juice, onions, pickle relish or even chocolate --  whatever appeals to your taste buds.  </P> <P> He also suggests reading "The All-American Barbecue Book" ($8.95, Vintage  Press) by Rich Davis and Shifra Stein.  </P> <P> Of all the barbecue books he owns, this is Traywick's favorite because it gives  a comparison survey of how barbecue differs from region to region across the  country and includes different sauces. "And it's got recipes from some of the  most famous barbecue houses in the United States," he says.  </P></p>

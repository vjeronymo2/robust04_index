			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AIDS DISCRIMINATION BAN REJECTED IN O.C.  </P> <P> In a 3-2 vote before a tense and emotional crowd, the Orange County Board of  Supervisors on Tuesday rejected a proposed ordinance that would ban  discrimination against AIDS victims, making Orange County the only urban area  in California without such a measure.  </P> <P> The vote capped an 18-month study by the county's HIV Advisory Committee that  concluded the ordinance was necessary to reduce the spread of acquired immune  deficiency syndrome by making its victims more likely to seek treatment.  </P> <P> The measure, which would prohibit discrimination against people with AIDS in  the areas of housing, employment or county services, was also endorsed by the  county's health officer and the Health Care Agency. Supporters of the measure  left the meeting disappointed.  </P> <P> "I think the pressure from the squeaky wheels overcame common sense and  sanity," said Pearl Jemison-Smith, chairwoman of the advisory committee. "We  are behind in Orange County. Here, AIDS is a four-letter word."  </P> <P> The opposition was led by Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Anaheim-based Traditional  Values Coalition, which mailed more than 1,000 letters to its members urging  that they show up for Tuesday's meeting.  </P> <P> More than 150 people attended the session, including the vocal anti-homosexual  Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and the acknowledged homosexual Laguna  Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry. The supervisors heard nearly three hours of  sometimes sobbing and strident testimony from a total of 36 speakers -- 21  against the ordinance -- before they voted as insiders had predicted on Monday.  </P> <P> "I support the fears and concerns of those opposed to the ordinance -- it is a  fear of the unknown," said Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who joined Supervisor  Thomas F. Riley in supporting the measure. "(But) I'm concerned about the  spread of the disease. I'm concerned about ignorance spreading the disease."  </P> <P> All three of the supervisors voting against the ordinance -- Gaddi H. Vasquez,  Don R. Roth and Roger R. Stanton -- said they believe that existing state and  federal laws already protect AIDS victims from discrimination.  </P> <P> "I have tasted discrimination, and it is a very bitter taste," Vasquez told the  audience. "This is not a matter of whether you are for or against  discrimination. I am concerned about the duplicity of laws."  </P> <P> Roth added: "My record is very clear as a public official -- that is, I oppose  discrimination. But in good conscience, I cannot give favor to one group over  another."  </P> <P> Politically, it was a sensitive issue for a board that is composed of five  conservative Republicans and almost always casts unanimous votes. Some  supporters of the issue attributed the vote to the strength of right-wing  politics in Orange County.  </P> <P> Riley said: "You and I both know . . . Orange County is certainly more  conservative" than other urban counties. "I think being conservative, it's a  little more difficult perhaps to (vote with) a more open . . . sense of  responsibility."  </P> <P> Wieder said after the vote: "It's kind of unfortunate that Orange County has to  always be the recalcitrant. It's only substantiating an image of Orange County  that really has been changing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Urban Status, . . . Problems"  </P> <P> "I thought that we'd grown up, that we'd achieved urban status with urban  problems and we'd recognize this thing (differently)."  </P> <P> Wieder, who recently announced her bid for reelection, said she hopes that her  vote will not hurt her politically. "I would hope that my constituency would  have faith in my integrity."  </P> <P> Dr. Don Hagan, a representative on the HIV Advisory Committee from the Orange  County Medical Assn., said: "Two or three of the votes came out of fear of a  very vocal religious minority. I think the vocal response from the religious  right is very loud in Orange County."  </P> <P> Still, Hagan and Smith said that after 18 months of work, the advisory  committee will not give up its goal of an anti-discrimination ordinance for  people with AIDS. They said they will talk with the opposing supervisors about  the possibility of supporting another version of the measure.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possibility of New Vote  </P> <P> Vasquez seemed to leave open such a possibility when he said shortly before his  vote that he cannot support the measure "in its present form." Vasquez was not  specific about what changes he considers necessary. And afterward, he said that  the possibility of changing his vote is "slight."  </P> <P> "I will be glad to listen to the committee without making any commitments," he  said. "I don't think there is much difference in the concerns we all have about  the AIDS crisis."  </P> <P> Specifically, the ordinance would have prohibited discrimination against people  with AIDS or those "perceived" to carry the AIDS virus in the areas of housing,  employment or county services.  </P> <P> The ordinance said that an employer may not fire or decline to hire a person  because he or she has AIDS, that a landowner cannot terminate a housing  agreement or change a property transaction because a person carries AIDS and  that people with AIDS will have complete access to all public county services.  </P> <P> "In order to encourage persons to fully utilize such (health care) services so  that this condition can be diagnosed and treated and the risk of transmission  to others can be reduced, it is necessary that discrimination against persons  with AIDS or AIDS-related conditions be clearly prohibited," the ordinance  reads.  </P> <P> Even if it had been passed by the supervisors, the ordinance would only have  applied to the unincorporated areas of the county.  </P> <P> In preparing the proposed ordinance, the county's advisory committee reviewed  similar measures that have been adopted in California's five largest counties,  excluding Orange. They are Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Riverside and  Alameda.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County supervisors adopted their ordinance in February, on a 3-2  vote when Supervisor Deane Dana broke with his two Republican colleagues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gay Life Style Criticized  </P> <P> Much of Tuesday's testimony from opponents of the ordinance linked AIDS with  homosexual behavior and criticized the gay life style.  </P> <P> "I demand that you take a stand to protect us from this onslaught that would  try to destroy the church . . . and try to pervert the rest of us," said Steve  Goodyear, who called himself a father and an "extremely concerned citizen."  </P> <P> Another speaker, who said she represents the Concerned Women for America, said:  "It seems to us that this is a form of reverse discrimination. The rights of  the few have superseded the rights of the majority. We believe we are facing a  severe threat to our population and its institutions."  </P> <P> Dannemeyer suggested that this type of ordinance would have far-reaching  ramifications, such as the possibility that doctors would not be able to wear  masks and gloves when they treat AIDS patients, that insurance carriers would  not be able to distinguish the greater health risks for those with AIDS and  that blood banks could be forced to accept contaminated blood.  </P> <P> "If we grant this ordinance, someone will say you must accept my blood into the  blood supply of this country," Dannemeyer said.  </P> <P> County Counsel Adrian Kuyper corrected Dannemeyer's statement, however,  repeating that the ordinance is limited to discrimination in employment,  housing and county services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Church Support Cited  </P> <P> Speaking in favor of the ordinance, retired Rev. John M. Krumm of St. Paul's  Episcopal Church in Tustin said he has discussed AIDS with religious leaders  throughout Southern California and found support for the measure from the Roman  Catholic bishops of California, the Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, the  Methodist bishop of Southern California and the Presbyterian Church in Orange  County.  </P> <P> "For me and many others in our society, the traditional values that are  important in this present health care crisis are compassion and care, healing  and help," Krumm said.  </P> <P> "If this ordinance is defeated, the vast majority of religiously affiliated  people of this county and this state will want to know why Orange County . . .  is not willing to give this assistance to the health agencies as they seek to  conquer . . . this disease."  </P> <P> Mayor Gentry, who interrupted his testimony when he was overcome by emotion in  discussing the AIDS death of his live-in partner, said Laguna Beach has already  adopted an anti-discrimination ordinance for people with AIDS that has been  helpful to businesses and residents.  </P> <P> "In our community, when someone is ill, we don't subject them to  discrimination," he said. "The virus is -- yes -- dangerous. The fear is more  dangerous."  </P> <P> TURNING THE TIDE -- Church group helps defeat ordinance. Part II, Page 1.  </P></p>

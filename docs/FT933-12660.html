			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US arms dealer to third world The US became the largest seller of arms to the third world last year, while the overall sales of armaments to that market decreased, Aaron Lewis reports from Washington. A study by the Congressional Research Service said the US was responsible for 57 per cent, compared with Russia's 9 per cent. Worldwide weapons sales reflected Russia's reduced performance totalling only Dollars 23.9bn last year, Dollars 4.7bn less than in 1991. The third world, in particular, has imported fewer weapons in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. This affected in particular Vietnam, Cuba and Syria.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY DINNER  </P> <P> As President Reagan neared the end of his farewell address he offered today's  youth ". . . lesson No. 1 about America. All great change in America begins at  the dinner table. So tomorrow night in the kitchen I hope the talking begins.  And children, if your parents haven't been teaching you what it means to be an  American, let them know. . . ."  </P> <P> As I listened to this instruction, the thought occurred to me that the  President was not in tune with the American family today. His view of the  entire family gathering night at the dinner table is more consistent with the  Ozzie and Harriet era than the day of microwaves and fast food. I thought that  it would be interesting to inquire into family dinner practices by asking my  high school American history students. I teach 16 and 17 year olds in the  middle-class community of West Covina.  </P> <P> The day after the address I asked the 121 students who came to class to tell me  if they ate dinner with their parents on a regular basis. Even I was surprised  when only 33 indicated that they ate as a family. If you eliminate the 11 who  ate in a family environment from my 22 advanced placement students, the figures  are even more striking. Of the 99 students present in my four average classes,  only 22 indicated a regular family dinner experience.  </P> <P> I agree with Reagan's belief that "we've got to teach history based not on  what's in fashion but what's important." If we forget what we did we won't know  who we are." But if the President believes that the evening meal will provide  the setting for the transfer of the "American memory" to today's youth he is  sadly mistaken. That important responsibility appears to be left to the public  school teachers of American history.  </P> <P> NORMAN SILVEY  </P> <P> Pomona  </P></p>

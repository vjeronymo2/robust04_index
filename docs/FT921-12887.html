			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Defence costs Macarthy Pounds 3m COSTS OF Pounds 3.12m were incurred by Macarthy, the retailer and pharmaceutical manufacturer, in defending itself against three separate bids last year. The amount was included in a Pounds 3.26m extraordinary charge for the year to September 28. The sum compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.31m (Pounds 4.61m), a rise of 15 per cent, at the higher end of City forecasts. The company faced bids from Lloyds Chemists, the chemists chain, UniChem, the pharmaceuticals wholesaler and Grampian, the Scottish mini-conglomerate. The first two were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, on which decisions are still waited, while Grampian's bid attracted only an 11 per cent take up. Mr Ian Parsons, chief executive, said that profits rose in spite of the group being in various discussions with potential bidders during almost all of the second half. Earnings per share were 13.8p (11.6p). Macarthy is proposing a 33 per cent cut in the final dividend to 5p (7.5p) for a total 20 per cent down at 10p (12.5p). Mr Parsons said that the 1990 dividend had been based on an assumption that the economy would recover. The reduced dividend provided for cover of 1.4 times. Turnover for the year fell from Pounds 372.6m to Pounds 206.5m after the disposal of the pharmaceutical wholesale business. Sales for continuing businesses rose by 6 per cent. Its over-the-counter retailing business and the retail healthfood business both suffered from the downturn in spending as the UK recession deepened. The veterinary products division increased sales by 11 per cent and turned a Pounds 164,000 loss into an operating profit of Pounds 580,000. Pharmaceutical products also put in a resilient performance with operating profits up 41 per cent to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 2.6m). Steps had been taken to reduce costs by several hundred thousand pounds, including some redundancies. Borrowings of Pounds 16m at the year end give gearing of 60 per cent. COMMENT Uncertainty, high costs and a damaging effect on staff morale, not to mention the impact on business plans, can all be pointed to as adverse effects on Macarthy of last year's series of bids. But on the brighter side, all the attention from its suitors may have been the necessary trigger to spur the company into getting its house in order. Macarthy itself admits that the previous dividend was based on overly optimistic assumptions, but the decision to cut the dividend this year must have taken some serious talking, not to mention courage, particularly as Macarthy is, in effect, still in a bid situation. That decision seems sensible, given the group's uncomfortably high gearing. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.5m this year, makes for a prospective multiple of nearly 17, which is high, unless bid activity is revived. Given that, based on fundamentals, a more appropriate multiple would be about 12, it seems worth waiting for the MMC to make up its mind.</p>

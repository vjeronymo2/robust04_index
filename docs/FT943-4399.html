			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia's planners ride the fast lane - The government is willing to take risks with ambitious projects Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, yesterday declared open one of south-east Asia's most ambitious infrastructure projects - an 848km expressway stretching the length of the Malaysian peninsula, from the border with Thailand in the north to the causeway to Singapore in the south. Called the north-south highway, it is looked on with pride by Malaysia's planners. The highway is a vital artery that should relieve transport bottlenecks and promote economic growth not only within Malaysia but between neighbouring countries of Asean (the Association of South-East Asian Nations). It is Malaysia's first big privatised infrastructure project, built without massive government funds and likely to be finished well ahead of schedule. But there is another side to the highway story. The original cost of the project was put at MDollars 3.45bn (Dollars 1.34bn). Cost overruns have resulted in a final bill of nearly twice that amount. Steep increases in toll charges have angered motorists and led to charges of 'highway robbery' against the company managing the expressway. There have been criticisms that some work on the highway is below standard: only months after opening, some sections are under repair. Over the next four years the Malaysian government plans to spend more than MDollars 40bn on various infrastructure projects. By the end of the century that figure is likely to rise to more than MDollars 70bn. New infrastructure is urgently needed to cope with pressures arising from six years of 8 per cent-plus economic growth. What staggers planners from elsewhere - and sharpens appetites of the world's construction companies and financiers - is that these projects are not being phased over a lengthy period. They are all in progress now, or are about to happen. On Wednesday, Malaysia lifted a ban on government contracts for British companies. The ban was imposed in February in retaliation for British media reports hinting at corruption in senior levels of the Malaysian government. British companies have been among the most active in trying to win a share of Malaysia's large infrastructure cake. Malaysia has been a pioneer in south-east Asia in pushing ahead the privatisation process. Dr Mahathir's government has made clear it expects the private sector, rather than the state, to be the main mover behind infrastructure development. Malaysia has enthusiastically adopted the build-operate-transfer (BOT) concept. Local companies, most in joint ventures with foreign partners, are being told to build their projects, raise the bulk of their own finance and operate facilities for 20 or 25 years, recouping money by imposing tolls or other charges. With electricity demand increasing at 14 per cent a year, Malaysia has been faced with power shortages. To relieve the burden on Tenaga Nasional, the partially privatised power utility, the government has invited local companies, in joint ventures with foreign concerns, to construct power stations on a BOT basis. These companies, termed independent power producers (IPPs), are already building five large power plants with a total price tag approaching MDollars 10bn. Siemens, British Gas, Asea Brown Boveri and John Brown are among foreign companies involved. Much the same principle is behind other infrastructure projects, ranging from a MDollars 10bn international airport south of Kuala Lumpur to a MDollars 2bn light railway system in the capital and a MDollars 6bn national sewerage scheme. Malaysia is considering applying the BOT concept to a university it plans to open in a joint venture with the University of London. Private developers will build a campus in Kuala Lumpur and recoup costs through student charges. Infrastructure has caught the imagination of the local stock market. Malaysian companies rumoured to be in line for infrastructure projects have seen a sharp rise in their shares prices. But amid all the euphoria there are question marks over the direction of Malaysian policy. Much of the planning associated with projects is built on the premise that the country will continue to have soaring economic growth. A downturn could bring serious problems to the companies involved, with revenues from completed projects not matching costs. Political connections often seem to have been the most important factor in granting infrastructure projects to local companies. In 1988 the Renong Group, then directly owned by Dr Mahathir's United Malays National Organisation, won the privatisation contract for the north-south highway. Renong has subsequently won a wide range of other multi- million dollar infrastructure contracts, ranging from a new bridge linking Malaysia and Singapore to a MDollars 555m contract to build a new stadium complex for the 1998 Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Kuala Lumpur. Competitors say tender procedures are often ignored. Privatisation and BOT arrangements on infrastructure projects are new ideas, even in the west. There are doubts whether Malaysia has the necessary supervisory apparatus to monitor both the construction and operation of such a vast array of projects. Consumers might raise objections to relatively high charges likely to be charged on facilities like the Kuala Lumpur light railway. Serious problems on such an issue have recently arisen over a BOT road scheme in Bangkok. There are doubts whether the capital markets, domestic or international, will be willing to risk ploughing such large sums into one area of the economy, without government guarantees. Local banks recently signed loan agreements worth MDollars 5.6bn to finance three independent power projects. Some financiers feel such focused lending is imprudent: it could also put a squeeze on funding for other areas of economic activity. Critics say some projects are more for prestige than economic necessity. A company in Sarawak, east Malaysia, with no previous experience in the power sector, has been given preliminary approval to build a MDollars 15bn dam, nearly twice the height of the Aswan dam in Egypt. The project not only involves building a dam in a jungle area: an underwater power cable will transfer the power to peninsular Malaysia via a 650km underwater cable - a technical job never attempted before. Dr Mahathir and his government have shown they are not afraid of risks. 'The ability to learn from failures is as critical as the lessons from the success of any experiment,' Dr Mahathir told an infrastructure conference earlier this week. 'The right approach seems to be to marry boldness with realism.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         MDollars bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Paka, Pasir Gudang             2.60 Kuala Langat                   1.80 N.

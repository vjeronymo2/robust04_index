The Implementation of the 1993 Plan    In 1993, the national economy of the whole province, on the  basis of the relatively fast growth of the previous year,  continued to maintain a good momentum. After the implementation  of Document No 6 of the Central Committee in particular, the  increasingly tense economic environment was improved, the pace  of economic construction was accelerated, the strength of reform  and opening up increased, various social undertakings were  vigorously developed, and the annual plan of the main sectors of  the national economy was basically fulfilled or overfulfilled.  The domestic gross output value of the whole year was 186.6  billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent, of which the tertiary  industry increased by 12.3 percent. The gross output value of  the industrial and agricultural production was 366.53 billion  yuan (334.07 billion yuan as calculated according to the  constant prices in 1990), an increase of 26.8 percent. They  were respectively 3.8, 0.3, and 15.4 percentage points higher  than the requirements of the annual plan.    1. The rural economy developed steadily and township and  town enterprises grew at a high speed. Last year, despite  natural disasters, a relatively good harvest was reaped in  agriculture through the common efforts of the whole province.  The total grain output of the whole province was 43 million  tonnes, 1.311 million tonnes less than the previous year. The  number of hogs marketed was 67.38 million, 1.38 million more  than the previous year. Trees were satisfactorily planted over  5.34 million mu of land, which greatly exceeded the targeted  area of the plan. The situation of a higher rate of  tree-felling than tree-planting began to change. Some 3.15  million mu of medium- and low-yield fields were transformed, 5.1  percent more than the requirement of the annual plan. The  township and town enterprises developed at a high speed. Their  total annual output value was 191.87 billion yuan, 95 percent  over the previous year. The income from sales and profits and  taxes increased simultaneously. The momentum of rural laborers  going out of the province was good. The annual gross output  value of agriculture was 84.59 billion yuan (81.1 billion yuan  as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), 1.5  percent over the previous year.    2. The reform of enterprises was continuously deepened,  industrial production grew at a high speed, and the economic  results were improving. Our province thoroughly implemented the  "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Changing the  Operational Mechanism of Enterprises Under the Ownership of the  Whole People," emphatically grasped the work of changing the  operational mechanisms of 2,000 enterprises, and selected 22  large and medium-sized state enterprises for carrying out  experiments on the establishment of the modern enterprise  system. Industrial production maintained rapid growth  throughout the whole year. The gross output value of industry  of the whole province was 281.94 billion yuan (252.97 billion  yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an  increase of 37.8 percent, of which industries at or above the  township level accounted for 212.61 billion yuan (181.39 billion  yuan as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990), an  increase of 20.9 percent. They were respectively 22.8 and 8.9  percentage points higher than the requirements of the annual  plan. The output of major industrial products increased by  varying degrees and the annual plans for them were  overfulfilled. Production was basically in keeping with  marketing and the annual marketing rate of products reached 96.1  percent. The economic results of enterprises were improving.  The total amount of profits of local state-run industrial  enterprises included in the provincial budget was 77 percent  higher than the previous year and the growth of profits and  taxes was 43.7 percent.    3. The investment structure was readjusted to some extent  and the construction of key projects was strengthened. Last  year the increase in the investment in fixed assets of our  province was relative big, the number of newly started projects  was reduced, the investment structure was further readjusted,  and the work of key construction projects was carried out in a  down-to-earth manner. It is estimated that 50.6 billion yuan of  investment in fixed assets of the whole society in the whole  year was completed, 24.8 percent over the previous year. In  accordance with the requirements of the central authorities on  strengthening macroregulation and control in investment in fixed  assets, our province seriously checked up on invested projects  under construction and arranged them into different categories.  We ensured the construction of the most important ones and  increased the speed of construction of key projects. With  efforts during the past year, most of the key construction  projects in Sichuan progressed smoothly and some of them were  completed and put into operation.    4. Great efforts were made to strengthen market building and  urban and rural markets were stable and tended to become brisk.  Last year, emphasis was made on grasping the reform of the  circulation structure and the building of the market system and  markets of various kinds developed to a varying degrees. Efforts  were made to develop urban and rural markets and to meet the  purchase demands of the residents. The supply of consumers'  commodities was abundant across the province. The annual social  commodity retail sale volume amounted to 85.46 billion yuan,  18.8 percent over the previous year and exceeding the  requirement of the annual plan. Following reforms in housing,  medical service, education, and the social security system, the  noncommodity consumption of the residents increased to a  relatively great extent.    5. The province was opened wider to the outside world and  progress of a breakthrough nature was made in attracting foreign  businessmen and capital. The annual import and export volume  was $2.916 billion, 32.6 percent over the previous year, of  which the export volume was $1.65 billion, an increase by 11  percent. The total volume of border trade was 750 million yuan,  74.4 percent over the previous year. The establishment of 1,910  additional foreign- invested enterprises were approved in the  whole year and agreements involving the introduction of $2.4  billion were signed. The direction of foreign investment also  began to shift from ordinary industries to capital-intensive and  technology-intensive industries, basic industries such as power  industry, transportation, and telecommunication, and technical  transformation of large and medium-sized enterprises.    6. The work related to financial revenue was satisfactorily  carried out and the financial order was improved to some extent.  The annual revenue amounted to 20.14 billion yuan, an increase  of 37.1 percent. In view of the drastic fall in bank savings  and abnormal cash inputs in the first half of the year,  governments at all levels seriously implemented various measures  concerning the strengthening of macroregulation control put  forward by the central authorities and the province, resolutely  consolidated the financial order, made great efforts to pool  funds, seized the opportunity to grant more loans, readjusted  the credit structure, and ensured the needs of economic  development and key construction projects of our province are  met.    7. The science, education, and other social sectors were  strengthened and the living standard of the people was further  improved. Last year, with the support of state departments  concerned, our province undertook 180 key state projects and 55  key projects included in the provincial plan to turn  achievements in science and technology into productive forces.  Good results were made in different stages in most of the  projects and they produced good economic results in production.  Through making great efforts to enhance technical progress, the  ability of enterprises to develop technology with their own  resources and to digest and absorb technology was greatly  increased. Greater importance was attached to education, the  input into education by the whole society continued to increase,  the quality of education was improved, and benefits from running  schools also increased to some extent. The speed of the  development of ordinary middle school education and tertiary  education increased markedly and the scale of enrollment was  enlarged.    People's living standards continuously improved and their  living conditions also improved to some extent. Urban and rural  construction developed steadily. Medical service and public  health work further developed and, in particular, the rural  sanitary conditions were improved to some extent. Family  planning was considerably strengthened and the rate of the  annual natural population growth was 9.57 per thousand. At the  same time, various social undertakings such as culture, arts,  radio, television, the press, publication, employment, tourism,  and sports, developed by varying degrees.    8. The economy and society of areas inhabited by minority  nationalities developed comprehensively. Last year, areas  inhabited by minority nationalities in our province further  emancipated their minds, made greater efforts in reform and  opening up, overcame various difficulties in economic life, and  maintained a good situation of a relatively fast development of  the national economy and social stability. The domestic gross  output value of areas inhabited by minority nationalities of the  whole province is expected to be 9.6 percent over the previous  year. The total grain output was higher than the previous year.  In the pastoral areas, the rate of cattle marketed and the  commodity rate increased. The annual gross output value of  agriculture increased by 5.5 percent. Mainstay industries  characteristic of the strong points of resources in areas  inhabited by minority nationalities continued to take shape and  the speed of construction of transportation, telecommunication,  and other infrastructure was accelerated. The living standard  of the people continued to improve and the annual per capita net  income of the peasants and herdsmen is expected to reach 500  yuan.    However, some conspicuous contradictions and problems also  cropped up in the course of the implementation of the plan. The  first is that last year, the prices of the means of agricultural  production rose too fast and the efficiency of agriculture  declined. The second was that the contradiction between the  supply and demand of funds was too sharp. The third was that  the coordination in development between heavy and light  industry, and between the state- owned large and medium-sized  enterprises on the one hand and the state-owned small  enterprises on the other, was not good enough. The fourth was  that commodity prices rose too fast. Besides, there were other  problems such as inefficient macroregulation and control and  funds were too widely spread. In making economic plans this  year, we must pay great attention to these contradictions and  problems and have them properly resolved.  <H5>  II. Arrangements of the 1994 Plan </H5>   This year is a crucial year in promoting reform to establish  the socialist market economy structure. It is also an important  year to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development  [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhen 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660  4099 1455] of the national economy. Therefore, planning  arrangements should have new ways of thinking and should meet  the needs of the new economic structure. According to the  guiding ideology for the economic work of the whole province put  forward by the provincial government, we should lay stress on  grasping the four principles in planning arrangements this year:  The first is to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy. The second is to ensure  the smooth implementation of various reformative measures. The  third is to properly readjust the economic structure of our  province in accordance with the needs of building the socialist  market economy structure. The fourth is to effectively control  the range of the rise of the general level of commodity prices  to maintain social stability.    According to the above principles, the arrangements for the  main targets of the national economy and social development plan  of the whole province this year are:    The domestic gross output value is to be 220.8 billion yuan,  an increase of 9.6 percent; of which the increased value of the  tertiary industry is to be 60.7 billion yuan, an increase of  11.3 percent.    The gross output value of industry and agriculture is to be  (as calculated according to the constant prices in 1990) 376.8  billion yuan, an increase of 12.8 percent.    The financial revenue is to be 12.24 billion yuan, an  increase of 9.7 percent.    The total retail volume of commodities of the society is to  be 100.8 to 102.6 billion yuan, an increase of 18 to 20 percent.    The total index of retail prices of the whole society is to  be controlled around 110 percent.    The local investment in fixed assets of the whole society is  to be 30.786 billion yuan, 70.8 percent over the beginning of  last year.    The per capita net income of the peasants is to exceed 775  yuan, an increase of more than 80 yuan, and efforts are to be  made to increase their income by 100 yuan.    The rate of natural growth of the population is to be 11.66  per thousand and the population at the end of the year is to  reach 112.456 million.    The main aspects of the planning arrangements are:    1. Continue to put agriculture in the most important  position of economic work. The gross output value of  agriculture is planned to reach 84.3 billion yuan, an increase  of 4 percent; and the total grain output is planned to reach 43  million tonnes, which is expected to be the same as that of last  year. The gross output value of township and town enterprises  is to reach 250 billion yuan, an increase of 30 percent.  Stabilizing grain output, increasing income, and structural  readjustment are regarded to be the main targets and guiding  ideology of rural work. Striving to become relatively well-off  is to be in command of all rural work. Reform is to be  deepened, structural readjustment is to be made, circulation is  to be invigorated, the first, second, and third industries in  rural areas are to be developed in a coordinated manner, and  great efforts are to be made to achieve breakthroughs in  increasing the agricultural output, increasing the peasants'  income, and developing township and town enterprises.    2. Seize the opportunity to deepen reform of  enterprises and to maintain a rapid and efficient growth of  industrial production. According to this year's plan, the  gross output value of the whole province is to reach 292.5  billion yuan, 15.6 percent more than the previous year. The  gross output value of industries at and above the township level  is to reach 203.2 billion yuan, an increase of 12 percent. A  certain growth rate is to be maintained in the output of main  industrial products. According to the plan, it is necessary to  create good external conditions for deepening the reform of  enterprises and for improving state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises. It is necessary to speed up the reform of  enterprises and structural readjustment, regarding the  improvement of state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises  as the center and the establishment of the modern enterprise  system as the target. It is necessary to, through deepening the  reform of enterprises, strengthen management, reduce  consumption, lower production costs, and energetically increase  the economic results of industry.    3. Maintain a rational scale of investment and make  great efforts to readjust the investment structure. This  year, the scale of local investment in the fixed assets of the  whole society is 30.786 billion yuan, of which the investment  local state-owned units accounts for 23.036 billion yuan, and  that of collective investment, 7.75 billion yuan. It is  necessary to widen the investment and fund-raising channels for  basic projects and key construction projects and to support the  development of bottle-neck industries and the exploitation of  resources. It is necessary to make greater efforts to readjust  the investment structure. In making investment, the province is  to give priority to projects for transportation, agriculture,  water conservation, telecommunication, energy, and important raw  materials, projects jointly constructed by the state and the  province, winding-up projects, projects whose products are  required to meet targeted quotas, and projects whose  construction is resumed. The focus of technical transformation  is to optimize the structure, save energy consumption, do a good  job in the transformation of state-owned large and medium-sized  old enterprises and old industrial bases, and raise the level of  key industries centering round industries with strong points and  best-selling products.    4. Do a good job in the planning, layout, and  construction of various key markets in our province and make  great efforts to develop and expand the markets; deepen the  reform of the operational structure and make great efforts to  raise funds. A number of big markets are to be developed  in our province in important places where commodities are  produced, marketed, collected, and distributed and stress is to  be laid on the construction of a number of large and  multifunctional wholesale markets which can have a positive  impact on a wide range of neighboring localities. The uneven  development of the market system in our province is to be  changed. The nurturing and development of the funds, stock,  technology, information, qualified personnel, labor power, and  other essentials markets are to be speeded up and the gradual  formation of the market system is to be promoted. On the basis  of consolidating the order last year, the reform of the  financial structure in our province is to be properly carried  out and the macroregulation and control of the people's banks  are to be strengthened. At the same time, various specialized  banks are to be gradually changed into commercial banks.  Efforts are to be made to encourage people to keep more bank  savings, to properly run various kinds of social security  undertakings, and to pool up funds to meet the needs of economic  development.    5. Make great efforts to open up wider to the outside  world, to expand foreign economic relations and trade, and to  attract foreign businessmen and introduce foreign capital.  According to the plan, the total import and export volume in  the foreign trade of whole province is $3.15 billion, an  increase by 8 percent, of which the export accounts for $1.815  billion, and efforts are to be made to make it $2 billion. In  the whole year, $3 billion of foreign capital involved in  agreements is to be used and the amount of foreign capital to be  actually used, $1 billion. Efforts are to be actively made to  keep abreast with the reform of the foreign trade and foreign  exchanges structure and various enterprises with necessary  conditions are to be encouraged to increase export to earn more  foreign exchange. Continued efforts are to be made to readjust  the export product mix of our province, to earnestly strengthen  quality control and supervision, and to strive to bring about a  marked improvement of the quality of the export commodities of  our province. The investment environment is to be further  improved to attract more foreign capital for foreign-invested  enterprises in Sichuan. Efforts are to be made to have more  than 2,000 additional foreign-invested enterprises. Industrial  policy guidance for foreign businessmen to make investment is to  be strengthened and foreign businessmen are to be encouraged to  continue to make investment in infrastructure, basic industries,  high-technology and new-technology industries, and the technical  transformation of old enterprises.    6. Implement the strategy of "revitalizing Sichuan  with education" and the "Law on the Progress of Science and  Technology," and make great efforts to turn science and  technology achievements in science and technology into realistic  productive forces; implement the "Education Reform and  Development Program" and the "Teachers Law" and train various  kinds of qualified personnel to meet the needs of economic  construction. The reform of the science and technology  management structure is to be pushed further forward and the  focus is to be put on turning achievements into productive  forces. Efforts are to be concentrated on a number of science  and technology projects which have good market prospects, high  added-values, a major role in the development of the national  economy of our province, and a role in promoting the development  of relevant trades and of the regional economy. At the same  time, various ways are to be adopted to extensively carry out  science and technology consultation, technology exchanges, and  other activities in a bid to apply faster more achievements in  science and technology to production and construction.    Education is to be earnestly put in a strategic position and  priority is to be given to its development. To meet the needs  of qualified personnel for reform, opening up, and economic  development, the readjustment of courses, levels, and speciality  structure of colleges, universities, and post-secondary  institutes is to be speeded up. The issue of personnel needed  by border and remote areas, poor mountain areas, areas inhabited  by minority nationalities, sectors whose work is difficult to  do, and township and town enterprises is to be solved through  expanding the enrollment of students whose assignments after  graduation are fixed, students trained on behalf of departments  and organizations, and students who paid for their tuition. The  structure of running schools is to be further reformed to meet  the needs of the social and economic development. Various  channels are to be used to raise funds for running schools,  conditions for running schools are to be improved, and the  quality and benefits of running schools are to be improved and  increased.    7. Meet the needs of economic development, promote the  coordinated development of various social undertakings, and  strive to improve the people's living standard. Public  health undertakings, cultural undertakings, and social security  undertakings are indispensable factors for the assessment of the  goal of being relatively well-off. While grasping economic  development, governments at all levels must make unified  planning with due consideration for all concerned to ensure  coordinated development. In a bid to meet the needs of and keep  abreast with the progress of the general reform, the speed of  reform in the social security system and the housing system is  to be accelerated, and the comprehensive progress of the social  undertakings of the whole province is to be promoted. On the  basis of developing the economy and increasing benefits, the  living standard of the urban and rural residents are to be  further improved.    8. Have a foothold on the strong point of resources,  and speed up the economic development of areas inhabited by  minority nationalities. The "Nationality Regional Autonomy  Law" is to be comprehensively implemented, various policies to  help areas inhabited by minority nationalities issued by the  state and the province are to be fully utilized, and flexible  opening up strategies are to be adopted to speed up the economic  development of areas inhabited by minority nationalities and to  narrow the gap between these areas and the hinterland. A  foothold is to be planted on the strong point of resources in  areas inhabited by minority nationalities and the construction  of agriculture, power industry, nonferrous metal industry, gold  industry, transportation, telecommunication, and other basic  industries and infrastructure is to be further stressed. Great  efforts are to be made to exploit tourism resources and to  develop tourism and tourism is to be used to promote the  development of the tertiary industry in areas inhabited by  minority nationalities in our province. Greater efforts are to  be made to develop social undertakings in areas inhabited by  minority nationalities and the cultural, science, technology,  and health levels of the peasants and herdsmen are to be  constantly raised. Great efforts are to be made to  comprehensively fulfill the Eighth 5-Year Plan a year ahead of  schedule.    9. Do a good job in regional planning and promote  regional economic development. The two center cities of  Chengdu and Chongqing are to be used as a support, the  preferential policies for opening up the two cities are to be  fully used and extended, and the developed areas and the  backward areas are to be linked up in order to attain common  prosperity. "The two lines" are to be developed with great  effort, on the basis of continuously developing agriculture,  township and town enterprises, to speed up the development of  the second and tertiary industries, and to promote the process  of industrializing the rural areas and integrating the urban and  rural areas in a bid to become relatively well-off earlier. The  three gorges economic zone is to seize the opportunity, to  combine the resettlement of people with the economic development  of the reservoir zone, to make unified planning with due  consideration for all concerned, and to speed up the economic  development of the entire reservoir zone. While properly  grasping the construction of a number of existing major projects  for the exploitation of resources, the Panxi Chuannan Economic  Zone is to grasp firmly the early-stage work of a number of  projects. Great efforts are to be made to introduce foreign  capital and technology and to promote the exploitation of  resources and economic development of the entire economic zone.  The hilly areas in central Sichuan is to energetically  cooperate with the construction of the Daxian-Chengdu railway.  The Guangan Bazhong prefecture is to take advantage of its new  establishment to grasp firmly planning work and to speed up its  development.    10. Enthusiastically and carefully grasp well the  construction of existing development zones of the whole  province. Macroguidance to the development zones is to be  strengthened and the principle of making unified planning with  due consideration for all concerned, making rational layouts,  acting according to one's capability, doing one's best, starting  within a smaller area, and developing in a rolling manner, is to  be upheld. An operational mechanism for development zones which  conforms with the socialist market economy structure is to be  enthusiastically explored and the construction and management of  the development zones are to be gradually put on the orbits of  standardization and legalization so that the development zones  can truly become new growing points and supporting points of the  economic development of our province.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry denies reports that it has  proposed to turn Haifa Port into the home base of the 6th Fleet  in the framework of the guarantees Israel will receive in  exchange for withdrawing from parts of the Golan Heights. The  denial was made in reaction to claims by Tzomet Knesset Member  [MK] Eli'ezer Sandberg, who resides in Haifa. Our correspondent  Shulamit Schmerling reports:    [Begin recording] [Schmerling] Tzomet MK Eli'ezer Sandberg  fears that the Haifa Bay will be exposed to possible leaks of  radioactive materials or even to a nuclear disaster if Haifa  Port becomes the U.S. 6th Fleet's home base:    [Sandberg] A home base means the long-term physical presence  of nuclear-powered vessels and ships carrying nuclear weapons in  Haifa Bay. I queried the defense minister about this issue; I  also asked whether the ongoing negotiations regarding turning  Haifa Port into a home base for the 6th Fleet are somehow tied  to Israeli promises of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights and  meant as a sort of alternative security guarantee.    [Schmerling] The Defense Ministry's answer to the residents  of Haifa is that there are no negotiations with the Americans on  turning Haifa Bay into a home base for the 6th Fleet as an  alternative in the event of a possible withdrawal from the Golan  Heights. The Defense Ministry confirmed, however, that  nuclear-powered vessels and submarines have visited Haifa Bay  dozens of times. They have taken all possible precautions,  however, while keeping the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, the  Environment Ministry, and the Ports Authority informed and  involved. The Defense Ministry promises that now, too, all the  necessary measures are being implemented to make sure there are  no leaks and disasters resulting from radioactive materials.

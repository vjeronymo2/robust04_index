			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janusz Korwin-Mikke, chairman of Union for </F> Real Politics, by correspondent Barbara Szczepula; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Szczepula] To begin with, let us talk about money.  About our money. A few days ago, Minister Modzelewski announced  his intention to increase the real estate tax to 10 percent....    [Korwin-Mikke] That announcement was simply unbelievable. I  even suspect that Minister Modzelewski did it to spite the  government coalition and expose it to ridicule because, as we  know, they want to dismiss him and have already given him his  notice. Ten percent! No one imposes real estate taxes of such  magnitude, not even an occupying force. It is a forced  contribution levied on a nation, and a very high contribution at  that. It is dreadful!    [Szczepula] Not everyone sees it in the same way. During a  meeting at the "Zak" club, a young man pointed out to you that  the proposed tax applies exclusively to tenement-house owners,  and, because he did not own a tenement house, he was not at all  affected by the thing.    [Korwin-Mikke] And I asked him: And where do you live?  Under a bridge? Because, unless the youth in question lives  under a bridge, the real estate tax will affect him as well.  This is because the owner of the house where our hero lives  will naturally include the costs of the tax in his tenants'  rents. And that will happen regardless of whether the owner is  an individual, a housing cooperative, or a local authority. You  must understand the simple truth that that tax will not be paid  by the wealthy tenement house owners, land owners, and so on.  The tax will be paid by the consumer. It will be factored into  the costs of bread, rent, shoes, and gasoline. And one other  thing. I recall an exchange of correspondence with a reader  resident in California, published a while ago by one of our  weeklies. It concerned a referendum on lowering the real estate  tax in California. Our inquisitive compatriot, who was a  correspondent of the weekly in question, asked a  none-too-affluent-looking local resident whether he had voted  for or against the lowering of the real estate tax. "I voted for  it," was the reply. "Do you yourself own any real estate?" our  inquisitive reporter wanted to know. "I don't, but I could,"  was the reply.    [Szczepula] But, considering that it has not yet been  decided when the tax in question should be imposed, we can still  hope that we can last out until then. Just as in the story  about the man sentenced to death by the sultan, who, in exchange  for having the execution of the sentence postponed for a year,  undertook to teach a monkey to speak. When asked how he  proposed to make good his undertaking, he answered that he would  worry about that later because, in the course of the year, the  sultan could die--or the monkey or himself. Consequently, we  can still cherish the hope that the sultan or the monkey will  die before the new tax on real estate is brought into practice,  and that we will outlive them. "Lower taxes" is the standard  motto of your movement, but not all of your proposals have met  with the same public approval. I am thinking here of the  recommendation that the price of vodka be drastically lowered.  People are rather shocked by such proposals. They reason as  follows: "Cheaper vodka will be tantamount to more extensive  alcoholism in society."    [Korwin-Mikke] That kind of reasoning is erroneous. Just as  an increase in the price of vodka does not cut its consumption,  so its decrease will not raise it at all. On the other hand, we  should indeed examine the reasons that vodka is so expensive.  It is 10 times more expensive than it should be. Well, it is  because of the monopoly tax. Which is truly horrendous.    In any case, what is the result of the fact that the price  of vodka is so high? Smugglers bring liquor to Poland  illegally, while our own distilleries stand idle. This is  because farmers are unable to sell their potatoes or rye grain.  The industry suffers. The bureaucratic machine rakes in the  money for the vodka. As a result, the poor families--because  the families of alcoholics are always poor--suffer. If vodka  were cheaper, perhaps our alcoholics would be able to put some  money aside rather than spend it all on alcohol and, in this  way, keep it for their wives and their children. Please note  how many people profit from the organized smuggling of vodka to  Poland. On the other hand, if we were to lower the price of  alcohol, smugglers would take our vodka out of the country, and  so the distilleries would profit and the farmers would  profit.... In other words, a normal situation would prevail.    [Szczepula] You insist that taxes are the true measure of  our freedom. The lower the taxes, the more freedoms available  to the citizens. This kind of reasoning would suggest that the  Swedes are the most captive nation in our world: After all,  they pay as much as 80 percent of their incomes in taxes.    [Korwin-Mikke] Precisely. The Swedes and the Poles. Seen  from the inside, Sweden presents a horrific picture.    [Szczepula] What do you mean by this? For many of our  compatriots, Sweden is the nearest equivalent to a paradise on  earth.    [Korwin-Mikke] Swedish society is a captive society.  Something along the lines of Huxley's Brave New  World. However, there is one fundamental difference  between Sweden and Poland. Sweden is a wealthy country, having  made its fortune by selling iron ore abroad during the two world  wars. So it has enough money to be able to afford to lose some.  On the other hand, we do not have the resources from which to  finance socialism.    [Szczepula] The Union for Real Politics [UPR] wants to do  away with socialism and introduce capitalism on a large scale,  but the latest election showed that people do not want  capitalism. After all, they voted for the left-wing orientation.    [Korwin-Mikke] But why did they do so? Because the people  who ruled Poland recently were akin in their views to the U.S.  Democrats. They claimed that they were building capitalism in  Poland. But, in fact, they took as many loans as they could,  they got rid of their Syrena cars and bought Volvos instead, and  they kept on traveling toward socialism. Or, rather,  Eurosocialism. So it was a ride in a larger and better vehicle,  but it was still a ride in the wrong direction. Therefore,  people got confused. In any case, after 45 years of life under  real socialism, it is very difficult to accept the truth that  there is no such thing as a free lunch.    [Szczepula] On the other hand, UPR proposes the introduction  of capitalism, and people are afraid of that. For example, your  plans to privatize all schools make people recoil in horror.  Teachers are afraid that they will lose their jobs; parents are  afraid that they will not be able to afford to pay for their  children's educations.    [Korwin-Mikke] You are now citing a classical example of  demagoguery promoted by the Polish Teachers Association. There  will be smaller classes in private schools, which means that  there will be a need for more teachers.    [Szczepula] But parents have their fears, too.    [Korwin-Mikke] Statistically speaking, parents spend on  average some 700,000 zlotys [Z] per child per month in a  publicly owned school. This money is not paid directly to the  school but is hidden in taxes: in gasoline, electricity, vodka,  and so on. Out of that sum, about Z300,000-400,000 reach the  school. The rest is swallowed by the bureaucratic machine. If  parents could keep that sum of Z700,000--or even Z600,000--in  their pockets, they would be able to pay Z500,000 in school fees  and still have Z100,000 with which to buy, say, books for the  child. At the same time, the school would still be getting much  more money than it gets nowadays. At the moment, parents  support huge crowds of officials from the Ministry of Education  and local education authorities with the money they pay in  taxes. In addition, that money is spent on supporting people  who make controversial decisions about their children's  educations contrary to the parents' wishes.    [Szczepula] Let us now talk about values and principles.  The blue cross of St. George, which figures on your party's  flag, is said to symbolize your fight for principles. What  principles are these?    [Korwin-Mikke] St. George gave his energies to fight the  dragon. The fact that in Polish the words "dragon" [smok] and  "socialism" start with the same letter "s" is, of course,  coincidental. As a symbol of our fight, St. George has one  obvious advantage: According to the Vatican, he never existed  at all. So no one will be able to accuse us of anticlericalism.  The principles for which we fight are as follows: freedom, the  right to own property, and justice.    [Szczepula] Do you mean social justice?    [Korwin-Mikke] Oh, no, anything but that.    [Szczepula] But what is the difference between social  justice and plain justice?    [Korwin-Mikke] There are two ways of looking at it. Either  social justice is the same as plain justice, and then the  adjective "social" becomes superfluous, or social justice is  something different from plain justice, which would indicate  that it is, in fact, injustice. For example, justice would  dictate that Kowalski be remunerated for his work on the one  hand and punished for the crime of homicide by hanging on the  other. In turn, injustice, which is another word for social  justice, would insist that all of the Kowalskis who earn, say,  Z1.4 million per month, receive benefits and privileges just  because they are low-paid. But, among all of these Kowalskis,  there may be some who try but just cannot earn more and some who  do not even feel like trying. Justice cannot be collective.    [Szczepula] The abortion issue has returned to the Sejm  again. The ruling coalition intends to take advantage of  it--for political reasons--in the forthcoming local  self-government election. UPR is against abortion.    [Korwin-Mikke] Yes, we are. We believe that there should be  a clear provision in our legislation stating that the Polish  state is not in favor of abortion. UPR supports women. We are  interested in securing a law that will stop men blackmailing  women by saying: "If you do not have an abortion, I will leave  you." At present, thanks to the law on protection of the unborn  child, men find it more difficult to force women to make such  decisions. In the meantime, life itself has shown that the  infanticide statistics have not gone up as predicted by  feminists. Of course, pathological cases do happen still, but  these have always happened regardless of legislation.    Let me make myself clear. We do not propose that women be  punished for abortion. Definitely not. We recommend that the  Israeli model be adopted in our practice. In Israel, abortion  is a punishable offense, but the courts almost never resort to  making use of the relevant paragraph of the penal code. But  they still call evil by its name.    [Szczepula] Let us turn again to current political issues.  Most observers would nominate Aleksander Kwasniewski as the  Left's principal candidate for the office of president. You, on  the other hand, claim that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]  will officially nominate Jozef Oleksy.    [Korwin-Mikke] I am convinced that that is what will happen.  Mr. Oleksy is simply a more suitable candidate for the function  of "the father of the nation": He genuflects in churches and  has a generally winsome personality.... On the other hand, Mr.  Kwasniewski, with his ladder-climbing feats [reference to  Kwasniewski's recent attempt at avoiding media attention after a  major political meeting] is surely a less serious candidate.    [Szczepula] Does Oleksy stand a chance?    [Korwin-Mikke) He does, provided some disaster occurs--such  as Mr. Walesa's decision to run in the election.    [Szczepula] Would that be a disaster?    [Korwin-Mikke] Of course, because it could happen that the  Right's votes will become fragmented, and then both Mr. Walesa  and Mr. Oleksy will enter the second round of the election. And  then Mr. Oleksy will be certain to win.    [Szczepula] So, will the whole camp representing the former  democratic opposition mobilize itself and nominate their own  candidate?    [Korwin-Mikke] Let us not believe in mirages. But I can  tell you that UPR does have a candidate--a man from outside all  of the present political configurations--who is certain to win  once he agrees to run in the election.    [Szczepula] Who is that?    [Korwin-Mikke] It is too early for me to tell you.    [Szczepula] Is he a well-known figure?    [Korwin-Mikke] Yes, of course.    [Szczepula] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

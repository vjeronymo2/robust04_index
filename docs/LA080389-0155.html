			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW 710 FREEWAY WILL BRING NO TRAFFIC BENEFITS  </P> <P> The evidence is starting to come in and be heard. The completion of the 710  Freeway will not only be devastating and destructive, but will not  substantially relieve any traffic problems.  </P> <P> New transportation studies show that if the 710 Freeway is completed through El  Sereno, Pasadena and South Pasadena, it will operate at level "F" the day it is  completed. That means "severe congestion." The same studies show, if the  freeway link is completed, it will increase the amount of traffic on the 210  Freeway, the San Bernardino Freeway and California Boulevard, which is a main  thoroughfare through Pasadena. More traffic, more congestion!  </P> <P> In a recent article by White House Fellow Richard Sybert, he called for  charging fees for usage of highways during peak hours. He also wisely pointed  out we need more parks, trees, schoolyards and public places, not more concrete  and fumes. The 710 extension will destroy 7,000 trees and run side-by-side with  three schoolyards where children will live and breathe high concentrations of  lead.  </P> <P> Even top transportation bureaucrats understand the future lies in alternative  solutions to relieving congestion, not paving our way out of it. Caltrans  Director Robert Best recently said: "In Los Angeles, there's no more room for  new freeways, and the next advance has to be technological." U.S. Secretary of  Transportation Samuel Skinner is currently involved in a massive public  outreach program. He's touting double-decking existing freeways in L.A. and  high-speed methods of transportation.  </P> <P> UCLA Transportation expert Martin Wachs estimates the 710 extension may cost  more than $1 billion, possibly $3 billion or $4 billion.  </P> <P> Caltrans will tell you the cost is $425 million. They continue this low-ball  figure in order not to alarm taxpayers. It's basing its numbers on ancient  history. All it need do is look at the Century Freeway and the  billion-dollar-plus price tag.  </P> <P> Alhambra Mayor Michael Blanco and L.A. City Councilman Richard Alatorre are  encouraging San Gabriel Valley cities to support a freeway through their  neighborhoods. Alatorre is vehemently for this freeway despite the destruction  to low-cost housing in his East Los Angeles community. He has not been  responsive to grass-roots opposition. Blanco believes Alhambra's traffic  congestion problems will be alleviated, but studies show the relief will be  temporary.  </P> <P> There must be alternative solutions to easing traffic congestion rather than  uprooting lives, bulldozing homes and trees and destroying neighborhoods.  </P> <P> EVELYN FIERRO  </P> <P> mayor pro tem,  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

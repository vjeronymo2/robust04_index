			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Japan to ease curbs on foreign law firms The Japanese government has finalised proposals to ease restrictions on the freedom of foreign lawyers to do business in Japan. Under plans prepared by the Justice Ministry, and due to take effect within a year, foreign and Japanese law firms would be allowed to merge and to practise foreign and Japanese law from the same office. At present, clients have to go to separate legal offices for advice on foreign and national law. However, Japanese lawyers have managed to persuade the government to let them keep up some protectionism, in the form of a continued ban on foreign lawyers arguing Japanese cases in Japanese courts. The proposals are expected to be laid before parliament early next month and should come into force early in 1995. They are the result of longstanding pressure from the European Union and the US, keen to have access to Japan's lucrative but tightly controlled legal market. The Japan Federation of Bar Associations has been understandably very reluctant to expose itself to competition from foreign firms. However, it finally decided to compromise with the Justice Ministry after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, seized on the proposals as part of his drive for more deregulation in the country's protectionist economy.</p>

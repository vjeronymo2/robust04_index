			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Fantasy land faces a change of direction: Is it art or is it Hollywood? Nigel Andrews on the struggle between movie moguls and movie-makers THERE HAVE always been two Hollywoods. One is the place on your crinkled road map of Los Angeles. Drive there and you find a few bell-ringing names like Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street jostling with acres of seedy anonymity. Hardly a studio in sight: most of these are miles away in Burbank or Culver City. Then there is Hollywood the concept. This is a whole different mirage and for most people it goes like this. In a palm-strewn kingdom on the Pacific, men and women strive to create the dream of a demotic culture. Brash but lovable moguls hand down commands; directors crack whips; and those divinities we call stars act out our fantasies under a cloudless sky. Any time up to the late 1950s the American film industry could have recognised this image, however exaggerated, staring back from its mirror. But today the business is prey to foreign takeovers, kamikaze production costs and frantic head-scratchings over cinema's technological future. The Dream Factory, goes the buzz, is waking up to new realities. On a recent visit, I quizzed eight top movie people on the state of their art. Behind the particular questions lay two broad ones. Is Hollywood still 'Hollywood' - the town that 50 years ago, circa Gone With The Wind and Casablanca, set standards for high-power popular art unequalled in human history? And is the American film industry, which once nurtured such keepers of the new-world flame as DW Griffith and John Ford, still American in spirit and letter? The six main studios still keep their historic names. But two are now Japanese-owned (Columbia/Sony, Universal/Matsushita); one was owned by an Italian before falling into the hands of French creditors (MGM); and a fourth, 20th Century Fox, is owned by an Australian newspaper tycoon who is now a US citizen. Although the first wave of invasion fright is over, some distinguished people still shudder at the spectacle of - as they see it - the US's most precious institution being asset-stripped for non-Americans. I found the veteran Universal producer Ross Hunter, who poured money into the studio's coffers for 20 years with hits such as Pillow Talk, Imitation Of Life and Airport, still raging at the way the studio had been sold to foreign interests. Hunter belongs to the school that asks: could they now make a film about Hirohito? 'Will there be interference in story matter? Of course there will. If I owned a foreign studio, do you think I wouldn't interfere?' But film-maker Barry Levinson, whose own sweet-and-sour versions of the American dream include Rain Man and Bugsy, belongs to a newer generation. For him, foreign ownership is a fact of life and a factor of American incompetence. 'It's because we've run our own industry into the ground. Take MGM. Kirk Kerkorian raped that company for 20 years, sold off everything he could, destroyed studios. The 1980s was an age of corporate raiders who couldn't care less about the products they were buying or selling. So you can't blame foreign intrusion when our own greed has made the void for the Japanese or Italians to come in.' As for story interference, Levinson says you can always go to a rival studio if you want to make Horror Of Hirohito. But Warner's chairman, Robert Daly, raises another buzzword spawned by the new takeover fever: 'synergy.' 'When Sony bought Columbia,' he says, 'there was more concern in Washington than in Hollywood about our culture and history being bought by someone else. What the film community is worried about is the control of a software company by a hardware company. There's a different mentality that goes into running a creative business from one that markets hi-fi's and washing machines.' More bullish about both foreign ownership and industrial synergy is the new president of the Motion Picture Academy, the outfit that runs everything from the Oscars to grant programmes for up-and-coming film-makers. He is Robert Rehme, a former head of Matsushita-raided Universal. 'We live in a world dominated by telecommunications and instant communications; by satellites with 550 channels on them where you'll have a footprint over the whole Orient and be able to broadcast movies in 80 languages. Do we really suppose we can keep Hollywood as an American cottage industry? Or pretend that the new hardware won't impact every day on the way we make the software?' Rehme points out, too, that Sony's investment in Columbia has resulted already in renovated studio space and a more ambitious production slate than any rival studio. But where does the film-maker stand in these battles of the giants? He is supposed to make recognisable movies about life in the country or culture in which he grew up, while his paymasters fight their cosmic wars over interstellar transmission systems or the role of the film studio (small) in the international conglomerate. 'A studio today is a tiny speck on the portfolio of major, major corporations,' complains director Rob Reiner, who made the new smash-hit Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson drama, A Few Good Men. That was produced by Castle Rock, the company Reiner formed six years ago after becoming disillusioned with big-studio bureaucracy. CR offers its movie-makers the tender loving care of a small business: exactly what is missing, claims Reiner, in big studios that have been gobbled up by conglomerates. 'Film companies are no longer run by people whose main interest is film. When the industry began in the early part of the century, you had these European refugees, mostly Jewish, who were just getting started and who liked putting on a show. It was their only means of income - the Sam Goldwyns and Louis B. Mayers - so they took a hands-on interest. Today, the studios aren't in the business of putting on shows but of turning out product. And you can't make films as product.' 'Product'. After synergy and software, here is the third billion-dollar buzzword. Only, you have to point out to most Hollywood people that they are using it. They do not realise they are bandying this bleak assembly-line term for something that used to be called a 'movie' or a 'picture.' Just as the long arm of Oriental ownership terrifies some observers with its threat of alien, remote-control leadership, others are daunted by the industrialisation of the vocabulary. 'It's only a word,' argues Rehme. But Daly, sitting on the pile of gold produced in 1992 by Warner's 'product,' is unapologetic about the business jargon used in an increasingly competitive environment. What else when a studio must fight its corner with other components in a conglomerate - in Time Warner's case, cable and music? 'In 1991, our movie division contributed Dollars 319m to company profits,' he says. And I spoke to him before Warner's no-less-impressive 1992 turnover was announced: Dollars 886m. But wasn't there a whiff of 'product' about this performance? Warner's two top earners last year both were sequels. Batman Returns and Lethal Weapon 3 alone accounted for Dollars 300m at the American box office and were, let's face it, a case of shaking the same old tree for the same old fruit? 'It's great to have a franchise like that,' argues Daly. 'It means a repeatable flow of profit from a dependable line of product. Try telling the stockholders that we shouldn't make sequels. Try telling Time Warner.' Yes, but this is exactly what the paths we have followed all lead up to, is it not? The modern American movie world is assailed by the mentality of the quarterly balance sheet, and by the alien disciplines of big global companies used to making durable products rather than those more indefinably durable things called films. No surprise, therefore, that film-maker Joe Dante - who, in the 1980s, goose-bumped a generation with the witty monster-mayhem of Gremlins - senses a growing gulf between the administrative class in Hollywood and the artist class. 'There are very few executives who understand what it takes to make a movie. They understand the money part, the deal part, but not the creative part. If there was a way for studio executives to make pictures without actors, writers and directors, they'd be happier.' Dante has another fear: that the ledger-book mentality is spreading from film bosses to film audiences. 'Americans are so attuned today to what's making money. The grapevine is all about 'What's the big hit this week?' If you don't make Dollars 10m on your opening weekend, you may be finished by the next one.' Director John Landis, who gave a screwball twist to the American dream in comedy hits like The Blues Brothers and Coming To America, is less convinced about the New Philistinism. He believes audiences can be trusted to discriminate. And he believes there have always been art-resistant bosses: only their style of command has changed. 'Old Hollywood was like the Old South. You had your plantation and the 'Massa' was very much involved in the production of the cotton. People say they made better movies back then. In fact, they made more movies, so the odds were better. But what was really different then was that each studio had a style that came down from the man who ran them. Warner's realism; MGM's glitter . . . Today, what is the difference between the majors? None. They're distribution and marketing companies.' And why have they become that? Historically, Landis argues, because they lost control of their employees after the war: all those in-house writers, directors, actors. In the century's second half, emancipated artists yelled for higher fees; budgets rocketed to today's average of Dollars 26m; fewer films were made each year (from 60 a studio to 20 or 30); and the search was on for an art that was industrially dependable, that was 'product' - from sequels to star vehicles to those modern-day trade fairs of Special FX like Terminator 2 and Batman. But all my witnesses to date are established members of Club Hollywood. Each speaks with a career to pursue and a set of interests to protect. So, I knock on the door of someone I have cast as the sardonic Tinseltown outsider: Michael Tolkin, writer of that everyone-is-guilty Hollywood satire, The Player. He will no doubt tear into artists and executives, God and Mammon, Hollywood and Tokyo alike. Tolkin, however, pulls the biggest trick of all. Cast as Thersites, he plays the fair-minded sceptic. He thinks that, beneath the cosmetic changes, the US film business is The Same As It Has Always Been. The studios' names have not changed, nor has their mentality. He says: 'The best movies have always been made by people who sneak in through the door: a John Ford or Martin Scorsese who makes one film for the studios and then one for himself. The people in power want to make profits - nothing's changed. The people on the sound stages want to make movies - nothing has changed. And the people who write about Hollywood know a good story when they can hype one. Out here, we live in the fantasy business. And fantasies don't necessarily stop at the studio exit gate.' Food for thought; but still not, I suspect, the final course. Whatever the adversarial certainties of Daly and Dante, Reiner and Tolkin, the truth about Hollywood today will not be known fully until tomorrow. By then, we shall know if Beverly Hills has become twin city with Osaka; if the average movie budget has blown up to Dollars 100m or burst like a balloon; and if sequel-mania and 'product' fetishism have steamrollered the last creative fold out of a once glorious industry. Like Tolkin, I believe that Hollywood will always be Hollywood. But, like everyone else, I am crossing my fingers, scanning the tea leaves and praying to St Cecil B. DeMille - or anyone else Up There who can help . . .</p>

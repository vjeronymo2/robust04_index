			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (27): A pioneer in the DIY community - Case study In the highly competitive market for do-it-yourself in the UK, retailers are continually looking to improve customer services while maintaining tight margins and reducing operational costs. Wickes, the timber, building materials and home improvement products group, turned to International Network Services in 1986 for a system which would enhance its business processes and practices. Since then Wickes has become a pioneer of EDI in the DIY community. 'EDI was a natural progression for Wickes, complementing sophisticated sales and order processing applications already in use across the company,' says Mr Andrew Hennell, financial accounts controller. 'Using INS-Tradernet, trading electronically has now become an essential element of the company's IT processes.' He says the benefits of electronic trading were immediate. 'Not only is it far quicker than traditional paper-based ordering methods, it is also more accurate. Reduced order lead times mean we can ensure that shelves are neither empty of popular brands nor overstocked with lines that sell slowly.' Working alongside INS, Wickes initially approached several of its larger volume suppliers to pilot the receipt of electronic orders. This was followed by a progressive roll-out across the supplier base. Wickes presently sends more than 10,000 electronic orders a month via the INS EDI service to more than three-quarters of its suppliers. Order information from the retail outlets is collected daily and consolidated centrally on a PC system at Wickes' computer centre. Using INS' PC-based software, Intercept-Plus, orders are transmitted overnight to suppliers via INS-Tradernet, ready for collection and processing the next morning. Using EDI, suppliers can process orders much more quickly and efficiently, especially if the order data is passed directly into the supplier's sales order processing system. By fully integrating EDI with in-house systems, the paper flow is dramatically reduced and the need to re-key information is eliminated. Keen to extend its electronic trading, Wickes has also developed an in-house invoice matching system. Invoice data is received and processed on an IBM AS-400 system using INS' Intercept-400 software. It is then passed into Wickes' in-house invoice processing application where it is matched for errors and finally checked against the original order. Wickes receives about 60 per cent of its invoices electronically. Mr Hennell believes electronic trading speeds up the invoice cycle by as much as seven days compared to traditional methods. Early receipt of invoices means problems and mismatches can be addressed, saving time and resources and enabling prompt payment for suppliers. Recognising that not all suppliers have the resources to integrate EDI with their in-house systems Wickes commissioned INS to produce a PC-based application system which enables users to generate invoices simply and accurately from order data received. 'The hardest part, always, is convincing suppliers that electronic commerce is a worthwhile investment,' says Mr Hennell. 'On the whole, our suppliers have been very co-operative. . . however there are still a handful of our smaller suppliers who remain concerned by the initial commitment.' In order to make EDI more accessible to the smaller volume and expense account suppliers  - those who provide services as opposed to resaleable stock  - INS provided Wickes with a unique trading community called WickesNet last year which is based on INS-Tradernet but offers suppliers a low-cost, tailored EDI solution for invoicing and electronic mail. Wickes has recently linked its internal financial network to the INS-Mail service, enabling store and head office employees to exchange textual information, such as order-invoice queries and general memos on a person-to-person level with customers and suppliers. 'E-Mail brings numerous benefits over traditional communications methods such as facsimile, post and telephone,' says Mr Hennell. 'It is instantaneous, cost-effective and since it eliminates the need for paper, is environmentally friendlier, too.'</p>

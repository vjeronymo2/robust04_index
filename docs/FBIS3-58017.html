			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  received Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic for a talk in  Bonn today, thus introducing a new phase in the peace efforts.  Following a one and one-half hour discussion, he told the media  he hoped for a partial cease-fire in Bosnia.    Immediately afterward, Kinkel met Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg, the most important mediators in the Balkan conflict  and the cochairmen of the Geneva conference on Yugoslavia. The  intensity of the new efforts also became clear in parallel  telephone talks between Kinkel and U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who  asked about the latest developments.    The talks took place in the run-up to a meeting of the  presidents of Bosnia and Croatia, for which Franjo Tudjman and  Alija Izetbegovic are coming to Bonn on Saturday [8 January] at  their own request. The Federal Government gladly made itself  available as hosts, Kinkel said today. It offered its "good  offices" and made available the guesthouse on Petersberg hill.  The bilateral presidential conference, which will, according to  Kinkel, take place without any specific German participation and  may go on until Sunday, will also be attended by Lord Owen and  Stoltenberg, the two mediators.    The head of the Bosnian Government thanked the German  Government for its intervention and addressed an urgent appeal  to the international community to "stop the carnage in Bosnia."  Kinkel also spoke of "oppressive human suffering," particularly  in Sarajevo, but in other areas of Bosnia as well. A solution  would have to be found "that secures viable areas for the  weakest, and that means the Muslims."    The Bosnian-Croatian presidential conference is taking place  without Serbian participation. Diplomats pointed out that the  most that could be achieved would be a limited armistice  [begrenzter Waffenstillstand] or a cease-fire  [Feuereinstellung], which would then be restricted to the war  between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia.</p>

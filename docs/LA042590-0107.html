			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASKIN-ROBBINS, SOVIETS STRIKE A SWEET DEAL  </P> <P> Hoping to expand Soviet consumers' horizons beyond vanilla and chocolate, ice  cream maker Baskin-Robbins will build a new plant outside Moscow.  </P> <P> Under an agreement struck Tuesday, the Glendale-based franchiser will build a  $30-million plant in the Moscow suburb of Ostankino as a joint venture with a  Soviet trade ministry. The plant, scheduled to open in 1992, will be staffed by  about 100 Soviets and will be designed to produce more than 8 million gallons  of ice cream annually.  </P> <P> That supply will be sold at thousands of existing government-managed food  stores in Moscow, ending a government monopoly on ice cream freezer space in  the Soviet capital, said William Savel, president of Baskin-Robbins Inc.  </P> <P> Savel said government-issue ice cream in the Soviet Union is available in only  two flavors -- chocolate and vanilla. Baskin-Robbins will distribute 10 flavors  initially and will expand the selection and its markets, aiming for nationwide  distribution.  </P> <P> "They have a large unmet demand for ice cream," Savel said. "Their ice cream is  good, but our ice cream is better and we have a greater variety. We think they  (Soviet consumers) will accept it readily."  </P> <P> Savel said Baskin-Robbins will generate hard currency by selling about 10% of  its product in Soviet stores that accept only convertible currency, shops  generally catering to tourists. Baskin-Robbins will use rubles from the food  stores for plant supplies and expansion efforts.  </P> <P> The venture is Baskin-Robbins' second in the Soviet Union. The firm has been  selling ice cream from a shop in the Rossiya Hotel in Moscow since 1988, an  enterprise approved in the wake of the Reagan-Gorbachev summit of that year.  </P> <P> After the first agreement, Baskin-Robbins announced it would sell a flavor  called "Kremlin Cranberry." To inaugurate the latest deal, the firm said it  will sell a white and dark chocolate concoction called "Gorba Chocolate."  </P></p>

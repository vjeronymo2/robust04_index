According to Major Mehrani, the bandits will be severely  suppressed.    The bandits, involved in drug trafficking, have stepped up  their activities since two weeks ago when the law enforcement  forces started checking all the roads through which drugs were  smuggled to the province and arrested two four-member gangs with  a large quantity of drugs, he said.    Major Mehrani added that all the roads which used to be  taken  by the bandits were under full control and that bandits could no  longer be engaged in illegal activities.    The drug trafficking gangs, he continued, had resorted to  blocking several roads leading to the provincial capital and  looting civilians and passengers after being severely confronted  by the law enforcement forces and being entrapped in the  province.    With the reinforcements sent to the region yesterday,  security has been maintained on the roads and all the area is  being mopped out from the bandits and corrupt elements.  [sentence as received]    The operation for tracking down the bandits will be  continued  until full security is established in the region, Major [passage  indistinct].</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / As They Say in Europe: Hair today but tedium tomorrow It is a lucky country that has dull newspapers. Russia (more of this later) is profoundly unlucky but Germany could be returning to normal. This thought was inspired partly by the unremitting tedium of German news stories, until the Schneider company collapse came along, and editorial comment. For four years from November 1989, Germany seemed in danger of becoming quite exciting. But things are changing. Recent developments have been dominated by the burden of the past, as usual, and by the catatonic round of elections. So far, it is one down and about 18 to go. The key question at the moment centres on Rudolf Scharping's beard; there has been much debate as to whether the leader of the opposition Social Democrats would become more popular if he shaved it off. The world should know the difficulty one faces when seeking quotable opinions from the German media. Last week, before events in Bosnia came to my rescue, I was contemplating a comparative study on attitudes towards unemployment. Commenting on the fall in the numbers out of work last month, the Suddeutsche Zeitung told readers: 'It is largely attributable to seasonal factors. Even before the end of the year, in the high point of the recession, there were in west Germany 64,000 more registered unemployed than in the previous month. Then it was 102,000. 'More impressive than monthly comparisons are yearly data. They, however, show, as against March 1993, for the old federal territories, almost 420,000 more out of work, and for the new territories 120,000. So it is that the present noticeable business recovery, which shows slight increases in production, orders and capacity utilisation, still passes the labour market by.' A veil shall be drawn over the rest of this complex argument. It is, therefore, time to turn to the topic of the week and the thoughts of the Thuringer Allgemeine on the Nato bombing of Serb troops outside the besieged Bosnian city of Gorazde. On Monday, it said: 'Whether this will have a rapid effect on the besieging forces is still an open question. In any case, it is a further escalation of the war. The enforced peace in Sarajevo earlier this year, brought about by the threat of attack and linked diplomatic pressure, appears to have bolstered the arguments of those who want military intervention.' In other words: we don't know if it will work, but it means a bit more violence and some people think that might work. The analysis in, say, a French equivalent of the Thuringer Allgemeine, reflects similar insights and the same grasp of a complex situation. Yet, somehow, the piling up of mixed metaphors and random questions makes it altogether a more exciting read. Thus La Charente Libre: 'The intervention of Nato planes at Gorazde has the character of a warning shot. But this warning shot marks a turning point for it represents, for the first time, the thin end of the wedge of UN military intervention in Bosnia. But will it dissuade the Serbs from continuing their attacks? That is the question . . . Will other aerial strikes be necessary?' As the Bosnian imbroglio developed, one looked again to Germany and that powerful organ which was so influential in forcing the pace of events in the former Yugoslavia: the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Its staff have been locked in debate as to whether the paper should change (nobody has been known to read it from cover to cover). But it has one man who never will and remains unique among German commentators: Johann Georg Reissmuller, who made a vast personal contribution to smashing up the Yugoslav federation. This week, he described how the confidence of the Serbian leadership had grown, and concluded: 'So it is now, as the UN and the western powers wake from their self-hypnosis, that they see that further action is necessary. But what is there to save now (that) the Serbs in Bosnia, as in Croatia, have as good as achieved their war aims?' Reissmuller is a rare figure in the general run of 'on-the-one-hand-on-the-other' German editorialising. If uneventful countries produce boring editorials, Germany could be about to recover its role as a mammoth Switzerland. There is no similar fate in prospect for Russia. On Wednesday, Komsomolskaya Pravda managed a riveting analysis of the Bosnian bombing. It combined irrelevance and historical ellipsis in perfect balance: 'Fifty-three years ago today, several hundred German planes dropped 360 tons of bombs on Belgorod (in Russia). Air strikes continue today. The Balkans, where the first world war began, are being bombed. Prominent historians offer fearful but just words: 'The Balkans are a convenient place for unleashing world wars'.' More typical comment was to be found in Rabochaya Tribuna: 'As Russia begins to play an increasingly active diplomatic role in the Balkans, the western attitude towards the Serbs becomes tougher . . . Some people apparently don't like it if Russia ceases to be an obedient executor of western decisions and tries to play solo in the diplomatic orchestra.' This kind of overt popular nationalism is rare these days. The Germans are banned from such territory and the French avoid it by couching their arguments in the form of general principles rather than paranoia. There is only one other country where leader writers inveigh at enormous length about not being kicked around by foreigners. But then, for the past 50 years, the British (whose newspapers are very interesting) and the Russians have shared a unique awareness of the threat posed by foreigners.

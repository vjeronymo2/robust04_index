			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 27 Apr (AFP) -- An undetermined  number of armed followers of President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand  Aristide were killed over the weekend in the northern region of  Borgne during a Haitian Army operation, the local correspondent  for Radio Metropole, a private Port-au-Prince station, citing  military sources, reported on 27 April from Cap-Haitien (260 km  north of the capital).    According to the correspondent who quotes Colonel Claudel  Josaphat, military commander of the northern department, the  soldiers seized weapons, including a 40 MM grenade launcher, an  AR-15 rifle, a Parabellum 9 MM pistol, explosives, and  ammunition. The military sustained no dead. A soldier was shot  in the foot under circumstances not yet clarified.    The armed followers were led by Marc Lamour, who served as  Constituent Assembly member in 1987. He was also deputy  delegate for the region during the mandate of Father Aristide in  Haiti. The same source added that this operation was prompted by  an attack by two Marc Lamour followers on a military post at  Petit Bourg du Borgne (50 km west of Cap-Haitien) on the evening  of 7 April.    Several people were arrested in Borgne and in the  neighboring  towns of Port Margot and Limbe. Among them was Borgne Mayor  Belizaire Fils-Aime, who was arrested on 8 April for crimes  against state security. The OAS-UN international civilian  mission and the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince expressed concern  for Fils-Aime and his family.    On 27 April, a reliable source from Cap-Haitien confirmed to  AFP over the telephone that three trucks loaded with soldiers  returned on 26 April after carrying out operations over the  weekend in the rural area of Bassin Caiman, a cavernous region  north of Petit Bourg du Borgne. The soldiers combed the area  after firing mortars at a cavernous area of about two square km  where the presence of armed men had been reported. The source  was unable to determine the death toll.    The Haitian Army accused Aristide of initiating an armed  operation known as "Operation Cut Iron" to "destabilize the  state" since he delivered a speech in Creole in early 1994 from  the United States. In the speech, Aristide extolled  Jean-Jacques Dessalines, author of the 1804 Haitian independence  and the slogan "Coupe tetes, brule cayes" (cut off heads, burn  houses) that was used against French expeditioneers of that time.    Aristide spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau denied this charge.  Speaking from Washington to Haitian stations over the telephone,  Martineau pointed out that the military is trying to blame  others for its own "crimes." Members of the OAS-UN civilian  mission had planned to travel to Borgne and Gonaives on 27  April, where 28 people, according to the most recent estimates,  died on 22 April during a police operation in the low-income  neighborhood of Raboteau.</p>

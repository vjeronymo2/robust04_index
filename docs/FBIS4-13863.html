			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA)--Egypt, the current OAU  chairman, has urged the nationalist forces in South Africa to  end all acts of violence and prepare for free and honest  elections that will establish a democratic system in which all  sides can participate. This was stated by a responsible source  at the Foreign Ministry on the occasion of the first non-racial  elections to be held in South Africa on Tuesday.    The Egyptian source said that the current stage in which  democratic changes are taking place in South Africa demands  extreme vigilance because it is difficult to eliminate the  legacy of racism and tribalism in a very short time.    He added that the elections require the support of all  local,  regional, and international political forces to thwart the plans  of the enemies of democracy.    The source affirmed that the democratic changes in South  Africa are consistent with the views and will of the  international community. He added that attempts to frustrate  these changes will fail because they are not in the interest of  the South African people.</p>

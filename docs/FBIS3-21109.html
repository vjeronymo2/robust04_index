Like its two American competitors, Airbus Industrie  continued  to feel the effects of the difficulties being experienced by the  world's airlines throughout last year. It ended the year with 69  canceled orders, compared to the cancellation of 95 units in  1992, and 38 new orders, compared to 136 the year before. Those  figures do not take into account the announced decisions by  Cathay Pacific and Air Canada to purchase 12 of the model A340's.    The same decline was noted on the delivery side. General  manager Jean Pierson announced at the start of 1993 that 150  aircraft would be delivered at a price of $8.7 billion (50.5  billion francs)--a 19 percent increase in value--but the  consortium wound up delivering only 138 units (compared to 157  in 1992) because of postponements by a number of airlines. But  there was considerable progress nonetheless in terms of money  values, since the deliveries included 22 A340's and one A330  worth over $100 million each, and in the end, Airbus Industrie's  turnover increased by 13.7 percent to $8.3 billion (48 billion  francs). Operating results remained "favorable," although no  details have been provided, the reason being that as usual, the  GIE does not announce its "accounting surpluses," which exceeded  1.5 billion francs ($267 million) in 1991 and 1992.    As a result of that succession of cancellations and the low  volume of new orders, Airbus Industrie's order book has grown  slim. The firm still had 952 aircraft (including 252 A330's and  A340's) worth $71.2 billion to deliver as of the start of 1992,  but that figure was down to 838 units worth $66.4 billion by the  start of 1993 and 667 worth $55.4 billion by the start of this  year. That is a drop of 30 percent in two years. But even so,  the remaining orders represent over four years of production for  the consortium's partners.

The decline in new orders has already affected the rate at  which Airbus aircraft are being produced. Jean Pierson stated  last year that production would gradually increase from 150 to  170 aircraft in 1995 (and that in itself was a retreat from the  220 units announced in the boom days), but he has now revised  production rates downward. "As early as the end of 1990, Airbus  Industrie instituted a policy of rigorously managing its order  book so as to judiciously adjust its future production rates in  plenty of time to match the market," say officials in Toulouse.  Result: the consortium has slowed the increase in its production  rate, which now stands at 134 aircraft for 1994, 138 for 1995,  and 154 for 1996, the mix including about 30 percent A330's and  A340's and 50 percent A319's, A320's, and A321's. But Airbus  Industrie also says that it "will continue to pay close  attention to the market so as to be ready to adjust its work  load whenever a change becomes necessary, but with the  expectation that the market will recover during the second half  of the decade."    And in fact, the consortium is beginning to view the future  with "cautious optimism." The first signs of a stabilizing air  transport market are appearing, and some airlines are again  making a profit. And since it has an extensive and complete  family of products, it feels that it "is capable of capturing  more than 30 percent of the market."</p>

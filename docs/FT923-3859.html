			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Paisley walkout threatens talks THE round-table talks on the political future of Northern Ireland hung in the balance last night after a walkout by the Democratic Unionist leaders the Rev Ian Paisley and Mr Peter Robinson. The DUP leaders abandoned the 'strand two' talks at Stormont Castle, which are being attended by the four constitutional parties in Northern Ireland and the British and Irish governments. They were complaining that two articles of the Irish Republic's constitution, which establish a territorial claim to Northern Ireland and which the Unionists wish to see dropped, should be a priority in the negotiations. After the walkout, Mr Paisley said: 'The Irish government has persuaded the other people at the talks that articles two and three are not to be given priority, and so they have put them at the bottom of the agenda. As long as that prevails we will not be there.' The DUP did, however, keep two junior representatives at the negotiating table to monitor the discussions, and it is understood that Mr Paisley told the other participants that he and Mr Robinson would return to the negotiations once articles two and three are discussed. In reaction to the walkout, Mr John Hume, the nationalist SDLP leader, said that Mr Paisley seemed to want only to discuss his matters on the agenda and no one else's. He added: 'It doesn't seem to give any great commitment to try to have genuine dialogue, which is about discussing other people's attitudes as well as your own. 'What is being discussed are the obstacles which lie in the way of north-south relations. Everybody has put forward a list of what obstacles they see. I am quite prepared to discuss everybody's attitude but I would not confine myself to my own.' The DUP warned last night that it would respond to any statements made by other participants to the talks, raising fears that the entire process begun last April may be on the verge of breakdown amid a public exchange of mutual recriminations. The strand two talks are scheduled to continue up to September 28, with one round at Stormont next week and the final round taking place in Dublin. A 'strand three' meeting, between the British and Irish governments, is scheduled for London this Friday.</p>

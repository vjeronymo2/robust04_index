			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Election '94" program] </F>   [Text] Announcer Patricia Glyn: Our reporter has  arrived at Jan Smuts Airport. Hendrick Martin is on the line to  us from there now to give us an update on the bomb which  occurred there earlier this morning. Hendrick Hello. How close  are you to where the bomb actually exploded?    Martin: Well, I'm on the spot where the bomb  exploded, on the inside of the airport building. It's actually  just outside the windows on the second floor, a sort of parking  area, it's just opposite the international departures hall. A  lot of damage has been done. The windows are smashed. The  ceiling has fallen in in several places. Even from the ground  floor outside, some of the windows were shattered, and you can  also [see] parts of the ceiling hanging down. [passage omitted]    Glyn So Hendrick let me get this straight, the  bomb was planted in a car outside the international arrivals  hall, but the distance between where the car was parked and the  hall was merely a matter of meters, was it?    Martin That's how it looks. According to this  witness, he told me his whole story. He saw a white Peugeot  vehicle and he saw smoke coming from the boot of this car. He  had two traffic officials with him, they also saw it, and they  tried via radio to contact, to get help, to get someone to come  and look at this, and he said the next moment there was a  tremendous blast, and it is literally just on the other side of  the window.    Glyn Now did this person also see the man that  the police are looking for, some chap with red hair who was  taken away, or drove away in a Toyota Corolla?    Martin No, he didn't see anybody, at least he  didn't mention seeing anybody, but another witness apparently  did see someone running away from the area, and apparently the  police are in the process of compiling an identikit based on the  description of the person.    Glyn Hendrick, thank you very much.</p>

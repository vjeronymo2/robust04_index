Undoubtedly, state-owned enterprises must be given great  credit for the prosperity of the Republic today and for the  strong material base on which reform and opening up are being  carried out. However, as economic structural reform deepens and  the construction of a socialist market economy accelerates,  difficulties encountered by state-owned enterprises in  production and management have become increasingly acute. The  heart of the problem is their slow growth in economic  efficiency. For example, profits delivered and taxes paid by  state-owned industrial enterprises grew a mere 1.1 times between  1980 and 1992, far below the 3.14 times registered by collective  enterprises and the 33.5 times registered by enterprises of  other types of ownership. There are some state-owned  enterprises which are unable to grow or which even suffer large  losses. It is true that the predicament of state-owned  enterprises today was caused by the shortcomings of the unitary  planned economic system which the country implemented for a long  period. However, we must not deny that the heavy historical  burden on the shoulders of state- owned enterprises is an  important reason why the "dragon" cannot take off.    Speaking at a national conference on restructuring the  economy late last year, a principal responsible person from the  State Commission for Restructuring the Economy made a resounding  call: To change course in accordance with the requirement of a  modern enterprise system, state-owned enterprises must resolve  the question of their heavy historical burden in a unified way.  This has struck a sympathetic chord in various quarters,  particularly among the vast numbers of state-owned enterprises.  Entrepreneurs generally agree that the call points to an  important link in reforming state-owned enterprises and that the  opportunity offered by reform should be seized to resolve this  issue of the "burden" once and for all.    How to unload the "burden?" It can be unloaded through  reform and by approaching the problem from two directions, the  state and the enterprises. An authoritative analysis carried  out by a state department indicates that the historical "burden"  on the shoulders of state-owned enterprises consists of four  major thing, namely enterprises' debt burden; an inadequate  accumulation to cover the social insurance of veteran workers;  the transfer, unemployment, and rehiring of surplus personnel;  and social undertakings carried out by enterprises.    To lift state-owned enterprises' historical burden and to  enable them to operate according to a new system, the paramount  issue is to rationally adjust the structure of their assets and  liabilities and to resolve the question of their debt burdens  based on the need for fair competition in the market. The idea  adopted by the departments concerned is to determine, on a  case-by-case basis, the amount and ratio of the debts borne by  enterprises as a result of the change from appropriations to  loans, and to transform these loans into invested capital in the  form of increased state investment. The question of other types  of debts can also be resolved by a variety of means, including  transforming creditor's rights into shareholder's rights. As to  the difficult problem arising from shortages of accumulation to  cover veteran workers' social insurance, it should be resolved  by exploring new approaches to replace workers' insurance with  social insurance and to do so in a unified manner. In the  process of reforming the system of property rights through  auctioning off state assets, carrying out mergers, and adopting  a stockholding system, experiments may be conducted to  appropriate a certain proportion of social insurance funds from  state assets for use in covering veteran workers' social  insurance. This approach can unload the "heavy burden"  currently borne by the backs of enterprises while removing  veteran workers' concerns about life after retirement.    Surplus manpower is another difficult problem caused by the  protracted implementation of a planned economic system. The  current situation is that there are too many surplus personnel  in state- owned enterprises, and the reform of the enterprise  system and adjustment of the industrial structure will create an  additional large number of surplus personnel. After analyzing  this issue, an authoritative person hit the nail on the head  with the remark: If the question of "excess employment" in  state-owned enterprises is not resolved, fair competition  between state-owned enterprises and other types of enterprises  will become empty talk. To resolve this question, the state has  decided that surplus personnel created in the course of  enterprise reform should be transferred primarily to tertiary  industries and that the state will give these preferential  treatment in terms of taxes, credit, and real estate. At the  same time, it encourages some workers to transfer to village and  town enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and private  enterprises. It also urges workers to themselves look for work.  However, workers at state-owned enterprises, after leaving  state-owned enterprises, should enjoy rights to and interests in  social insurance and housing commensurate with their years of  service. In resolving the question of enterprises carrying out  social undertakings -- the fourth major difficulty encountered  by state-owned enterprises -- the state has made clear the  policy of gradually stripping enterprises of their nonproductive  undertakings. Schools for dependents, logistical undertakings,  and services operated by enterprises and other social functions  undertaken by them for long periods should be hived off as soon  as possible. Some of the hived off functions are to be taken  over by governments, some by independent social organizations,  and some by enterprises established solely for such purposes.    The time will eventually arrive for the dragon to take off.  Through restructuring and innovation, state-owned enterprises  will surely be able to meet the various severe challenges of  economic competition in the marketplace with a new image. State  enterprises will certainly regain their magnificent image, like  the dragon soaring to the sky!</p>

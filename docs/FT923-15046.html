			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Imminent issues may face lack of confidence WITH less than three working days left before the close of the share offer for Anglian Group, the double-glazing company, there is little to suggest it will attract strong public support. The failure on Wednesday of The Telegraph Group's public offer, three-quarters of which was left with underwriters, did not help sentiment. Nor have the decidedly soggy stock market conditions. But the signs were there once Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen equipment maker, managed only a 1.2 times subscription of its offer in early June, when the market was relatively buoyant. Despite the advantage of a famous brand name, public demand was modest. Tuesday's pricing of the Anglian flotation at 210p - some 20 per cent below the level at which advisers NM Rothschild had been seeking only a fortnight earlier - suggests underwriters were aware of this weak retail demand. Realising they were likely to be left with a large portion of the retail offer, they appear to have played hard-ball. The 210p was, therefore, a price at which they will be happy to be left with stock. Lack of enthusiasm from retail buyers has tended to obscure the underlying qualities of the Anglian offer. At 210p, Anglian is on a relatively high historic dividend yield of 5.5 per cent and is at 12.2 times historic price earnings - a multiple that in more stable market conditions, might be considered generous. For Taunton Cider, the west country drinks company that is next to price a flotation, the pricing decision for its advisers, Samuel Montagu, is also difficult. But the cloud over this issue comes from yesterday's pricing of MFI's share offer at 115p. Taunton is one of the few new flotations where a sensible comparison can be made with an existing quoted company in the same sector. Unfortunately for Taunton, so was MFI. The 115p price fixed yesterday represents a 15.3 times historic earnings per share multiple, which is a substantial discount to other stores companies and was struck even though institutions are keen believers in the company. Taunton would like to be compared with Bulmer Holdings, the UK's other large cider company, although arguably it could be rated alongside Guinness, the drinks group. Like Anglian, it is a well managed company and has expanded during recession in a segment of the drinks market that is growing at the expense of the brewers. As Samuel Montagu approaches its price decision over this weekend, it will be painfully aware that such fundamental questions about Taunton's business and prospects may cut little ice. If MFI's flotation price is a guide, Taunton may have to accept a float at a discount to the sector.</p>

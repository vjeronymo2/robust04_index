			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: TV, RADIO ANCHORS FAWN OVER OLLIE SHOW  </P> <P> They shook hands, embraced, socialized, posed for pictures, ate fruit tarts and  looked simply terrific.  </P> <P> Being a local news anchor in Los Angeles is a demanding, challenging,  oppressive, exhausting, grueling, excruciatingly hard job. But somebody has to  do it.  </P> <P> Take Tuesday, the day Oliver L. North addressed the Hollywood Radio and  Television Society in Beverly Hills. Sharing a two-tiered dais with North --  the retired Marine officer convicted of shredding government papers in the  Iran-Contra affair -- were 14 local television and radio anchors.  </P> <P> Ollie's trolley.  </P> <P> There was so much glitter you almost needed sun glasses. It was the local-news  equivalent of one of those group photographs of old MGM stars, for the assembly  of gleaming hood ornaments included some of the town's biggest TV celebrities:  </P> <P> Jim Lampley and Bree Walker of KCBS Channel 2, Kelly Lange of KNBC Channel 4,  Harold Greene and Tawny Little of KABC Channel 7 and his royal Dunphyship  himself, Jerry Dunphy of KCAL Channel 9.  </P> <P> Befitting their exalted status, these super elite occupied the same front dais  as North, segregated from an upper dais occupied by the merely elite Hal  Fishman and Jann Carl of KTLA Channel 5, Larry Attebery and Wanda Starke of  KCOP Channel 13, Pat Lalama of KTTV Channel 11, Tom Sirmons and David Zorn of  KNX radio and Charlie Brailer of KFWB radio, who was seated beside the  station's executive editor, Bill Yeager.  </P> <P> Before lunch, North and the anchors were guests at a "no press" reception,  which, when you think about it, wasn't a paradox.  </P> <P> Society executive director Oliver H. Crawford said none of the anchors he  invited to appear with North rejected the invitation, although a few who  accepted were unable to attend.  </P> <P> Look, everyone likes a nice lunch out. Yet why would news anchors -- who at  least bear the trappings of journalists -- accept invitations to appear on a  stage with a controversial public figure who was was likely to -- and did --  give a highly partisan and politicized speech?  </P> <P> The local-news people were appearing with North "without any commitment  whatsoever as to the activities (of) our speaker," society president William M.  Haber assured the industry crowd before his introductions.  </P> <P> No? Then why were these clods there? The food wasn't that good. Nor was the  Reagan-boosting, Gorbachev-bashing speech. To prove it, there were times when  anchor eyes seemed to glaze over. These things happen when your life is  20-second sound bites.  </P> <P> Regardless of Haber's disclaimer, the news crowd's participation (some posed  for pictures with North) gave at least the appearance of an endorsement of  North, violating the separation of news reporter and news maker. The same taboo  against participation would apply if the speaker had been someone as liberal  and politically different from North as, say, Ramsey Clark.  </P> <P> The anchors showed up merely because they were invited, apparently, and because  the opportunity to display themselves before so many show-business powerhouses  was just too tempting to pass up. It was one happy family.  </P> <P> "We are, after all, a communications industry," Haber said. And don't forget,  an entertainment industry.  </P> <P> That includes most of the anchors, and these days especially Lange, who, in  addition to co-anchoring two newscasts a night on Channel 4, may soon have her  own syndicated daily talk show. Well, why not? The station's funny  weather-caster, Fritz Coleman, hosts his own variety show.  </P> <P> If all goes well for Lange, she'll be sharing her cute quips with a national  audience as co-host of the proposed "Kelly &amp; Gail," with comedy writer Gail  Parent. Tribune Entertainment is trying to sell it.  </P> <P> According to trade ads, the show is a "survival guide for women" covering such  commanding topics as "How to Nail Him" and "How to Dress Your Man So You're Not  Embarrassed to be Seen With Him." All right!  </P> <P> Wouldn't the new show be a conflict for Lange? Not to worry. The ad says it's  "part-talk, part-comedy. . . ." Just like Channel 4 news.  </P> <P> Come to think of it, North -- not the anchors -- was the one damaged by showing  up Tuesday.  </P></p>

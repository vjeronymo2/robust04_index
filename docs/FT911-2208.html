			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ends little changed as volume falls INVESTORS returned yesterday after Monday's holiday but few were eager to trade, and share prices drifted to close with an easier bias, writes Seth Sulkin in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 12.43 at 26,111.25 as volume fell to 230m shares from Friday's 300m. The index set a low for the day of 26,094.09 and a high of 26,258.61. Declines narrowly led advances by 490 to 453, with 180 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks improved 5.46 to 1,963.42, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 13.85 to 1,499.01. The extension of afternoon trading hours came into operation yesterday. The market now reopens at 12.30 pm, instead of 1 pm. Dealers hope the longer hours will attract more customer orders, but said the initial effect was difficult to gauge because of the Golden Week holiday. The market will close on Friday and Monday. Share prices were higher in the morning on futures-related buying and upward revised earnings by several companies, but interest rate uncertainty kept a lid on gains. At the Group of Seven meeting in Washington, US President George Bush called for lower worldwide interest rates, but dealers said there was no reason to assume that the Bank of Japan would loosen its monetary policy. Bond prices closed at the session's lows, pushing equities down. Mr Matthew Berlow, economist with Credit Lyonnais, said the Finance Ministry had not put pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates, even though money supply growth had fallen significantly this year. Among shares lifted by revised earnings forecasts was Nippon Densetsu Kogyo, which climbed Y170 or almost 10 per cent to a record Y1,900. Traders said the electrical engineering company, which is heavily involved in the railroad industry, was also boosted by reports of more investment from leading rail companies. Large-capital issues were mixed. Nippon Steel, the day's volume leader, eased Y2 to Y471. Kobe Steel, also heavily traded, firmed Y5 to Y545. The prominence of environmental issues prompted buying in related companies. Takuma, a boiler maker which has diversified into rubbish disposal and water treatment, advanced Y140, almost 10 per cent, to Y1,280. Sodick, a numerical control machine tool maker listed on the second section, rose Y170 to Y2,510. Keiyo, a do-it-yourself chain store operator often targeted by speculators, gained Y190 to Y3,400. In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 30.09 to 28,782.30 on volume of 19m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly depressed by Wall Street's overnight weakness, although there was bargain hunting on some exchanges. AUSTRALIA fell 1.5 per cent as the strong overseas interest of recent sessions evaporated. The All Ordinaries index shed 24.1 to 1,534.2 in turnover of ADollars 289m, against ADollars 259m. NEW ZEALAND declined in moderate trading, the Barclays index losing 19.25 or 1.3 per cent to 1,467.86 as turnover eased to NZDollars 20m from NZDollars 23m. Brierley Investments weakened 6 cents to NZDollars 1.03 on heavy volume of 2m shares. HONG KONG reversed an early rise, with late selling testing the 3,600 support level for the Hang Seng index, which ended down 36.36 or 1 per cent at 3,588.36. Turnover totalled HKDollars 1.07bn (HKDollars 1.02bn). SINGAPORE hit a nine-month high before closing lower in light trading. The Straits Times Industrial index reached 1,566.75, its best level since July last year, but ended a net 4.7 off at 1,553.94 in volume of 65.6m shares (64.6m). TAIWAN staged a sharp rebound on bargain hunting after the previous session's steep fall. The weighted index rose 193.29 or 3.4 per cent to 5,921.29 in turnover of TDollars 64.5bn, down from TDollars 106bn. MANILA attracted bargain hunting after recent weakness. The composite index gained 23.97 or 2.3 per cent to 1,057.53. A block sale of 563,783 shares of Bank of Philippine Islands at 580 pesos each - against Monday's closing price of 530 pesos - boosted overall turnover to 444m pesos from 91m.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Financing fixed for third section of Algeria-Italy pipeline FINANCING for the Dollars 260m (Pounds 136m) third section of a new Algeria-to-Italy gas pipeline, to be built by Transmediterranean Pipeline Co, has been completed after eight banks have agreed to underwrite the venture. Transmediterranean, a Jersey-based venture between Snam, the gas and petroleum subsidiary of ENI, Italy's state-owned energy group, and Sonatrach, Algeria's state-owned hydrocarbons company, is building the pipeline beside an existing pipe from Algeria, through Tunisia and the Sicily Channel, to Italy. Snam has been buying gas from Sonatrach since 1983 and is contracted to buy 530bn cu m by 2019, one of the world's biggest energy supply pacts. Morgan Grenfell has been working since October to bring eight banks together to finance the third section of the pipe, through the Sicily Channel, where work is due to begin soon. The two facilities comprise a Dollars 200m Italian buyer credit guaranteed by SACE, the Italian export credit agency, and a Dollars 60m commercial loan. Financing was secured for the trans-Tunisian section last year, and financing for the Dollars 400m Algerian section is expected to be in place by the end of this year. The pipeline will contribute significantly to Italy's energy needs. Reuter reports from Algiers: Sonatrach has signed an agreement with BP Exploration of the UK to study ways of co-operating in oil and gas exploration and production. Sonatrach, seeking foreign partners to increase oil and gas output, said the two also agreed to look into co-operating in selling and transporting natural gas in Europe. BP's chief executive, Mr Richard Newton, signed the pact after talks with Algeria's oil minister, Mr Nordine Ait-Laoussine and Sonatrach's director-general, Mr Abdelhak Bouhafs. Sonatrach said negotiations were also being held to finalise a contract for exploring in Algeria's Atlas Tellien mountains. The range divides Algeria's north coastal region from the Sahara desert.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Arts: Dylan in one of his more bullish moods If you're Irish a Fleadh is a party; if you're not Irish (perhaps even if you are) it is falling flat on your face in a muddy field, making contact with a rich undergrowth of detritus, and trying to avoid the rain while waiting for some warmth, some raising of the spirits, by musicians from over 30 predominantly Irish bands. Good things have been spoken of this annual hooley in north London, but Saturday's event was only fitfully enjoyable. An English summer was at its bleakest and Finsbury Park lacks natural grandeur. Even an appearance by that well-known Irishman, Bob O'Dylan, failed to ignite the 20,000-odd rather forlorn spectators. Dylan was in one of his more bullish moods. He tried. And though not by nature an Irishman you could somehow recall hearing his voice, that confident cranking of a musical saw, replicated by some lone Paddy in the bar of a Camden Town pub on a Saturday night. On my last viewing of perhaps the most creative pop artist ever he was invisible, skulking in the shadows of a stage and content with a perverse mockery of his talent. On Saturday he was up front, blowing his harp with enthusiasm and duelling with his guitarist in extrovert, imaginatively embroidered versions of 'All Along the Watchtower' and 'Memphis Blues Again'. The slower songs were less successful, enabling the man to take refuge in his legend, but Dylan still sounds miraculously contemporary. He can find relevance and rhythms in his music with the right aura to make a damp depressing evening an occasion. The Fleadh is a wonderful reminder of the Irish contribution to popular music. Before Dylan on the main stage we had Irish high spirits, with Hothouse Flowers, and Irish melancholy, with Van Morrison. Hothouse Flowers lifted the crowd and got the arms waving. They may lack the character and originality to become mega but as a snapshot for the 21st century of what a mainstream pop band used to be like on stage they could hardly be bettered. Morrison just goes on and on, his jangly, jig-like band acting as the ideal counter point to his resonant, lived in, voice. He was in restrained, spiritual mood, with songs like 'The Garden' rather than the old belters. He came across as a genuine echo of an Irishman far from home.</p>

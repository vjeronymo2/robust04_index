After the report from the Majles  Inquiry and Investigation Group was read in the Majles on 11 and  12 Aban [2 and 3 November] an answer was presented by the  Islamic Republic of Iran Voice and Vision organization, which  was broadcast fully, yesterday by the national radio network.  Printed below is a summary of the answer from the Voice and  Vision organization:    During the lifetime of the Imam (may Almighty God be pleased  with him), his excellency gave special attention and favor to  the Voice and Vision organization. Under the revised version of  the Constitution it came under the supervision of the exalted  leader. It has therefore always been the closest organization to  the vice-regent and the leader.    This report adds: As the voice of the Islamic revolution,  the  Voice and Vision organization has numerous supporters and  opponents.    Foremost among this media's supporters is His Holiness the  Imam, may Almighty God be pleased with him, the exalted leader,  the respected officials in the government, the hezbollah nation  and the Muslims of the world. Foremost among the opponents of  this media are the counterrevolutionary groups and groups who  were damaged by the revolution such as the hypocrites, the  leftist minigroups, the Hojjatieh Society, the supporters of  America and Israel, and others who have tried repeatedly in  various ways to destroy this organization.    Likewise, part of this answer said: Although inquiry and  investigation is among the duties of the Majles, this is a  matter that is judicial in nature. In an Islamic atmosphere, the  most important qualifications for a judge are justice and  impartiality. Unfortunately, Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh, a member  of the Inquiry and Investigation Group, has a previous record in  the Hojjatieh Society. He has expressed opposition since the  year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] to Mr. Hashemi's  management, and especially during the incidents at the Voice and  Vision organization in the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March  1984], which led to the dismissal of the executive director at  that time by the Supervisory Council and the reappointment of  Mr. Hashemi by the late Imam, Mr. Parvaresh and like-minded  others said many things against the Imam's involvement and  against his house, which displeased the Imam. In a written  statement dated 4 Tir 1362 [25 June 1983], the Imam said: "It is  necessary to mention that it has been heard that some people in  my house are doing things against my wishes or without my  knowledge. If this is not true, then the person who said this  will be punished by God...."    Mr. Hashemi added that the presence of Mr. Parvaresh with  his  record on the Inquiry and Investigation Group undermines the  groups "neutrality." Here the members present at this meeting  said they did not know about Mr. Parvaresh's past and the events  of the year 1362 [21 March 1983-20 March 1984] in the Voice and  Vision organization. With reference to the record, they promised  to observe neutrality and not to allow anyone to influence their  vote and their views.    This answer also emphasized: Studying 1 million hours of  programming and giving an opinion about it, and an official  opinion at that, is something that is quite difficult.  Considering the opponents and supporters of the Voice and Vision  organization, the Inquiry and Investigation Group cannot base  its judgement on hearsay. Rather it must conduct its own study  and see the documented evidence for each instance where it wants  to express an opinion.    Another part of the report says: On matters of religious  jurisprudence, it was announced that since the late Imam, apart  from the fact that he was the owner of the revolution and the  founder of the sacred government of the Islamic Republic of  Iran, was the most knowledgeable theologian and the clear source  of emulation, on matters of religious jurisprudence in the Voice  and Vision organization such as the way women should appear on  television or on the issue of music, we have acted in accordance  with the Imam's theological views. In cases like this a council  cannot judge according to its own views. Rather it must declare  its view in accordance with the fatwas and the views of the late  Imam concerning the aforementioned issues.    In conclusion he announced that to avoid any kind of rumor  about the organization not cooperating, which might be  circulated by persons of ill will, or to allay any doubt, all  the information and documents needed by the council should be  requested in writing and the Voice and Vision organization will  send you all the information in writing.    The answer from the Voice and Vision organization says: In  the report that the Majles Inquiry and Investigation Group  broadcast from the Majles on 11 and 12 Aban [2 and 3 November],  they did not mention any of the documents sent except in one or  two cases. Rather, those making the report were completely  unfair and in several parts of the report they made the  declaration "despite the organization's failure to cooperate" or  "despite the organization's failure to cooperate...."    The answer also adds: While reading the report Mr. Parvaresh  announced that despite the organization's failure to cooperate,  the Inquiry and Investigation Group obtained its information  through sensitive and nonsensitive means!    Another part of this answer states: During the year while  the  research and investigation was under way, a lot of information  about the members of the Inquiry and Investigation Group was  given to the Voice and Vision organization. In obedience to  guidance from the late Imam (may Almighty God be pleased with  him) and the exalted leader, may his life be long, and in view  of the belief and faith that we have, we will not disclose it.  We will mention in general one or two points, which are very  significant in analyzing the group's report, because failure to  observe these points might do serious damage to the realities:  Mr. 'Ali Akbar Parvaresh has a record of activity in the  Hojjatieh Society, and brief reference has been made to his way  of thinking. Some of the group's other members also have a  record of cooperation and activity in the Hojjatieh Society.    Likewise, another member of the group is married to the  former spouse of an executed hypocrite as a second spouse, and  he introduces her as the wife of a "martyr." Later it became  clear, however, first of all that this person was the spouse of  an executed hypocrite, and second that it was this very woman  who drew her former spouse into the hypocrite group.    The way of thinking of some of the nonsensitive members of  the Inquiry and Investigation Group is thus clear, with the  "Hojjatiyehs," "hypocrites" and the views of "Hojjatiyehs" and  "hypocrites" concerning the late Imam and the exalted leader and  their friends. However, it is completely clear and there is no  need here for further explanation. The complete text of the  answer will be published in a subsequent issue.</p>

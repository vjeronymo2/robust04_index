			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (12): No-frills, anti-glamour ethic seems to prevail - Commuter and executive aircraft ALONG with elegant offices, there is perhaps no other greater sign of corporate prestige and well-being than private aircraft. In addition to conferring status, they absolve senior managers from the time-consuming procedures of commercial air travel, they can deliver managers more rapidly and closer to their destinations and allow them to make multiple stops in a day and still be home for dinner. Glitz aside, these advantages tend to add up to greater managerial productivity and efficiency. Yet, while such corporate goals might be highly desirable, over the past several years companies in straightened circumstances or faced with difficult economies have been unwilling to make the extra investment in private aircraft. Moreover, in the 1990s, a no-frills, anti-glamour ethic seems to prevail. At Beech Aircraft, the market leader in turboprops, for example, officials say they've recently seen companies turn in their higher-priced fan jets (also more costly to operate) for cheaper and more work-a-day turboprops. 'It looks more prudent to the stockholders,' said Mr Michael Potts, spokesman for Beechcraft. This kind of thinking in corporate boardrooms has led Cessna, owned by Textron and the leading jet maker (with about 60 per cent of the market), to make a cheaper aircraft, the CitationJet. At just Dollars 2.7m - the bottom of this jet line's price range - it aims to reach down into the turboprop market, says Mr Philip Michel, Cessna's director of marketing. 'They can get the advantage of a jet without the big price tag,' he said. Choosing the right aircraft depends on a company's needs and its budget. For trips of 200-400 miles a turboprop - which travels more slowly than a fan jet - is probably adequate. Turboprop prices can start at less than Dollars 250,000. Beech, however, does manufacture a turboprop for the image conscious. The Starship, made of composite material and brandishing a price tag of about Dollars 4.9m, is the top of the line. Jets are usually preferred for trips of 600 miles or more. Business jets come in three classes, light, mid-size and large, according to speed, comfort, size, avionics and price. Light jets are the most popular selections but the mid-size market seems to be growing. In January, Lear Jet delivered the first five of its new Dollars 8.3m mid-size model, and Cessna is developing a mid-size Citation X, which will sell for about Dollars 14m. For large business jets, Gulfstream Aerospace leads the category with its Gulfstream IV, which can take a dozen passengers comfortably across the Atlantic. It sold 25 last year, at an average cost of about Dollars 21.5m. The selection of a helicopter rather than a fixed-wing aircraft tends to be dictated by the availability of heliports. In New York, where rooftops can serve as landing pads, helicopter use - especially for flights to airports - is fairly common. But in many other locations heliports are scarce. Mr Frank Jensen, president of the Helicopter Association International, says that helicopters suffer because they are perceived as 'a convenience tool of the rich and famous.' Mr Donald Trump, the 1980s real estate magnate, no doubt contributed to this image problem. He flies a 44-passenger Boeing 'Chinook.' Nonetheless, helicopters are the only choice for some companies, particularly those in oil and mining, which work in areas where landing a fixed-wing aircraft is impossible. Business aircraft manufacturers say their sales generally reflect the ebbs and flows of the world economy. Total worldwide shipments of 46 US manufacturers fell 5.8 per cent last year compared to 1991. But in the US, where the economy is picking up steam, sales are starting to revive. Mr Bill Robinson at Lear Jet said: 'We took 32 new orders in December and January and we haven't had two months like that in a long time.' Although Lear Jet is based in Wichita, Kansas, it is owned by Bombardier of Canada. The uptick in American sales is also being prompted in part by anticipation that the new Clinton Administration will reinstitute an investment tax credit. If an ITC goes through, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, the industry lobby group in Washington, believes its members will see a further jump in sales. Meanwhile, it is fighting hard to make sure that the ITC does not somehow exclude aircraft. By contrast, in Europe where recessionary gloom is colouring corporate outlooks, sales have been drooping. The sales figures from Cessna tell some of this story. Since 1988, Cessna's balance between US domestic sales and those overseas has been moving from its traditional 70 per cent-30 per cent split to closer to 50-50. But in 1992, the division swung back to 66 per cent domestic and 34 per cent foreign. While leading business aircraft companies such as Cessna and Beech say the European market has considerable potential, they do not believe that their level of penetration there will ever reach that of the US. In the total of the world's business aircraft fleet, Europe only accounted for some 13.4 per cent last year while the US claimed 65.8 per cent. A key factor limiting the business aircraft market in Europe is that Europe is a smaller land mass. Also, its biggest commercial centres are already well served by commercial carriers. European company headquarters are also more often located in leading business centres than in the US, where increasingly companies are choosing semi-rural sites. The liveliest foreign markets for aircraft, say manufacturers, are now in the newly industrialising countries. The countries of the Pacific Rim and Latin America, once largely buyers of used aircraft, are now purchasing new private aircraft. Mexico is mentioned as an especially dynamic market. There is some speculation, too, that eastern Europe, underserved by commercial airlines, may become a good market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by radio correspondents "in the besieged and </F> steadfast West Bank and Gaza"]    [Text] Our Palestinian people's confidence in Damascus has  never shaken and they have never been affected by the  psychological warfare launched by Zionists and their forces to  propagate their dreams about the results of the Geneva meeting  between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill  Clinton.    The stands were clear: Al-Asad, who called for the peace of  the brave, was not and will never be like 'Arafat who distorted  this slogan and turned it into a capitulatory slogan for the  defeatists. Al-Asad, who was the first to raise this slogan,  wants it to be clear and frank. He wants peace to be based on  achieving justice and restoring rights. The U.S. officials, who  dreamed of achieving something from this meeting in the interest  of the Zionist entity, did not hide this fact when they conveyed  Clinton's impressions about President al-Asad's steady and firm  stand on issues considered by Damascus to be among its top  priorities and commitments. At the top of these commitments is  the fact that the Palestinian vanguards, which found shelter,  sympathy, and care in Syria are militant and liberation  vanguards that seek to achieve their Palestinian people's  freedom and to see dawn on their usurped lands.    Thus, Arab Damascus refutes American and Zionist allegations  that the Palestinian liberation factions are terrorist  organizations that undermine peace. Clinton said at his news  conference that differences with Syria lie in different fields,  including the presence of certain groups, such as the Jibril  group [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command], as he said in his statement. This reaffirms our  Palestinian people's confidence in al-Asad's Syria, which forced  Clinton to publicly annul the label of terrorists with which the  vanguards of our people were described and to acknowledge the  firmness of the Syrian stand.    Therefore, the expectations of some observers have been  reiterated; namely, the clear and firm Syrian stand will not be  changed by all that has been connoted by Zionism and all that it  has planted in the mind of the U.S. Administration in order to  keep the United States a tool in its hand.    The al-Asad-Clinton summit very ably disproved the picture  drawn before the U.S. President by the stands of capitulation  and shame adopted by some defeatists and surrenderers who,  falsely, claim the representation of our heroic people. Those  defeatists and surrenderers panted in Washington just to put  their hands in the hand of terrorist Rabin and to sign the  accord of treason with him at the expense of their people's  objectives and aspirations.    Greetings of appreciation and pride from our Palestinian  people to the stand of brotherhood, fraternity, struggle, and  determination to achieve justice advocated by al-Asad's Syria  from the beginning of our people's cause when 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam led our people's strugglers, until he was martyred in  Ya'bad's jungles, and when Sa'id al-'As carried out his heroic  acts, until the full liberation is achieved, God willing.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edaterina Kazasova] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, May 26 (BTA) -- The National Assembly  voted 125 to 95 for the confidence motion proposed by the  Council of Ministers, thus backing its newly proposed programme.  Under the Constitution the government needed the votes of half  of the MPs present (today 221 MPs took part in the ballot).    "I guess one is supposed to say `thank you' in a situation  like this, but I don't think those who voted against me feel  envy for my mission," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said after the  ballot. He promised to make great efforts to keep the state on  an even keel. [passage omitted]    The MPs opted for a secret ballot. Although SDS [Union of  Democratic Forces] and the independent MPs insisted on an open,  roll-call ballot, the secret ballot got 125 votes.    The procedure was delayed more than an hour by the  continuing  consultations between the prime minister and the political  forces. Just before the ballot he met with representatives of  the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms], the BSP [Bulgarian  Socialist Party] and NSDP [New Social Democratic Party]. The  government asked that its normal operation be guaranteed for a  period of three months, said the spokesman for the DPS, Mr.  Yunal Lyutfi. He reiterated DPS's support for the cabinet.  After two meetings with the prime minister the Socialists who  until then had firmly backed the cabinet felt somewhat  hesitatnt. BSP leaders Zhan Videnov and Nora Ananieva asked  from the prime minister too firm guarantees regarding incomes  compensations, the Government's Spokesman Raicho Raikov  explained. "They are impossible because of the conditions set  by the international institutions and G-24," he said. After its  meeting with the prime minister the parliamentary BSP held a  long conference at which the MPs were not quite unanimous as to  the support for the cabinet.    The New Policy Center, the Alternative Social Liberal Party  and the Alliance for Democracy issued a joint declaration that  they would not support the cabinet. Neither did the SDS.    Mr Vassil Gotsev, MP of the SDS, described the ballot as  "just another farce". He accused DPS leader Ahmed Dogan of  voting as instructed by Russia's Ambassador Alexander Avdeev.  Mr Dogan met with Mr Avdeev today and with U.S. Ambassador  William Montgomery yesterday. "We cannot help asking why Prime  Minister Berov asked for confidence only until September," Mr  Gotsev added. Meanwhile, Alexander Lilov of BSP told the  national radio that early elections will be held this fall and  that they will be won by the BSP.    MP from the New Union for Democracy and representatives of  the Democratic Bulgaria Union intend to propose a draft  agreement to the other parliamentary forces to regulate the work  of parliament until the new elections. They explained that  parliament and the other state institutions have lost much of  their prestige. However, jurists from different parliamentary  forces say that under the Constitution early elections can only  be held in case of cabinet crisis and the inability of  parliament to appoint a government.</p>

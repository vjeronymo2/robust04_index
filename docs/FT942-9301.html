			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Ulster searches for equality at work: A struggle to eradicate decades of religious discrimination Mr Bob Cooper may not be amused at the prospect of his organisation being taken before Northern Ireland's fair employment tribunal to answer an employee's allegations of religious bias. The organisation in question is, after all, the Fair Employment Commission, set up to help eradicate decades of damaging workplace discrimination. But Mr Cooper, the FEC's chairman, can perhaps find some consolation from knowing that the tough set of anti-discriminatory laws he is in business to enforce in Ulster are increasingly understood and that workers will not hesitate to invoke them if they believe they have a grievance. It is nearly five years since the government revamped legislation to try to tackle head-on the unlawful discrimination which for decades has scarred many aspects of life in the province. With problems over the allocation of housing and electoral abuses largely overcome, new measures were felt necessary to wipe out the discrimination still rampant in the workplace. The answer was the Fair Employment Act 1989, a tough package placing fresh responsibilities on employers to monitor the religious composition of staff and to enact equal opportunities at work. The act cites more than 20 criminal offences and lays down punitive economic sanctions against defaulting employers. The compensation ceiling for tribunal awards to individuals has just been raised to Pounds 35,000, and already a payout close to the maximum has been made. Next year the legislation is to be reviewed and organisations across the province are assessing its success and compiling recommendations for changes. The general, though not universally accepted, view is that the act has made a useful start in combating discrimination but that there is still a long way to go. For decades, Roman Catholics were in effect banned from whole areas of public-sector and commercial life and knew it was a waste of time applying even for jobs they were qualified to do. Most grades of the civil service were devoid of Catholics - now they hold three of the province's 10 permanent secretary postings - and there were few in the professions or in skilled industrial jobs. With unsuitable schooling and poor qualifications, they were trapped in a vicious circle. Catholics, who make up nearly 40 per cent of the available workforce, are still under-represented right across the economic community but the gap is slowly narrowing. Discrimination nevertheless remains well in evidence, with a spate of tribunal findings suggesting that Ulster's district councils and health and education boards are among the worst and most persistent offenders. Many private-sector companies, overwhelmingly staffed by workers from one or other side of the religious divide, have so far failed to make significant changes in their employment profiles. The picture is not just one of stubborn Protestant bosses. Among the biggest employers, some Catholic-dominated companies are apparently proving slower in redressing the balance than businesses with predominantly Protestant workforces. It is accepted, however, that change can be impeded by the religious make-up of the local labour pool and by declining workforces in the wake of recession. The biggest imbalance remains among the unemployed, with Catholics still more than twice as likely to be out of a job than Protestants. The situation has barely improved in 20 years with many employers avoiding an underskilled and inexperienced labour force rather than consciously discriminating on religious grounds. As a review of the act approaches, Mr Cooper is not complacent: 'So much more remains to be done, but if you look at where where we were coming from we have already moved an enormous distance.' Mr Nigel Smyth, director of the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, agrees: 'The legislation has started to make an impact, particularly on recruitment and selection practices, but there was never going to be any quick fix.' The unions, too, say the legislation has proved more effective than they expected. Mr Terry Carlin, Northern Ireland officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, says the law has forced many employers to consider their recruitment and employment attitudes. But he sees little evidence that 'a culture of equality is taking root'. Ulster politicians, predictably, are divided. While the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party believes that the 1989 legislation is beginning to have a beneficial impact on employment imbalances, some Ulster unionists complain it is now discriminating unfairly against Protestants. There will, even so, be pressure on the government to make changes. The CBI believes the tribunal process has become too lengthy, overly legalistic and costly.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Day of reckoning looms on pensions - Pension funds How the European Union's capital markets develop in the next few years will depend in part on how governments tackle the dilemmas they face over providing pensions for their ageing populations. On one hand, shrinking workforces and growing numbers of retired people are likely to impose intolerable strains on existing European state pension schemes. On the other, large amounts of capital from people forced to provide for their own retirement could be drawn into private savings and investment. If governments seize the chance, this flow of funds could help stimulate diversified and flexible capital markets across Europe. At present, most west European states rely mainly on so-called pay-as-you-go schemes for state retirement provision, in which younger working people effectively finance their parents' pensions. But the greying of the EU's population is putting such schemes under extreme pressure. Governments will soon face a painful choice between cutting benefits and imposing swingeing tax increases to finance the rising pension bill. Already most EU countries have raised retirement ages for women and lengthened the number of years of employment needed to qualify for the maximum state pension. But these changes are only a start; to go further means entering a political minefield. A more palatable approach has been developed in North America, the UK and the Netherlands. There, private pension schemes have developed large pools of capital by extracting contributions from both workers and employers. The resulting combined savings have not only eased pressure on state-funded retirement provision but had a dramatic impact on domestic and foreign capital markets. In the UK, an estimated Pounds 350bn in pension scheme assets means pension funds own at least 30 per cent of the UK stock market. Now, most other European countries are studying whether to adopt funded private schemes. According to Mr Karel Lanoo, researcher with the Brussels-based Centre for European Policy Studies, the difficulty governments face is that fiscal incentives are needed to encourage greater private pension provision. 'You are asking people to do this while they are still paying significant taxes for those currently receiving pension benefits.' But offering tax incentives means less cash for today's pensions bill. Italy has forced through unpopular measures modestly limiting the availability of state pensions. Tax incentives have been made available and a nascent personal pensions sector now exists. The French government, by contrast, plans to provide for funded private pension schemes to complement the pay-as-you-go system. But it has postponed this until the autumn, in part because of concern about the impact of such schemes on public finances and personal consumption. Switzerland, which has long operated a funded scheme for its state pensions, introduced mandatory requirements for employers to contribute to funded private pension schemes for their workers in 1985. Switzerland is one of only four European countries where pension scheme assets exceed those of insurance companies. Even if EU member states develop pools of pension assets, they have yet to resolve how these funds can be invested to maximum effect. The Anglo-Saxon style of equity-based investment and geographically spread pension portfolios is alien to most EU countries, which prescribe limits on pension fund investments, by currency and class of asset - favouring domestic fixed-interest securities. In Germany, which has a relatively small independent pension sector, no more than 5 per cent of assets may be invested in non-German assets and no more than 30 per cent in equities. Denmark requires that 60 per cent of assets be invested in domestic government and mortgage bonds. Such restrictions usually spell lower returns. They have also constrained the growth of institutional investment and international equity markets in Europe. The European Federation of Retired People, a grouping of occupational pension providers, says the UK and the Netherlands, with almost no restrictions on investment, accounted last year for about 93 per cent of all EU pension fund investment outside its own currency area. The issue of the restrictions has proved so thorny that a proposed EU directive intended to liberalise pension fund investment has been temporarily shelved. It would have barred countries from insisting on minimum investments in asset classes, allowed pension schemes to invest up to 40 per cent of assets in non-domestic currencies and allowed a pension scheme to hire a non-domestic investment manager. The problem, according to Mr Giovanni Tamburi, partner at consulting actuaries R Watson in Geneva, is that governments have confused the question of how best to finance retirement provision with other social goals, such as bolstering domestic industry or reducing public borrowing. There is no doubt that investment restrictions can seriously undermine returns for private pension schemes. Moreover, the US and UK experiences of pension schemes and voluminous academic research establish an overwhelmingly strong case that diversification of portfolios reduces risk. The lesson of diversification has not been lost on US pension fund managers, who until a decade ago largely shunned foreign investments. They now put an average of 6 per cent of their Dollars 4,000bn in assets abroad, according to InterSec Research, which specialises in tracking pension fund investment. 'There is a top tier of managers of larger funds who are putting as much as 15 percent of assets abroad,' according to Ms Alexe Nowakowski, associate consultant at InterSec. InterSec estimates that, in the first half of 1993 alone, close to Dollars 30bn in net new cash was sent abroad by US pension scheme managers in search of higher returns. Of that, only 15 per cent was specifically destined for Europe. Europe, by contrast, has hardly begun to resolve how to generate and channel institutional capital of this kind, or, more generally, how to structure and finance pension provision. As the new century approaches, the options for pensions provision narrow and the day of reckoning looms closer.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / An Italian empire strikes back: ENI, the state energy group, is restructuring and breaking political ties There can be few jobs more daunting than the one facing Mr Franco Bernabe, chief executive of ENI, Italy's state energy concern and the world's eighth largest oil group. The 44-year-old economist must pick up the pieces of an industrial empire stricken by involvement in corruption investigations and prepare its businesses for privatisation. His efforts are being watched closely from abroad. Potential investors will scrutinise his attempts to reshape the diverse group. Foreign governments will keep an equally close eye on emerging evidence of fraud in ENI's overseas operations. It is at home, however, that the group's affairs have caused most disruption. ENI has emerged as one of the principal paymasters in an elaborate system of graft that has sustained Italy's main political parties for two decades. Its affairs have caused the resignation of two ministers in less than two months and contributed to the enforced departure of Mr Bettino Craxi from the leadership of the Socialist party. Mr Gabriele Cagliari, ENI's chairman, resigned on March 9 after being arrested on charges of alleged corruption and falsifying accounts. The heads of four leading ENI subsidiaries - Agip (oil and gas exploration), Snam (gas supplies), Saipem (drilling) and Nuovo Pignone (turbines) - have also been arrested on similar charges. All are now helping magistrates unravel a darker side of what has been the most dynamic group in Italy's unwieldy public sector. In the midst of this storm, Mr Bernabe has remained calm. 'Although very much alone, he knows what he wants and has had strong support from the government,' observes one colleague. 'Now that Cagliari's gone and the political parties are too discredited to interfere, he is much freer.' His position has been reinforced by the appointment on March 31 of a new five-man board, composed of technocrats and oil industry experts. But he has enemies from within the political establishment who oppose his plans to shake up ENI, concentrate on core businesses and carry out extensive privatisation. 'Bernabe sees privatisation essentially as a means of reducing the capacity of the state to interfere in corporate management,' observes a senior ENI executive. ENI is the second largest state group with annual sales of over L50,000bn (Pounds 20.8bn) and 130,000 employees worldwide. Many politicians are reluctant to lose this source of patronage. Last June, 'old guard' politicians from the Christian Democratic and Socialist parties tried to get Mr Bernabe sacked. The move backfired, and when ENI was converted into a joint stock company in August, Mr Cagliari, the representative of these politicians, was forced into a nominal chairman's role. This marked the first stage in removing ENI from the direct political arena. Ever since the group was founded by Enrico Mattei in 1953 following significant gas discoveries in the Po Valley, it has played a high-profile political role. The drive to establish independent sources of oil supplies gave Mattei powerful influence, particularly in foreign policy. 'I treat the political parties like taxis - I get on and off them when I feel like,' is an often quoted Mattei dictum. A power unto himself, he took ENI in a number of diverse directions including newspaper ownership (ENI still owns the daily Il Giorno). But he also made ENI's logo of the fire-breathing dog with six legs the symbol of Italy's postwar development and prosperity. After Mattei's death 1962, the politicians gradually reduced the group's independence. First it was the turn of the Christian Democrats, then the Socialists who in the late 1970s staked out ENI as their area of patronage. Once Mr Craxi, the Socialist leader, became prime minister in 1983, he established a chain of officials to aid ENI operations. From Italian embassies abroad to pliant state-controlled banks, ENI received favoured treatment. In return, the party received political funds. The confessions of ENI executives and consultants in the past two months point to the group being one of the most important sources of illicit finance to Italy's political parties during the 1980s. Among the many accusations now being levelled by Milan magistrates against Mr Craxi is that during the late 1980s he allegedly received or was party to organising illicit funds of about L12bn from ENI, L8bn from Snam, L4bn from Agip, L3.5bn from Saipem and L4bn from Nuovo Pignone. Milan magistrates are pursuing five main areas of investigation: the reorganisation of the petrochemicals and chemicals industry through Enimont, the joint venture set up in 1989 with Ferruzzi Montedison and bought by ENI in 1990; domestic contracts won by ENI subsidiaries, notably in the energy sector; kickbacks on foreign contracts won by Saipem and Snam. These include pipelines in Nigeria and Iraq, and gas supplies from Algeria and the Soviet Union; the fate of Dollars 7m paid in 1982 to the Socialists by disgraced banker Roberto Calvi in return for ENI lending money to Banco Ambrosiano, the private bank which collapsed in 1982 and had to be rescued by Italian financial institutions. funds generated by ENI offshore subsidiaries through false consultancy contracts, and through trading in oil contracts and currencies. This is a big dossier with far-reaching implications. Take the Enimont affair. Magistrates are working on the assumption that ENI was pressed by its political masters in the Socialist and Christian Democrat-dominated coalition to buy out Ferruzzi Montedison's 40 per cent stake in Enimont for an inflated price of L2,805bn. But they have so far failed to prove there was any political pay-off from the transactions and Ferruzzi denies any wrongdoing. Nevertheless, the cost of this purchase and the subsequent losses of the fertilisers sector have been one of the main factors restraining ENI's profits. The state's investigations are also revealing the extent of the group's overseas operations in directing funds to the political establishment. According to the investigators, revenues were diverted through subsidiaries in offshore tax havens or Switzerland, frequently using former ENI executives and their cronies. Foreign subsidiaries also passed on the profits of speculative trading in oil and currencies. ENI executives have admitted that 'commissions' were frequently paid for overseas contracts. This was also confirmed in a recent interview by Mr Franco Reviglio, who was forced to resign as Italy's finance minister last month because of his alleged role in permitting ENI funds to be diverted to political parties while chairman of the group between 1983 and 1989. In an interview in La Repubblica, one of Italy's leading newspapers, he said: 'Unfortunately this (granting of commissions) was something unavoidable if you wanted to deal with certain countries. . . . Our main concern was to ensure that these bribes did not find their way back to Italy to finance people, movements and institutions.' In Italy the paying of 'commissions' to secure a contract abroad is not an offence provided the company's books are not falsified. This grey area of legality has enabled the parties to obtain illicit funds by taking a cut on inflated foreign 'commissions'. All of the 11 ENI executives involved in the corruption scandals are charged with falsifying accounts. So far the magistrates appear to have decided to avoid embarrassing foreign governments - and prejudicing Italian contracts overseas - by not releasing the names of foreign nationals. But already the Algerian government has asked the Italian government for information about large gas sales contracts with ENI in the 1980s for which it fears bribes may have been paid. In the wake of Mr Cagliari's resignation, Mr Bernabe set up a special working committee to examine management methods in ENI's overseas operations. By the beginning of June it will present proposals for tightening controls on the overseas activities of subsidiaries, especially those with purely financial functions. Already 30 overseas companies have been closed. In addition to cleansing its organisation, the group faces a difficult challenge in restoring its credibility and defining its future shape. 'ENI has become too big to keep track of with 209 subsidiaries overseas,' says one executive. Agip Petroli, the oil distribution arm, and the EniChem chemicals business have 60 companies based outside Italy, while another 30 are registered abroad by Agip. Bringing this far-flung empire to account is essential, says the company. The shake-up is already underway. Amsterdam-based ENI International Holding, which controls ENI International Bank, a financial institution registered in Nassau and operating out of Montecarlo, and which handles financial transactions exclusively for the group, has been one of the first targets. Last week, its 16-member board was removed and replaced by a 5-man team. Mr Bernabe's efforts to reorganise the group will have a marked impact on ENI's financial performance. The results for 1992, as yet unpublished, will reflect the heavy cost of measures already taken to simplify the group's structure, purge loss-makers and sell off parts of the business. ENI officials concede that additional heavy provisions will be necessary. About L500bn will be set aside in both the 1992 and 1993 accounts to cover redundancies at subsidiaries such as the group's heavily loss-making Sardinian lead and zinc mines. Job losses have already been felt in the higher echelons of the ENI organisation, with about 250 boardroom posts having been cut as a result of the closures so far. Heavy provisions will also be required to cover one-off write-downs in the value of fixed investments at some subsidiaries being closed or sold. Together these provisions will depress earnings for the group, which made L1,081bn after tax in 1991. As a result, ENI is unlikely to meet the government's prediction in its 'green book' on planned privatisations that pre-tax earnings for 1992 will be in line with those of the previous year. The need to set money aside to cover special provisions may even require some of the proceeds from privatisation to go to ENI, rather than directly to the Treasury, as envisaged by the government's privatisation plans. Mr Bernabe has already managed to sell some of the group's non-core assets and hopes to raise further cash by floating other operations on the stock market. Last month, he announced the disposal of two parts of the Savio textile machinery division, raising about L150bn. The remaining units of the division may be sold by the end of this year. Plans to sell the profitable Agip Coal business, which has operations from Australia to South America, are well advanced. In all, 25 significant disposals are now under way. Sales of group assets are open to foreign investors. So, too, will be the next stage of restructuring and refinancing the group - the flotation of its principal subsidiaries. The process is expected to start with Agip, one of the most profitable parts of ENI. Details are not yet available, but analysts expect up to 20 per cent of the shares will be listed, raising about L2,000bn. If the Agip deal goes successfully, Snam may be next. 'Taking the subsidiaries public is not just a way of raising money, but will also show bankers and potential investors we are serious about being judged by the market,' says a member of the privatisation team. The transactions will be the prelude to floating ENI itself. Listing the parent company will be much more complicated than taking the subsidiaries public. Merchant bankers have been working on the Agip and Snam flotations for over two years; it will take them at least as long to do valuations and prepare ENI's accounts for a share issue. During this period ENI will continue its struggle towards a new identity. The cleansing process has begun and there is a sense of liberation within the group, a result of its increasing freedom from political control. But there is much dirty linen still to emerge, and the road to privatisation will not be easy.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ENI: PREPARING FOR PRIVATISATION  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The five main subsidiaries       Sales (000 Lbn)   Net Profit (000 Lbn)                                  1990       1991      1990       1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agip Upstream Oil &amp; Gas        13.736     10.957     1.581      1.442 Agip Petroli Downstream Oil    15.327     16.089       -44        117 Snam                           11.017     12.999     1.234      1.901 Enichem                        15.060     13.727        40     -1.405 Nuovo Pignone                   1.198      1.550        27         36  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The five main subsidiaries      Investment (000 Lbn)    Workforce                                   1990       1991       1990       1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Agip Upstream Oil &amp; Gas          1.900      3.672      9.357      9.628 Agip Petroli Downstream Oil        756        973     24.844     24.956 Snam                             1.286      1.919     16.207     16.783 Enichem                          2.093      1.971     44.544     42.784 Nuovo Pignone                       46         50      5.744      5.693  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company report  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

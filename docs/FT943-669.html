			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: EVC's plastic problem The reasons why ICI and Italy's EniChem eventually want to leave the PVC industry are easy to fathom. The European sector is mature, hugely cyclical, and unpleasantly capital intensive. EVC, their joint venture, also has a record of bleeding red ink. The company has achieved combined pre-tax losses over the last three years of Fl 827m. That raises the question why anyone else should pick up shares when the stock is floated. EVC has its attractions. It moved into the black during the last six months. Its management believes profits are set to expand rapidly as the group rides the economic cycle and cuts costs. There is certainly scope for savings. EVC may be Europe's largest PVC maker, but it is far from the most efficient. If the new group can grasp the political nettle in Italy where it needs to cut staff, it can probably achieve its cost reduction targets. Of more concern is the validity of EVC's growth projections for the PVC market. Demand for PVC pipes and window-frames - representing about 50 per cent of the market - looks solid. But health and environmental fears make the prospects for PVC packaging far more uncertain. These concerns were heightened this month when the US Environmental Protection Agency published a new report on the subject. Evian water will no longer be sold in PVC bottles and other manufacturers look set to follow. Mineral water bottles may represent just 4 per cent of the west European market, but that is still substantial given the overall sector may expand at only 1.5 per cent a year. PVC is a risky product. EVC's price will have to reflect that.</p>

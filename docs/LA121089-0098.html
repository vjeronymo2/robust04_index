			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DEMOCRATS FIND NO LIFE IN THE PARTY'  </P> <P> Re "Orange County Democrats Find No Life in the Party" (Nov. 26): Even without  money, there is more life in the Orange County Democratic Party than the  Republicans can buy. Next time visit one of our Central Committee meetings or  other events to see just how much life we do have before you write such an  inaccurate headline.  </P> <P> Your reporter who wrote the story visited our last Central Committee meeting  and told me that he thought the meeting was exciting. It's too bad the Los  Angeles Times decided to focus on the negative.  </P> <P> MIKE BALMAGES  </P> <P> Chairman, Orange County Democratic Party  </P></p>

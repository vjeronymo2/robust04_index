			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: US operation lifts Dewhurst to Pounds 0.69m Dewhurst, the electrical components and control equipment maker, reported pre-tax profits 69 per cent ahead at Pounds 685,126 for the 26 weeks to April 3, against Pounds 404,487. Turnover was up 4 per cent at Pounds 5.39m (Pounds 5.17m). Earnings per share were 3.99p (2.36p) and the interim dividend is raised from 0.66p to 0.75p. Steady growth in demand for keypad products and a strong performance from lift components in the US offset the expected downturn in rail equipment sales.</p>

This economically booming province has simplified port  formalities. Instead of making repeated examinations of trucks  coming in and out at different localities, customs officers only  check the trucks once, at the Shenzhen crossing point bordering  Hong Kong.    Generally, they will no longer make on-board examinations of  foreign ships, and they will make only some spot checks on  tourists.    A provincial official in charge of port management said that  the province officially opened seven first-grade ports and built  20 second-grade ports last year.    Guangdong had 44 first-grade entry and exit ports and 152  second- grade ports by the end of last year.    These ports handled 71.384 million visitors last year,  111.51  million tons of cargo and 8.42 million motor vehicles, increases  of 5.6 percent, 29.9 percent and 10.1 percent over the previous  year, respectively.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Costly research The topic of research and development, and British industry's supposed aversion to it, is back in the news again. Last Thursday the UK Department of Trade and Industry published the latest version of its 'R &amp; D scoreboard', showing that Britain still spends far less on R &amp; D than its main competitors. The data also suggested that British companies, uniquely among the big industrial nations, spend less on R &amp; D than on dividends to shareholders. The comparison between R &amp; D and dividends is particularly topical, since the UK government seems to be toying with the idea of redressing the balance: for instance, by taxing the income of the pension funds, thus making dividends less attractive by comparison with cash reinvested. At worst, this could do industry more harm than good. Either way, it is largely beside the point. The debate about the City's alleged reluctance to invest in British industry goes back at least to the late 1970s, when it was examined by the Wilson Committee. The answer was clear then, and it is clear now. If industry fails to invest, it is not primarily because of lack of funds. It is more often because it cannot find sensible projects to spend money on. Nor is it true that R &amp; D is self-evidently good and dividends bad. Take a simple example from the world of high technology. Both Philips of the Netherlands and Microsoft of the US spend massively on R &amp; D, and neither paid a dividend last year. Philips could not afford to: its huge spending on research (over Dollars 1bn annually) has proved largely profitless, and the money would arguably have been better handed to shareholders. But shareholders in Microsoft - one of America's most spectacularly successful companies - have no reason to want dividends. Their company's growth record is such that they can count on reinvested cash bringing a far higher return than they could get on their own. The basic fallacy is to suppose that high R &amp; D spending is the cause of commercial success, rather than the result. Britain's drug companies have traditionally spent lavishly on research, and have also enjoyed rapid profits growth and high stock market ratings. This is because the British have a talent for discovering useful medicines, so the cost of discovering them has been money well spent. Now, as it happens, this may be changing. The glory days of conventional drug discovery appear to be over, and Glaxo is spending almost as much on dividends as on R &amp; D. Merck of the US - the world's biggest drug company - is actually paying more. In seeking to make the more mature sectors of British industry spend more on R &amp; D, the government may thus be flogging a dead horse. Indeed, proposals to penalise dividend payments by taxing previously tax-exempt pension funds could actually be harmful. The paymasters of the pension funds, after all, are largely the companies themselves. If their net receipts were reduced, their collective response would have to be either an increase in dividend payments or a rise in pension contributions. Either way, they would have less to spend on R &amp; D. Alternatively, the Treasury could opt for fiscal neutrality, for instance by reducing the basic rate of corporation tax in compensation. The net effect might be a mild stimulus to R &amp; D spending, and that would doubtless do no harm. But it would not do to expect too much. When it comes to productive R &amp; D, it isn't what you spend, it's the way that you spend it.</p>

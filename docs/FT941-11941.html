			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Genial Kohl strikes chord with Clinton: A look at the chancellor's highly successful recent visit to Washington The word from London, according to US correspondents dutifully reporting on British media and political reactions, is that the 'special relationship' is in poor health, its latest illness brought on by the US decision to grant a 48-hour visa to Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein. British angst may be understandable, if exaggerated. But it also may be compounded by the word from Washington, that another US relationship - with Germany - appears to be blooming. That, at least, is the reasonable interpretation of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's genial performance here over the past two days. Mr Kohl's mission may well have been designed to play to his domestic audience about to enter a ferocious election year cycle. He seemed to have decided that a young and vigorous President Bill Clinton, fresh from an impressive European tour and now with an July invitation to Germany, is company worth keeping. As if to give the lie to even the vague suggestion that he was offended when Mr Clinton compared him to a sumo wrestler last month, the chancellor hauled the hefty president off to his favourite Washington restaurant - a trattoria totally unfamiliar with the trendy new wave of light and healthy cuisine (the Clinton appetite, according to the proud restaurateur, was the larger). More substantively, all Mr Kohl's public comments suggested no daylight between US and German positions on any number of big issues, while tricky bilateral subjects, such as aviation and interest rates, were skipped over lightly. On the Balkans, the chancellor endorsed the president's reluctance to commit ground troops. 'After the experience of world war two,' he said, 'I can only warn that intervention with ground troops won't solve anything but will only create a more tragic situation.' Like Mr Clinton, he argued it would be wrong to force the Bosnian government to the negotiating table, as France has been demanding. 'Violence did not originate in the Moslem camp,' he said, using words virtually identical to those of the US administration. He declined to get involved in the Franco-US dispute. 'I've said time and again that Bonn should not be involved as an interpreter. The people we are talking about are grown-ups and they don't need an interpreter.' He had no problems with the use of air support to protect peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, as agreed by Nato last month. But he was prepared to exert pressure on Croatia, should it send its forces into Bosnia in strength. 'I would disapprove very strongly and I would find a way of putting my disapproval into practice,' a clear hint that that might embrace the sort of economic sanctions the US has threatened. He endorsed Mr Clinton's determination to further Russian reform and said Russia would be invited to the next G7 finance ministerial meeting. But, he went on, 'real progress can only be made by Russia itself', with western aid best directed at Russian self-help. He denied, as does Mr Clinton, that Russia had acquired a veto power over Nato's membership. The Partnership for Peace approach made current sense, though it would be unwise to duck for too long critical decisions on European economic and military integration, a very Clintonian theme. He hinted that the Czech Republic might be first in east European to pass the EU and Nato membership posts. And, if all this solidarity with the US were not enough, he inserted a couple of sly digs at Britain, too. On aid to the former eastern bloc, he smiled and contrasted the German contribution, equivalent to Dollars 485 per German citizen, to the British (bottom of the western league at a mere Dollars 10). The chancellor also went out of his way to praise former President George Bush and James Baker, his secretary of state, both awarded German medals on Sunday night, for their unstinting backing of German unification. 'There were not so many supporters as you might imagine,' he said, presumably a reference to Lady Thatcher's now well-known opposition. Clearly Mr John Major, the British prime minister due here at the end of this month, has a tough act to follow. After all, he can hardly invite the president to one of Washington's Irish bars.</p>

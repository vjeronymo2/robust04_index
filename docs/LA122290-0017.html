			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT EVERYONE THINKS ROBINSON IS THE PROBLEM  </P> <P> The Rams' reputation for front-office stinginess and shortsightedness far  predates John Robinson.  </P> <P> Robinson provided stability and respectability to an organization that had  become a laughingstock. He is a charismatic, popular leader who knows the game,  and for several seasons has gotten exceptional performances from players who,  for the most part, possess average talent.  </P> <P> The Rams don't need a new coach. They need ownership whose first priority is  fielding a championship football team, and isn't afraid to pay the people to  get the job done.  </P> <P> BOB BURRIS  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

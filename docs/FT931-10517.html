			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Italy reduces banks' reserve requirements THE Italian government has lowered the proportion of funds commercial banks have to deposit with the Bank of Italy, to try to reduce the country's high borrowing costs. However, the decision to cut obligatory reserve requirements was greeted cautiously by bankers at the weekend, amid warnings that interest rates would not come down immediately. The move lowers to an average 17.5 per cent from 22.5 per cent the proportion of deposits and short-term certificates of deposit commercial banks have to place with the central bank. The reserve requirement is one of the highest in the western world, and has often been blamed for contributing to Italy's high interest rates and low bank profits. The move, long sought by bankers, follows last week's 0.5 percentage point cut to 11.5 per cent in the Bank of Italy's discount rate, and is a further response to growing recessionary pressures in the economy. As unemployment rises, industrialists have been demanding lower interest rates to stop output being stifled. The decision to cut reserve requirements, under discussion for some time, follows a similar move by Germany last month. The cut in the reserve requirement will create about L15,000bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in additional liquidity for commercial banks. A further L5,000bn should be freed by mid-March as a result of a reduction to 10 per cent from 22.5 per cent in the proportion of funds which banks raise from certificates of deposit of over 18 months' maturity and place with the Bank of Italy. However, Mr Tancredi Bianchi, the chairman of the Italian Bankers' Association, warned that no cut in lending rates would take place for some weeks. Other bankers, who have cut lending rates by between 0.5 and 1 point in response to the discount rate reduction, said their room for manoeuvre was restricted by the falling growth rates for deposits and by the Bank of Italy's decision to cut by half a point the interest rates its pays on the reserve placed with it.</p>

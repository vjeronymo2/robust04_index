			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Watchdog misinformed by MoD: Arms-for-Iraq inquiry told of 'ambiguous' status of ministry official THE MINISTRY of Defence misinformed a Whitehall watchdog about links between one of its officials and the proposed Pounds 1bn sale of Hawk trainer jets to Iraq, the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday. The official, Mr David Hastie, was appointed by the MoD in April 1988 as 'business development adviser' on secondment from British Aerospace where he was a marketing executive. Documents made available to the inquiry show that Mr Hastie was recruited primarily because of his links to the Hawk sale, which was actively pursued by BAe and MoD officials until the summer of 1989. The sale was stopped on the insistence of Baroness Thatcher, the then prime minister. In a letter written by the ministry to the Civil Service Commission in April 1989, asking to extend his contract, Mr Hastie was described as being involved in the development of the European Fighter Aircraft and in helping small businesses. No mention was made of the Hawk contract. The commission supervises Whitehall recruitment, particularly non-advertised appointments from the private sector. Mr Ian McDonald, a senior MoD official, told the Scott inquiry yesterday that Mr Hastie's appointment was judged by the ministry to be 'for the good of HMG as well as for the company'. Mr McDonald was questioned about previously secret government papers that show Mr Hastie's appointment became the subject of controversy within Whitehall. Foreign Office officials vetoed a visit by Mr Hastie to the Baghdad International Military Fair in April 1989 as an MoD official attached to the ministry's defence export sales organisation. They judged that Mr Hastie's status as an MoD official was 'ambiguous' and risked being misinterpreted at a time when the government was bound by guidelines restricting defence sales to Baghdad. Subsequently Mr Hastie was allowed to be present at the fair without official status but as a member of the BAe team. Lord Justice Scott said that the documents made available to the inquiry suggested a situation of 'conflicting duties'. Subsequent answers to parliamentary questions about Mr Hastie, which were prepared by Mr McDonald, were neither informative nor complete but amounted to a 'fobbing off', the judge said. The hearing continues tomorrow.</p>

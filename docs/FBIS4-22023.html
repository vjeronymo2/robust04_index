			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- According to information  released by the chief federal prosecutor's office, two vehicles,  possibly used by the Red Army Faction (RAF) in attacks, have  been found. A Karlsruhe Office press release on Thursday [14  April] says that the vehicles, found on 2 February and 14 March,  are registered to Klaus Steinmetz, liaison man of the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution, whose information  led to the bloody antiterrorist operation in Bad Kleinen.    Already, on 24 March, the chief federal prosecutor initiated  investigations of unknown perpetrators on suspicion of RAF  membership and causing a bomb explosion. A passenger car and a  motorcycle were discovered. The chief federal prosecutor's  office did not reveal where the vehicles were found. Both  vehicles have reportedly been used "by a great number of  persons" in the past. Technical analysis of the passenger car  turned up evidence that might indicate its use for terrorist  crimes.</p>

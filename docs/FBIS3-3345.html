			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa at a </F> news conference with foreign and Japanese correspondents at the  New Century Hotel in Beijing -- live, with passage-by-passage  translation into Mandarin]    [Text] [Unidentified Japanese official] I am sorry for  keeping you waiting. Please, take your seats. Now we will hold a  news conference by Prime Minister Hosokawa. The prime minister  will make a statement before fielding questions.    [Hosokawa] I would like to say a few words before fielding  questions at this news conference. I am visiting China at the  invitation of Premier Li Peng. During a series of meetings with  Premier Li Peng, President Jiang Zemin, and other Chinese  leaders, I was able to have a candid and significant exchange of  views. I had hoped to visit China as soon as possible after I  took office and I am very pleased to realize my visit to this  country. I would like to express my gratitude to Premier Li Peng  and other Chinese officials for warmly greeting me.    I have valued Japan-China relations as one of the most  important pillars of Japan's foreign policy. Japan-China  relations have entered a new stage after marking the 20th  anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations and the  15th anniversary of the conclusion of the peace and friendship  treaty, and our relations have continued to make good  development. As you know, the emperor and empress recently  visited China. I had a candid exchange of views with Chinese  leaders on how to develop Japan-China relations, which have  entered the new stage, into a future-oriented relationship that  will be able to make contributions to the world in the 21st  century. I confirmed with Chinese leaders to strengthen  cooperative ties between both countries.    I and Chinese leaders touched on many aspects of Japan-China  relations. I believe that China's reform and open up policy has  been contributing to peace and prosperity not only in China, but  in the region, and Japan will provide all possible support to  China's efforts. It will provide the fourth yen-based loan and  cooperate with China's bid for GATT membership from the  standpoint of Japan's intention to assist China's efforts.    During my stay in Beijing, Japan-China accord on cooperation  in protecting environment was concluded and I think the  conclusion of the accord is very meaningful as a specific  indication of bilateral cooperation between the two countries.    Regarding the Japan-China economic relations, both trade and  investment have largely expanded between the two countries in  the past few years and I think this is a very desirable  development and the future of relations between the two  countries is bright. We confirmed that both Japan and China will  continue to exert efforts for further development of our  economic relations.    I and Chinese leaders confirmed the need to promote the  exchange of youths and culture between the two countries. In  this connection, both Japan and China have cooperated for  preserving the Changan Palace in Chengdu, capital of Tang, which  was a major city in the history of exchanges between Japan and  China.    At the series of meetings, I and Chinese leaders affirmed  that Japan and China will cooperate for and make vigorous  contributions to the world peace and prosperity. Specifically, I  think that I was able to have a candid exchange of views with  Chinese leaders on the issue of North Korea's nuclear  development, Japan-China cooperation in the Asian and Pacific  region, arms control and disarmament, military moves in the  region, and human rights. As for the issue of North Korea's  nuclear development, during a series of meetings with Chinese  leaders, I told them that Japan is deeply concerned over the  insufficiency of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency and the failure of North-South working-level talks  to reach any agreement. Since this is an important issue related  to the security of northeastern Asia, Japan and China share the  same [ninshiki] understanding. I believe that we were able to  confirm the importance of having close contact with each other  for a settlement of this issue.    In my speech to the Diet in August 1993 shortly after I took  office, I expressed my feeling from the standpoint of looking at  the past as it was. During the series of meetings with Premier  Li Peng and President Jiang Zemin, I told them that I intend to  further develop a future-oriented relationship with China from  the standpoint of reflecting upon what Japan did to China in the  past. I intend to work to develop Japan-China relations in the  future.    Although my visit to China is brief, I have been able to  witness major changes taking place in China and Chinese people  full of confidence, and I am greatly impressed by them during my  stay in China. I will stop tomorrow in Shanghai and am looking  forward to touring the New Pudong Area that symbolizes China's  reform and open up policy.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Appointments: The Midas touch for Carpetland? Carpetland, the management buy-out company hoping to rise from the Lowndes Queensway ashes, has chosen Julian Lee as its non-executive chairman. Lee appears to have been picked not for any retailing savvy but rather for the Midas touch that he exhibited in leading the Bricom buy-out of the non-financial interests of British &amp; Commonwealth - which he successfully sold to a Swedish-led group of investors two years later, in a deal which increased staff and management's investment by a factor of 25. A chartered accountant by training and a partner at Arthur Andersen until 1982, Lee joined Phibro, the Salomon subsidiary, briefly becoming international chief operating officer in London before moving to B&amp;C in 1985. As Lee tells Lowndes Queensway employees involved in last August's buy-out how to make a go of Carpetland, one of his competitors will be Sir Philip Harris, former employer of many Carpetland staff. The carpet baron who personally made a Pounds 70m profit when he sold out of Lowndes Queensway two years before it collapsed in a heap of debt, is well into his next carpet business, Carpetright, which is already doing well enough for Sir Philip to be considering a stock market flotation.</p>

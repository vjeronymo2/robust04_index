			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Observer: Jilting Jones Gwyn Jones, the flamboyant 44-year-old businessman who ceased to chair the Welsh Development Agency only a week before yesterday's blistering attack on the agency's management style by the Commons public accounts committee, no doubt hopes that all is behind him as he returns full-time to his other interests. In one important respect, however, Jones, who is a non-executive director of Tesco, is not yet shot of his public sector responsibilities, having been installed as the BBC's national governor for Wales at the beginning of last year. The MPs tartly note that some of his public and private appointments 'may well have resulted from his chairmanship of the WDA'. Hence the odd awkward question as to whether someone whose management team 'presided over a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of control and accountability' is best qualified to do the BBC job which runs until the end of 1996.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] At its session today, the Croatian Government  examined the implementation of the second phase of the  stabilization program, and the situation in Croatia's energy  network in the light of certain misunderstandings as regards  Krsko nuclear power plant. Among other things, it also examined  the situation in Croatia's railways. [passage omitted]    One of the most important points on the agenda was entitled:  the situation in Croatia's energy network. This referred mainly  to certain cases of incomprehension and misunderstanding between  the Slovene and Croatian sides about the Krsko nuclear plant,  and as regards an outstanding debt owed by the Croatian  Electricity Board to the Krsko nuclear plant. However, this is  only a pretext for some disagreements; the real reasons are of  another nature. Minister of Industry Nadan Vidosevic said there  will be no problem about paying the 40 million German mark debt.  He added:    [Begin Vidosevic recording] The central issue is that we are  demanding an interstate treaty, we want extremely clear and  correct relations, and we are demanding the protection of 50  percent of our property, which according to some estimates is  around $1 billion. This is a huge sum which Croatia, acting as a  responsible country, simply has to protect. That is the central  issue.    I hold that we simply ought to protect our interests, and  strictly abide by the standpoint that we will settle our  financial obligations, but the Slovene side has to accept the  drawing up of an interstate treaty; we must return to the  framework of the 1970 agreement, according to which 19 Croats  will go back to work [in the nuclear plant].

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Stock Exchange criticised over role in Astra collapse THE STOCK EXCHANGE and accountants Stoy Hayward were roundly criticised yesterday for their role in events that led to the collapse of Astra Holdings, the munitions company linked to the Iraqi supergun affair. A report from the Department of Trade and Industry also showed that Astra's short, but spectacular, publicly quoted existence began in 1986 in controversial circumstances. According to the report, directors of the then private Astra falsified invoices to boost profits and meet a forecast that allowed it to make a reverse takeover and become a public company. Last September the DTI sent the Serious Fraud Office a dossier on the Astra affair, but the SFO has said it 'did not justify' a criminal investigation. Former directors of Astra, who were also criticised, tipped off the UK intelligence services in September 1989 about a suspicious contract under which their new Belgian subsidiary was supplying propellant to Iraq via Jordan. The 560-page report concentrates on the financial circumstances surrounding the disastrous 1989 acquisition of PRB, a Belgian munitions company, and an accompanying Pounds 36m rights issue. It shows serious failures by the Stock Exchange and Paine Webber, Astra's financial advisers, to ensure proper monitoring of circulars to shareholders that accompanied the rights issue. The Exchange allowed the circular to be issued without the normal letter from Astra's advisers to verify that Astra had adequate working capital. The Exchange said yesterday it regretted that that had happened. Management in the new listings department had been changed 15 months ago. Stoy Hayward, Astra's auditors, were also criticised for not being more forthcoming with information about the company's parlous working capital position in 1989 and for signing annual accounts in 1987 that did not reflect a true and fair view. Stoy Hayward denied the accusations. Report details, Page 20</p>

Kayoko Hosokawa said, "It is natural that the premier and  the  chief cabinet secretary express different opinions," noting that  the Hosokawa Cabinet is different from previous governments  under control of the Liberal Democratic Party. The difference  between Hosokawa and Takemura "doesn't mean a gap between them  has widened," she said. "Contrary to media reports, their  relationship is not serious."    She also told reporters she has doubts about the media  because they often distort facts or write stories based on  imagination.    She did not say whether the prime minister wanted to remove  Takemura from the key post of chief cabinet secretary and give  him another position. The premier has expressed hopes of  reorganizing his six-month cabinet later this month, which the  media has speculated could mean the removal of Takemura.    Parties in Hosokawa's ruling coalition are divided on an  early cabinet reshuffle, with the Social Democratic Party (SDP),  the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and Takemura's Sakigake  (Harbinger) against it, and Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and  Komeito pushing strongly for it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Haggling Over Speaker, Caucuses on </F> Eve of Inaugural Sitting of 12th Legislature"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- The search for agreement on  a Senate speaker continued Thursday evening [14 April], as  parliamentary caucuses formed in the run-up to tomorrow's first  sitting of the 12th legislature.    After a meeting between senators from across the political  spectrum failed to produce accord on an institutional figure to  take the Senate speaker's chair this afternoon, People's Party  and Left Democrat Party representatives were reported to be  holding further talks this evening.    In the Lower House, where the right-wing Freedom Front has  an  absolute majority, Northern Leaguer Irene Pivetti has been  tapped for the speaker's chair. In the Senate, where the Front  is a few seats short of a majority, things are more complicated.  The Northern League seemed determined to see Forza Italia's  Carlo Scognamiglio placed in the Senate speaker's chair, despite  the claims from Northern League chief Umberto Bossi earlier this  afternoon that he did "not give a damn" about whether the  economics professor made it or not.    "Let's not bandage our heads up before we get clobbered,"  said Francesco Speroni, himself originally considered likely to  become the right-wing alliance's candidate for the top Senate  job.    Roberto Maroni, the League's Lower House whip in the last  legislature, commented "if Scognamiglio does not get elected  then we will have to go back to the ballot box.... If  Scognamiglio does not get elected, then (out-going Senate  Speaker Giovanni) Spadolini will be, with the votes of the  opposition which would mean that they had a majority. So  President (Oscar Luigi) Scalfaro would have to give them a  mandate."    Scalfaro will hand out a prime ministerial mandate after the  houses have elected their speakers.    Meanwhile, parties are preparing for the opening of  parliament by selecting whips and putting together caucuses.    The National Alliance, heir to the neo-fascist Italian  Social  Movement, named Giuseppe Tatarella as its Lower House whip  today, while the Northern League handed out more minor posts but  did not choose whips. Roberto Maroni is unlikely to return to  his Lower House floor leader place, but Francesco Speroni may  stay on as Senate whip, well-informed sources said.    The Christian Democrat Centre, the right-wing of the old  Christian Democrat Party which split off when this renamed  itself the People's Party, opted today to form its own  parliamentary group, rather than merging with Forza Italia. The  caucus will be closely linked to that of Forza Italia, alongside  which it fought last month's elections under the Freedom Front  banner.    Heading the Christian Democrat Centre's whips in the Lower  House is likely to be Clemente Mastella.    On the left of the house, talks between the eight  Progressive  allies to form a single caucus ended with a decision to go ahead  without the Socialists and Reformed Communists. The Progressive  caucus will consist of 213 deputies and 122 senators, a  communique released this evening said.    Well-informed sources said that Progressive members, the  Greens and Network, were championing out-going Lower House  Speaker Giorgio Napolitano as Lower House whip for the  Progressives, but this has not been officially confirmed.    The Socialists, who decided today to keep up their own  `visibility' in a separate parliamentary group, said they would  be closely linked with the Progressive caucus.    When the Senate meets tomorrow at 1030 (0830 GMT) for its  first session of the 12th legislature, 87-year-old life Senator  Francsco de Martino will preside for the second time, in his  capacity as older member of the house.    Voting for a new Senate speaker will take place in a secret  ballot, with an absolute majority needed to win in the first two  rounds of voting, to be held tomorrow, and an absolute majority  of senators present needed to win in the third ballot. A run-  off between the third ballot's two top candidates will decide  the final winner if the vote goes to a fourth round.    A breakdown of Senate seats on the basis of results in the  March 27-28 general elections is as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |154                                   |Freedom Front (Forza Italia, Northern |  |                                      |League, National Alliance, Christian  |  |                                      |Democrat Centre)                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |31                                    |Pact for Italy (People's Party, Segni |  |                                      |Pact)                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1                                     |Val D'Aosta Union                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3                                     |South Tyrol Party                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2                                     |Pannella Ticket                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |122                                   |Progressives (Left Democrats, Communi-|  |                                      |st Refoundation, Network, Greens, Dem-|  |                                      |ocratic Alliance, Social Christians,  |  |                                      |Socialists, Magris Ticket)            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2                                     |Others                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |11                                    |Life senators                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      In the Lower House, which meets at 1000 (0800 GMT), the job  of overseeing procedures will go to Alfredo Biondi, the oldest  of the deputy speakers in the out-going legislature.    To win the speaker's seat in the first round of voting, a  candidate needs 420 votes, or those of two-thirds of deputies.  In the second and third rounds, a winner would need the support  of two thirds of those voting. From the fourth vote on, an  absolute majority is needed.    On the basis of last month's election results, the  party-by-party breakdown should be as follows:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |366                                   |Freedom Front 122 Northern League     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |109                                   |National Alliance                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |95                                    |Forza Italia                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |32                                    |Christian Democrat Centre             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |6                                     |Pannella Ticket                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |2                                     |Autonomous tickets                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |213                                   |Progressive 114 Left Democrat         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |41                                    |Communist Refoundation                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |18                                    |Democratic Alliance                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |15                                    |Socialists                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |11                                    |Greens                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |8                                     |Network                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |6                                     |Social Christians                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |46                                    |Pact for Italy                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |33                                    |People's Party                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |13                                    |Segni Pact                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |3                                     |South Tyrol Party                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1                                     |Val D'Aosta Union                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1                                     |Independent                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The 12th legislature is younger, more female, and more  erudite than the previous one, and contains over 400 new faces.  The average age in the Lower House has gone down from 49.8 top  46.3, while in the Senate the drop is from 54.9 to 52.4.    The female presence in the Lower House has risen from eight  percent to 13.9 percent, but in the Senate it has remained more  or less stable.    Only 30.9 percent of deputies and 40.4 percent of Senators  have previous parliamentary experience, against an average of 44  percent last time round. Forza Italia boasts 95 percent of new  faces, followed by the Northern League with 44.4 percent of  newcomers in the Lower House and 61 percent in the Senate.    University professors account for 25.8 percent of senators  and 17.9 percent of deputies, while 13.3 percent of deputies and  12.4 percent of Senates are lawyers or judges. Almost 76 percent  of senators have a university degree, making the upper house  more learned than the Lower, where 67.5 percent have degrees.    Law is the degree favoured by Italy's law-makers, but they  must have been wishing they had studied geography when they  found themselves having to make their way around the  labyrinthine corridors of the parliament buildings with no maps  provided.    The next step after speakers are elected will be forming a  government, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro due to hand out  a prime ministerial mandate as soon as this essential  institutional task is carried out.    Most bets for the premier's office are being placed on Forza  Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi, who was responsible for putting  together the Freedom Front alliance of his party, the Northern  League, National Alliance and some smaller parties.    Berlusconi found an unlikely champion today in the shape of  Serb ultra-nationalist Voyslav Seselj who welcomed the  right-wing victory and said it was the sole reason for Italy not  having been bombed after NATO jets took off from these shores on  their recent air strike against the Bosnian town of Goradze.    "Berlusconi is a patriot, and he will not go against his  country's interests, and therefore he will object to NATO's  taking off once again from bases in his country to strike Serbs  in Bosnia," explained Seselj.</p>

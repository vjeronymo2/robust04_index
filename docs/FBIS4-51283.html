			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Foreign  Ministry released a statement here today on U.S. President  Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation (MFN)  trading status. The full text is as follows:    On May 26, President Bill Clinton of the United States  announced his decision to extend China's MFN status for  1994-1995 and to delink future annual MFN review from human  rights issue. This decision will create favorable conditions  for the further strengthening and expansion of trade and  economic cooperation between the two sides and the improvement  and growth of the overall relations between the two countries.  It therefore serves the fundamental interests of both countries  and peoples. The Chinese Government and people welcome this  decision of President Clinton.    The MFN treatment that China and the United States grant to  each other in accordance with the agreement on trade relations  between the two governments is purely a reciprocal and  mutually-beneficial arrangement that serves the interests of  both sides. It constitutes the basis for normal trade between  them. We have consistently opposed linking MFN with non-trade  issues or attaching conditions and requirements. What the U.S.  side did in the past few years on the MFN issue has impaired the  bilateral trade and economic exchanges and the overall relations  between the two countries, to the strong dissatisfaction of the  two peoples. We have to point out with regret that while  announcing the renewal of China's MFN status, the U.S. side  stated that the existing sanctions against China would be  maintained. It should be pointed out in particular that the  U.S. side has made unwarranted charges about human rights  situation in China. This constitutes an interference in China's  internal affairs, which is totally unacceptable to us. We hope  that the U.S. Government, proceeding from the fundamental  interests of the two countries and two peoples, will immediately  remove all sanctions against China and abandon all measures  detrimental to the development of bilateral relations.    China and the United States share broad interests. The  current situation offers a historical opportunity for the  enhancement of Sino-American relations. The Chinese Government  attaches importance to these relations and has made and will  continue to make major efforts for their improvement and growth.  We hope that the U.S. Government, on its part, will take a  realistic and forward-looking stand in the overall interests of  Sino-American relations and take concrete action to show its  sincerity for enhancing relations between the two countries. We  are convinced that so long as both sides strictly abide by the  guidelines and principles set forth in the three Sino-American  joint communiques, enhance mutual trust, reduce troubles,  develop cooperation and refrain from confrontation,  Sino-American relations will enjoy smooth and healthy progress.</p>

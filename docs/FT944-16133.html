			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Murdoch prepares for family control Mr Rupert Murdoch, the News Corporation chairman,is planning to strengthen the position of his children by ensuring that they will eventually control all the family interests in the international media group. The News Corp chairman told the magazine Business Review Weekly that he planned to buy the 40 per cent of Cruden Investments, the family investment vehicle, not already held by his immediate family. Cruden owns about 32 per cent of News Corp - a stake now worth around ADollars 4.83bn (USDollars 3.55bn). Mr Murdoch plans to buy the 40 per cent back from members of the extended Murdoch family over the next five to 10 years, although he declined to say how this would be financed. Mr Murdoch, in Australia for News Corp's forthcoming annual meeting, told Business Review: 'The arrangement is confidential but it will lead to my children's trusts eventually having 100 per cent of Cruden Investments.' Although financial problems in recent years have led to a dilution of the Cruden stake in News Corp, Mr Murdoch has always been keen to retain as much control as possible and to pass on that control to his children. He argued in the interview that without an effective controlling family stake in News Corp, the company could not have been built to its current size. Asked which of his two daughters and two sons he would like to succeed him Mr Murdoch, 63, is quoted as saying: 'I hope we can work it out between us.' He added, however, that he would probably make a judgment about his successor in about 20 years. Mr Murdoch's 23-year-old son Lachlan, who was recently appointed general manager of News Corp-owned Queensland Newspapers, was present at the interview. He told the magazine that his father's successor could come from inside or outside of the family and should be whomever was best for the company. Mr Murdoch also defended the controversial plans for a one-for-one issue of limited voting shares. 'The News Corp shares will do just great and Australian people can buy their voting shares and the Americans can buy limited-voting shares and get the bigger dividend,' he said. Earlier this week Mr Murdoch moved to make the preference shares more attractive by ensuring that their holders would receive a dividend premium of at least 20 per cent. The new shares would also participate on the same basis as the ordinary shares in any takeover bid for the company.</p>

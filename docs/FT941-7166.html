			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances 2.2% as Hong Kong falls sharply Reports that the US would tolerate a weaker yen depressed the Japanese currency against the dollar, and the Nikkei average closed up 2.2 per cent on active dealer and arbitrage buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 gained 423.65 to 19,765.48 after opening at a low of 19,389.24 and reaching a high of 19,792.28 in the afternoon session. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 29.77 to 1,607.62 while the Nikkei 300 rose 5.69 to 297.52. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 6.62 to 1,328.22. Share prices initially rose on strong buying by foreign investors, followed by arbitrage buying. Activity was triggered by the fall of the yen to the Y106 level on reports that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, had made comments in favour of a weaker yen. A Japanese finance ministry official later denied the report in the early afternoon. Mr Yutaka Nakai at Daiwa Securities said that share prices would remain stable ahead of the March 11 settlements for Nikkei futures contracts as long as the yen did not strengthen against the dollar. 'Whether arbitrageurs will roll over their positions or not will depend on the currency.' Volume rose to 470m shares against 274m. Gainers overwhelmed losers by 975 to 94, with 108 issues remaining unchanged. Hopes of a bottoming out in earnings boosted electronics issues. Hitachi, the most active issue of the day, rose Y18 to Y915 on foreign buying and Toshiba rose Y9 to Y747. Sony advanced Y160 to Y6,300. Reports that the company would sell Columbia, its movie company, at a profit also attracted buyers in spite of denials by company officials. Nippon Suisan, the fishery group, rose Y26 to Y417 on reports that the company has developed a technology to refine a fatty acid found in fish oil believed to activate the human brain. Other fisheries were also higher, with Maruha up Y16 to Y376 and Nichiro adding Y17 to Y377. Arbitrage buying supported bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y60 to Y3,260 and Fuji Bank rose Y80 to Y2,280. Brokers were also higher with Nomura Securities up Y60 to Y2,290. In Osaka, the OSE average jumped 378.40 to 21,815.49 in volume of 66.9m shares. Roundup Some sharp falls were seen in regional markets. HONG KONG finished 3.1 per cent lower on renewed selling triggered by the decision to press ahead with local political reforms. The Hang Seng index tumbled 331.21 to 10,432.02. Most blue chips suffered from the late sell-off. HSBC Holdings, the most actively traded stock, slid HKDollars 2 to finish at HKDollars 115 while its Hang Seng Bank unit fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 70.50. Cheung Kong shed HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 43.50 and Jardine Matheson lost HKDollars 3.50 to HKDollars 68.50. SINGAPORE fell 1.6 per cent in reaction to the government's failure to cut corporate taxes in the 1994-95 budget. The Straits Times Industrials index fell 38.67 to 2,385.24 but was off an intra-day low of 2,376.06. SEOUL was dragged down by a sell-off of blue chips and worries about liquidity constraints. The composite stock index closed 17.86 down at 932.15. MANILA declined for the fourth straight day, weighed down by the proposed doubling of a stock transaction tax. The composite index slid 39.94 to 2,956.27. PLDT lost 45 pesos at 2,090 pesos after an overnight fall in New York while Philippine National Bank shed 15 pesos to 640 pesos. TAIWAN gave up small early gains to close 1.7 per cent lower, undermined by a late plunge in shares of Formosa group firms in the wake of 1993 results from Formosa Plastics and Nan Ya on Wednesday. The weighted index closed 98.48 down at 5,670.71, off a low of 5,647, in modest turnover of TDollars 46.39bn. Formosa Plastics ended TDollars 2.30 lower at TDollars 48.70 and Nan Ya lost TDollars 3.50 to TDollars 58. AUSTRALIA finished lower amid worries about higher interest rates and some disappointment about recent corporate results and the All Ordinaries closed 21.9 down at 2,197.0. NEW ZEALAND held firm, the NZSE-40 capital index hovering around its opening level throughout the day before some late buying tipped it 4.03 higher to finish at 2,269.26. Fletcher Challenge rose 7 cents to NZDollars 3.33 following its half year profit announcement on Wednesday. BANGKOK lost momentum on a lack of positive news coupled with fears of an upward trend in US interest rates. The SET index fell 11.11 to 1,419.54 in thin turnover of Bt6.8bn. BOMBAY saw demand from investors under the mistaken impression that passenger fares and freight rates had been only marginally raised in the Railway budget being announced in New Delhi. The BSE 30-share index rose 85.44 to 4,114.22.</p>

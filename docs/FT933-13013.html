			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / International Company News: KLM, Northwest in flights deal KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said yesterday all its flights to the US from Amsterdam would operate as code-sharing services with Northwest Airlines, the US carrier in which it owns a minority stake. The joint flights are due to begin in late September and will cover all 11 KLM destinations in the US. The decision means that the airlines will fly their existing routes between the US and Amsterdam under a new dual flight number based on the old Northwest and the old KLM code. 'By operating through joint ventures, the airlines can present their combined product through a central reservation system, optimising service to customers,' the airlines said. The use of a single flight number combining both airlines' codes is designed to encourage Northwest passengers to transfer to KLM flights, and vice versa. Since the start of the summer season, the airlines have experimented with code sharing on flights to Minneapolis/St Paul, Detroit and Boston. The eight other cities that will be added are New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>

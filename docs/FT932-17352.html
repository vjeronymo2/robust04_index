			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Letter: A better way for the UK government to borrow money Sir, Your leading article, 'Gilts galore' (March 30), with its description of the vagaries of short and long-dated issues, makes me think once more of the vast waste of effort for highly intelligent people in the City of London who spend their time guessing and second guessing one another as to the levels of inflation over the coming years. Why doesn't the government raise its money in the form of indexed linked gilts and cut out all this nonsense? I know that the Treasury loves to rob the investors by borrowing money and then paying it back in trash 20 years later, but since we are the real borrowers and we are the real victims, are we not kidding ourselves? Might it not be cheaper for us to borrow real money and pay back real money and tell the yuppies to do some useful work instead? We could then borrow at about 3 per cent real instead of 4 to 6 per cent, and save the premium we pay for unnecessary risk. Douglas Dale, 'Birch Crest', 97 Hilderstone Road, Meir Heath, Stoke-on-Trent ST3 7NS</p>

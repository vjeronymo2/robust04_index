			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Observer: Light on Bright Whatever versions of the truth politicians are expected to serve up to the House of Commons, the role of John Major's Graham Bright is clear enough. As parliamentary private secretary to the PM, his duty is to relay the concerns of backbenchers, in pretty much unexpurgated form. Which is why Major should take note of the growing unease at Westminster that the 51-year-old MP for Luton South is adopting an imperious, dismissive approach to his colleagues' worries. Those who remember the last Tory leadership crisis are warning the boss not to repeat Lady Thatcher's mistake - of listening too closely to her PPS Peter Morrison and hence underestimating the strength of feeling on the backbenches.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Japan hints at move on rice THE Japanese government has started the painful debate over the opening of the rice market, as three cabinet ministers yesterday hinted the country would need to make a concession to ensure the success of multilateral trade talks. Ministers of finance, trade and foreign affairs said Japan would continue to argue that an exception be made for rice on the grounds of 'food security', but they also indicated that pressure from the international community would probably force a market opening. However, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and the agriculture ministry insist the market will remain closed to imports, regardless of the agreement between the US and the European Community on farm trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Like the French government, Tokyo is under intense pressure from farmers to defend the rice market, but there is a general recognition within the government that a concession must be made. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister for international trade and industry, hinted Japan would be willing to compromise, as did Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, who suggested that rice may not be suitable for tariffication (the replacement of existing trade barriers by a tariff schedule). Mr Hata and other ministers are concerned that tariffication would lead to a gradual and inevitable increase in the foreign share of the Japanese rice market. They would prefer to make a single, symbolic opening, for example, by allowing a foreign share of 3-5 per cent. Meanwhile, Mr Watanabe said other countries must recognise that rice is a 'difficult issue' for Japan, but a conclusion to the Gatt Uruguay Round 'will benefit all free-trade nations'. A Japanese concession is likely to come after prodding by other nations, though the ministers' comments yesterday suggest the agreement between the US and EC has ended most hopes that a market opening may be avoided. The strongest indication of a political willingness to open the market came from Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, who said discussions must start immediately at the highest levels. The agriculture ministry is responsible for the rice issue, and it must agree on compensation with Japanese farmers before a decision can be announced by the government.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH MERCHANTS PROTEST PLANS TO SELL THEIR STATE-OWNED SHOPS;  </P> <P> CAPITALISM: EMPLOYEES FEAR JOBS WILL BE LOST IN TRANSITION FROM COMMUNISM TO A  MARKET ECONOMY.  </P> <P> Merchants and restaurateurs shuttered thousands of state-owned shops across the  country Thursday to protest government plans to auction off their workplaces to  private owners.  </P> <P> The labor action demanding that workers be given preferential conditions to buy  into their own firms threatens to escalate and signals a souring of the public  mood toward the new democratic government.  </P> <P> It also illustrates the difficulty that workers in the former Communist nations  have in coping with some unfamiliar, and what they see as unfair, demands of  capitalism.  </P> <P> Parliament has not yet endorsed details of the government plan to privatize  70,000 small businesses beginning this fall. But a published draft of the  government proposal has angered employees of retail and service shops who fear  for their jobs and their chances of participating in Czechoslovakia's  transition to a market economy.  </P> <P> To protest the competitive bidding that the state intends to use to extract  itself from the service industry, Czechoslovak waiters and hairdressers, shoe  repairers and kiosk clerks posted strike signs at 3 p.m. and turned away  customers for three hours.  </P> <P> "We don't want auctions, because then we could be bought out by the local Mafia  -- the former Communist Party officials and money changers and others who have  benefited from corruption," protested Jaroslav Novy, manager of the  Staromestska Restaurant named for the cobblestone square in central Prague  where it stands.  </P> <P> "There's too much uncertainty about the future in the country now," Novy  lamented, huddled with fellow strikers in a room off the cluttered kitchen he  oversees. "I understand that the government is under pressure to do something,  but this is not the way it should proceed."  </P> <P> The strikers said they want the state to set a price for each enterprise so  workers can pool their funds to form ownership cooperatives. They also objected  to a proposed requirement that a 50% down payment on each business be made in  cash.  </P> <P> "I've been here for 21 years, starting out as the lowliest waiter," said Jiri  Svoboda, manager of the Green Frog Restaurant tucked into the executioner's  quarters of a 17th-Century palace. "I should be allowed to own part of this  restaurant, but I've raised four children and have no money."  </P> <P> The labor unrest began Wednesday with a symbolic one-hour closure, which was  expanded to three hours Thursday to step up the pressure. Czechoslovak Radio  said 1,750 shops were shut down in northern Moravia, and that the strike  appeared to have been broadly observed across the rest of the country as well.  The national Confederation of Trade Unions, which had encouraged only a  five-minute warning strike, said the protest action threatened to get out of  hand.  </P> <P> Thursday's strikes were the most extensive labor unrest to hit Czechoslovakia  since its peaceful revolt against communism last November.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, the government is talking more to economists than with the  people like us who want to own businesses," said Marian Sykora, a food-service  worker at the Prince Restaurant.  </P> <P> President Vaclav Havel met with federal and republic government leaders to  discuss the public backlash but emerged from the daylong talks to confirm that  the leadership won't artificially manipulate conditions for the selloff to  favor employees.  </P> <P> He told Czechoslovak television after the meeting that special bank loans will  be made available to groups of employees to finance up to half of the cost of  their enterprises. But the 50% down-payment requirement could exclude many  ordinary workers who have little or no savings on which to draw.  </P></p>

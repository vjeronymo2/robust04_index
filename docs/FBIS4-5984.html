			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Working people and  students in the northern half of Korea have condemned the South  Korean puppet clique for scheming to open the rice market.    The speakers at a meeting held at Kim Chaek University of  Technology on April 11 said the opening of agricultural market  is a brazen-faced act which can be perpetrated only by such  fellows as the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who makes no bones of  treachery and disguise and does not hesitate at betraying the  interests of the country and the nation, motivated by a lust for  power.    They said the South Korean rulers have offered not only the  rice market but also all the human and material resources of  South Korea for the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea and have  exacerbated North-South confrontation and pushed ahead with  preparations for a war against the North, according to the U.S.  strategy aimed at stifling the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea.    The speakers at meetings held at the Haksan Cooperative  Farm,  Hyongjesan district, and the Chilgol Cooperative Farm,  Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang, branded Kim Yong-sam, who has  throttled the peasants and devastated agriculture, as the most  heinous traitor to the nation.    They called on the peasants and other people of South Korea  to invigorate the struggle against the opening of the rice  market throughout South Korea so as to decisively smash the Kim  Yong-sam group's anti-national moves and finally defend the rice  market.</p>

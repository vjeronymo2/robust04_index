According to him, the first deputy  premier's decision not to join the reorganized government was  not unexpected.    "Evidently it's extremely hard, and maybe politically  illogical, to be the leader of a parliamentary faction and serve  as first deputy prime minister at the same time," Sergeyev said.  "The issue of whether Gaydar should be the leader of  parliamentary faction or first deputy premier has been raised  more than once, and now Gaydar made his choice."    Chernomyrdin did nothing to nudge Gaydar toward taking this  decision, Sergeyev stressed, because Gaydar was appointed first  deputy premier several months ago at Chernomyrdin's initiative.    As Sergeyev said, Gaydar's leaving the government will not  alter the policy of reforms pursued by the Cabinet led by  Chernomyrdin.    "The government has been, and will be, reformist. The course  of reforms underlies the government's program for 1994- 1995  approved by President Yeltsin," he said.    In answer to Interfax's question as to who may replace  Gaydar  in the government, Sergeyev said with reference to Viktor  Chernomyrdin that "this complicated question will be resolved by  the president together with the government's leadership".</p>

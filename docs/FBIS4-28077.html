			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 7 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  on Tuesday [7 June] welcomed the latest accord to restart  bilateral trade talks in financial services and intellectual  property rights.    Nobuo Matsunaga, Japanese Government representative for  external affairs, and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  confirmed the significance of the agreement during their  20-minute meeting here, Japanese officials said.    Matsunaga, former Japanese ambassador to the U.S., and  Kantor  are in Paris to attend a two-day ministerial conference of  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  that opened Tuesday.    Financial services and intellectual property rights have  been  added recently to the three priority industrial sectors for the  trade "framework" negotiations between Tokyo and Washington.    The original priority areas in the framework talks are  government procurement, insurance, and trade in autos and auto  parts.    Working-level talks on financial services began in Paris  earlier in the day between Japan's Finance Ministry and the U.S.  Treasury Department. This followed the resumption of insurance  trade talks in Tokyo last week after a hiatus of three and a  half months.    Financial services talks focus on ways to expand access by  U.S. investment advisers to Japan's pension market, deregulation  of securities business in Japan and steps to facilitate  international deals on financial services.    On intellectual property rights, Japan and the U.S. will  study how to protect patents involved in "reverse engineering"  for computer software.</p>

			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COWBOYS' SKID CONTINUES; PHOENIX WINS, 19-10  </P> <P> Jimmy Johnson's 0-for-the-NFL ordeal continues. This time, a Tom  Landry-schooled coach beat him.  </P> <P> Gene Stallings' Phoenix Cardinals let the Dallas Cowboys make all the critical  mistakes and cruised to a 19-10 victory Sunday as Johnson, Landry's successor,  saw his National Football League coaching record go to 0-8.  </P> <P> Stallings, an assistant under Landry for 14 years, threw a simple mistake-free  offense and a blitzing defense at Johnson and rookie quarterback Steve Walsh.  </P> <P> "We wanted the clock to run in this game and that's why we were conservative,"  Stallings said. "We wanted the game over so that's why we didn't come with  anything special on offense."  </P> <P> Michael Zordich returned an interception 16 yards for a touchdown and Al Del  Greco kicked four field goals as the Cardinals evened their record at 4-4.  </P> <P> "I was right there when Walsh threw the ball and it fell right in my hands  after it was tipped," Zordich said. "There was nobody in front of me. It was  just a matter of catching the ball and taking it in."  </P> <P> The Cowboys' 0-8 start is their second-worst in club history. Only the 1960  expansion team, which lost its first 10 games on the way to an 0-11-1 record,  was worse.  </P> <P> Johnson admitted his team was pressing.  </P> <P> "We're trying so hard that we're making mistakes," he said. "For the second  straight week, our opponent didn't have any turnovers. I guess we are pressing  as we try to make something happen and that in turn causes errors."  </P> <P> Zordich's third-quarter touchdown put Phoenix ahead 13-3. Cedric Mack tipped  the pass and the alert Zordich pulled it in.  </P> <P> "Somebody got a hand up and deflected the ball," Walsh said. "It was a big  play."  </P> <P> Stallings agreed.  </P> <P> "It was one of the key plays of the game. That and the fumble by Shepard on the  punt late in the game."  </P> <P> Tim McDonald's fourth-quarter interception set up Del Greco's third field goal,  a 31-yarder that made it 16-3 with 6:40 to play.  </P> <P> Walsh, booed heavily by the crowd of 44,431, struck back with 4:27 to play on a  37-yard scoring pass to Derrick Shepard, who outjumped two Cardinals for the  ball.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Today the Hungarian Civic Party of Slovakia  issued a call urging the coalition of three Hungarian parties.  Our Bratislava correspondent Ildiko Nagy outlines the document.    [Nagy] With respect to the activity of the governing party's  petition committee, which was formed at the weekend, aimed at  collecting 350,000 signatures to demand a referendum, today the  Hungarian Civic Party published an appeal. It calls on  Slovakia's citizens, especially the Hungarian electors, not to  join the call for a referendum, which [Prime Minister] Meciar  has been urging.    It also calls on the leaders of the Coexistence and the  Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement to start talks without  delay in preparation for a Hungarian three-party coalition, with  regard to the situation that has evolved and the possibility of  early elections.    The need for this coalition is also proved by what  [Coexistence leader] Miklos Duray said at today's news briefing  of the Coexistence, namely that prior to last week's parliament  session the Slovak opposition had not held talks with the  Hungarian parliamentary coalition on cooperation.

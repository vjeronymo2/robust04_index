			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Congressional mandate requires the gradual elimination of restrictions in existing gas transmission lines and existing hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide lines in a manner that will eventually make the lines piggable. Operators are only required to remove the restrictions when replacements are made on the pipeline. On those occasions, the economic burden of the upgrading is reduced because crews and equipment will be on the site and that portion of the pipeline will need to be out of service. Six of the commenters appear to have considered the favorable economics when they recommended that the upgrading for piggability cover the ``line segment'' or ``line section''. While ``line segment'' is frequently used in the gas regulations it is not defined, although it's used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similarly to ``line section'' (one commenter suggested it was the distance between two logical points e.g. compressor stations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in consideration of the comments ``line section'' is used in place of the term ``replacement transmission line'' in part 192, and ``line section'' is used in place of the term ``replacement pipeline'' in part 195, as those terms are used in the NPRM. ``Line section,'' as added to part 192 is similar to ``line section'' as it is defined in &sect;195.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In part 195, ``line section'' is currently defined in &sect;195.2 to mean a continuous run of pipe between adjacent pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and terminal or breakout tanks, between a pressure pump station and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves. Now, in part 192 ``line section'' is defined in &sect;192.3 to mean a continuous run of transmission line between adjacent compressor stations, between a compressor station and storage facilities, between a compressor station and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, &sect;&sect;192.150(a) and 195.120(a) have been revised to clarify that when a replacement is made of line pipe, line valve, line fitting, or other line component in an existing pipeline, covered by this rule, the complete line section must be made to accommodate smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, RSPA has modified the final rule in response to the comment from the gas transmission operator that felt replacements of certain partial segments within an existing valve section that are replaced because of MAOP class change or regular maintenance work requirements, should be excepted because of construction constraints. Although, the construction restraints were not specified, RSPA has addressed construction type problems with the procedure set out in &sect;&sect;192.150(c) and 195.120(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Launchers and Receivers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Several commenters agreed with statements in the NPRM that installation of pig traps should not be required by this rulemaking, but should be left to the discretion of pipeline operators. Also, a commenter agreed with the statement in the NPRM that operators should determine where pig traps are to be permanently located based on individual operating circumstances. A gas pipeline operator said that in a practical sense, it would be more cost effective to add launchers and receivers at the time of construction rather than after the transmission line is in service (which could again require the line to be taken out of service). The National Transportation Safety Board urged RSPA to revise its proposal so that facilities for entering and removing smart pigs are required on all pipelines capable of being traversed by such equipment. However, RSPA believes that revising the NPRM for this purpose would delay the regulatory effect of this rulemaking and the requirement may be included in a future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the final rule, as in the NPRM, RSPA has not included requirements for launchers or receivers. However, when the rulemaking mandated by the PLSA of 1992 is issued, RSPA may prescribe the circumstances for inspection with smart pigs. Such circumstances, if included in any final rule, may require facilities for launching or receiving smart pigs. In the meantime, RSPA urges pipeline operators to consider the economic advantages of voluntarily installing facilities, at the time of construction or replacement of pipelines, for launching and receiving smart pigs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Exemption of Gathering Lines <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Several commenters urged clarification of the exception for gas gathering lines in the proposed &sect;192.9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the comments, RSPA agrees that clarification is needed. Therefore, the exception, of the new &sect;192.150, has been retained and the current exception, as provided in &sect;192.1, has been referenced in the revised &sect;192.9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in &sect;&sect;192.150(b)(7) and 195.120(b)(6), RSPA has excepted offshore pipelines other than gas transmission or liquid main lines, 10 inches or larger, that transport gas or liquids to onshore facilities. Liquid gathering lines, which are defined in &sect;195.2, are included in this exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

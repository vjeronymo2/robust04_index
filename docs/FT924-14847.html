			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK seeks support for curb onBrussels BRITAIN yesterday continued its intense diplomatic activities in advance of next week's European Community summit in Birmingham by trying to persuade sceptical governments in Portugal and Spain to relax their opposition to weakening the powers of the European Commission. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, met his Portuguese colleague, Mr Jao de Deus Pinheiro, in Lisbon yesterday afternoon before flying to Madrid for late night talks with Mr Javier Solana, the new Spanish foreign minister. Portugal and Spain are worried that British and German efforts to widen the application of the principle of 'subsidiarity' - whereby the EC defers to member states in matters which can best be handled by national parliaments - constitutes an attack on the powers of Brussels. Mr Hurd said in Madrid that Germany had prepared a 'strong paper' on subsidiarity. This reportedly calls on the EC to defer to regional governments as well as to national ones. It has caused particular concern in Madrid, which fears such a proposal could be used by Spain's autonomous governments to weaken links with the central government. In general, both Portugal and Spain worry that trimming Commision powers will reduce the funds that the less developed EC partners rely on from the Community in order to narrow the gap with richer members. Seeking to allay such misgivings, Mr Hurd said: 'We do not intend to alter the balance of the (EC) institutions. We do not want take anything away from the Community, we want to add to it. We certainly do not want to make the Community's decisions more difficult.'</p>

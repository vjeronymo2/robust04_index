			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD CITIZEN TAKES HIS FIND TO DEPUTIES, HAS THEM SCURRYING  </P> <P> There it was, shiny and new and free for the taking: an expensive-looking  leather briefcase, lying in a Castaic dumpster.  </P> <P> And when retired handyman Irving Greenhouse spotted it Saturday, he figured it  would bring top dollar at the hospital thrift store where he works as a  volunteer.  </P> <P> But after Greenhouse, 73, showed his prize to the manager of his nearby mobile  home park, the man told him he had a problem on his hands: the briefcase was  stuffed with explosives.  </P> <P> Greenhouse got a similar reaction Sunday morning when he showed up with the  case unannounced at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in  Valencia. A sergeant took one look inside the case in the trunk of Greenhouse's  car and ordered most of his co-workers into the basement.  </P> <P> "It's easy to Monday-morning quarterback, and he's a very nice man . . . but I  wouldn't have touched it," Sgt. David Stunson said.  </P> <P> Sgt. Ron Moya of the sheriff's bomb squad said the explosives -- 20 strips of  rubberized material similar to plastic explosives, plus two coils of detonating  cord -- were "relatively stable" and posed little threat.  </P> <P> Moya said officers were trying to determine who owned the material, often used  in the aerospace and high-tech industries. He said it is being stored as  evidence in a magazine at the Peter Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic and will  be detonated later.  </P> <P> Greenhouse said he was scavenging for aluminum cans when he found the  briefcase. The dumpster is in a field off the Old Road near Parker Road,  surrounded by homes, some of which are as close as 100 feet.  </P> <P> Greenhouse's arrival at the station touched off a "quite hectic" scene as  deputies rushed to cordon off the street and a nearby parking lot and to herd  other station personnel into the basement, Moya said.  </P> <P> "At least he didn't dump it off somewhere else," Moya said. "He probably should  have called us first. . . . But being a good citizen, he brought it to the  station."  </P></p>

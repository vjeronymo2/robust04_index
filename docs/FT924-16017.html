			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Tender withdrawal signals Irish borrowing abroad THE Irish government yesterday withdrew a IPounds 10m exchequer bill tender after failing to receive any acceptable bids. The move signals the government's probable intention to reduce its variable rate borrowing and, instead, to borrow abroad. The weekly tender, small in comparison to the more usual IPounds 30m, was expected to draw bids at a high rate of about 16 per cent, in line with current interbank rates in the Dublin market. The central bank raised its short-term facility rates by 3 percentage points on Monday to 13.75 per cent, as pressure on the punt in the European exchange rate mechanism continued to cause liquidity problems in the Dublin money market. Mr Brendan Lynch, chief economist at Bloxham, the Dublin gilt brokerage, said the withdrawal of the tender was 'most unusual' and carried 'a very strong message that the government is going to start borrowing abroad'. Irish gilts have come under severe pressure since sterling left the ERM a fortnight ago. This fuelled doubts that Ireland would be able to hold its position within the ERM while the currency of its main trading partner, the UK, floated freely. Foreign holders of Irish gilts had, by yesterday, unloaded an estimated IPounds 500m to IPounds 600m worth of stock, representing 12 to 15 per cent of the IPounds 4bn they held two weeks earlier. This allowed Irish institutions to pick up bargains, but put pressure on the government to look towards foreign markets for its next round of borrowing. At the end of this month, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), which now handles Ireland's entire national debt of IPounds 25bn, has to refinance IPounds 230m of a maturing gilt issue. It is also committed to a IPounds 60m to IPounds 65m issue of its 2012 stock in the fourth quarter. No date for this has yet been set. Yields on benchmark Irish gilts have risen sharply in the past fortnight: the 20-year 8.75 per cent 2012 stock going from a yield of 8.7 per cent to 9.62 per cent; and the five-year 9 per cent 1996 capital loan stock rising more dramatically from 9.35 per cent to 11.35 per cent. A shift to foreign currency borrowing will mark a reversal of a now well-established policy to cap Ireland's foreign debt of IPounds 8.9bn at current levels, 65 per cent of which is denominated in D-Marks and Swiss francs. Analysts said, however, that as long as it is a short-term measure, foreign borrowing should help improve foreign currency reserves - sharply depleted by the support of the punt in the past two weeks - and improve liquidity in the interbank market, easing pressure on interest rates. 'It will also underline the government's determination to continue defending the punt,' said one analyst. Mr John Corrigan, the director for Irish pound borrowing at the NTMA, said: 'It would not be helpful if we were to start funding immediately. Our funding position is reasonably healthy. We will be able to take the redemption in our stride.' Monthly exchequer returns tend to show a surplus rather than a deficit in the second half of the year, while the total exchequer borrowing requirement for the year is not expected to exceed IPounds 300m. But about IPounds 400m to IPounds 500m in short-term exchequer notes are in circulation at any one time, and they require regular roll over and appear to be the first candidates for replacement by foreign debt. Should sterling continue to decline, budgetary targets for 1993 will be thrown off-track, as a loss of competitiveness to the UK will result in higher unemployment levels in Ireland and further pressure on government finances. The question of issuing debt as gilts or foreign currency-denominated bonds might then become more problematic.</p>

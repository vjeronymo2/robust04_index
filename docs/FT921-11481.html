			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Landowners' body launches 'manifesto' THE UK farm sector will not be able to sustain the rural economy single handed in the 1990s, according to the Country Landowners Association, which yesterday launched its Manifesto for the Countryside. The manifesto will be distributed to all MPs and parliamentary candidates for the coming election, said Mr John Fellowes, president of the CLA, which has 48,000 members. It calls for policies that 'promote profits, jobs, conservation and recreation'. The general thrust of the manifesto calls for greater flexibility, particularly in the areas of planning, taxation and farm tenancy legislation. For example, land ownership is classed as not being a business, Mr Fellowes said. Capital gains tax makes it impossible for landlords to exchange one asset for another. Pointing out that farm incomes had fallen by 30 per cent in the past two years, Mr Fellowes said no-one wanted to see the countryside derelict again, as it was in the 1930s. 'If you don't have profits in the countryside, you don't have a countryside,' he said.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Gaskell cutting payment to 4.25p Gaskell, the carpet group, is reducing its dividend from 8.5p to 4.25p for 1992, with a final of 2.75p, although it is not fully covered. The directors had reason to believe that 'we have have pased the low point in our recent company fortunes'. In the year turnover fell from Pounds 30.2m to Pounds 28.3m and pre-tax profit dropped from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 131,000. Earnings per share worked through to 1.6p (3.1p). Nearly all the decline in sales was in carpet tiles made by Bamber Carpets. The two principal subsidiaries recorded a small increase.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Madrid, 1 Mar (EFE) -- On the second day of his  state visit to Spain, Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem  stated on 1 March that his government "will do its utmost" so  Aerolineas Argentinas can reach a speedy settlement with the  Spanish carrier Iberia.    During a news conference at El Pardo Palace, the Argentine  head of state stated that negotiations with Iberia are not on  his agenda of talks with the Spanish head of government, Felipe  Gonzalez. He said nonetheless that he hoped both delegations'  experts "make their calculations again and work out an  agreement" in the forthcoming days.    In the meantime, Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo  on 28 February in Buenos Aires that negotiations between Iberia  and the Argentine Government geared to overcoming Aerolineas  Argentinas' financial crisis have been suspended after a  decision by the Spanish company.    Commenting on another subject, Menem on 1 March announced  that Argentina might join NAFTA in June.    The Argentine president was full of optimism that his  country, together with Colombia and Chile, will be able to join  NAFTA -- established between Canada, the United States, and  Mexico -- without having to sever its current commitments with  Mercosur [Common Market of the South].    "It is a question of making room for both agreements. It  goes without saying that if this is achieved Argentina will  stand to gain a lot," he said, adding that his country endorses  the U.S. project to create a free trade zone from Alaska to  Tierra del Fuego.    Menem was proud of his administration's economic  achievements, noting that his privatization policy was  instrumental in curbing inflation -- which in 1989-1990 ran at  approximately 22,000 percent -- to an estimated 4.5 percent this  year.    Menem believes the success of his economic policy "has no  secret. Markets have been totally liberated and an all-out  campaign against the fiscal deficit has been waged. We had to  perform major surgery without giving a general anesthetic and we  have obtained exceptional results. Argentina is at present the  country with the highest growth rate in the world following the  PRC and Thailand."    Menem noted: "It is all very well to say so, but it is quite  difficult to do it." He observed that the state's action has  been limited to "only the fields of justice, sanitation,  education, and security; the rest has been entrusted to the  private sector."    He added: "This privatization formula together with a dose  of wit and wisdom and a bit of luck have enabled us to turn  deficit-ridden state-owned enterprises like the telephone and  petroleum ones into profitable companies that pay taxes."    To this effect he remarked that Spanish entrepreneurs who  followed Gonzalez' advice concerning investments [in Argentina]  "are getting great results." He praised "the excellent"  bilateral relations between both countries.    Menem skirted the issue of his ideological and personal  preference for either the head of government, Felipe Gonzalez,  or Jose Maria Aznar, the president of the leading opposition  party, the Popular Party, whom he met at El Pardo Palace on 1  March.    "They are both friends of mine," he commented. "It is  important not to tie oneself down to ideological considerations  but rather to assess results, and both of them are contributing  greatly to democracy and freedom."    Menem added that the difference between Gonzalez and Aznar  "lies in the fact that Gonzalez is heading the government and  Aznar has not yet had the opportunity to do so. And I can tell  you from experience that it is one thing to engage in politics  from this side of the counter and a very different thing to do  so from the outside."    He underlined the role his country is playing in the  international scene, noting that an Argentine contingent of  1,350 men is currently part of the UN peacekeeping forces -- of  whom 1,078 are in Bosnia and the rest in Cyprus and Kuwait --  and is "ready to pay heed to UN requirements."    Regarding possible mediation between the United States and  Cuba, Menem said: "I have never offered myself as a mediator so  democracy may be re-established in Cuba, but I do share the  Ibero-American hope that Castro will accept democratic rule and  Cubans can soon elect their rulers."    Menem accepted the press' meddling in his private life with  resignation. "I cannot prevent it. They have the freedom to  say what is true and what is not. I assumed office having a  specific personal situation and my people know me and elected me  just as I am."    The Argentine president may run for the presidency a second  time if the constitutional reform -- which was the outcome of a  "very fruitful" dialogue and agreement with the Radical Civic  Union's Raul Alfonsin -- is passed. He said: "If I do my  homework well I may be elected. Otherwise, let them elect  someone else who does better than I."</p>

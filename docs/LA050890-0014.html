			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> CITY HALL PAPER WILL BE RECYCLED  </P> <P> The Simi Valley City Council on Monday unanimously approved a City Hall office  paper recycling program as part of a continuing effort to reduce the flow of  garbage into local landfills.  </P> <P> "This is great," Councilwoman Ann Rock said of the recycling program.  </P> <P> "Every little bit helps."  </P> <P> City officials estimate that the program will cost $1,150 to start up and  $2,300 to operate annually. But savings in regular trash collection charges and  the sale of recyclable paper is expected to generate $2,850 a year for the  city, a $550 profit.  </P> <P> Recyclable paper constitutes about 90% of the trash generated by City Hall  offices, according to a city staff report. Fax paper, computer paper and  envelopes make up a large portion of the recyclable materials, according to the  report.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Government Center and the cities of Ventura and Oxnard  already have similar recycling programs in place.  </P> <P> A recent state law requires that cities devise a plan by the end of the year to  reduce the flow of trash into landfills by 25% by 1995, and by 50% by the turn  of the century.  </P> <P> As part of its own effort to meet that goal, the Simi Valley City Council voted  last month to expand its curbside recycling program from 1,000 to 13,000  households. By April of 1991, the program is expected to serve all 25,000  households in the city. CARLOS V. LOZANO  </P></p>

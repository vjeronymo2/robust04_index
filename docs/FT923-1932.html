			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: A battle is won, but not yet the war FRANCE'S narrow endorsement of Maastricht was greeted with almost cathartic relief in Brussels, and calls for the Community to redouble efforts to secure economic, monetary and political union. But most officials recognised that what had been won in France was a battle, not the war. Quite apart from whether Danish voters can be persuaded to reverse last June's rejection of Maastricht, concern is growing in Brussels about whether Mr John Major, the British prime minister, can get the UK parliament to ratify the treaty, after the government's humiliating defeat on sterling policy last week. In a direct reference to Britain, a senior Commission official said 'one problem we can solve, but not two - especially if it is the UK.' 'The (British) problem was there even before we had the referendum,' said Belgium's commissioner, Mr Karel Van Miert. But asked whether the UK could be the next weak link in the Maastricht chain, he said: 'I tend to believe that is the case.' Mr Van Miert was cautious about the immediate future. 'I think everyone has a clear impression about how much damage has been done over the last few weeks,' he said. 'The first task is to stop the drift apart in the Community from worsening.' Officials in Brussels expect the meetings today of EC foreign ministers at the UN in New York, and EC finance ministers attending the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, to extract every bit of momentum they can from yesterday's vote. Nevertheless, they expected it would require an emergency summit within the next month to get Maastricht really back on track. Officials last night in Brussels took comfort, however, in the renewed possibilities of a Gatt world trade agreement opened by the French Yes. They confirmed that the final push to unblock the Uruguay Round trade talks, hung up on EC-US inability to agree how far to cut farm subsidies, would now go ahead in an attempt to reach agreement before the US presidential election on November 3. The French vote gives us 'new arguments for a compromise', one official said. France's reluctance to make farm subsidy concessions before the referendum was what made impossible a settlement at July's summit of the Group of Seven big industrial nations in Munich. Despite last week's turmoil in the currency markets, senior officials argued strongly last night that Mastricht's goal of monetary union remained intact, thanks to the French vote. Germany's senior commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, said it is 'quite clear that only Emu (economic and monetary union) can bring an end to speculation and that kind of situation in the markets.' Brushing aside the rancour in the UK over the German Bundesbank's role in last week's events, Mr Bangemann insisted that Emu promised 'one currency defended by one central bank in Europe, with one desire to defend stability, but looking after the European situation and not just one country's' Nonetheless, his colleague, Mr Van Miert, conceded that political as well as economic difficulties surrounding Maastricht meant that 'more bilateralism and more of two speeds' could make it difficult to keep the 12 together.</p>

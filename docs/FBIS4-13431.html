			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The recent indiscriminate Zionist air raids against  civilian areas in southern Lebanon have caused a new wave of  angry reactions from Lebanese political and religious circles.  After the artillery shelling of the coastal city of Sidon,  Zionist planes raided several areas in the south. Dozens of  civilians were killed or wounded and a large number of houses  were destroyed in the raids and the shelling.    Despite these recent acts of aggression, which once again  turned world attention to the developments in southern Lebanon  and to the brutal Zionist policies there, Washington, in a  public, biased step toward the usurper entity, called on the  Lebanese Government to bring the situation under control. The  U.S. Administration's message to the Lebanese Government  yesterday, Friday, said Lebanon must take the necessary measures  to calm the situation in the south and put an end to violence  there.    This, naturally, is not the first time Washington has  adopted  such a biased position in favor of Israel, despite all its  flagrant violations of international law and its blatant  aggression against Lebanon. Over the past 10 years Washington  has persisted in its illegitimate support for Israel's  occupation. The Zionist forces are occupying hundreds of square  meters of Lebanese territory, deploying thousands of Zionist  soldiers and officers in that area, which Israel calls a  security belt. But this is not all: Tel Aviv has repeatedly  invaded Lebanese territory, and its aggression has reached the  Lebanese capital itself.    The continuation of these acts of aggression deprive the  Lebanese people of security and stability. Nevertheless, the  United States insists on its support for this aggressor and  usurper entity. Not only did the United States fail to condemn  the Israeli aggression, but it also asked the Lebanese  Government to apply effective pressure on the Islamic resistance  movement in south Lebanon, the movement that fights the Zionist  occupation from inside Lebanese territory.    The United States, which gave several warnings to the  Lebanese Government on this subject, forgot that the  international public knows that self-defense is a right of any  nation under foreign occupation. International laws give the  Lebanese people the right to defend their land. These laws  condemn Israel and its aggressive and expansionist policies.  Israel is still disregarding Security Council Resolution 425  some 15 years after it was issued; the resolution says Israel  must withdraw from the occupied Lebanese territories.</p>

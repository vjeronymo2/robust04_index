The bills provide for a 20 percent reduction of the  income tax in two stages -- first with summer bonus payments and  second with the year-end adjustment of tax payments.    The local or resident tax will also be cut by 20 percent.    Government officials said the local tax will not be deducted  from salaries for two months in June and July and collection of  the annual levy will be divided equally over the remaining 10  months from August. The officials said the amount of income and  local tax reductions will amount to 106,600 yen for an average  family with a wife and two children.    For nonwage-earning households, income tax adjustments will  be made in July, November and March while the yearly amount of  local tax payments will be cut by 20 percent in June, they said.    For high-income taxpayers, the ceilings of income and local  tax cuts have been set at 2 million yen and 200,000 yen,  respectively.</p>

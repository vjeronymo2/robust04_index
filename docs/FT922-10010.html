			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Clinton attains his finest hour: Democratic frontrunner sets out his vision for the presidency WHETHER or not Governor Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency strikes gold, he may reflect when it is over on the high and low water marks on the long road to the White House or back to Arkansas. If so, he would surely conclude that one of his finest oratorical hours took place in New Orleans at the weekend. On Saturday, less than 72 hours after Los Angeles had erupted in flames, he delivered a speech which defined as well as any why he wanted to be president and of what sort of country he wished to preside over. 'Of course I want to be president,' he said. 'But, more important than that, I want you to think of what kind of citizen you want to be.' The 'you' in this case were members of the Democratic Leadership Council, who are very much Mr Clinton's sort of people - professionals, committed, successful. Rev Jesse Jackson once unkindly called the DLC the 'Democratic leisure club' and, judging by the number of its members toting golf clubs off the charter flight last week, it was impossible to deny he had a point. But it was also impossible to deny that Mr Clinton spoke with real feeling. He did so without the benefit of a prepared text or teleprompter, relying on, but not referring to, his hand-scrawled notes. While, after so much campaigning, no speech can be said to be wholly spontaneous, the performance served to remind how good a public speaker Mr Clinton can be. The traditions of southern oratory are not lost on him. He set out his stall early. 'Thomas Jefferson once said that the crisis of slavery is a fire bell in the night. The crisis in Los Angeles is now our fire bell in the night.' His alarm was over race, fear and social division. It was one thing for the nation to unite in response to a crisis, be it the Gulf war, the assassination of a public figure, or Magic Johnson, the basketball player, contracting the HIV virus. 'But when the crisis passes, when we go back to the day-to-day ordinary living of life, I say we are not a community. 'We should be afraid, my fellow Americans. But we must face our fears and stop running from them.' And this could only begin with the recognition of 'the hard truth' that race was at the root of much of this. 'White Americans all too often fear that violence has only a black face. They see it on the news, they see it in their movies, they are gripped by the isolation of their own experience. Blacks, too, often fear that too often violence has a black face - and no one cares.' What happened in Los Angeles was 'the plaintive cry of millions of Americans who know there is no community today'. But this was not the bleeding heart liberal Clinton, or the professional governor with a million programmes for every problem, or the politician seeking to assign partisan blame. Indeed, he blamed his own party as much as the Republicans for having let the country down. Of the Democrats, he said: 'Too often people think we haven't paid as much attention to the victims of crime as we should have. Too often they think we have clung to putting their tax money into programmes year after year, whether they work or not. Too often we have heard members of our party say that those who seek to reform the welfare system are the enemies of the poor. 'Too often we have had a leadership in our nation's capital paralysed and divided, mirroring a country all too divided. And when that happens, we all pay.' He conceded that, as a politician, his credibility was not high. 'People say you are a politician, how can I believe you?' There was no answer unless people were honest with themselves, honest about race and crime and honest enough to say that 'here is what the leaders should do and here is what the people must do'. Without that ingredient there could only be frustration. With it, he had some ideas: better community policing, community service, not incarceration for the youngest and least violent offenders, serious gun control ('you cannot make the case that a kid's need for an assault weapon is protected under the constitution of the United States'), strengthening families, including forced extraction of delinquent child support payments, and turning schools into meaningful experiences. A lot of what he said derives from his personal experience; he was the child of a broken home, but brought up inside a strong extended family. He sends his daughter to a racially mixed state school in Little Rock and lived through, as a student, the 1968 urban riots in Washington. Perfection is, of course, unattainable and he clearly has not always attained it. But that does not mean he is insincere or cannot legitimately dream. 'What is killing us today is that millions of Americans get up every day and do not believe tomorrow will be better and do not believe they can make a difference.' In New Orleans he eloquently set out the case that neither is necessarily so.</p>

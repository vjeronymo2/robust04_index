On one hand, they preached the  20-character principle of "grasping the opportunity, deepening  reform, expanding the open- door policy, and promoting  development," which has been proposed by the senior level of the  CPC as this year's work, and on the other hand they listened to  the opinions of local authorities on reform measures aimed at  state-owned enterprises, finance, taxation, revenue, investment,  and foreign trade -- measures that are forceful, penetrating,  and extensive -- so as to strengthen communications between  central and local authorities and to create a good environment  for the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress  [NPC] which will open on 10 March.  <H5>  "Central Committee With Jiang As Core" Still Has No Authority </H5>   Informed sources in Beijing disclosed that Yang Shangkun, Bo  Yibo, Wan Li, and other CPC elders stressed during their  inspection trips that in the new year, when many reform measures  are being announced, whether or not changing from the planned  economy to a market economy goes well will depend on five  factors:    1) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can  voluntarily safeguard the authority of the CPC Central Committee  which has Jiang Zemin as the core.    2) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can  establish the view that party spirit is above everything, and  voluntarily strengthen party spirit and organization.    3) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can  unconditionally submit local and partial interests to central  and overall interests.    4) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can  strengthen their own clean government building and win the  people's trust by the image of doing solid work.    5) Whether or not leading cadres of various levels can  seriously learn from Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and actively, thoroughly,  and correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's theory.    The persons of political circles in Beijing pointed out  that,  regarding the importance of safeguarding the authority of the  CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, not only  Deng Xiaoping has talked about it many times, but even Chen Yun  stressed it when he talked about the way to solve the current  difficulties with Shanghai's party and government leaders who  went to convey New Year greetings to him on 9 February. He  said: "Without the authority of the Central Committee, big  things cannot be done, and society cannot be stable." He also  praised the current leading group in the central authorities  saying it is strong, capable, and doing quite a good job.  Undoubtedly, with the support of Chen Yun, who is viewed as the  chief representative of the conservative forces within the CPC,  the authority of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as  the core will be strengthened. However, the authority of the  "Central Committee with Jiang as the core," which is the  third-generation leadership, must still rely on the protection  given by the CPC elders, and this shows that the "Central  Committee with Jiang as the core" still has no authority. This  cannot be denied as a big potential problem after Deng and Chen  pass away.  <H3>  Not Carrying Out Political Reform Is "Political  Shortsightedness" </H3>   According to informed sources, Wan Li talked specifically on  the issue of self-construction of leading cadres during his  inspection trip. He hoped that leading cadres could set high  standards for themselves. He mentioned that some leading cadres  were content with not engaging in corruption, not taking bribes,  not pursuing erosion, and not abusing their power, and he  pointed out that these "four not's" are only the criteria for a  law-abiding citizen, not the criteria for leading cadres, and  that if they are only able to do the "four not's," then they are  not qualified to serve as leading cadres. He said: "In the new  historical period, and today when we try to establish the system  of the socialist market economy, we must stress in particular  that leading party and government cadres must put the interests  of the party, the state, and the people first, and put  individual interests, as well as the interests of their family  members, in a lesser position. I am not saying that those  interests are not to be considered, and it is not realistic to  completely ignore them, but there has to be an order of  priorities. Otherwise, one is not qualified to serve as a  leading party or government cadre, and the people have no  obligation to support him."    Bo Yibo, during his inspection trip, criticized some  provinces that have owed wages to primary and secondary school  teachers for a long time, and issued IOU's to peasants, but  spent a large amount of public funds to build halls, buy cars,  and travel. He said at the meeting of the standing committee of  a certain provincial party committee: "If you, the standing  committee members who are sitting here, did not receive your  paychecks for three or six months, would you still come to work?  Would you not complain? Would you not swear at the Central  Committee? Did you feel any sense of guilt when you rode in the  imported limousines to the counties and villages for inspection?  You must know that the price of an imported limousine could  completely change the face of a village!"    According to political circles in Beijing, what is  noteworthy  is why the phenomena criticized by Wan Li and Bo Yibo is  continuously spreading within the CPC. In the final analysis,  it is because as reform of the economic system is carried out,  reform of the political system is not. But regrettably, the CPC  elders and the current CPC leaders still bury their heads in the  sand regarding this serious mistake. They hardly realize that  establishing democratic politics is more helpful in safeguarding  the position of the party and government and the security of the  country, and at the same time, it has a bigger political  rallying force than merely imbuing the masses with a "sense of  loyalty." Not carrying out political reform is indeed a kind of  "political shortsightedness."  <H5>  The "20-Character Principle" Is the Basic Tone of the NPC </H5>   The informed sources also said that Bo Yibo, who once said  that Deng Xiaoping's biggest contribution is that "he found the  way of building socialism with Chinese characteristics -- a way  which Mao Zedong wanted to find but failed to find," demanded  during his inspection trip that provincial leaders thoroughly  learn from and correctly understand Deng Xiaoping's theory. He  said: "The true meaning of Comrade Xiaoping's theory is that it  proceeds from China's actual conditions. Comrade Xiaoping,  using the stance, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism, has  summed up the positive and negative experiences in the  development of China and foreign countries, summed up the  positive and negative experiences in the history of the CPC, and  created the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The essence of this theory is emancipating  minds and seeking truth from facts. Under the guidance of this  theory, our country has undergone profound changes over the past  14 years, catching the attention of people all over the world.  Therefore, every party member and the leading cadres of various  levels must seriously learn from and grasp Comrade Xiaoping's  theory."    According to political circles in Beijing, Bo Yibo's high  appraisal of Deng Xiaoping's theory was helpful in checking the  unhealthy tendency of the Mao craze within and without the party  arising from the 100th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birthday.  But it is difficult to correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's  theory.    For example, Deng Xiaoping has time and again explained the  theory of opportunity in recent years, and stressed the need to  grasp the opportunity and expedite reform and development (note:  see the 21 February article in this column), as a result, many  cadres have rapidly launched projects without considering  conditions. In fact, when Deng demanded a speedier development,  he did not permit blind enthusiasm. Concerning this point, Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji, who is taking charge of China's economic  reform and is considered to be most skillful in understanding  Deng Xiaoping's theory, has explained it as follows: "To  actively, thoroughly, and correctly implement Deng Xiaoping's  thinking and theory, one will be condemned by history if one  fails to grasp the opportunity. If one charges ahead blindly,  and does not seek truth from facts, to the extent of causing big  fluctuations, then, one will also be condemned in history." The  above-mentioned "20-character principle," which has been  proposed by the senior level of the CPC, has replaced  "expediting the development" with "promoting the development,"  and this obviously is to prevent blind adventure. Judged from  this, the 20-character principle will be the basic tone of the  Second Session of the Eighth NPC and the government work report,  whereas before the NPC, it is believed that the CPC authorities  will achieve a consensus at the Fourth Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee on the relevant issues such as this  basic tone and the way to strengthen the authority of the  "Central Committee with Jiang as the core."</p>

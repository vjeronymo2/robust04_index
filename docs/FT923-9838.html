			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: Care for customers Sir, The answer to poor customer service reported in the National Consumer Council's report, 'Consumer Concerns 1992' ('Stores receive customer praise', July 30), is to invest 50 per cent of your training budget on customer care. Surprise and delight your customers. The result of our investment is more satisfied customers and a balance sheet that is the envy of our competitors. Roger Burrell, managing director, ICL Customer Service, Cain Road, Bracknell, Berkshire</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [New Report: "CIA was Involved in Bombay Bomb Blasts"] </F>   [Text] Bombay, 12 March. The CIA was involved in the  dreadful violence and bomb blasts in Bombay after the 6 December  1992 incident. This is the conclusion the Indian intelligence  agencies have reached. According to the conclusions reached  after confidential investigations, the CIA used the Pakistani  intelligence agency, ISI, the Mafia gangs in Bombay, and some  leaders for this purpose.    According to these sources, the CIA helped the communal  organizations and the Mafia gangs with money and weapons. These  sources revealed that the purpose for the dreadful violence and  bomb blasts in Bombay was to sabotage the market here. they went  as far as to say that the CIA is trying to split up India. These  sources expressed the concern that Madras was the next target  after the destruction in Bombay.    A red alert has been declared in the state after this  information was received. The state government has issued a  special appeal to the people to remain peaceful. According to  these sources, the CIA is inciting innocent people in addition  to using anti-social and communal elements to make its  conspiracies successful. The intelligence agencies have prepared  a list that includes names of important persons in politics and  other fields. Their activities are being closely monitored now.    The intelligence agencies have collected all possible  information related to the terrible riots in December 1992 and  January 1993 as well as to the March bomb blasts. What happened  in Bombay after 6 December was not coincidental. The plans to  spread violence were made before 6 December. A local  intelligence official was aware of a meeting held in a minority  section of city to plan a strategy for spreading violence after  the mosque was destroyed. However, he did not try to get  information about the decisions made in that meeting.    The sources revealed that this plan to spread violence  brought the Muslims who were wounded in the riots to public  attention. The CIA had made plans to have the majority group  commit violence in retaliation to the violent activities of the  minority group. It has supplied weapons to both sides. It used  communal organizations on both sides and anti-social elements  for this purpose.    The widespread violence that the foreign powers had assumed  would take place after the March bomb blasts did not take place.  The sources said that additional violence did not occur because  of the change in political atmosphere after the change in  leadership and the measures taken after the police received  additional information about riots. The CIA and the ISI worked  together to provide finance and weapons for bomb blasts. In  additional to the Mafia members, young people suffering from  riots were used for this purpose.    The home and foreign ministries needed to work together to  apprehend the real criminals behind that 12 March bomb blasts.  The investigation was not very successful because of the lack of  cooperation. That disheartened the investigating officials.  High-level officials have said that the local communal  organizations interfere in their efforts to foil CIA and ISI  plans. Whenever plans to take serious action against anti-social  elements are made, the related communal organizations raise a  lot of hue and cry against it.    After last year's major bomb blasts, there were nine smaller  blasts in public places in Bombay in August and September. The  goal of these blasts was to spread fear among the people. The  Bombay police arrested a Pakistani citizen trying to place a  bomb in the Ahmedabad Janata Express at Bombay Central station.  This member of the Jamaatul Mujaheddin is a resident of Lahore.  Several persons suspected to be Kashmiri terrorists were also  arrested in Bombay.    According to police sources, the BJP was planning a  demonstration outside the Vidha Bhavan on 12 July 1993. At that  time, some Bajrang Dal members with Indian-made revolvers were  arrested. These people had threatened the minority community  store owners. A similar incident took place on 6 December 1993  when the All India Ulema-e Council had organized a strike. The  police had expected communal hatred to erupt on both these  occasions. One report recommended that the police should be  fully prepared for every important religious holiday and minor  confrontations.</p>

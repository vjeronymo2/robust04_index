			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Worries About Rise in Prices"] </F>   [Text] Baghdad, November 7: Iraqi television mentioned that  the Iraqi National Assembly has decided to include the economic  situation and wave of price increases on the agenda of its fall  session, which began yesterday, Saturday.    In reports broadcast on television Saturday evening, a  number  of deputy ministers of commerce, agriculture, and foreign  affairs, sought to study ways of handling the price rises and  efforts to lift the multifaceted sanctions imposed on Iraq since  the liberation of the governorate of Kuwait in August, 1990.    Deputy Speaker Ghanim 'Aziz Khadduri confirmed that  inflation  was continuing in the markets, as were price rises, to a degree  burdensome to citizens and society, despite all the measures the  government has taken to fight high prices.    Five days ago, Iraqi President Saddam Husayn asked  government  institutions to stop buying dollars from the local market, in an  effort to halt the steep rise in the price of the dollar, which  is considered the major cause of the price rises.    Money exchangers in Baghdad say that the price of the dollar  has stabilized in recent days, at 106 or 107 Iraqi dinars [ID],  after having reached ID115 at the end of October.    The drop in the price of the dinar in the parallel market  has  been linked to the rise--ranging from 20 to 70 percent--in the  prices of basic commodities in recent weeks. The cost of Iraqi  foodstuff imports is paid in dollars.    He indicated that the Iraqi dinar is now officially worth  $3.20.    The recent drop in dinar rates is traceable to the  suspension  of talks between Iraq and the United Nations on the sale of  Iraqi oil in early October. These talks dealt with the sale of  $1.6 billion worth of Iraqi oil under UN supervision, to fund  Iraq's imports of foodstuffs.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM SEES FUTURE IN DEVICE TO HELP COMPUTERS CONFER  </P> <P> Back in 1977, Frank Peters was running a computer company when a Japanese firm  approached him for advice about how to begin selling in this country an optical  character reader, a device that reads printed information and turns it into  data that can be stored electronically. "I said, 'Don't do it. It's a bad  idea,' " Peters said.  </P> <P> The company ignored Peters' advice, and ultimately he started selling the  device for them. In selling it to banks, Peters saw a need for a way to make it  "talk" to the banks' computers. Peters' company found the answer with a device  it developed called a message switch.  </P> <P> Twelve years later, Peters' present company, Franklin Telecommunications in  Westlake Village, has designed a product that is a distant stepchild to that  message switch, and Peters believes that it puts his company more than two  years ahead of rivals in helping computers talk to each other via phone lines.  </P> <P> So confident is Peters about the computer product that he's effectively bet his  company on it, selling two of Franklin's important divisions to concentrate on  selling a device called a multi-protocol switching PAD, or MPP.  </P> <P> Computers built by different manufacturers generally 'speak' different  languages. But most companies that use computers don't want to throw out all  their old equipment each time they buy a new computer. Instead they want to  find ways of making all their computers talk to each other over special  telephone lines. The MPP takes messages from one computer, puts them in a  different language and sends them via phone lines to other computers.  </P> <P> Since the early 1980s, other major data communications companies such as Hughes  and Telenet have sold fancier MPP-like gadgets that can be used in extensive  computer networks. But many of those devicescannot be reprogrammed easily and  most are expensive. Larry Cynar, a data communications analyst with Dataquest,  a San Jose market research firm, said that while a Telenet system can cost  $100,000 or so, Franklin can offer a comparable but simpler system for as  little as $20,000 to $30,000.  </P> <P> Franklin's MPPs also come with the feature Peters said sets them apart:  software that allows a technician to reprogram the devices if old computers are  replaced or new ones are added to a network.  </P> <P> "It is a good strategy," Cynar said. "Franklin's been doing it for several  years now and has a good spot."  </P> <P> Already, Franklin's MPP sales have grown from zero 2 1/2 years ago to more than  $5 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to John Hochstein,  Franklin vice president and secretary. And Hochstein predicts that sales will  double or triple next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MPP Customers  </P> <P> Franklin counts among its MPP customers Citicorp, which is using the device to  help connect the bank's branch computers, automatic tellers and central main  frame computers, a deal Franklin says will be worth more than $1 million in the  first year. Franklin also announced a deal to provide MPPs for First Boston  Corp.'s computerized securities trading system, as well as one with San  Diego-based Price Co., a national wholesaler of appliances and office goods.  </P> <P> But as is the case with most new electronics products, Franklin has to keep an  eye on a competitor. Amnet, a privately held Massachusetts firm, offers a  similar MPP device, according to Robert Machlin, the company's vice president  of marketing. Machlin declined to give a sales figure for Amnet's line of  competing MPPs but said the company's total sales for all product lines were  about $5 million last year.  </P> <P> Another worry for Franklin, according to Dataquest's Cynar, is that some major  data communications companies want to try and introduce their own lower cost  MPP versions. "Everybody wants to go that way," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extra Cash  </P> <P> To try to keep its technological edge, Franklin may seek an extra infusion of  cash to fund the expected growth in its sales of MPPs, Peters said. The money  would go for research and development and sales and staff support, he said,  since he expects his MPP division to double in size to 120 workers in 18  months.  </P> <P> Franklin has already raised $1.5 million as part of an agreement in November,  1988, with a Canadian data communications company, Gandalf Technologies.  Gandalf purchased a 7% stake in Franklin and agreed to market its products in  Canada. "We have faith in Franklin," said Gandalf's vice president of corporate  marketing, Thomas Baumgartner. "We knew that to be fully successful that they  needed some more money to put in some more engineering and some more support."  </P> <P> In the meantime, to narrow its focus on its MPP business, Franklin announced  earlier this month a $550,000 deal to sell the assets of two of its divisions:  Shamrock, a direct marketing operation, and PC Products, which makes and  markets computer peripherals such as modems and data storage systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Key Elements  </P> <P> But Franklin's plans to shed the two divisions could be risky, since those  parts of the company have proved key to its expansion. According to Franklin's  annual report for the year that ended June 30, 1988, the PC Products division  brought in the largest portion of Franklin's $26.1 million in sales. Since  Peters started the company in 1983, Franklin has grown steadily, and in the  nine months that ended March 31, Franklin's sales climbed to $23.2 million.  </P> <P> Despite the growth, Franklin has not always been profitable. In the 1987 fiscal  year, Franklin lost $1.2 million on sales of $19.4 million, and in its latest  fiscal year, Franklin earned only $339,000.  </P> <P> Peters, who owns 35% of Franklin's stock worth about $2.6 million at recent  prices, has essentially opted for the Kentucky Fried Chicken school of  management: Try and do just one thing right.  </P> <P> "By selling off those divisions I think I got rid of 95% of my risk," Franklin  said. "I'll admit that I was stretched trying to manage all three kinds of  business."  </P></p>

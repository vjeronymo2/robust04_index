Due to this fact, our agency is unable to function. The  building is searched without the sanctions of the Procurator.  The police does not explain the reasons of their activities.    The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Azerbaijan, Procurator's  Office and President's staff of the Republic give no details  about present situation and refuse to answer the question of the  journalists. Presently we use several additional sources to  inform you about the situation.</p>

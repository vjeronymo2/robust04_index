			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Company News: Dutch publisher advances 39% WOLTERS KLUWER, one of the Netherlands' biggest publishers, reported a 39 per cent rise in first-half net profit to Fl 109m (Dollars 69m) from Fl 78m and has upgraded its forecast for full-year net earnings. The 9 per cent increase in first-half turnover to Fl 1.15bn, was spread evenly across its geographical areas of operation. Wolters Kluwer operates mainly in Europe and the US, and is active in legal and medical publishing, as well as in the scientific, business and educational markets. Costs rose at only half the rate of income. The operating result jumped by 41 per cent to Fl 180m, compared with the Fl 128m achieved during the same six months last year. It attributed roughly half this increase to recent acquisitions, the largest of which was Ipsoa, the Milan-based leader on the Italian tax and legal publishing market bought last year. First-half net profit included after-tax extraordinary income of Fl 8.3m. Wolters Kluwer expected a 20 per cent rise in net profit over the Fl 214m achieved in 1991, corresponding to a 19 per cent rise in net earnings per share on a fully diluted basis.</p>

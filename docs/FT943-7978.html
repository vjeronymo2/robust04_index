			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / People: Drury resurfaces in the shipping business Charles Drury, 53, a veteran of London's boom and bust shipping finance cycles, has resurfaced at Den norske Bank (DnB) as head of a new London-based marine corporate finance unit which will raise equity for over-indebted shipowners. Norway, unlike Britain, has always had more than its fair share of entrepreneurial shipping figures, and Drury, who has worked at Greig Middleton and NatWest Securities, knows most of them. DnB is Norway's largest bank and has always been a leading lender to shipping companies around the world. However, competition for business has reduced the margins on traditional shipping lending and increased the risks, and, in common with the rest of Norway's banks, DnB is recovering from five years of heavy credit losses. Hence, DnB is anxious to expand the corporate finance side of its shipping business where the risks are less and the returns considerably higher. UK merchant banks such as SG Warburg have been raising increasing amounts of equity for Norwegian shipowners, many of whom are traditional clients of DnB. Drury's new operation will raise primary equity in both the public and private markets, advise on mergers and acquisitions and corporate restructuring. Drury is one of the more well-rounded figures in London's close-knit shipping world. He started out at Hambros, has been a director of a successful shipping company, Bulk Transport, and even co-authored a book Ship finance - the credit crisis. He retired from NatWest Securities two years ago in order to set up his own database publishing company. However, he says that he soon found that his plan to 'create a super-highway of transport statistics was beyond his slender management skills' and after toying with another publishing venture he decided to return to his first love, doing deals in the shipping business.</p>

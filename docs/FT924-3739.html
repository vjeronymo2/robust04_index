			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Banking complaints soar - The ombudsman's 1992 report LAURENCE Shurman, the banking ombudsman, was deluged by more than 10,000 complaints in the year to September 1992 - a 62 per cent increase on 1991, which itself was up 60 per cent on the previous year. Shurman said the rise was due to the effect of the recession on customers as well as greater awareness of the ombudsman scheme. Banks recently have faced criticism for failing to pass on fully the benefits of interest rate cuts, and for charging small businesses too much - and complaints about charges headed the 1992 list, accounting for 19.2 per cent of the total. In his report, though, Shurman said customers' expectations were too high. 'Free banking services are no more possible than free lunches,' he declared. 'At the end of the day, the banks have to generate more income than expenditure in order to survive.' Many complaints were from those annoyed they had been left in accounts no longer open to new business, or had not been told they would earn a higher rate of interest in a different account. But Shurman said banks were not usually under an obligation to advise their clients to do this. Instead, the investor 'has a responsibility to be vigilant to ensure that his or her investment remains competitive, both in relation to what is on offer elsewhere from other banks and institutions and in relation to other accounts available at the investor's own bank.' He added, however, that if the bank could be found to have breached its own conditions or to have made a mistake, a complaint could be upheld. He cited a case where a bank issued a customer with a gold card, entitling him to an overdraft of Pounds 6,000 at not more than an annual 2.5 per cent above the bank's base rate. When he took up the overdraft, he found he had been charged at the bank's higher managed rate. The ombudsman found that although the bank had the right to vary its base rate, it was not entitled to replace this with the managed rate. The bank was obliged to refund the excess above 2.5 per cent to the customer. Lending policy accounted for 14.2 per cent of the complaints and automatic teller machines for another 8.7 per cent. Many of the ATM complaints were about 'phantom withdrawals' where the customer finds money removed through the cash point machine but does not remember doing so himself. On this, Shurman commented: 'There has been a lot of talk about ghost withdrawals, but we have not found any evidence. 'What we have found is a great deal of fraud, often by someone known to the complainant - a friend, family member or workmate.' The increase in plastic card fraud, which cost banks at least Pounds 166m last year, is a growing problem and Shurman suggested the banks could do more to combat this by introducing photographs on cards and installing videos at cash machines. But he expected the number of complaints about ATMs to fall with the new Pounds 50 limit - introduced by the code of banking practice - on a customer's liability in cases of stolen cash cards. Although only 956 of the 10,109 preliminary complaints were investigated, this was an increase of 28 per cent on the 746 cases examined the year before. Shurman said he had needed to examine proportionately fewer cases because the banks were themselves becoming more successful at settling complaints. Of the fully investigated complaints, 36 per cent were about ATMs, followed by cheque guarantee cards (10 per cent). More than a third of the 772 fully investigated cases resulted in compensation for the customer. This ranged from Pounds 100 to Pounds 10,000.</p>

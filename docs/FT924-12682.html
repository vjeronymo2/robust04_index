			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Japanese to keep foreign rice ban JAPAN's agriculture ministry insisted yesterday that the rice market would remain closed to imports regardless of EC-US negotiations on farm products trade. Tokyo has watched the apparent progress in US-EC talks anxiously, as the present factional struggles within the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) have distracted party leaders from the politically-sensitive issue of rice imports. The agriculture ministry said the ban would not be relaxed, even if the EC and US reach a formal and final agreement as part of Gatt's Uruguay Round. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, has said multilateral farm talks could resume soon. His comment followed a weekend meeting with trade ministers from the US, Japan and Canada, at which negotiators were said to be on the verge of making progress on the outstanding issues of farm subsidies and oil seeds. An understanding exists among senior LDP officials that rice imports must eventually be allowed, if only in limited amounts. But last week's resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's powerbroker, reduced any prospects for liberalisation. Mr Kanemaru was one of few Japanese politicians with the prestige needed to deal with an issue as complex as rice. He is known to have accepted that opening the rice market was inevitable. But before opening the market, the LDP would have to begin talks with the influential farm lobby. Few LDP politicians want to be linked with the change of policy on rice, which the farm groups say has a sacred role in Japanese life. Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday that the Japanese government was watching the progress in talks between the US and EC, and would 'cautiously consider future events'.</p>

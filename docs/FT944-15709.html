			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Strong overseas interest in Swedish privatisation - International offerings International investors will soon be able to invest in Stadshypotek, Sweden's largest mortgage lender, currently being privatised by the Swedish government. The international equity portion of the deal may be smaller than originally anticipated by bankers advising the government. But there are hopes that overseas investors could buy up to Dollars 300m of shares, making the deal one of Scandinavia's - and possibly one of Europe's - biggest international equity offerings this year. This could be one of the last opportunities for some time for investors to obtain privatised Swedish stock because the newly-elected Social Democrat administration is less committed to state sell-offs than its predecessor. 'The current government has made no commitment to a privatisation programme. We will see a hiatus with no new paper coming through. The flow of paper will dry up for a while,' said Mr John St John, director of equity capital markets at Kleinwort Benson, which is joint global co-ordinator of the deal with Alfred Berg. Kleinwort and Alfred Berg are co-leads for the US tranche, with Salomon Brothers as co-manager. The tranche for the rest of the world, including Sweden, involves Goldman Sachs, UBS, Cazenove, Nomura, Indosuez, JP Morgan and Dresdner. Overall, Stadshypotek, a mutual company which controls about a third of the Swedish mortgage market, aims to raise SKr3bn in an international and domestic offering. Bankers are impressed by overseas interest. 'I have been astonished at the interest from big, blue-chip institutions, both in Europe and the US,' said Mr Jakob Kinde, director of corporate finance at Kleinwort Benson. Kleinwort Benson was brought in after its success with the sale of Abbey National, the UK building society, and the 1993 demutualisation of Foreningsbanken, the Swedish farmers' bank. Mr Kinde says Stadshypotek represents good value. 'This is a low-risk business with high earnings ability.' Bankers had hoped there would be Dollars 500m for international investors, but the domestic take-up has so far been higher than expected, partly because Swedish home owners and corporate borrowers are being offered free shares to tempt them to invest in Sweden's largest initial public offer. This means the precise size of the international offering will not be known until the sale offer for the domestic side - described by Mr Kinde as a 'rights issue to mortgage holders' - closes on October 21. Kleinwort has introduced a unique and complicated structure for the domestic side of the Stadshypotek deal. Borrowers who have mortgages with the Stadshypotek will be given 37.5m shares currently owned by the state-owned Stadshypotekskassan or Urban Mortgage Bank, for free. They will also be offered the right to buy a total of 37.5m new shares at SKr80 a share. The bigger their mortgage, the more new shares they can buy. The UMB shares were trading at around SKr90 each on Friday. About half of Stadshypotek's 760,000 mortgage holders are property companies which may not subscribe to the rights, and their entitlement will form the basis of the international tranche. The UMB owns all 80m of the existing Stadshypotek shares. After the capital increase its shareholding will be cut to 36 per cent. All the SKr3bn raised from the rights issue will go to boost the balance sheet of Stadshypotek, allowing it to obtain better terms when it begins to borrow in its own name at the start of next year.</p>

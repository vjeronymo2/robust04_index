			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Health care hit as sanctions bite in Belgrade UNITED Nations sanctions, including an oil embargo, imposed on May 31 against the reconstituted Yugoslavia, are biting hard in Belgrade despite allegations of widespread violations. The effects are far broader than petrol queues snaking out from the few city filling stations still open. Amid an overall collapse of the economy, hospitals are among the hardest hit. 'All the doctors pray that we won't fall ill because we know there is no way to be cured,' says a young endocrinologist in Belgrade. Dr Sasa Simic, a surgeon who works at one of Belgrade's top hospitals, calls the present state of health care a 'catastrophe'. Patients are admitted to hospital only if they can supply their own medicine, anaesthetic, bandages, and towels. 'We do not have any material. No sutures, no plastic gloves. Everything we used was imported from the US.' Doctors say while medicine is supposed to be exempt from the sanctions, medicines must go through the UN bureaucracy in order to be imported. A cardiologist who spoke on condition of anonymity said: 'The import of medicines theoretically is not banned. But it is blocked because it is illegal to import packaging.' The shortages have forced doctors into an ethical dilemma: to choose which patients should be allowed medical care. 'We now have to reject all patients for elective surgery, operating only on those with cancer or injuries,' says Dr Simic. He explains how hernia patients, for example, are told to go home and wait for better days. Few beds are filled in the once-packed cardiology ward. Unable to provide their own pacemakers, most people now must forego surgery. Haematologists say the treatment of blood disease has stopped because diseases such as leukaemia were treated only with imported drugs. Dr Simic says: 'We now have a rise of urinary infections because we no longer have disposable catheters. Infection results because everything must be washed by hand.' An official from the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it would soon be hazardous to drink tap water because Serbia and Montenegro, the sole members of Yugoslavia, can no longer provide the chemicals for purification. Flats in about half of Belgrade for the past five days have been without any water at all. But Dr Simic says: 'Medicine is so hard hit that all other problems - gas queues and shortages - seem irrelevant.'</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UN chief hints at Balkan troop pull-out The United Nations should consider pulling out of former Yugoslavia, whether or not the current peace proposals are accepted, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said yesterday . In a letter to the Security Council, he said the United Nations forces were not strong enough either to enforce a peace settlement, or to withstand the consequences of an escalating war. He suggested that if the international community acted on its threat to punish the Serbs for intransigence - through air strikes or by supplying arms to their enemies - the UN would become a target for Serb retaliation. 'Such (punitive) actions would deliberately impinge on the basic military interest of one of the parties and would therefore be likely to be militarily resisted,' Mr Boutros Ghali warned. In Bosnia, Serb forces seemed already to be embarking on a war of nerves with the UN. Yesterday, they challenged the UN to call in air strikes by firing heavy weapons near the 'safe haven' of Gorazde for a second day. The UN also blamed the Serbs for the anti-aircraft fire at Sarajevo airport last week which has forced the suspension of relief flights. The Serbs have denied responsibility. In a third challenge to the UN, the Serbs refused to allow the evacuation of 35 sick people from Gorazde unless all Serb prisoners held by the Moslem-led Bosnian government were released. Negotiators from the five-nation contact group which has devised a partition arrangement for Bosnia conferred in Moscow yesterday over how to react to the Serbs' ambiguous reply to the proposal. A statement by the group said they discussed 'additional measures aimed at removing the objections from all sides in the conflict'. The group's members - the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany - were united in pressing for acceptance of the peace deal but seemed split over how to cope with its apparent failure. No firm decisions are expected until the group's foreign ministers meet in Geneva at the weekend. Mr Igor Ivanov, Russian first deputy foreign minister who chaired the meeting, said before it began that they would continue to strive for acceptance of the latest peace plan - accepted by the Croat-Moslem alliance but in effect rejected by Bosnian Serb leaders. 'We believe we have a plan that is balanced and realistic and reflects the interests of all sides,' Mr Ivanov said. 'It would hardly be expedient to abandon it.' General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, will arrive in former Yugoslavia today, where he is expected to meet Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and possibly the Bosnian Serbs as well. Gen Grachev has often been in direct communication with General Ratko Mladic, head of the Bosnian Serb army, and the Russian minister may be one of the few people who can exercise any influence over the Serb commander. Yesterday, Russia announced a wide-ranging defence co-operation agreement with Greece calling for joint exercises, possible co-production of weapons and the exchange of information on defence matters. Greece is the only European Union member which shares Russia's traditional sympathy for the Serbs.</p>

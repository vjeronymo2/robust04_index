			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER JOLT JARS ODDITY IN SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> LANDMARK: THE BAY AREA EARTHQUAKE ONLY ADDED TO THE PROBLEMS OF THIS FOLK ART  TOURIST STOP, WHICH ALREADY WAS ON SHAKY GROUND.  </P> <P> Bottle Village has been called many things in its quirky 30-year history in  Simi Valley. An eyesore. Folk art. A historic landmark.  </P> <P> Now, as cities statewide survey buildings for potential earthquake hazards,  Bottle Village has been named one of only two unreinforced masonry structures  in the Ventura County city.  </P> <P> But no one has to tell the Preserve Bottle Village Committee that the odd  collection of bottle-and-mortar huts -- or their organization -- lies on shaky  ground. The new, earthquake-related label is just the latest of the foundering  group's problems.  </P> <P> "What other community has something like Bottle Village?" asked supporter  Joanne Johnson. "It's got to be the most unusual thing in Ventura County, and  yet it's falling apart."  </P> <P> Ten years after it was formed to save the village from demolition, the  committee has dwindled to three artists, is about $5,000 in debt and has lost  its tax-exempt status. An engineering study of the village's 13 unconventional  buildings is incomplete and the group has become mired in the city's  bureaucracy as it tries to renew an expired operating permit.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the village remains closed to the public, except for occasional  tours by appointment.  </P> <P> Its new designation as an "unreinforced masonry structure" stems from a  state-required survey in which building inspectors are expected to identify  structures of brick or stone that are not reinforced to modern,  earthquake-conscious standards.  </P> <P> In Simi Valley, a 20-year-old city of gleaming shopping centers and  cookie-cutter houses, the only other structure on the list is a nearly  200-year-old adobe in Strathearn Historical Park.  </P> <P> Exactly what the label means for Bottle Village, and the adobe, is unclear.  Inventories of cities' unreinforced buildings and plans for strengthening them  are due Jan. 1. Gaddis Farmer, Simi Valley's chief building official, said he  is still preparing his report, which will have to take into consideration the  village's protected status as a California State Historical Landmark.  </P> <P> The village committee's own engineering study, commissioned four years ago to  determine how best to restore and preserve the buildings, is also supposed to  address earthquake issues. But that report is on hold because the committee  owes its engineer money, said Brian Gabler, an assistant to Simi Valley's city  manager.  </P> <P> Over the last six years, the committee has exhausted an estimated $50,000 in  grants and donations for a variety of expenses and, as Johnson put it last  week, "We have nothing to show for it.  </P> <P> "Our financial records are so murky I really don't know what was going on," she  said. "Here we are these three honest people, trying to put back together this  house of cards...."  </P> <P> The village immortalizes ordinary objects, otherwise condemned as trash: dolls,  scissors, nails, bits of glass and tile. A metal sign embedded in the ground at  the village's entrance bears the cryptic slogan: "They Last."  </P> <P> A visitor once remarked to Johnson that virtually every object had been held in  human hands. Tinted bottles floating in cement, filtering Southern California  sunlight like stained glass, give the 1-acre complex of tiny buildings and  mosaic walkways its name.  </P> <P> Creator Tressa (Grandma) Prisbrey started Bottle Village in the 1950s to house  her collection of 17,000 pencils. For more than 20 years, she added on using  refuse from a local dump. The buildings have odd, fairy-tale names -- Parade of  Dolls, Home of Little Mothers, Bottle House, the Rumpus Room, Cleopatra's  Bedroom.  </P> <P> By the time she died last year in a San Francisco nursing home at 92, Prisbrey  was an internationally recognized folk artist and her life's work was a state  historic landmark. But in Simi Valley, Bottle Village might have been razed for  condos if not for the committee.  </P> <P> And although the committee received a $25,000 grant from the city, the village  today is hardly a celebrated cause among local arbiters of history and lore.  </P> <P> "It's not the general consensus throughout the population that it's something  that should be conserved. There are those who question what it's artistic merit  is," said Dmitri Hunt, planning and development administrator for the Rancho  Simi Recreation and Parks District, whose property includes the Strathearn  adobe.  </P> <P> "Do I personally like it?" said Patricia Havens, the city's designated  historian and director of the Strathearn park museum. "I try to stay neutral on  that . . . I'm more inclined to be interested in the ordinary family, the  ordinary individuals who made this community what it is, rather than one or two  in the limelight for eccentric things."  </P> <P> "At one time it was Simi Valley's claim to fame, the only reason we were in the  Auto Club book," Mayor Gregory Stratton said.  </P> <P> Committee President Helen Dennert and Johnson both readily concede the  organization's past administrative failings. Past president David Kaplan,  credited with raising much of the committee's spent funds, could not be reached  for comment. Neither Dennert nor Johnson expected to be committee officers when  they originally volunteered, they said, and now find themselves leaders by  default.  </P> <P> The group's top priority is regaining its tax-exempt status so it can raise  funds again. Because of an apparent oversight, Johnson and Dennert said, the  group never applied for permanent tax-exempt status and its temporary  designation expired five years ago.  </P> <P> Dennert and Johnson also want to join the committee with a more conventional  group such as the park district, because "if Bottle Village had been attached  to an institution, people would have been touring it," Dennert said.  </P> <P> In light of the committee's more immediate problems, Johnson can't help but  smile ruefully at the prospect of earthquake-proofing Bottle Village.  </P> <P> "Given the choice of where to die during an earthquake, I would rather succumb  and be buried in the rubble of Bottle Village than be wasted in the debris of a  poorly designed freeway," she wrote recently while organizing the committee's  paper work.  </P></p>

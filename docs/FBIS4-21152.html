He stressed: While Iran has come under strong Western  criticism for taking strict antinarcotics measures, the United  States accuses Tehran of procrastination in the matter.    Referring to data and statistics and a report by the  International Narcotics Control Board, our country's permanent  UN representative said: The Islamic Republic of Iran has taken  extensive measures to control narcotics, not only in the region  but also globally. Tehran's investment in the matter is of the  highest level.    The U.S. assistant secretary of state claimed last Monday  that the Islamic Republic of Iran is taking no measures to fight  narcotics smuggling.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a major blow for openness this week, the MAIL  &amp;  GUARDIAN [WM&amp;G] forced the South African National Defence  Force  [SANDF] to confirm the names of members of the shadowy  Directorate of Covert Collection [DCC].    The WM&amp;G sent the military a list of 62 individuals  with the  request that they should reveal their present and past  relationship with the DCC. Yesterday the SANDF confirmed that  11 were still working for DCC and that 36 others had been  employees.    In court papers justifying the interdict against the  WM&amp;G,  SANDF chief General Georg Meiring last week cited the need to  protect the identity of intelligence operatives.    The following are DCC members:     -  Director Brigadier Horace William Doncaster, who once  allegedly headed the Johannesburg City Council spy ring.    -  Second in command Colonel Gerrie Borman, the senior staff  officer for the East Front, which includes Swaziland, Tanzania,  Uganda, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.    -  Pat Keyser, SSO West Front -- Botswana, Namibia, Angola,  Zaire  and Zambia. Kayser was formerly with the Rhodesian Central  Intelligence Organisation [CIO] which initiated Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance]. He moved to SADF [South  African Defense Force] MI's [Military Intelligence] Directorate  of Special Tasks, responsible for running Renamo in Mozambique  and Unita [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  in Angola, and later to DCC.    -  Colonel Gert Pretorius, SSO Foreign Intelligence Services,  whose job is to identify threats from foreign intelligence  agencies.    -  John Maudsley, now believed to be running Internal  Collection.    -  Sandra Nolan.    -  Leon Nefdt.    -  Terry Scallan, based in the Eastern Cape.    -  Lieb Venter.        Also understood to be in the DCC's employ is Henri van der  Westhuizen, responsible for intelligence on the ANC until March  this year. After the WM&amp;G sent its list of suspected DCC  members to the military this week, Van der Westhuizen assaulted  a former SADF [South African Defense Force] officer he believed  to be one of our sources.    Past employees of the DCC:     -  Brigadier Tolletjie Botha, former DCC director who lost  his job after the Goldstone raid.    -  Colonel At Nel, one of Botha's deputies, who also lost his  job.    -  Jean Blignaut.    -  Ferdi Bernard, the former CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau]  member  hired by DCC between May and December 1991.    -  Warrant Officer Clive Brink, who once worked in Ciskei for  Military Intelligence front organisation International  Researchers/Ciskei Intelligence Services, whose task was to prop  up the Gqozo regime.    -  Lucas Delport, now possibly working as a diplomat.    -  Jose D'Oliviera, an Angolan Portuguese who ran the DCC field  office in Rundu, Namibia, and was allegedly an ivory smuggler.    -  Pamela du Randt, arrested by British police while allegedly  on  a mission to kill Dirk Coetzee.    -  Leon Flores, arrested along with Du Randt.    -  Tony Oosthuizen, who until March was responsible for  intelligence on the PAC.    -  Mickey Geletti.    -  Deon Gerber.    -  Gerhard Jansen van Rensburg lost his job after the Goldstone  raid.    -  Koos Louw, now a naval commander in Saldanha.    -  Alec West, ex-Rhodesian CIO, Colin Evans and Albie Botha, all  rehired after the Goldstone raid.    -  Leon Nefdt.    -  Jan Anton Nieuwoudt, who trained Inkatha members at the  Caprivi  Strip in the 1980s and later ran the International  Researchers-Ciskei Intelligence Services operation in Ciskei for  DCC. He won a R220,000 [rand] payout from the SADF shortly  before the elections.    -  Sandra Nolan, the administrative officer responsible for  running key front companies.    -  JP Opperman, now based in the Durban field office.    -  Eugene Riley, who was recruited to DCC by Ferdi Barnard. He  died under mysterious circumstances.    -  Jim Ross, who moved on to track down illegal diamond dealers  for Anglo American Corporation.    -  An Askari [former ANC member working for the South African  police] formerly employed by Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock,  Chris Makgopa. Another Askari hired by DCC, Glory "September"  Sedibe, died mysteriously.    -  Stephan Snyders, who was accused of criminal activities after  the Goldstone raid and lost his job.    -  Philip Steenkamp.    -  Rick Verster, who was accused of criminal activities after  the  Goldstone raid and lost his job.    -  Wally Wilsenach, who lost his job after the Goldstone  raid.

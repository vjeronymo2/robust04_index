			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Working Group has reviewed Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993, and has recommended it to the FAA for mandating of the described inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and necessary repair. The SWG also recommends modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 or more total landings. The upper skin panel in these particular lap joints has a doubler that is hot-bonded to the skin. The countersink depth of the rivet is greater than the basic skin gage. While this is not a problem for a skin panel with the hot bond intact, disbonding will result in a knife-edge condition in the skin layer. This condition causes these lap joints to be more susceptible to fatigue-related cracking. The SWG also recommends accomplishment of repetitive inspections of these modified lap joints. Accomplishment of these modifications and inspections will detect fatigue-related cracking and corrosion in a timely manner and will ensure the structural integrity of the skin lap joints beyond the design life of the airplane. The FAA has concurred with the Working Group's recommendations and has determined that AD action is warranted to mandate the inspections and modifications to assure the continued airworthiness of the Model 747 fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;53&hyph;2307, Revision 2, dated October 14, 1993, that describes procedures for inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The service bulletin also describes procedures for ``full'' modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 total landings. Such rivets are used in the lap joints at the following locations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Stringer 12, left and right, from station 520 to 1,000; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Stringer 19, left and right, from station 520 to 740.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``full'' modification for deep countersink rivets at these locations consists of opening the lap joint between circumferential splices, removing adhesive, repairing all cracks and corrosion, and reassembling the lap joint with 9/32 inch protruding head rivets at all rivet locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The service bulletin also describes procedures for repetitive external high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks of modified lap joints at the upper fastener row, and repair, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The service bulletin also describes procedures for an ``optional'' (partial) modification for certain lap joint areas that have an upper skin panel thickness of 0.090 inch or less and that do not have cracks or corrosion or an existing structural repair on the lap joint. The ``optional'' (partial) modification consists of removing the upper row of rivets at a corrosion-free lap joint, performing an HFEC open hole inspection to detect cracks in removed rivet locations, and installing 1/4-inch protruding head rivets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. The proposed AD would also require ``full'' modification of certain skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe that are fastened with deep countersink rivets on airplanes that have accumulated 20,000 total landings. The inspections and ``full modification'' would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed AD would also require repetitive external HFEC inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks of modified lap joints, and repair, if necessary. After such repair, additional repetitive external HFEC inspections would be required. The HFEC inspections and repair would also be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed AD would also provide an ``optional'' (partial) modification for certain skin panels that have a thickness that is within specified limits, and that do not have cracks or corrosion or an existing structural repair on the lap joint. For those skin panels, this ``optional'' (partial) modification may be accomplished in lieu of the ``full'' modification. However, the ``optional'' (partial) modification may not be implemented at deep countersink fastener locations. The ``optional'' (partial) modification would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accomplishment of the requirements of this proposed AD would terminate the requirements of AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;6653 (55 FR 28600, July 12, 1990). The FAA is considering further rulemaking action to revise AD 90&hyph;15&hyph;06, Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 39&hyph;6653, accordingly once this proposed AD becomes effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 200 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 116 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs associated with the proposed inspections entail 100 work hours per airplane per inspection, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed inspections, is estimated to be $638,000, or $5,500 per airplane per inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs associated with the proposed ``full'' modification entail approximately 96 work hours, for each 200-inch length of uncracked and uncorroded lap joint, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. (This figure does not include the time necessary for gaining access and closing up.) There are 100 lap joint sections per airplane, each with a length of 200 inches. The cost of required parts is expected to be negligible. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed ``full'' modification requirement, is estimated to be $61,248,000, or $528,000 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs associated with the proposed initial HFEC inspection following modification entails approximately 56 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators, with regard to the proposed initial HFEC inspection following modification, is estimated to be $357,280, or $3,080 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is expected to be $62,243,280, or $536,580 per airplane. This total cost figure includes the proposed inspections and modification, for the first year of the average five-year inspection cycle. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA recognizes that the proposed ``full'' modification would require a large number of work hours to accomplish. However, the proposed compliance time specified in paragraph (e) of this proposed AD should allow ample time for accomplishment of the ``full'' modification coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

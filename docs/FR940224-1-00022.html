Yields on one year Treasury bills at `constant maturity' are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519) is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Frequency of interest rate changes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur no sooner than 12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. To set the new interest rate, the lender will determine the change between the initial (i.e., base) index figure and the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Method of rate changes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial rate and magnitude of changes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran. The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Except for the initial rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example, if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent. If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 81/8 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pre-loan disclosure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, no later than on the date upon which the lender provides the prospective borrower with a loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in the loan folder and included in the loan submission to VA. Such lender disclosure must include the following items: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in the interest rate index: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The frequency (i.e., annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual disclosure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  At least 25 days before any adjustment to a borrower's monthly payment may occur, the lender must provide a notice to the borrower which sets forth the date of the notice, the effective date of the change, the old interest rate, the new interest rate, the new monthly payment amount, the current index and the date it was published, and a description of how the payment adjustment was calculated. A copy of the annual disclosure shall be made a part of the lender's permanent record on the loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Section 36.4312 is amended by removing from paragraph (e)(3) the words ``in paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5)'' and replacing them with the words ``in paragraph (e)(4)''; by adding (e) introductory text; and by revising paragraph (e)(1) to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;36.4312 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Charges and fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a fee must be paid to the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The fee on loans to veterans shall be as follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) On all interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under Sections 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7) the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) On all refinancing loans other than those described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the loan amount for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of section 3701(b)(5) of title 38, U.S.C., and 2 percent of the loan amount for loans to all other veterans, provided, however, that if the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, the fee shall be 3 percent of the loan amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Except for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of section 3701(b)(5) of title 38, U.S.C., the funding fee shall be 2 percent of the total loan amount for all loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent.

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Survey of Israel (6): Likud seeks a young leader - Politics THE LIKUD party is set to leapfrog an entire court of 'crown princes' as it prepares to elect a new leader and start down the road to recovery from its defeat in the June elections, writes ERIC SILVER. Neither of the frontrunners to succeed Mr Yitzhak Shamir as Likud leader - Mr Binyamin Netanyahu and Mr Binyamin Begin - has cabinet experience. Both entered parliament as recently as 1980. 'Bibi' Netanyahu is 43; 'Benny' Begin, son of the late Mr Menachem Begin, is 49. The high-flyers previously tipped to succeed the old warriors of the Irgun Zvai Leumi and the Stern Gang - smooth lawyers in their 50s like Mr Dan Meridor, the former justice minister, and Mr Ehud Olmert, previously health minister - have pulled out of the race. Mr Ariel Sharon, at 64 the oldest of the original contenders, has made a tactical retreat. Mr David Levy, the 55-year old former foreign minister and standard bearer of Israel's north African immigrant community, is still running hard, but his chances have diminished. He is blamed for weakening the party on the eve of the general election by reviving ethnic resentments. Two younger Sephardi candidates, Mr Moshe Katsav and Mr Meir Sheetrit, are putting down a marker for the future. Mr Netanyahu confirmed his position as early favourite on November 15 by persuading the 3,000-member Likud central committee to adopt a system of primaries for choosing a leader who would command them through the present parliament to the next elections, due in 1996. The committee overwhelmingly rejected Mr Begin's alternative proposal which would have left a decision about the candidate for prime minister to a later stage. His father's memory is a dwindling asset. The younger Begin, an earnest geologist with an American PhD, appeared extensively in Likud's television commercials last spring, but he lacked his father's showmanship and passion. The party managers gambled on the name and the name was not enough. The elections left Likud politicians weary and dejected, a party with a lame-duck leader, a ramshackle machine and debts of Dollars 50m. Only Mr Netanyahu, who introduced the 10-second sound-bite to Israeli diplomacy, first as ambassador to the United Nations, then as deputy foreign minister, seemed ready for another battle. His rivals accuse him of importing American techniques - and American money in the form of donations from US Jewish supporters - into the contest. But they have failed to brand him an outsider. He presses the flesh. His oratory owes more to Hebrew football commentators than to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (his alma mater). He is rapidly making good his lack of a power base within the party by recruiting new members to Likud - about 25,000 since June. Mr Netanyahu's critics complain that they don't know what he stands for. What he has vouchsafed so far is that he favours electoral reform and a market economy of Thatcherite rigour. He wants to hold on to all the occupied territories. He does not trust the Arabs. That may suffice to win the Likud leadership in the March primaries. But unless Mr Rabin disappoints those who voted for a change of national priorities, it may not be enough to make Mr Netanyahu prime minister in 1996.</p>

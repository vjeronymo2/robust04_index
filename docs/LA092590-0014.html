			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOFTON ON MORAL INSANITY  </P> <P> Oh, I get it. A tossed salad commentary! Just throw up a half a dozen serious  subjects, i.e., abortion, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, women murdered in  the workplace, etc. (whose potential for serious debate could fill columns) and  see where they land on a piece of paper.  </P> <P> Add a pinch of paranoia; a dash of Republican rhetoric; a couple of cups of  right-wing catch phrases and toss it all in a big bowl of hot air and top it  off with a nice dressing of "moral insanity" (whatever that means) and voila! A  tossed salad to exceptional hyperbole.  </P> <P> Hey, John, you can take your aluminum foil chef's hat off now. The CIA is no  longer bouncing recipes off your head!  </P> <P> MIKE OSTRYE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

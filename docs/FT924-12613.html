			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Receiver for North West Growers This summer's glut of tomatoes, which has already caused the Dutch to bury 1m boxes of the fruit, has now resulted in the failure of North West Growers, one of the largest UK producers. Along with Marathon Fresh Foods, a sister company which packs and markets fresh salad vegetables, it has been put in the hands of Mr Mike Seery, the receiver from KPMG Peat Marwick. North West and Marathon, both of Southport, Lancashire, had a combined turnover of Pounds 3m and debts of more than Pounds 2m. Established in 1970, North West invested Pounds 800,000 in a new five-acre site in 1988 to make it the largest tomato grower in the north-west. It is hoped the businesses will be sold as going concerns. To that end, the 53 full-time and 48 part-time staff have been retained.</p>

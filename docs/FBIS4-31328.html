			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 6 June (MTI) -- "I sincerely hope that  Hungary's new government will not forget its obligations towards  ethnic Hungarians beyond the border, that it will use all  possible means -- including international forums -- to further  their interests, and that it will hold preliminary discussions  on all related political moves with legitimate leaders of  cross-border Hungarian organizations beforehand."    ``I also hope that the new government will require that  policy on ethnic Hungarians abroad be invariably based on a  consensus between parliamentary parties.    "I shall be in a position to warn my successor in the post  of  prime minister of this obligation," says a letter from Peter  Boross to Oradea Bishop Laszlo Tokes, which was released by the  Government Spokesperson's Office to MTI on Monday [6 June].    Boross was replying to Tokes's open letter, published in the  Budapest daily MAGYAR NEMZET on April 11, asking for Hungary's  political support for Transylvanian Hungarians, urging the  conclusion of a bilateral cooperation accord between the  Hungarian Government and the Hungarian Democratic Federation of  Romania, and calling for political and economic assistance to  curb the emigration of Hungarians from Transylvania.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: Stronger UK and US markets help Tarmac Tarmac yesterday became the latest UK construction and building materials group to announce a sharp recovery in profitability in 1993 as it took advantage of improving markets in the UK and US. Pre-tax profits of continuing businesses quadrupled from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 55.7m thanks mainly to a strong performance by UK housebuilding. After allowing for goodwill write-offs on disposals, the group recorded a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 350.3m). The shares, which since the beginning of this year had out-performed the sector, fell 8p to 178p on profit-taking and concerns that recovery in housing profits could be undermined by higher land prices. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive, said group profits were expected to improve further in the current year as Tarmac took advantage of rising house sales and prices and better building material margins. Prices of UK building materials rose by 5 to 10 per cent during the year and by similar amounts in the US where the construction recovery was even more advanced and widespread than in the UK. Turnover of continuing businesses fell from Pounds 2.44bn to Pounds 2.37bn. Losses per share were were 11.3p (36.4p). Pre-exceptional earnings per share were 3.1p (0.4p losses). The group is paying a maintained dividend of 5.5p with a proposed same-again 2.5p final. Interest payments fell from Pounds 58.8m to Pounds 39.4m as the group cut net debt, including auction market preferred stock, from Pounds 577m to Pounds 194m, helped by last autumn's Pounds 214.9m rights issue. Gearing fell from 63 per cent to 18 per cent. The company, which planned to increase spending on housing land with a provisional target of building 8,500 homes a year by 1996, said gearing was not expected to rise above 40 per cent. Mr Simms said that the group would not chase house sales at the expense of profit. It would reduce sales if the housing market fell away or land prices became too expensive. The housing division produced the biggest improvement last year with operating profits rising by 43 per cent to Pounds 55.2m (Pounds 38.6m) in spite of a reduced turnover of Pounds 606m (Pounds 651m). There was also a turnround in the building materials division which made a Pounds 3.2m profit (Pounds 2.9m loss), and in the US, which moved from a Pounds 1.4m loss to a Pounds 3.5m profit. Construction, in spite of a difficult UK market, maintained profits at Pounds 21.1m (Pounds 22.7m) on slightly lower turnover of Pounds 945.5m (Pounds 978m). Quarry products was the odd poor performer with profits falling by 24 per cent to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 26.6m) because of reduced sales of coated stone in the UK and difficult conditions in France.

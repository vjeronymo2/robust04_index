			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clark confirms he will step down - Defence MR ALAN CLARK, the colourful and controversial defence procurement minister, yesterday announced that he will leave the Commons at the coming general election. His decision, after 18 years as a Tory MP, was revealed to his Plymouth Sutton constituency association at the weekend. Mr Clark commented yesterday: 'It was a difficult decision to make. And there were a whole range of different considerations.' When told that his agent had said he was leaving for personal reasons, Mr Clark reacted with characteristic abruptness: 'I never said that. 'Personal reasons' usually means there has been a scandal and I can assure you there is nothing of that.' At Westminster, most Conservative colleagues concluded that the wealthy 63-year-old minister has decided to retire to pursue his other interests, including his work as a historian. Political opponents claim, however, that his 4,013 majority over the Liberal Democrats in Sutton has made the seat substantially less secure. At council elections in May last year, there was criticism among local Tories of his attention to the constituency and complaints that he had inadequately defended the Devonport dockyard. The Old Etonian son of Lord (Kenneth) Clark, the art historian, has long proved one of the most outspoken, entertaining and quirky figures on the Tory benches. This year alone his aristocratic manner has been demonstrated in a court appearance on speeding charges and contradicted by a magisterial attack on bloodsports in the pages of The Guardian. Since moving to his present post from the Department of Trade and Industry in 1989, he has never been far from controversy. His cavalier manner has sometimes outraged senior military commanders and his relations with Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, are said to have been difficult. His closeness to Mrs Margaret Thatcher strengthened his initial role at the defence ministry, where his proposals for armed forces cuts set the tone for the Options for Change review begun in 1990 - although the final reductions were less drastic than Mr Clark's would have been. In the midst of the military build-up in the Gulf, he again embarrassed colleagues by challenging the usefulness of Nato and of keeping US forces in Europe. On another occasion he accused European allies of 'running to the cellars' while the US and Britain faced up to Iraq. As MP for Plymouth Sutton, he appeared to pre-empt decisions on the future of naval bases with reassurances on prospects for Plymouth's Devonport facilities. He was pursued by controversy over his role at the DTI in promoting British exports to Iraq, although he denied 'giving a nod and wink' to exporters to evade restrictions on arms sales. A new Conservative candidate for the seat is expected to be selected within three weeks. Observer, Page 18</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: Labour not cynical in pressing its Maastricht amendment Sir, You seem either unable or unwilling to understand why Labour moved and voted for the successful amendment on the Committee of the Regions ('Major must persevere', March 10). The import of the sanctimonious message in your leading article is that we should 'rubber stamp' a government bill to which we always have had fundamental objections. How can you legitimately describe as cynical an opposition party which expresses its view clearly, moves an amendment to legislation, and states its intention to vote for it? Our aim was to ensure that our delegation to the committee is truly representative of the nations and regions of the UK when dealing with the institutions of the European Community. Our argument that elected representatives from local government should make up the 24 members was accepted by the Commons on March 8. As you rightly say it is Mr Major's own rebels who are filibustering on the Maastricht legislation. They have not been bought off by the Tory leader's opt-out on the Social Chapter - the first of many miscalculations by the prime minister over Maastricht. You fail to mention it was Mr Major who, in a state of panic last November, promised to delay third reading of the bill until the second Danish referendum. Your charge of cynicism would be more appropriate to a prime minister who promised delay and now complains of opposition amendments. To say the 'government's tactics have been less than brilliant' is a laughable understatement of reality. But serious government misjudgments are no reason for an opposition to refrain from pressing its own ideas in the House of Commons. Jack Cunningham, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

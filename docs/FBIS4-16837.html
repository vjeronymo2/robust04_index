			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> Diplomatic Correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] The Korean Peninsula is the only hot spot in Asia  and the Pacific which may seriously destabilize the situation in  and outside this region. Given this, talks with the South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow on June 1 to 4 will deal  with ways of easing tensions in the Korean Peninsula and with  South Korean-Russian relations, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister  Aleksandr Panov told INTERFAX on Tuesday.    He believes that the South Korean president's visit to  Moscow  provides "one more proof of our stable and broadening  relations." "We hope that the forthcoming visit will give a  fresh impetus to them," he said.    To quote Panov, relations between Moscow and Seoul develop  normally and have no unsurmountable barriers, which can be  judged from a 40 percent increase in bilateral trade last year.    Panov emphasized that Russia's initiative on the convocation  of an international conference on the Korean Peninsula remained  in force. "This idea has not been rejected by anyone, although  most of our partners give preference to bilateral talks," he  said.    He told INTERFAX that Russia had already held consultations  with China, Japan and other parties concerned. "No one has  removed this idea from the agenda. Moreover, everyone thinks  that at a certain stage it may become rather efficient. We  don't think that bilateral talks, the way they have been  conducted until now, hold any promise. They are not making any  progress and only complicate the situation each time they find  themselves in a deadlock," said Panov.    He announced that Russia would like the People's Democratic  Republic of Korea to adhere to the treaty on the  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. On the other hand, we  think that it is high time that all the parties concerned worked  out a single policy instead of holding consultations on the  Korean problem, he continued. A balance of interests must be  found, whereby the security interests of both Korean states will  be observed, said Panov.    It is difficult so far to talk about the date of the  international conference, he went on to say. "We propose that a  consultative meeting be held to discuss the agenda," he said.    Asked if the government crisis in Japan would influence  Russian-Japanese relations, Panov said that Russia had no fears  on this score. Judging by all accounts, Tokyo will not change  its policy in relation to Russia whoever heads the Japanese  government and whichever parties are represented in it.</p>

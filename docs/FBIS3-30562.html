			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale </F> on 6 February -- recorded]    [Text] The meeting with Mr. Akashi, Generals Cot and Rose,  attempting to find a solution for a long-term and stable  cease-fire in the Sarajevo region, passed in a constructive  atmosphere. The Serbian side is very interested in complete  calm in Sarajevo, and I believe that we are well on the way to  achieving a cease-fire that would begin tomorrow, providing of  course, that the Muslim side accepts it.    The Muslim side has one motive for accepting the cease-fire  in Sarajevo, and one motive for not accepting the cease-fire.  The motive for accepting is that this would free a large part  of its forces that they could deploy on the fronts in central  Bosnia against the Croats, and on other fronts throughout Bosnia  against the Serbs. The motive for not accepting the cease-fire  is that Sarajevo would stop being an international media hit,  that is, the Muslims would lose a significant trump card, which  they use to apply international pressure to the Serbs. However,  I hope that reasons for accepting a just and stable cease-fire  will prevail.</p>

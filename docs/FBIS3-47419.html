[Yi Yong-tok] I have grasped the entire organizational  structure of the NUB and the work each department of the NUB is  charged with. I am still studying the specific details of the  policies and strategies related to the inter-Korean dialogue.    [Kim] Several days ago you mentioned the North Korean human  rights issue, touching off some controversy.    [Yi] That confirmed for me, the fact that not enough of a  national consensus about reunification strategy exists. Some  newspapers supported my view in their editorials and columns  which led me to think that this was the general opinion, others  criticized my view.    [Kim] You have been a career educator throughout your life.  How does your background reflect upon your appointment as NUB  minister?    [Yi] Indeed education is my area of specialization. I have  regarded education in schools as my minor and education in  society as my major. With that in mind, I founded the Korean  Educational Development Institute and served as its first  director for 10 years. In the early 1960's I met Mr. So Yong-hun  and was involved in Red Cross work. Then I became involved in  educational broadcasting. These experiences led to my taking up  of positions like the chair of the Broadcasting Deliberation  Committee and the first director of the Broadcasting Development  Institute. I think that this, in addition to my time as the  South's delegate to the North-South Red Cross talks prior to my  appointment may have been taken into consideration in my  selection.    [Kim] How long were you in direct contact with the North  while serving as senior delegate to the Red Cross talks?    [Yi] That was from 1984 when the two sides had contacts over  the relief goods for the flood victims until December 1985 when  the 10th round of full-dress North-South Red Cross talks were  held.    [Kim] What lessons did you learn from that experience?    [Yi] At that time, our primary objective was to hold talks.  We accepted the flood relief goods only because that would  enable us to hold talks. The talks were held, but failed to  result in the improvement of inter-Korean relations. North  Korea should be held responsible for this. On our part, we  tried hard not to cause a break up in talks in order to avoid  being blamed for the break up of talks. Meeting with the North  delegates then, however, we were led to doubt the usefulness of  meetings. I think it is now time for the North and the South to  hold practical and substantial talks in order to achieve real  reconciliation and to head for reunification. This is why I  have stated that the days of avoiding words that might displease  the North Korean side have now passed.    [Kim] What reunification policy will you promote?    [Yi] I will emphasize two aspects. The first aspect is  forming an image of a reunified state which we must attain. To  achieve this South and North Korea must work to show change  simultaneously. Reunification through absorption means that one  side will perish. What is important is that the two sides must  show change and develop according to the current situation.  Reunification must not be achieved with the result of the  demise of one side. The legal system and mode of living must  also change in preparing for reunification. Even though the  South and North are of completely different systems, with a  common goal, we can become close. I believe that if this is  carried out, reunification can be achieved and both sides can  also survive.    Second is the resolution of the issue of separated families.  South and North Korea are calling for reunification. Therefore,  I believe that allowing families who have been separated for  some 40 years without knowing if their families were alive or  dead, is the most concrete and earnest way for reconciliation.  If a plan for reconciliation is mapped out based on these two  aspects, I believe that there will be no problem in the second  and third stage of the government's three-stage reunification  method.    [Kim] Many people are worried about the relationship between  the NUB and the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP].    [Yi] I believe there is no problem between the NUB and the  NSP. We cannot say that one is doing a good job and the other is  doing a bad job because both organizations are working hard to  achieve reunification. Since the NUB has primary control of the  work to achieve reunification, I believe that the NSP must  cooperate well with the NUB. NSP Director Kim Tok has already  telephoned me on several occasions and expressed that the NSP  will cooperate fully.    [Kim] Dissidents of the reunification movement are turning  their attention to what you are saying and doing. How will you  maintain your relations with them?    [Yi] Dissidents are people with diverse opinions. If they  recognize the direction the government is pursuing to realize a  reunified state, I believe that dialogue will be able to solve  everything. On the other hand, I believe that it will be  difficult to hold talks with people who reject the government's  reunification effort and who try to overthrow our system. If  the dissidents agree with the direction of the government's  effort for reunification, I believe that the difference in  views, no matter how wide, can be breached.</p>

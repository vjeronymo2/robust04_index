			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "Follow the </F> Example of the Occupied Territory"]    [Text] The phenomenon of attacking foreign tourists in the  wake of every massacre or problem in the occupied territory  should be fully condemned by all forces and citizens. This  phenomenon should be dealt with firmly and decisively by the  security agencies. The reason for this is that any person who  takes revenge for what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque by  stabbing a foreign tourist is harming an innocent human being  and rendering a service to Israel and Zionist gangs.    If those who carry out such attacks knew the extent of  sympathy the Hebron massacre has evoked in the United States,  and even Japan, they would definitely feel guilty and come to  the conclusion that they have unwittingly rendered a service to  our enemies. When an ordinary citizen in Europe and the United  States hears that a foreign tourist was stabbed in an Amman  street, or in any other Arab country, he will be more responsive  to Zionist propaganda portraying us as killers and terrorists.    It is not true that every Westerner is our enemy and  Israel's  friend. World public opinion has shifted greatly in favor of  our cause. The intifadah in the occupied territory has opened  the eyes of Westerners to the reality of matters in our region.  European and U.S. citizens are now aware that Zionist  propaganda is misleading and that Israel is a racist,  suppressive state.    It is totally unacceptable that foreigners and tourists in  our country should be targets for spontaneous, emotional  reactions whenever Israel commits a massacre in Palestine. We  should launch a media campaign using television, radio, and the  press to warn against these odious actions that harm our cause  and substantiate Zionist propaganda against us in Western  nations.    Those who regard an attack on an innocent tourist -- whose  true feelings and sympathies are known only to God -- as a  heroic act should follow the example of the occupied territory.  No foreign tourist has ever been attacked in the West Bank and  Gaza, even when clashes and confrontations are raging, save what  happens by mistake. This is why the presence of foreign  journalists and tourists has been utilized in the interest of  the struggling Palestinian people and against Israel and the  Israeli troops.    The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has elicited sorrow and sadness  not just from those who attacked foreign tourists and others  they thought were foreign tourists; all our people were deeply  moved and were in tears over this massacre. However, they  expressed their sadness and sorrow by staging demonstrations,  making donations, or praying for the mercy of the martyrs. They  did not resort to unacceptable reactions, as did those who  attacked our foreign guests.</p>

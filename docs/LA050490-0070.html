			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR LEAK MAY DELAY WORK ON PRINCESS LOUISE  </P> <P> Salvage workers trying to refloat the sunken restaurant ship Princess Louise in  Los Angeles Harbor said Thursday they have discovered an air leak that could  force them to delay the operation for up to three days.  </P> <P> Divers will reopen the sealed-off hull and main deck and try to patch a leaking  seam with quick-drying plastic, said Willem G. Boelman of TriNav Shipping, one  of two Canadian-based companies overseeing the salvage operation.  </P> <P> Salvage workers had been hoping to raise the capsized vessel in its Terminal  Island berth and sink it at sea to create an artificial reef this week.  However, they discovered early Thursday morning that the hull was not holding  enough pressure to keep the vessel afloat. Salvagers say they will try to float  the ship upside down partly because it will be easier to tow.  </P></p>

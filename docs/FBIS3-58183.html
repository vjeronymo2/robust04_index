Mustafa Asula, Turkish ambassador in Pakistan, told AA  reporter on the phone that they expect the diplomats to arrive  in the afternoon.    Two dozen foreigners, including four UN staff and diplomats  from Pakistan, India, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Libya, drove out  of the war-shattered city in the afternoon in two convoys headed  for neighbouring Pakistan.    It was not clear whether the convoys would cross into  Pakistan through the Khyber pass or halt for the night in the  eastern Afghan town of Jalalabad.    But some Pakistani and Saudi diplomats, as well as several  from Indonesia, North Korea and Iran and one Palestinian, stayed  on. Sudanese diplomats left on Friday. [passage omitted]    Turkey said on Friday it would evacuate its ambassador and  three other staff from its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul,  rocked by a week of factional fighting.    A missile landed in the embassy garden last weekend.</p>

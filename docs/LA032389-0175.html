			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: GENETICS TENDERIZES TOUGH EYE OF ROUND INTO A DIFFERENT BREED OF  CUT  </P> <P> At one time in this country, as recently as 20 years or so, three or four  breeds of cattle provided us with some of the best beef in the world.  </P> <P> The English breeds, Hereford, Angus and Shorthorn, were the cattle that made us  a nation of beef eaters. They were small cattle by today's standards, and slow  to reach marketable weights. But they were giants in providing top-quality meat  with the rich beefy flavor that comes from a more mature animal.  </P> <P> Today, there are 74 breeds of beef animals registered in the United States,  many of them giants in size. Some of the new European breeds reach marketable  weights even before they reach maturity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where's the Beef?  </P> <P> They are babies, barely more than veal, when they become meat for tables. As a  result, they don't have the rich beefy flavor of a more mature animal. In my  opinion that is why it is getting harder and harder to find a great steak. But,  at the same time and for the same reason, beef today is leaner and generally  more tender than the beef of 20 years ago.  </P> <P> In my opinion the cut of beef has gained more as a result of today's beef  cattle genetics and crossbreeding than the eye-of-round. Once a tough cut that  required long, slow cooking to make it even much more tender than the sole of a  boot, it is now a different breed of cut.  </P> <P> The eye-of-round is one of the four muscles of the beef round (the hind leg of  the beef animal). It is not now, nor has it ever been, one of the most tender  muscles of the animal, but from today's larger, younger beef cattle, it is far  more tender than it was from yesterday's more mature animals. Cuts that a  generation ago required three and four hours of cooking can be done in a third  of the time or less.  </P> <P> You will often find eye-of-round in the steak section of the supermarket meat  case cut thin and labeled "breakfast steak" or "sandwich steak," but that's not  the place to buy it. Go to the roast section and buy an eye-of-round roast. It  will almost certainly cost you less per pound and you can easily slice your own  thin steaks for breakfast or sandwiches, although those are not the best uses  for eye-of-round. Tender though it now is, it is still not really tender enough  to be fried or grilled with much success.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Family Favorites  </P> <P> The following recipes are family favorites. They have been for years, but they  have been updated to take into account the new breed of eye-of-round.  </P> <P> Boliche Relleno is a specialty of the house at the Columbia Restaurant in the  heart of Old Tampa's Latin Quarter. I got the original recipe from Cesar  Gonzmart, fourth-generation proprietor of the Columbia, more than 10 years ago.  The recipe has been changed some over the years for two reasons: The first is  to simplify it a bit; I don't have the staff in my kitchen that Cesar has in  his. The second is to shorten the cooking time. Today's eye-of-round does not  need the 3 1/2- to 4-hour cooking time called for in Cesar's  great-great-greatgrandma's recipe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BOLICHE RELLENO  </P> <P> 1 (approximately 2-pound ) eye-of-round roast  </P> <P> 1 piece Chorizo or smoked sausage approximately 1 inch in diameter and as long  as eye-of-round  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon paprika  </P> <P> 2 strips bacon, diced  </P> <P> 1 large onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 large green pepper, chopped  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon dried oregano  </P> <P> 4 bay leaves  </P> <P> 2 cups beef broth  </P> <P> 1/4 cup cold water  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon flour  </P> <P> Cooked black beans and rice  </P> <P> With blade of long, thin carving knife, pierce hole through length of roast by  first inserting blade through meat horizontally, then vertically to make cross  cut. Be careful to keep as much to middle of meat as possible.  </P> <P> Carefully insert sausage into eye-of-round by starting at one end of roast and  gently pushing sausage into meat, turning from side to side as necessary.  Combine salt, pepper and paprika and rub mixture well into all sides of meat.  </P> <P> Fry bacon in heavy Dutch oven to render couple tablespoons of fat. Brown  Boliche well on all sides in hot fat. Lightly saute onion and green pepper in  same pan. Add garlic, oregano, bay leaves and beef broth. Return roast to pan,  cover and roast at 325 degrees 45 minutes.  </P> <P> Remove roast from pan. Strain pan juices into saucepan. Mix water and flour,  stir into pan juices. Cook, stirring, over medium heat until thickened  slightly.  </P> <P> Slice Boliche into thin slices and spoon sauce over. Serve with black beans and  rice. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P> <P> Note: If time permits, place sausage in freezer for 1 hour to firm before  inserting into meat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEON'S MAMA'S GRILLADS  </P> <P> 1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef eye-of-round  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 4 to 5 cloves garlic, very finely chopped  </P> <P> Flour  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon oil  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups chopped onions  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely chopped celery  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely chopped green pepper  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) can tomatoes, chopped  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups beef broth  </P> <P> Cooked grits or rice pilaf  </P> <P> Cut eye-of-round into 1-inch-thick slices. Mix together salt, black and cayenne  peppers and chopped garlic. Sprinkle spice mix over both sides of beef pieces  and press in well with fingers.  </P> <P> Coat each piece well on both sides with flour and, with edge of plate or meat  tenderizer, pound flour well into meat. Each piece should end up about 1/2-inch  thick. After meat is pounded, dip once again in flour and shake off any excess.  </P> <P> Place butter and oil in heavy Dutch oven and brown grillads on both sides.  Remove to platter and set aside. Add onions, celery and green pepper to pot and  cook, stirring, 3 to 4 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Return meat to  pot, add tomatoes and beef broth. Cover and simmer 30 minutes. Serve with grits  or rice pilaf. Makes 4 to 6 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The failure of yesterday's demonstration for  dialogue in Algiers is doubtless partly due to the fact that  some of the legal political circles did not take part, but  mainly to the fact that it was boycotted by the Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS]. According to the daily AL-WATAN, the  reason is that the slogans chosen were a concession to the  authorities, and the organizers did not enjoy credibility.  Furthermore, the FIS apparently blamed these organizers for  refusing to call for the release of its leaders and for the  rehabilitation of the movement. Evidently the proclamation by  the new Algerian authorities of dialogue without exceptions is  not meeting with much response from the Islamists of the FIS.  It must be said that the FIS is setting very hard conditions  before agreeing to hold discussions. For the FIS, before any  discussion, the authorities have to admit that they themselves  are illegal. Hachemi Sahnouni, a founding member of the FIS,  explains:    [Begin Sahnouni recording] In December-January, the  authorities contacted us via the dialogue commission. They  contacted several Islamist tendencies of the FIS [as heard], and  then nothing. They did not contact me or people in contact with  me. We can negotiate, in the hope of arriving at the following  goal: Namely that the authorities admit that they are illegal,  that they do not represent the Algerian people, and they must  give in to the demands of the people. Otherwise there is no  point in negotiating. If we negotiate in order to allow the  current authorities to remain in power, so that the problems of  the people remain the same, or perhaps get worse, I see it as  being pointless to negotiate.

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Air France close to deal with Sabena AIR FRANCE expects to clinch a partnership agreement with Sabena this year and open the way for the development of Brussels into a new European airline hub. Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman, confirmed yesterday that the French flag carrier was ready to invest FFr700m (Pounds 72m) in Sabena in return for a 37 per cent stake in the Belgian airline. Although talks between Air France and Sabena remain suspended because of the uncertain political situation in Belgium, Mr Attali said he was 'quite hopeful' that the negotiations would end successfully. Air France emerged as Sabena's favoured partner after talks between the Belgian airline and British Airways collapsed last year. After failing to reach an agreement with Sabena, BA has turned its attention to negotiating an even more ambitious partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest, the US carrier in which KLM has a 20 per cent stake. BA has so far refused to comment on its talks with KLM which are understood to be at a sensitive stage. The complexity of the proposal to create a new global airline partnership between BA and KLM modelled on the Anglo-Dutch Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell conglomerates is expected to entail several more weeks of discussions. Both the Air France-Sabena and the BA-KLM negotiations reflect the scramble by international airlines to develop significant partnerships and position themselves in an increasingly global and deregulated airline market. Apart from the proposed alliance with Sabena, Air France has already completed a series of strategic agreements and acquisitions including a co-operation pact with Lufthansa, an investment in CSA of Czechoslovakia, and the acquisition of the French carriers Air Inter and UTA.</p>

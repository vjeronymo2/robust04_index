			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Nadir Affair: Letter from Mates 'based on misinformation' MR MICHAEL MATES, who yesterday resigned as Northern Ireland security minister, may have sacrificed his political career by taking up a false cause. Scotland Yard said last night that the letter he wrote to the attorney-general on behalf of Mr Asil Nadir, which complained about the behaviour of two British police officers while in northern Cyprus, was based on misinformation. The officers whose alleged behaviour prompted Mr Mates's intervention, Mr Jones and Mr Savin, were in northern Cyprus on business unconnected with Asil Nadir or Polly Peck. In a detailed statement, which added to doubts over many of the claims from Mr Nadir, Scotland Yard said the two officers had been together in northern Cyprus only once, on October 9 1991, in connection with the deportation of a Turkish Cypriot, Mr Surmeli Tuluco. Mr Jones made a further visit to the island on November 5 1992 with another, unnamed officer, while Mr Savin visited on November 11, again with a second officer. Both visits were connected with different deportations. Separately, the Serious Fraud Office, which has been investigating Mr Nadir's business affairs with officers seconded from the Metropolitan fraud squad, said that 'none of them have ever been to northern Cyprus'. Mr Mates's letter was sent to the attorney-general on March 17 1993 with a photocopy of a certificate allegedly issued by the acting commissioner of police in northern Cyprus, giving dates of arrival and departure of Mr Jones and Mr Savin. The letter alleges both men stayed at the Altin Kaya Hotel, where they made extensive inquiries of the proprietor, Mr Fahri Otcuoglu. Mr Otcuoglu said he remembered two visits by Mr Jones and Mr Savin: one at the end of September 1991, when they stayed for three days, the other at the end of May 1992, when they stayed for five or six days. His hotel, a small bungalow on the outskirts of Kyrenia, was unable to provide any registration book or other documentation to confirm this. But the acting police commissioner for northern Cyprus, Mr Ali Cetin Karahan, said yesterday he had no recollection of either a Mr Jones or a Mr Savin coming to the island. One of the hotel's barmen, an Englishman who asked not to be named, said he recalled a visit by Mr Jones and Mr Savin, but insisted the two men had been there on deportation duties. Just how Mr Mates's letter came to be published remained a mystery last night. Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, the lawyer acting for Mr Nadir in the UK, said he had no knowledge of the letter prior to its publication. The only reference he had to SFO investigations in northern Cyprus was correspondence from the SFO stating they could not send their officers there because of legal difficulties with the local authorities. The events culminating in Mr Mates's resignation began on May 4 when Mr Nadir became a fugitive from British justice by jumping bail and flying to northern Cyprus, which the UK does not recognise as a legal entity. Within four weeks Mr Mates found himself in the midst of a growing political storm linked to the Nadir case when it was revealed by two Sunday newspapers that over a period of 18 months the minister had written to the attorney-general on Mr Nadir's behalf, questioning the conduct of the Serious Fraud Office's inquiry into the Polly Peck empire. It was also reported that three days before Nadir jumped bail, Mr Mates sent him a watch with the inscription 'From C and M. Don't let the buggers get you down.'</p>

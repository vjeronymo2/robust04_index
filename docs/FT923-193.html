			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Major looks for help from French MR JOHN MAJOR'S 90-minute meeting at the Elysee Palace this afternoon could determine the success of the emergency European Community summit in Birmingham next month. The UK prime minister's discussion with President Francois Mitterrand is, one insider said, 'designed to enable him to start trying to shape the consensus'. 'It's about squaring the circle' was the perhaps more realistic phrase of another. Downing Street emphasised yesterday that Mr Major has a good relationship with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whatever the view about briefings from officials of the Bundesbank, and said that the two often spoke on the telephone. With the prospect of a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders before the mid-October summit looking remote, however, France is increasingly significant as a possible ally on the way forward on the dispute over the exchange rate mechanism and on Maastricht. Mr Mitterrand will urge Mr Major to reduce recent Anglo-German tensions. He will also back the UK leader's plan to inject more democracy into the Maastricht process in a bid to get Britain to ratify the EC treaty this year, say French officials. France recognises Mr Major's internal political problems in pushing treaty ratification, but believes the January 1, 1993, target date for the treaty to enter into force can be met. In the short term, France is worried about the possibility of the UK government taking irreversible steps away from the Maastricht treaty, following sterling's departure from the parity grid of the European Monetary System and consequent British bitterness at lack of Bundesbank support. For their part UK Foreign Office officials say that while the close result of the French referendum has some side benefits for the UK's agenda, such as its reinforcement of the importance of retaining each country's national identity, other aspects could add to Britain's difficulties. Though some of the damage to Anglo-German relations may have been undone at this week's EC finance ministers meeting, Mr Mitterrand is still expected to counsel Mr Major not to let himself, or his cabinet colleagues, give vent to anti-German rhetoric. French officials say they realise, from the way relations with Germany figured large in the stormy French referendum debate on Maastricht, that such rhetoric can prove popular. But they warn that Britain needs co-operation, not conflict, with Germany if it is to bring the pound back into the ERM. British officials said the prime minister would be keen to hear first-hand President Mitterrand's analysis of the French referendum outcome and of his bilateral discussion with Chancellor Kohl last week. Mr Major is also expected to brief Mr Mitterrand on his discussions with Danish ministers about how they expect to proceed after their country's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. He is likely to argue that even if other countries do not see the need for fundamental changes in the ERM, the probability of a second Danish referendum before the uncertainty about Maastricht is resolved could impose strains similar to those in the run-up to the French referendum. So some sort of review is required.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Mitterrand wields double-edged sword: Ailing French president prepares the ground for the judgment of history In recent days Francois Mitterrand has been behaving like a man clearing his desk, putting a gloss on his presidential record for posterity, and emptying out dusty drawers before the historical cleaners arrive to uncover more murky incidents in his past. One of his doctors affirmed yesterday that the president, whose 78th birthday falls next month and who has been suffering from prostate cancer for at least two years, was 'fine'. And indeed on Thursday Mr Mitterrand was in Berlin to take the farewell to his country's troops there, and he was back in Paris yesterday to greet President Jiang Zemin of China, with whom he will sign some big-figure trade contracts today. But what the president has told Le Figaro newspaper in two long interviews this week, and Mr Pierre Pean, the author of a startling book on the 1936-47 period of his youth, has left an extraordinary ambiguity around everything, including his health. He told Le Figaro that he reckoned his cancer 'will be obliging enough for me to finish my term' which ends next May, but also said he was conscious that he would only be around 'for a few months or years'. As Mr Mitterrand, a specialist in ambiguity, well realises, such comments only fuel the uncertainty in the markets and the French political world about an early election. In addition, the Socialist president has managed to spray criticism and praise around in such a way as to help destabilise French conservatives. This would be wholly welcome to his own party, if it were not for the fact that revelations about his right-wing and Vichyist associations before, during and after the second world war have shocked many Socialists. It was already known that the young Mitterrand participated in some right-wing movements before the war, and that after his escape from a German prisoner camp in 1941, he worked for the Vichy administration for a year or so before sliding into the resistance. But what has shocked many French is the disclosure of Mr Mitterrand's friendly associations with Mr Jean-Paul Martin and Mr Rene Bousquet, senior officials in the Vichy police. Mr Mitterrand, while president, apparently attended Mr Martin's funeral in 1986. He also told Mr Pean that he considered Mr Bousquet 'sympathetic'; yet as president he inaugurated a day of national mourning for one of the Jewish deportations in 1942 of which Bousquet was accused. The latter was assassinated last year before he could face war crimes charges. In the same interviews, Mr Mitterrand also delves into his more recent past. He says, for instance, that his 1989 call for a Europe-wide confederation was misinterpreted as a bid to keep eastern Europe out of the European Union, and that his 1991 resistance to German calls to recognise ex-Yugoslav republics' borders was not an attempt to freeze the Titoist order there. But of more current interest are the various stones he casts in the path of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by revealing divisions in the conservative government over whose Wednesday cabinet meetings he presides. In addition to warning rank-and-file Gaullists of 'the certain tendency' of their government 'to re-enter the ranks of Nato', he also notes that Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, sided with him  - and against the prime and defence ministers - on intervention in Rwanda. On Algeria, he points out the way that Mr Balladur sided with Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister, and against Mr Juppe. Anything resembling praise for Mr Juppe is tacit encouragement to Mr Jacques Chirac, whose presidential bid the foreign minister backs against that of the prime minister. Clearly, President Mitterrand intends to go on dividing before he stops ruling.</p>

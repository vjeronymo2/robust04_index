			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New era for wine industry as quotas end THE SOUTH African wine industry received a tremendous boost this week with the announcement that quota requirements in the industry are to be abolished. The announcement, made by the KWV, the co-operative body that supervises the local industry, is the most important reform in the sector in decades. It has been welcomed by producers as a long overdue step that will revitalise the industry and stimulate the production of quality wines. Introduced in 1956 in an effort to control production in the country, the quota system meant that producers could not grow grapes and manufacture and sell wine without first having a production quota. Quotas were attached to existing vineyards, so, until the implementation of reforms in 1985, it was not possible to become a wine farmer except by buying out an existing producer. Quotas were also very expensive - as much as R800 (Pounds 131) a tonne in some areas. The system had an marked detrimental effect on the development of the quality wine industry in South Africa. When quotas were first handed out in the 1950s, the industry was very different from its present form. There was a bias in favour of quantity production, associated with warm, fertile, high yielding areas, and against cooler areas where slower maturation favoured making quality wines. With quotas fixed in areas unsuitable for the production of quality wines, and no new quotas handed out since 1975, the regulations were an important inhibition to developing the cooler regions. Mr Tim Hamilton Russell, one of the country's leading wine makers and a leading opponent of the KWV, commented: 'The whole system was designed to prevent the development of the quality end of the wine industry.' He said it had allowed the less regulated Californian and Australian wine industries to steal a march on South Africa. Looking ahead, he said the abandonment of quotas would create a freer climate to invest in the wine industry, encouraging especially the people, dedicated to quality, who come to wine 'through the glass, not the soil'. Mr Allan Mullins, who heads the wine division of the Woolworths store group, described the announcement as 'a fantastic step, a very progressive move'. He said it was a brave initiative on the part of the KWV because most of their shareholders were commodity grape growers who were unlikely to gain, and might well lose, from the initiative. Probably the main factor which encouraged the KWV to initiate the quota reform was the opening up of new markets to South African products, which has reduced the prospect of significant oversupply. Despite the latest announcement, the industry remains highly regulated, with the guaranteed minimum price mechanism the most glaring reminder.</p>

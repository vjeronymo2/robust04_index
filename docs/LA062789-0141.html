			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EEC LEADERS AGREE ON COMPROMISE PLAN FOR ECONOMIC UNITY  </P> <P> European Economic Community leaders today agreed on a compromise plan for  gradually unifying their economies after Britain succeeded in blocking attempts  to create a single currency and a central bank.  </P> <P> "We have conceded nothing at all," British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  said at the end of a two-day summit.  </P> <P> However, France and West Germany, which were aligned against Britain in the  dispute over broad plans to unify the economies, also declared themselves  pleased with the compromise pact.  </P> <P> Closer monetary union is part of the EEC's drive toward December, 1992, when  the member nations will drop trade barriers to form a single market.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the agreement at the end of a two-day  EEC summit was a "superb result."  </P> <P> "The foundation has been laid for a development that brings the EEC further  together and brings political union one step nearer," Kohl told reporters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How Far and How Fast  </P> <P> The 12 EEC leaders have been divided over how far and how fast to go toward  closer economic and monetary union as part of the establishment of a single  Europe-wide market in 1992.  </P> <P> In a final communique, the leaders endorsed only part of a sweeping plan for  monetary union drawn up by Jacques Delors, head of the EEC's executive body,  the European Commission.  </P> <P> The communique avoided setting any deadline on the more controversial aspects  of the plan: creating a single currency and a central bank. But it did provide  for the calling of an intergovernmental conference on those proposals,  something Thatcher had sought to avoid.  </P> <P> French President Francois Mitterrand said he will call the intergovernmental  conference after next year. The conference can be called by a simple majority,  but once there any member nation could veto the changes.  </P> <P> Britain also agreed in principle to link the pound to the exchange rate  mechanism that aligns the value of the EEC's major currencies.  </P> <P> But Thatcher hedged the move, which she has long resisted, with strict  conditions. These included that Britain's 8.3% inflation must drop to near the  4.5% average in the EEC and that arrangements for the single market must be  complete.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Repeated Clashes  </P> <P> Besides Britain, some smaller EEC nations, including the Netherlands,  Luxembourg and Portugal, have also expressed reservations about the Delors  plan.  </P> <P> Mitterrand and Thatcher clashed repeatedly during the summit behind closed  doors, officials reported, and gibed publicly at each other afterward.  </P> <P> Each claimed that it was the other who had been most isolated at the  conference.  </P> <P> "It was not me who was isolated," said Thatcher. "It was President Mitterrand."  </P> <P> Mitterrand agreed with a French radio interviewer that Thatcher was the "brake"  on Europe.  </P> <P> She retorted at a news conference: "It's a bit rich, isn't it -- someone who  has not got freedom of capital movement . . . calling me a brake on Europe. He  has scarcely got into the car."  </P></p>

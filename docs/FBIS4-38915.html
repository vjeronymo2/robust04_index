			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 01, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister  Mart Laar met in Tallinn today with a delegation from the  Institute of Mitsui &amp; Co. for Trade and Economic Studies. The  mission from the institute under the Japanese investment giant  Mitsui &amp; Co. was led by the institute's President Yoshikatsu  Hironaka. The visit was due to Mitsui's interest toward the  economic situation and development opportunities in Estonia as  well as prospects for the company's operation in the region, the  government press office says.    Laar at the meeting spoke at some length about the country's  economic policy guidelines and explained that his government had  based its steps on the principle of radical reform. He said  that in order to attract someone's attention in the present-day  world, one had to make steps that may not be common elsewhere.    The guests at the meeting praised Estonia's speed in  proceeding on the reform path. They said the country's resolve  in introducing a proportional 26-percent income tax was  impressing. The discussion further focused on the situation in  the sphere of foreign investments and trade between the two  countries. The mission members were particularly interested in  facts about the free trade treaty to be signed between Estonia  and the European Union soon.</p>

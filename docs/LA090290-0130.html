			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAVING ON SEWAGE  </P> <P> In the battle of numbers about the possible costs involved with the  implementation of San Diego's secondary sewage treatment system, it's easy to  be dazzled by the smoke and mirrors of official pronouncements.  </P> <P> The county Board of Supervisors recently received a report looking into the  actual costs involved in this proposed system.  </P> <P> When the financing costs are included, it is clear that the amount is easily  double the $2.8 billion figure, or $5 to $6 billion.  </P> <P> If federal requirements are changed to allow new chemical methods to be  incorporated, there will be no need to undergo the massive capital costs  involved with building a secondary treatment facility using biological  oxidation methods.  </P> <P> If the capital costs of adding biological oxidation methods are 35% of the $2.8  billion -- hence a savings of nearly $1 billion -- and if we add the savings in  financing costs, the amount of money saved to the rate payers is at least $1.6  billion.  </P> <P> ELAINE R.

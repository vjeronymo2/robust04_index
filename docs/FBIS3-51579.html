The foreign minister said the crisis of Banco Latino and its  subsequent intervention, which the government ordered last week,  has "damaged the image" of Venezuela in the international  financial world.    The bank closed its doors 14 January due to a serious crisis  of liquidity, after some 55 billion bolivars (some $514 million)  were withdrawn over the last three months, according to reports  by the bank board of directors.    Ochoa said the government's intervention is aimed at  protecting the deposits of depositors and defining what is the  real situation of that bank.    At the end of last year, Banco Latino was the Venezuelan  financial institution with the largest amount of deposits and  the third largest credit portfolio holder. The government  intervention may have significant consequences in the national  economic area.    The Venezuelan foreign minister said Venezuelan authorities  must establish clearly the criminal responsibilities that may  exist in this case, in which the savings of thousands of  depositors and Venezuelan Government institutions have been  endangered.    Venezuelan judicial authorities have ordered an  investigation  to establish if the Banco Latino directors have committed  embezzlement against that financial institution.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Many failed by planning Sir, Your leader, 'Planning for higher prices' (November 10), fails to take into account the millions of people, including the elderly, the disabled and families without access to private transport, who are being disadvantaged by the proliferation of out-of-town superstores. The independent small corner shop plays a crucial role for these citizens and they would be the first to lose out were we as a nation to followlemming-like the American way of shopping. America now suffers from the 'doughnut' effect, namely everything on the outskirts with very little, if anything, in the middle. Rather we should follow the Japanese example where planning permission is not given for a large retail development without a vote being taken first among the local business community. It may be the case that these superstores are immensely efficient, clean, with a wide choice of goods and services to hand. However, once the superstores have killed off the competition it may just be that quality will go down and prices will go up.

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (9): Asian centre for offshore finance - Labuan Island TODAY the sign at the gate of the 'Financial Park' on Labuan island leads only to a muddy building site and a cluster of pile drivers, but by the end of 1995 the island's small town should be overshadowed by at least MDollars 400m worth of office, condominium and commercial buildings. The creation of the Financial Park - by a consortium of the Malaysian central bank and commercial banks - underlines the determination of the federal authorities to make Labuan a thriving international offshore financial centre (IOFC) in the face of widespread scepticism among bankers in south-east Asia. Labuan's shortcomings are well known: office space is in short supply on this 92 square kilometre island off the coast of Borneo and clerical staff are hard to find. Only small aircraft such as the Boeing 737 can land at the airport, and the government has deferred plans to lengthen the runway. Since declaring Labuan an IOFC in 1990, however, the Malaysian government has devoted much time and millions of ringgit to ensure that Labuan succeeds. 'We the authorities are quite worried that it's moving too fast,' says Mr Mohamad Khir Abd Rahman, manager of the bank regulation department at Bank Negara, the central bank. 'New offshore banks are fighting for new office space.' That problem should be solved when the Financial Park is finished - the developers say a third of the office space has already been informally booked - and in the meantime banks are allowed to manage their offshore units from Kuala Lumpur, although they must also maintain an office on the island. So far 13 banks have been licensed to establish offshore units in Labuan, including Standard Chartered, Hongkong Bank, two Japanese banks and the main Malaysian banks. Bank Negara officials say total loans and deposits have each reached about Dollars 1bn - tiny by comparison with Hong Kong or Singapore but growing fast. There are also three insurance companies and 139 other companies licensed to operate offshore in Labuan. The Labuan economy, previously reliant on regional entrepot trade based on its free port status, services to the oil and shipping industries, has profited from the government-inspired building boom. Officials of the opposition state government in Sabah argue that the federal authorities are pouring money into Labuan to persuade voters that cooperation with Kuala Lumpur is better than confrontation: Labuan was part of Sabah but became federal territory in 1984. 'Perhaps the idea is to show it's a success if you cooperate with the feds,' says one banker. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister and driving force behind the development of Labuan as an IOFC, also looks at the project as a way of stimulating Malaysia's financial sector. The Malaysian government urges most state companies to raise foreign loans through Labuan. Bank Negara officials say Labuan is centrally located among the countries of Asean, the Association of South East Asian Nations. They are hoping the island will benefit from capital flight from Hong Kong in the lead up to China rule in 1997. Labuan compares favourably with its regional rivals on tax concessions. There is no withholding tax on bank interest, and offshore companies are given the choice of a three per cent tax on net profits, or a flat rate of MDollars 20,000. Secrecy for offshore companies is assured. But international bankers are still sceptical about Labuan. In Singapore or Bangkok, they say, customers can conduct their regular as well as their offshore business. Bermuda and Jersey are millionaires' playgrounds as well as offshore centres. (Mr Khir has an answer to that: 'Labuan might just turn out to be that way - a Monte Carlo for instance'). But Labuan is difficult to reach and has few facilities, the bankers say. Why, they ask, does an 'offshore' tax haven need to be physically offshore at all? Although Malaysian officials put a brave face on it, they were taken aback by the almost casual way in which the Thais established their own offshore business earlier this year - called the Bangkok International Banking Facility - and quickly attracted applications from more than 50 local and foreign banks; Thailand granted licences to 47. Even the few foreign banks already establishing their offshore units in Labuan - with a handful of staff - are believed to be doing so as a kind of political insurance. Those with domestic networks in Malaysia want to protect their interests by pleasing the authorities; those without operations in the restricted Malaysian banking market hope that supporting Labuan might help them in the future. 'People are assuming that this is a good way to score points,' says one economist in Kuala Lumpur. Although this attitude is widely acknowledged, bankers say it does not necessarily mean that Labuan will fail as an offshore centre; the government's financial 'pump-priming' and its real or imagined efforts at persuasion could easily give the island's offshore industry the critical mass it needs to succeed. 'It's almost at the stage when they can't afford for it not to work,' says one banker.</p>

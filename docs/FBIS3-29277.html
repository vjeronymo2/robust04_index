Senior officials of the  two governments were scheduled to start discussing the claims  totalling more than 500 million U.S. dollars in Hanoi on Tuesday  and Wednesday. One reason for postponing the talks was to  consider whether details of establishing the liaison offices in  each other's capital should be considered at the same forum.</p>

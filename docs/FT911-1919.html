			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UN pursues refugee police plan PRINCE Sadruddin Aga Khan, who is in charge of United Nations relief operations, is expected to raise the possibility of deploying UN civilian police in northern Iraq to protect Kurdish refugees when he returns to Baghdad shortly, diplomats said last night, Michael Littlejohns writes from the UN. A UN spokeswoman confirmed that the plan, proposed by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was among matters discussed by senior UN officials in Geneva under the prince's chairmanship. Also in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was setting up seven reception camps to accommodate 100,000 refugees along Iran's frontier with Iraq. Discussions on the British plan also continued in New York yesterday. According to his office, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, UN secretary general, still was undecided about it. He is believed to have sought UN legal advice. In northern Iraq allied forces ordered President Saddam Hussein's troops out of new areas to enlarge the safe havens for refugees.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Deutsche faces its critics, shares rise Bourses had mixed fortunes, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT shivered when bund futures weakened, and the Dax index touched an intraday low of around 2,180. However, both futures and the cash market recovered with the Dax closing at 2,196.97, and virtually holding in the post bourse. Turnover eased from DM11.6bn to DM10.4bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that German 10 year bonds were now yielding around 6.30 to 6.40 per cent, 60 basis points more than they offered at the end of 1993 in spite of the downtrend in short term interest rates. The Bundesbank, he said, needed to keep the D-Mark strong and to retain the increasing foreign investment in German domestic bonds which has been apparent since unification in 1990. Meanwhile, Merck Finck fancied a contra-cyclical bet on financials. Mostly, this was a good idea: Deutsche Bank decided to face its critics on television (last night) and in the press (next Monday), rose DM16.50 to DM765.50 and lifted the sector; but then there was Depfa, the mortgage bank, a strong tip three or four weeks ago by analysts who thought it could hit DM1,200. Depfa said yesterday that it was adding DM60m to loan loss provisions to take account of its exposure to Schneider property loans, and the shares fell DM35 to DM740. PARIS was unimpressed by the 10 basis point cut in the French intervention rate, and signalled its dissatisfaction at what it saw as 'too little, too late' by diving to the day's low of 2,079. The market recovered swiftly, but then retreated once again before a positive opening on Wall Street helped it to recover just before the close. The CAC-40 index ended off 10.76 at 2,091.95. Peugeot slipped FFr9 to FFr905 as some profits were booked following a good rise ahead of yesterday's 1993 results. Eurotunnel eased FFr1.05 to FFr40.90, but off a low of FFr40.60, after announcing that it would open the tunnel to passenger services in October. ZURICH was again pulled lower by weak bonds but recovered with Wall Street, the SMI index ending 37.1 lower at 2,781.6. Foreign selling depressed insurers. Zurich Insurance lost SFr35 to SFr1,235, Winterthur SFr10 to SFr665 and Swiss Re SFr17 to SFr630. Among banks, SBC fell SFr13 to SFr404 and CS Holding SFr14 to SFr606. Some cyclicals continued to find favour. Georg Fischer, the foundries and engineering group which last month forecast a return to profit this year, added another SFr35 to SFr1,435, taking its gains this week to SFr95. Roche certificates, seeing some profit-taking after this week's figures, fell to a low of SFr6,780 before finishing SFr90 lower on the day at SFr6,900 after some sustained late buying by a Zurich bank. AMSTERDAM ended marginally firmer, The AEX index rising 0.57 to 415.41. Nedlloyd added Fl 1.30 to Fl 75.70 as 1993 results came in much as expected, while Hoogovens put on Fl 1.60 to Fl 64.70 on good 1994 prospects. One of the best performances came from Nutricia, the food group, rising to a 12 month high, up Fl 1.50 to Fl 82.00. Goldman Sachs came out with a positive recommendation this week, noting that the company promised good 1994 results, helped by recent restructuring. MILAN played a waiting game, with domestic funds staying out of the market, and the Comit index fell 10.79 to 766.81. Benetton rose L325 to L25,714 on a 12.6 per cent rise in 1993 consolidated net profits, although the result was in line with forecasts. Ferruzzi remained volatile, losing L37 to L2,498 as it emerged that the company's L1,399bn funding programme will be launched next Tuesday. Ciga, the hotel group, fell L26 to L1,207 in heavy volume of 25.5m shares amid speculation that Sheraton may have to raise its bid to gain control. Against the trend, Stet put on L26 to L5,863 which was attributed to switching between the savings and ordinary shares. Among blue chips, Fiat lost L70 to L6,394 and Pirelli L145 to L2,925, although the tyremaker's Wednesday announcement that 1993 losses had narrowed and the company should return to profit in 1994 was regarded as an extremely positive development. MADRID offered a gentle recovery, the general index rising 1.39 to 311.12 as turnover fell further to Pta20.3bn. In banks, Banesto recouped Wednesday's losses, rising Pta50 to Pta800; Santander responded to higher first quarter profits, up Pta60 at Pta6,150; but the non-bidders for Banesto stood out more with BCH up Pta115 to Pta2,975 and Popular Pta310 better at Pta15,210. ISTANBUL dropped 5.9 per cent on the fall in the dollar and the collapse of Marmara Bank, banned from taking deposits after weeks of speculation which engulfed the banking sector in a liquidity crisis. The composite index fell 1,212.16 to 19,428.31 as turnover soared from TL1,800bn to TL2,700bn.

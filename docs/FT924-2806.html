			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: MFA extension The Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which governs the bulk of the world's textiles and clothing trade, has been extended for another year to the end of 1993, Frances Williams writes from Geneva. The extension, the fifth since 1974, was made necessary by the delay in concluding the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, which includes a draft accord to phase out the MFA over 10 years. Deciding the extension yesterday the textiles committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said bilateral agreements negotiated next year within the MFA framework should provide more access than their predecessors to rich-country markets, with special consideration being given to small suppliers and least developed countries.</p>

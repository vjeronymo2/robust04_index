On 18 January at "La India" cafe, Moncada Guillen held a  joint news conference with representatives of the Central  American Unionist Party, chaired by party leader Blanca Rojas,  and representatives of the National Justice Party (PJN), led by  Jorge Diaz Cruz.    These three parties issued a communique in which they  pointed  out that given the serious political, social, and economic  situation Nicaragua is experiencing: "We have decided to join  efforts to search for alternative solutions, hoping Nicaraguan  society will accept them, and together we will struggle for  their implementation."    The three political leaders expressed that currently the  nation is going through dramatic times as a result of poverty,  the lack of moral values, the disparagement of its political  leaders, "and the lack of specific projects" to solve  Nicaragua's problems.    In the communique, they also invited all Nicaraguans to  participate in a project they called "Unity for Change," which  adopts a "credible and trustworthy" political platform that  renews the people's spirit to work and their hope in the future.    At the news conference, Moncada Guillen, who is also a  doctor, indicated this initiative was taken to create a new  political culture, that turns its back on the past and looks  toward the future.    Meanwhile, PJN President Diaz Cruz asserted his organization  had decided to form an alliance with other political forces "to  generate new, reformed criteria in the political position we  will present to society."    Diaz Cruz added there are "mixed criteria and ideologies" in  his party that unites evangelical sectors. Therefore, he noted,  members of diverse political and ideological concepts can  participate together. Diaz Cruz indicated his party is new, but  he concluded by saying "it has great possibilities" for  participating in the nation's difficult political road.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Gas leak at Thorp N-fuel plant STAFF were evacuated from Thorp, the controversial nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, after a gas leak during tests yesterday. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, said last night that 'the work being carried out was non-radioactive'. It added that there was only a 'slight' escape of gas outside the plant, which posed no danger to the public. The leak, which is highly embarrassing for BNF, comes at a sensitive time in the long-running debate about whether the Pounds 2.8bn plant should get a licence to start operation. The current public consultation on the plant's future, the second in the past year, is due to decide in the autumn whether to give the go-ahead to the plant, which reprocesses used nuclear fuel. BNF said last night the incident was embarrassing 'in a way' but added: 'The tests are being carried out to make sure things do work properly.' The leak of nitrogen dioxide, which can cause breathing difficulties, occurred at 3.30pm, and BNF sent 280 staff 'in the immediate vicinity' outside the building. Twenty-five workers were taken to the medical surgery at the West Cumbrian site for examination before being allowed home. Some are to have a further medical check today. Last week BNF won court permission to begin radioactive tests of the 500-metre-long plant, which has taken nearly 10 years to build. But next week it faces another court challenge from Greenpeace, the pressure group, which will attempt to halt the tests on the ground that they prejudice the government's eventual decision. BNF said last night that the leaking gases were not part of the uranium testing. Greenpeace said: 'Thorp is meant to be the ultimate in technology and if BNF can't keep the non-radioactive materials under control, it does not bode well for the safety of the whole plant.' It added: 'This has been a bad year for them with leaks.' Earlier in the year, radioactive gases escaped from two other, unconnected parts of the Sellafield site. Yesterday's leak occurred while the gas was being used to test the ventilation in part of the plant.</p>

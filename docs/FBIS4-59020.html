			<p>BFN     [Text] Morocco's King Hassan has urged Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin to pursue the peace process and expressed his  belief that Israelis and Palestinians can coexist and create a  new Middle East. These remarks are included in a message sent by  the king to the prime minister via Knesset Member Rafi Edri, who  visited Morocco last weekend.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Moroccan and  Israeli  representatives are currently discussing the establishment of  economic representations in Jerusalem and Rabat, the opening of  direct aviation routes, and the establishment of telephone and  postal services between the two countries.</p>

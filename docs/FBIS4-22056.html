			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Shi'ite terrorist that came to our country  not only intended to attack Israeli diplomatic headquarters in  our country but to poison Israelis in the Middle East as well.  In order to do so, he was to have gained access to large  shipments of beef to be exported to Israel in order to poison  them with a powerful toxic substance.    This warning was sounded by the Israeli intelligence service  soon after it informed the Paraguayan National Police that Ahmed  Al Mekdav, a fundamentalist Shi'ite, had arrived in our country  a month ago.    Police Superintendent Enrique De Jesus Martinetti, the  director of the National Police Intelligence Department,  confirmed this and pointed out that the information was provided  by the Israeli secret service.    The terrorist had to locate meat-packing plants that export  meat to Israel, find a way to get access to the product to be  exported to Israel, and then poison it with a deadly toxic  substance.    The consequences would have been devastating. The objective  was to kill hundreds of Israelis in important cities in their  country.    The name of the meat-packing plants are: "Frigobeef,"  located in Capitan Lombardo very close to Artigas, and "San  Antonio" in the city of the same name.    Intelligence Department personnel went to those meat-packing  plants and warned their managers to take the necessary  precautions by not allowing strangers on their premises so as to  thwart any sabotage attempts.    Martinetti noted that the meat was imported by a private,  and  not government-owned, Israeli meat-packing plant.    He said: "We were alerted by the Israelis and now are  conducting an inquiry. We have been informed that this Shi'ite,  Imadal Mekdav [name as published], intended to poison a large  shipment of beef that was going to be exported to Israel. We  have seemingly aborted this attempt with the help of the  Israelis. Mekdav has been spotted already in Lebanon." [passage  omitted]</p>

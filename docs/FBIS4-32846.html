			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 27 May (NA) -- President Carlos  Menem implicitly supported the implementation of a clause making  it possible for governors to be reelected when he said that the  provincial constitutions "should be entirely in accordance" with  the terms of the national Constitution.    The president's words are a renewed support to the plans of  certain governors, Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde among  them, who hope the Constituent Assembly approves a clause  enabling them to become gubernatorial candidates in 1995, even  if their districts prevent them from being reelected.    In remarks made to "La 9.90" radio station on the night of  26  May, Menem again denied rumors that he was seriously ill. He  called for "an end to this irresponsible behavior, because  spreading this sort of rumor shows no love for the country or  its people." [passage omitted]    Commenting on the Olivos Pact, he rejected the idea of a  "package." He pointed out that "it is a law, part of which has  been agreed upon," and declined "to make further comments  because now it is the Constituent Assembly members' turn to talk  about it."    He also expressed support for a possible reelection of  governors because "four provinces have the possibility of  reelecting their governors and this unequal treatment of the  issue is repugnant to the national Constitution."    He emphasized: "There are no grounds, no reasons to oppose  the governors' reelection. We cannot forget that if we look at  the issue from the philosophical point of view, the provincial  constitutions must be entirely in accordance with the terms of  the national Constitution."    Menem believes the reelection issue is not a matter of form  but of essence because "it grants all citizens an equal right to  be elected and reelected."    Asked whether Duhalde could run for the vice presidency if  prevented from being reelected governor, Menem answered "of  course he can." He added that it was "a lie" that Economy  Minister Domingo Cavallo might become "jealous" because of that.    He pointed out: "Cavallo is now less interested in entering  the political area because he is doing very well in the economic  area. He is a vigorous, somewhat passionate, man."    He added: "The important thing is that in the economic field  things are well." He confirmed that "there is no possibility of  modifying or violating the economic model that we have  implemented."    Regarding disagreement created over the Secretariat for  Community Protection, Menem regretted the fact that "some have  exaggerated what has happened." He emphasized, however, that  "the issue has been discussed and the river waters have returned  to their course. The river is flowing slowly but uninterruptedly  and no one is mentioning the topic now."    "I do not know where the rumors come from, but all I can  tell  these people is `those whom you have killed are in good health.'  I have never felt better nor as full of enthusiasm for doing  things for my country as now," Menem said denying rumors about  health problems.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that &sect;409.46(c) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to specify that only skilled nurses or physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therapists with special training in respiratory care be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to furnish respiratory therapy services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have not accepted this comment for two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons. First, the purpose of this section is to describe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain services that are allowable administrative costs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not to establish requirements for coverage of skilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing or physical therapy services; therefore, such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision would not be appropriate to this section. Second,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not believe that such a revision is necessary because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State practice acts and professional standards of practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally regulate the services that can be provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurses and therapists, thus preventing nurses or therapists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from furnishing services they are not qualified to provide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Place of Service Requirements (&sect;409.47)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that this section be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to reflect the place of service provisions formerly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;409.42(e)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have accepted this comment. We have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised this section to reflect the specific provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1861(m)(7) of the Act and previous regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;409.42(e) more closely. As stated in the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;409.47(b), an outpatient setting may include a hospital, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SNF or a rehabilitation center with which the HHA has an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrangement in accordance with &sect;484.14(h) of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that this revised requirement, by duplicating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of section 1861(m) of the Act, more closely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects the original congressional intent to restrict home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health coverage of outpatient services to only a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific outpatient facilities and thus ensure that home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health services would be primarily provided in the homes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has also been brought to our attention that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of a beneficiary's home at proposed &sect;409.47(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the definition of ``confined to the home'' at proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;409.42(a) were not entirely consistent. We have revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;409.42(a) so that both sections define a beneficiary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home for purposes of Medicare home health coverage as any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place in which the beneficiary resides that is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital, SNF, or nursing facility as defined in sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1861(e)(1), 1819(a)(1), or 1919(a)(1) of the Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that the place of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service requirements contained in &sect;409.47(b) be expanded to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow Medicare home health coverage of outpatient services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished in a variety of settings, such as general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outpatient clinics and adult day care facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As we explained in the previous response,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act specifically allows Medicare coverage of outpatient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health services furnished in a hospital, SNF, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation center. We have revised paragraph (b) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the statutory provision. We have not expanded the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list of allowable outpatient settings because such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision would not be consistent with the plain language of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute. Also, it is important to note that section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1861(m)(7)(A) of the Act provides for coverage of outpatient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health services only when the beneficiary requires a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service which ``involves the use of equipment of such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature that the items and services cannot readily be made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the individual'' in his or her home. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means that Medicare coverage of outpatient home health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services is available only when the primary service cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be furnished in the home, not merely when it is more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convenient to the HHA or beneficiary to provide the service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an outpatient setting. Because coverage of outpatient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home health services is available only in such specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, we believe that the statutory limitation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the services to certain specific facilities is appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and does not restrict a beneficiary's access to covered home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health outpatient care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

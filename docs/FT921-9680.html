			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy It looks as though the government cannot pull decisively ahead in the polls without taking some calculated risks in economic management. A tax-cutting budget and lower interest rates are not the most obvious prescription, given sterling's weakness in the ERM. But they might be warmly received by the foreign exchange market if they made a Tory victory appear more likely. That would be the kind of virtuous circle the government badly needs. Yesterday's consumer credit and retail sales figures were a rude reminder that there is precious little reason for the voters to get spontaneously excited. If so, the government may be tempted to cut interest rates before the budget. Otherwise it would be too late for lower mortgage rates to be in place before an April election. Indeed, they already need to be effective by budget day to affect the retail price index before a May 7 poll. That explains why some money dealers believe the Bank of England is now testing the water for a possible rate cut. But it would be dangerous to infer that a cut is actually imminent. Sterling may have ridden out December's German rate increase; the peseta may also be only a distant threat, since it seems to move obediently in line with sterling. But the surest way of losing the election would be a botched rate cut followed by a currency crisis. That risk calls for delay until the last possible moment. There is still some time left, though not much, if the government is to maximise the political advantage of a cut and retain the option of going for April 9.</p>

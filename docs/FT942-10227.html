			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (9): Costs are catching up - Foreign investment The blue work jackets of the Santana Motor factory in the Andalucian town of Linares have become a familiar symbol of industrial protest in Spain over recent weeks. The company, a subsidiary of Suzuki, obtained protection from creditors in February; the Japanese parent declared that it had poured enough money into it, and then drew up proposals which included cutting 1,500 of the plant's 2,400 jobs. In an area overwhelmingly dependent on one foreign-owned factory, the Santana conflict is a paradigm of Spanish worries about multinationals' commitment to their local operations. The anti-Japanese reaction raised anxieties about the damage that the row could do to Spain's image among investors, prompting the government to undertake a public relations campaign in Tokyo. It is not the only case. Another Japanese company, Kubota, announced it was closing its Ebro Kubota tractor factory outside Madrid with 300 jobs. And, to the anguish of the hard-pressed regional authorities in Andalucia, Gillette of the US said it would abandon its razor blade plant near Seville, employing about 240, to concentrate its western European production in Germany and the UK. In the eyes of many Spaniards, the multinationals which only a few years ago seemed to be queueing up to enter Spain are now queueing up to leave. Not so, insists Mr Juan Ignacio Molto, state secretary at the industry ministry. For all the hard times multinationals have been facing - including Volkswagen's Seat car subsidiary and Nissan's Motor Iberica operation, both high profile acquisitions of the 1980s now going through drastic restructuring - investment levels remain high, he says. Net direct investment from abroad, according to the ministry's provisional estimates, may have exceeded Pta1,000bn (Dollars 7.2bn) last year; less than in the three previous years but more than any other year in Spain's history including the boom period of the late 1980s. The controversy, Mr Molto argues, has come from isolated cases. Suzuki never wanted overall control of Santana and is in search of a new shareholder. Ebro Kubota is not the only tractor company that has suffered - John Deere has stopped production near Madrid. And Gillette's plans have nothing to do with the profitability of the plant. Nonetheless, these cases are symptomatic of more widespread concerns about the competitiveness of Spanish manufacturing operations. Spain is no longer the obvious place for investors seeking low wages, especially in comparison with former communist economies in eastern Europe. 'Until a few years ago,' Mr Jose Maria Cuevas, head of the CEOE employers' organisation, wrote recently, 'Spain was an attractive country for multinationals, not because it was very productive, but because it produced at lower cost than other developed countries.' Costs are now close to those elsewhere. 'If there is still some advantage in labour costs, it is offset by the gap that still exists in productivity.' Mr Molto retorts that other factors than wage levels - such as location, market access and industrial tradition - weigh in investment decisions. However, a notable aspect of recent investments is that about 90 per cent involve additional funds for existing operations or purchases of Spanish companies. Only a small proportion go towards setting up new projects. Circumstances have changed for many foreign-owned companies, set up in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s in a protectionist environment in which transferring production to Spain was the only way of tapping the country's internal market. Some older-established subsidiaries set up under Spanish industrialisation programmes - Gillette, for instance - have been left behind in the move to new products and technologies. Withdrawals by large multinationals are not unprecedented. The Santana plant at Linares, for example, used to make Land Rovers for the Spanish and Latin American market, but the UK company progressively reduced its commitment in the 1980s before selling out. General Electric of the US, Westinghouse and Brown Boveri all abandoned Spanish subsidiaries when the capital goods sector restructured ahead of Spain's accession to the European Community. However, EC entry in 1986 prompted an unprecedented spurt of new investment. As much as half of Spain's manufacturing capacity is reckoned to be in foreign hands. The motor industry, Spain's chief exporting sector, is entirely foreign-controlled. Multinationals hold a high proportion of Spain's chemical and food and drink sectors - increased by Allied-Lyons' recent takeover of the Domecq wine and spirits group. Of Spain's top 10 exporters, nine are subsidiaries of foreign companies. Industrial production has declined since 1990 and last year fell 4.3 per cent. But recovery began in November, when the indices moved ahead of the previous year's figures. Recent confidence surveys show a marked improvement. And if the government needed a psychological fillip to set against the misadventures of Suzuki in Spain, it received it last month when Nissan's Barcelona plant started the first regular exports of Spanish-made four-wheel-drive vehicles to Japan.  ------------------------------------------------------------------             FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN SPAIN (PTA BN)  ------------------------------------------------------------------    1987    1988      1989      1990      1991      1992     1993*  ------------------------------------------------------------------   727.3   843.3   1,245.0   1,819.9   2,304.7   1,914.5   1,477.2  ------------------------------------------------------------------ *Jan-Nov  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Ministry of Economy and Finance  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

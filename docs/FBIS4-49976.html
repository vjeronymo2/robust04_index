			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of comments by unidentified spokesman of the Foreign </F> Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress on 22 April  regarding a report on Sino-British relations issued by the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons]    [Text] Since last year, the Foreign Affairs Committee of  the British House of Commons has held several hearings on the  China question. On April 13, the committee issued a report  related to the relations between Britain and China before and  after 1997. The report openly advocates the adoption of a  further confrontation policy toward China and interfering in  China's internal affairs. We express strong indignation and  regret over this.    The report admits the British side's change of policy  regarding Hong Kong and its support of Governor Chris Patten's  practices in Hong Kong, proceeding from its inaccurate  assessment of the current situation and prospects in China.  While continuing to adopt a policy of confrontation with China,  the report even advocates seeking international support over the  Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by such a report at a time when  the British side has repeatedly stated that it would cooperate  with China on other issues now that the truth of the disputes  over Hong Kong's political system has been made clear to the  public.    The report claims that China will not change the three-level  political framework established by the Hong Kong governor in  violation of the Sino-British Declaration, the Basic Law of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the bilateral  understandings already reached by the two sides. The Chinese  government has repeatedly stated that, in order to guard the  sanctity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and  the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Legislative Council and district  organizations established according to Patten's program can only  exist till June 30, 1997. After that date the government, the  legislative council and district organizations of Hong Kong will  be reorganized in accordance with the Basic Law. We firmly  support the stand of the Chinese government.    The report even openly attacks some articles, such as  Articles 18 and 158, in the Basic Law which state that the  Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC)  has the right to announce a state of emergency in Hong Kong when  necessary and that the right to explain the Basic Law lies with  the NPC Standing Committee. These provisions are to ensure the  restoration of China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  after July 1, 1997. However, the report claims the articles are  a potential serious threat to the Special Administrative Region  of Hong Kong, thus revealing the true motive of the British side  to attempt to prolong its control and influence over Hong Kong.    The promotion of democracy and the safeguarding of human  rights in Hong Kong as advocated in the report has revealed the  hypocrisy of the British side. The essence of the disputes over  Hong Kong's political system is not whether or not to develop  democracy, but whether or not to abide by international  commitments and to ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong in  line with the Basic Law. The Chinese government put forward the  policy of "one country, two systems" and advocated the  exercising of a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. The Basic  Law has provided adequate and specific provisions on the  development of democracy in Hong Kong after the Special  Administrative Region is established. There have been no  democracy or human rights to speak of over the past century or  more while the British codes for colonies governed Hong Kong.  To make much fanfare about democracy and human rights just a  few years before the ending of its rule over Hong Kong is aimed  at simply creating confusion.    The report also suggests that a human rights committee and  human rights supervision agency be established in Hong Kong.  The purpose is to create new barriers for the smooth transition  of power in Hong Kong. The Chinese side will not recognize  British unilateral decisions made on major affairs that extend  beyond 1997.    The report, in an attempt to interfere in China's internal  affairs, advocates self-determination of Tibet. It is known to  all that since ancient times, Tibet has been an inalienable part  of Chinese territory. Before 1959, a system of feudal serfdom  was practiced in Tibet, which was darker and crueler than that  of the Middle Ages in Europe. The old Tibet was one of the  regions in the world which suffered most seriously from  violations of human rights.    After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march down  the road of national unity and economic development, and people  began living in peace and contentment. This is a reform of  historical significance that moves to safeguard human rights and  promote social progress.    But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind  of  change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners as  "guards of human rights," a statement which in itself pokes  great fun at human rights. The making of such claims is in fact  an attempt to sabotage China's unification and national unity.    We advise them to take a cautious attitude toward the issue  of Tibet in light of what part Britain has played in history.  The Chinese government and its people, including compatriots of  the Tibetan nationality, are firmly opposed to any attempts to  use the so-called Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal  affairs. These attempts will never be realized.    The British House of Commons also suggests strengthening the  ties between the British parliament and Taiwan's "legislative  yuan," calling on the British government to ease its  restrictions on Taiwan. There is only one China in the world,  and Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the  People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government  representing China, a fact recognized by the world community.  The point of view on the issue of Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the British House of Commons runs counter to the  principles concerning the establishment of diplomatic ties  between China and Britain. Its real aim is to create "two  Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," a move firmly opposed by the  entire Chinese populace, including the people of Taiwan.    The report also has an ulterior motive in advocating the  "China threat," which is simply slated to undermine the  relations between China and,its neighboring countries. It is  known to all that China pursues an independent foreign policy of  peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world peace and  stability. So talk of a "China threat" is totally groundless  and to no avail.    The NPC Foreign Affairs Committee attaches great importance  to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation  with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons.    The Chinese side does not do anything to harm Britain, the  British parliament or Sino-British ties. But some members of  the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons  have recently repeatedly harmed Sino-British relations while  stressing the maintenance and development of Sino-British  relations. We should ask their motives and where they will lead  to in terms of bilateral relations. It is certain that the  anti-Chinese views that the report has raised will bring harm  not only to Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term  interests of Britain. We believe that those who really care for  and want to safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral  relations do not want to see that happen.</p>

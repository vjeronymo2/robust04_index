			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Arts: MTV awards in Berlin It was an awesome sight. The curtain rose to reveal one of the most dramatic backdrops in the world, the Brandenburg Gate; not a painted pastiche but the real thing, swathed in blue light. After this moment of grandeur the first MTV European Music Awards found their level when a bearded figure with solicitor's glasses bounded on stage looking worryingly like Sammy Davis Jnr. He turned into George Michael singing, of course, 'Freedom'. Berlin was the perfect spot for this new pop prize, not because of its political significance but because pop music, and the clubs it spawns, is about the only activity Ossies and Westerners enjoy together. They certainly mobbed the venue, described as 'the largest temporary structure in the world', and built abutting the Gate. And they did not seem to mind the Coca Cola logo crawling all over it. This was the West in all its tacky brilliance. The new awards, called the Matthews for no obvious reason, seemed immediately timeless: media creations like supermodel Naomi Campbell and a girl from Baywatch handing out 'globes' to stars who either smarmed over, or clowned with, the audience, a reputed 240m homes world wide. To some amazement Take That was voted Best Group, which suggests we must expand their shelf life from four to five years. Among the other newish names, Prodigy won Best Dance, and Crash Test Dummies, Breakthrough Artist of 1994. But the awards also showed up the terrifying conservatism of pop - Best Male was 35-year-old Bryan Adams; Best Rock band Aerosmith, the heavy metal outfit blasting through their third decade. Mariah Carey was the safe Best Female. The event was cherishable for its musical vignettes: the decidely quaint Bjork, who crawled out of a hole dressed like a raspberry mousse, skipped around the stage singing 'Big Time Sensuality', rolled around on her back and disappeared again into weirdo land; George Michael, who is in legal limbo, premiering a new song (a certain smash) called 'Like Jesus to a Child', backed by enough strings to parcel Christmas; Tom Jones, who after years as an object of mockery has suddenly become a pop icon, introducing the show with inadvertent Teutonic humour; and, most priceless of all, a cameo song from 'the artist formerly known as Prince', climaxing with the sad mantra, 'Peace to George Michael. Peace to MTV. But death to Prince.' That's one mixed-up mannikin millionaire.</p>

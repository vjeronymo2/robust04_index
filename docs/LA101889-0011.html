			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN PASQUAL  </P> <P> Caltrans workers discovered a 63-year-old Escondido man who spent more than 24  hours at the foot of a 100-foot embankment after his vehicle swerved off  California 78 in the San Pasqual Valley on Monday, a San Diego police spokesman  said.  </P> <P> Edgar Prado was found at 9:45 a.m. Tuesday and taken to Palomar Hospital  complaining of chest and back pains, according to spokesman David Cohen.  </P> <P> Prado's vehicle reportedly swerved from the westbound lanes of California 78  near the 30.5-mile marker to avoid an animal and plunged down a 100-foot  embankment at 7 a.m., Cohen said. The vehicle did not overturn and came to rest  against some rocks, he said.  </P> <P> Cohen said the discovery of Prado was a fluke because Caltrans workers were not  scheduled to work in the area until Sunday.  </P></p>

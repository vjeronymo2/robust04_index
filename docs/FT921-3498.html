			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Chas Baynes up 20% but warns of 'tough' first half CHARLES Baynes, the special-ist engineering and packaging distribution company, yesterday announced a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profits as earnings from packaging and technical products more than offset a downturn from building components. But Mr John Perkins, executive director, warned that trading conditions remained poor in some sectors and predicted the first half of the current year would be 'very tough'. The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.75m for the year to December 31, compared to Pounds 5.6m a year ago. Turnover increased 39 per cent to Pounds 73.7m. Technical products, including specialist metal valves, saw a near fivefold increase in turnover and operating profits to Pounds 12.5m and Pounds 2.21m respectively. Packaging distribution, which was boosted by acquisitions costing Pounds 10.6m, increased operating profits to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 867,000). However profits from the building components division slumped in line with the commercial property market and fell to Pounds 619,000 (Pounds 1.6m). Aerospace components lifted profits slightly to Pounds 1.87m. Earnings rose to 3.91p (3.64p) per share. A final dividend of 0.85p (0.8p) is recommended to make a total of 1.35p, an increase of almost 13 per cent.</p>

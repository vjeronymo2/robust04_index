"The State Duma replaced the notion of `pardoning' by  `amnesty' thus exceeding its authority. According to the  Russian Constitution pardoning is the right of the president",  national security aide Yuriy Baturin told TASS on Thursday.    He explained that there is a big difference between  "pardoning" and "amnesty". An amnesty frees people convicted  for certain crimes, while only concrete people can be pardoned.    Baturin also said that the Duma decision is contradicting  the  principles of law because "there are dead bodies while there are  nobody guilty". He was referring to over 140 killed during the  October revolt and the policeman killed during the May Day  demonstration last year.    He stressed that the principle of power sharing between  authorities had also been violated as, according to the  Constitution, it is only the court which can decide whether  defendants are guilty or not. "Thus it would be better to wait  with pardoning until a court verdict", Baturin said.    The national security aide believes the Constitutional Court  could have helped in the dispute. "But as the law on its  activities has not been adopted yet, the president, as the  guarantor of the Constitution has the right to demand that the  office of the prosecutor general and heads of departments do not  fulfill the resolution of the State Duma which does not abide by  the principles of the Constitution and Russian laws", Baturin  said.    He added that the Russian prosecutor general may file a  protest against the Duma decision which, according to the law,  is to be considered by the lower chamber.    In Baturin's personal opinion the Duma decision was "a  political-emotional act, rather that a juridical step".</p>

			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago wheat rallies CHICAGO WHEAT prices rallied yesterday in response to Friday evening's announcement that the US Department of Agriculture would ship 520,000 tonnes of wheat and 87,000 tonnes of rice to Russia by July under a food aid programme. The USDA will have to buy the grain from the open market as government stockpiles have been depleted. Commercial grain shipments have been at a standstill since November, when Russia began to miss interest payments on its US-backed grain loans. At midsession yesterday old-crop wheat futures prices were up 6 cents per bushel, with wheat for May delivery trading at 329. Prices for delivery later in the summer, during harvest, also rallied, but the advance was smaller. Analysts said winter wheat plantings in Kansas and the Western plains states were in excellent condition, creating the potential for record yields. The US wheat donations to Russia had been expected, according to Mr Daniel Basse, a grains analyst for AgResource, However, the quantity was larger than projections. Mr Basse said that while Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, encountered political setbacks over the weekend, grain traders viewed his dispute with parliamentary hardliners as part of the normal legislative process. 'Mr Yeltsin is still president,' Mr Basse said, 'they didn't ask him to resign'.</p>

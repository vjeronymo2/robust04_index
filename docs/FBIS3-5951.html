The analyst notes:    When the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact  in New York was published the high-placed authorities of Japan  made quite a noise as if the United States had made a big  mistake, trying to attain their sinister purpose by poking their  noses into the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK.    Blaring that the "pressure for the inspection" of the  military sites of the North of Korea "would increase", Japanese  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata a few days ago urged us to take "a  measure to dispel the suspicion of nuclear weapon development".    A ranking official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry said  with malice that "a mistake in the North Korean problem will  entail an irretrievable consequence."    The Japanese reactionaries are also spreading through  subsidized media the warning that if Japan cannot take a joint  step with the United States in the "nuclear problem", the  Japan-U.S. relations which show a lift with the collapse of  economic negotiation will greet a more serious phase.    Judging from the words and deeds of the Japanese  reactionaries, they are craftily and viciously trying to deeply  interfere in the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK by putting pressure  on the United States, capitalizing on the "Japan-U.S. alliance"  and the complex Japan-U.S. trade relations and break up the  DPRK-U.S. talks.    Japan has no ground or justification to meddle in the  "nuclear issue" of the North of Korea. The Japanese authorities  are kicking up an untimely row over it. This reveals their dark  intention to justify their own nuclear armament.    The Japanese authorities should not interfere in other's  affairs, forgetful of their position, but give up their own  reactionary scheme of nuclear armament.</p>

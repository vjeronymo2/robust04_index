			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rodime hit by heavy interim costs Rodime, the former disk drive manufacturer whose activity now concerns the licensing of its patents through negotiation or litigation, suffered a significant reduction in revenue and a 'substantial increase in litigation costs' for the half year to end-March. Administrative expenses jumped from Dollars 1.9m to Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) and after interest costs of Dollars 448,000 (Dollars 696,000) pre-tax losses emerged at Dollars 5.29m compared with profits of Dollars 815,000. Losses per share were 3.6 cents against earnings of 0.4 cents. The directors said it was unlikely that any significant licence agreements would be reached in the second half of the year. Directors expected losses to continue in the second six months, although at a reduced rate.</p>

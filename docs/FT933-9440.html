			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / People: Inspiring fear from the Bank of England Michael Foot is only 46 yet he has already had 11 jobs in 24 years and is about to become one of the most feared officials in the City when he takes over as head of banking supervision at the Bank of England at the end of the month. Like many of the Bank of England's high-fliers, Foot (pictured left) started life as an economist. Having graduated from Cambridge with an upper second, he had six years in the Bank followed by a year at Yale. His early career at the Bank included working for Professor Charles Goodhart, when the latter was advising on monetary policy. A stint as personal assistant to Eddie George, who took over as governor at the end of June, gave the first hint that Foot was destined for high office. It was followed by a series of jobs including being the UK alternate director at the IMF during the Mexican debt crisis and taking over as head of foreign exchange division when sterling was uncapped from the D-Mark. Since September 1990 Foot has headed the Bank's European division and spent much of his time preparing for the financial side of the Maastricht treaty. However, Foot admits that the challenge of heading the 200-strong bank supervision division is more daunting, especially given the recent criticism of the Bank's role as supervisor of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Whilst acknowledging his own lack of supervisory experience, he is conscious that the 500 institutions he will be supervising expect one thing above all else, and that is consistent treatment. As a career Bank of England official, he is also sensitive to criticism that his views might suffer from being too inbred and promises to compensate for this by getting out and about much more. Foot, who takes over from Roger Barnes, will also have a new deputy, Carol Sergeant, 40, (pictured right) who is also a Cambridge graduate. Since 1990 she has been senior manager for operations and policy in the gilt-edged and money markets division.</p>

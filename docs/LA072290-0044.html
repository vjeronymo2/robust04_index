			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BORDER SEWAGE PLANT, FINALLY AT HAND, MUST PROCEED APACE  </P> <P> More than half a century after Mexican sewage began to seep across the border,  the first real chance for long-term relief from what has become a torrent of  effluent is finally at hand.  </P> <P> The United States and Mexico have signed a historic pact calling for  construction of a $200-million border sewage treatment plant. The facility will  process the 10 million to 12 million gallons of raw sewage that each day pours  into the United States via the Tijuana River, cascading down canyons from  Tijuana's poorer neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The sewage has resulted in the quarantine of a 2 1/2-mile stretch of beach just  north of the border since the early 1980s. It also fouls a sensitive wetland  bird sanctuary and border-area horse farms. It has prompted decades of angry  rhetoric and frustration, symbolized by then-Imperial Beach Mayor Brian  Bilbray's 1980 bulldozer ride against the rising tide of sewage.  </P> <P> Now just two major obstacles stand in the way of the plant's opening in 1994 or  1995: funding and the outfall pipe's potential harm to the environment. We hope  that neither will block this most crucial of public works projects.  </P> <P> An environmental impact review is under way to determine whether the huge pipe  that will dump treated sewage at sea will cause harm. The conduit will enter  the surf at a site not far from two federally protected ecosystems.  </P> <P> Assuming that the pipe and the plant do not damage the environment, Congress,  the state and the city must pay for most of the various components of the  treatment plant and the pipelines.  </P> <P> To date, only about $32 million of that money is earmarked. The Mexican share  is expected to be about $41 million, money that will be put up front by a U.S.  loan program.  </P> <P> The funding must be swiftly and consistently approved, and construction should  proceed apace. Our two governments are too close to solving one of our region's  most enduring problems to allow any delay.  </P></p>

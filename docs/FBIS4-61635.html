			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Oleg Deyneko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 May -- The defaulted debt of enterprises  of various sectors of industry is growing at a rate which is  substantially greater than the rate at which credit investment  is growing, according to a report "On the State of the Russian  Economy (On the Results of the 1st Quarter of 1994)" drawn up by  the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics.    Credit investment (debt owed under credit issued by all  banks  and credit institutions) grew six times over the year and  amounted to 30.5 trillion rubles as of 1st January 1994 and by  the end of the first quarter this sum amounted to 39.8. Experts  of the Ministry of Economics believe the growth of credit  investments is outstripping the growth in the volume of products  which have been dispatched and the volume of work which has been  carried out. This bears witness to the fact that credit  resources are going not to the expansion of production, adding  to enterprises' circulating capital, but to the circulation of  goods and money. The ceiling of credit resources was set at  11.48 trillion rubles in the first quarter, and at 13.6 in the  second quarter. The lion's share of it is going to cover the  budget deficit.    According to data of the Ministry of Economics, in the first  quarter, debts owed by enterprises amounted to 69 trillion  rubles, including 25.8 in defaulted payments. Debts owed to  enterprises amounted to 67.9 trillion, including 27.3 in  defaulted payments.    Mutual non-payments by enterprises and organizations are  characterized by the following figures: debts of purchasers --  56.9 trillion rubles, including 31.3 in defaulted payments;  debts to suppliers -- 44.6, including 20.4 trillion rubles in  defaulted payments.</p>

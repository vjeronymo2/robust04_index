			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (AFP) -- A Chinese delegation led  by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen visited the U.S. Embassy  Wednesday to pay its respects to former U.S. President Richard  Nixon who died last week.    Qian, who is also vice-premier, and Luo Gan,  secretary-general of the State Council, observed a moment's  silence in front of a picture of Nixon hanging in the dining  room of the U.S. ambassador's residence. Qian, copying from a  prepared text, then wrote a message of condolence in a special  book.    "Nixon, when he was president of the United States, opened  the door to Sino-US relations and made a valuable historical  contribution. I want to express my heartfelt sorrow," Qian  wrote. Luo wrote a similar message, expressing his sympathy for  Nixon's relatives.    Wreaths "expressing deep condolences" from President Jiang  Zemin, Premier Li Peng and vice premier in charge of the economy  Zhu Rongji, surrounded the Nixon portrait.    Nixon is best remembered in China for his historic 1972  visit  here which ended decades of mutual hostility and paved the way  for the establishment of diplomatic relations seven years later.</p>

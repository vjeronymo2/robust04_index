			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Big Apple aims to shrug off troubles: Democrats will meet in a city trying to recover from crisis NEW YORK, which prides itself on its ability to throw sensational parties, is gearing up for four days of self-celebration as it hosts the Democratic Party national convention next week. But its civic leaders are also holding their collective breath and praying that the hoopla will not be marred by the kind of violence which shook upper Manhattan on Monday and Tuesday. Demonstrators rampaged through the mainly Hispanic Washington Heights neighbourhood - which is known for drug dealing  -looting shops and burning buildings, in protest at the killing by police of a young man from the Dominican Republic. With some 40,000 convention visitors about to descend on the city, including 15,000 representatives of the domestic and international news media, violence like this is the last thing New York needs. For as the Democrats prepare to anoint Mr Bill Clinton as their presidential candidate, the city is hoping to use the convention to trumpet a message of its own: New York, which has spent two years grappling with financial crisis, is on the point of an economic and psychological rebound. That is in stark contrast to just 12 months ago when the gloomiest pundits portrayed New York as a megalopolis in inexorable decline, beset by intractable budget problems, homelessness, violent crime and America's biggest caseload of Aids. Mr David Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, was then facing a severe budget crisis, brought on by economic recession, and was widely accused of failing to tackle the problem with sufficient speed, vigour or leadership. With the convention in mind, the Republican Party has been trying to capitalise on this image, seeking to link the problems of the solidly Democratic city with the national Democratic party's liberal agenda. Vice-president Dan Quayle has taken to visiting New York and taunting its leaders with remarks like: 'Liberal economics may prevail here, but it sure doesn't work here.' However, over the past few months there has been a sharp change for the better in both the mood of the city and in Mr Dinkins's public standing. Even the crime statistics have shown a slight improvement. Broadway theatres have been enjoying the biggest collection of hits in years. The recession which has ravaged the regional economy for the past two years is not over. Unemployment, at more than 11 per cent, is still way above the national average. The city is glutted with unused office space. But many analysts believe the economy has at least touched bottom and may now be recovering, albeit painfully slowly. One concrete sign is that the city's budget crisis seems to be over. The Dinkins administration finished the fiscal year which has just ended with a budget surplus of more than Dollars 500m, thanks to its conservative forecasts of likely revenue and a reining back of spending. This enabled the mayor to withdraw plans for Dollars 115m in new taxes and reach a remarkably early agreement with the city council on the budget for the current year. Mr Dinkins still faces fiscal criticism: the Citizens' Budget Commission, an independent watchdog, this week accused him of having missed the opportunity for more fundamental reforms in the way the city is run, which would create a much smaller, more efficient, municipal workforce and a better structural balance in the budget. The mayor has also been widely praised for the fact that New York was spared the violence which convulsed many other cities in the wake of April's Los Angeles riots. The mayor helped keep the political temperature down by working the phones to neighbourhood leaders, urging calm and dispelling rumours of impending trouble. He has played the same role this week in Washington Heights, making two trips to the neighbourhood to appeal for calm. The rampage there this week was ugly but it was mild in comparison to the convulsions in Los Angeles. All this has sharply improved Mr Dinkins's once dismal opinion poll ratings and his chances of winning re-election in 1993, when he is likely to face at least two strong challengers - the Republican Mr Rudolph Giuliani, who narrowly lost in 1989, and Mr Andrew Stein, the Democratic president of the city council. It also means a reasonably upbeat tone for the Democratic convention, which will itself have a significant economic impact on the city. In the short run, it will mean more spending in New York - the gathering could generate nearly Dollars 500m in new economic activity. However, Mr Ronald Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership, a group of business and civic leaders encouraging economic development, reckons 'the more important impact will be psychological, both internally and externally.' The convention may boost New York's reputation as a place to do business, which was battered in the 1980s by its high labour and property costs. But city advocates point out that these costs have been ameliorated by recession and insist that New York remains the best US centre for international businesses, given its good communications links and cultural sophistication.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Audi may invest in Hungary AUDI, the upmarket carmaking arm of Germany's Volkswagen group, is believed to be considering a big investment in engine production in Hungary, with a decision expected at today's supervisory board meeting, Nicholas Denton reports from Budapest. A Budapest official said Hungary had been competing for the plant with sites in east Germany and Austria. Audi would not confirm or deny the reports but said talks had taken place in several countries; a decision to go ahead is thought likely. Speculation over Audi's move coincides with growing concern in Germany that high wages are forcing companies to transfer output abroad. An Audi facility would join car investments in Hungary by Ford, GM and Suzuki.</p>

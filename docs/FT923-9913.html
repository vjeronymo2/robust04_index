			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Italian party tries to patch up split ITALY'S Christian Democrat party starts one of the most crucial weeks in its history today as party leaders gather in Rome to try to paper over serious internal differences at their national congress. The party moved quickly at the weekend to put forward Mr Emilio Colombo, a veteran member, to replace Mr Vicenzo Scotti, the Christian Democrat who resigned as foreign minister last week after less than a month in the job. However, the appointment of Mr Colombo, 72, a former premier who becomes foreign minister for the sixth time, still leaves yawning gaps between the factions, which are likely to be exposed to the glare of publicity this week. At the weekend, Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the former party secretary, withdrew his resignation in an effort to lower tensions. In-fighting over a successor to Mr Forlani, who had threatened to resign before, had become public, and may have been one of the factors behind Mr Scotti's heavily criticised decision to give up his ministerial post. Mr Scotti's move was ostensibly a reaction to a new party rule that ministers should give up their parliamentary seats. But Mr Scotti is close to Mr Giulio Andreotti's faction in the party, and his action has been interpreted by some as an attempt by the former Christian Democrat prime minister to exploit divisions within the party to his benefit. Mr Andreotti has denied such motives. Rebuffed by the electorate in northern Italy and heavily tainted by the political corruption scandal now gripping much of the region, the party will seek to use this week's congress to regroup. Speaking on Italian television, Mr Forlani explained his decision not to step down as a way of stimulating the changes in the party demanded by electors - such as greater accountability and transparency. However, many younger Christian Democrats, notably the reformists grouped around Mr Mario Segni, who has pushed for constitutional change through referendums, will see this as yet another attempt to paper over divisions and keep the same faces in power. Mr Forlani's step has already prompted Mr Mino Martinazzoli, a senior party member and more reform-minded candidate, to withdraw his bid for the party leadership.</p>

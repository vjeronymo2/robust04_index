			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPIN OF LEGAL WHEELS DULLS LOTTERY WINNER'S $3.4-MILLION OUTLOOK  </P> <P> Doris Barnett's little ball bounced out of the slot again Wednesday when her  lawyer was notified that California Lottery officials intend to seek a new  trial in an effort to overturn a jury verdict awarding her $3.4 million.  </P> <P> "I don't know how they can put me through all this," said a weeping Barnett,  54, the Los Angeles woman who went from $3 million winner to $10,000 placer  when the ball would not stay put for five seconds in the Big Spin on Dec. 30,  1985.  </P> <P> Barnett said her attorney, Lawrence Sperber, had warned her that the lottery  people might appeal and that when he called her Wednesday morning, "I felt  something was wrong."  </P> <P> After he gave her the bad news, she said, "I sat there for a while, then I just  started to cry."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Lottery Commission, however, said the notice was filed in  Los Angeles Superior Court "in order to keep our options open" and did not  necessarily mean the matter will be pursued.  </P> <P> "We had 15 days to file this," said Joanne McNabb. "No decision has yet been  made."  </P> <P> Told that Barnett was upset by the move, McNabb said, "It is a very unpleasant  situation."  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury decided on April 4 that Barnett should receive the $3  million plus $400,000 in damages for emotional trauma, although the ball on the  Big Spin wheel did not stay in the grand prize slot for the required five  seconds, settling instead in a $10,000 niche.  </P> <P> After first announcing that she had won the big money, Geoff Edwards, master of  ceremonies of the televised Big Spin show, unhappily told her it was a mistake.  </P> <P> When the state sent her a check for $10,000, Barnett refused to cash it and  filed suit.  </P> <P> Jurors at her trial agreed with her lawyers, Sperber and David B. Shapiro, that  lottery officials rarely awaited the timer's ruling before announcing a winner.  </P> <P> Sperber said he was surprised by the notice to ask for another trial, because  "there was so much public support" for his client.  </P> <P> "I was shocked they would do this to her again," he said. "Like they have no  feeling for her as a human being. She's tremendously upset."  </P></p>

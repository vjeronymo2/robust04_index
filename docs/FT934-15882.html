			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / OECD tells Tokyo 'no growth this year' JAPAN'S economy will not grow at all this calendar year, according to latest estimates by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Paris-based organisation has revised its provisional 1993 growth forecast for Japan downward from the 1 per cent predicted last July, said Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the its economic department. Growth would be slightly less than 2 per cent next year, he told Japanese newspapers. This would mark a recovery beyond the 1.5 per cent rise in gross national product in 1992. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, dismissed the estimate as 'pessimistic', but admitted that economic recovery had been stalled by an unusually cool summer and a stronger than expected yen. However, he saw no reason to devalue the yen, in response to question at a news conference. The OECD will publish its final estimate at the end of this year. Its latest revision, made by a working group last month, reflects stagnant personal consumption during the summer, a drop in export volumes and the continued fall in Japanese asset values, Mr Shigehara was reported as saying. He believed, like most of Japan's business community, that an income tax cut was needed. But Mr Shigehara warned that consumers were so cautious that they might respond by saving rather than spending more. Last month's cut in official interest rates was effective in bring Japanese interest rates closer to US ones in real terms, but was unlikely on its own to promote a rise in bank lending to small and medium sized businesses, he said. The business recovery would be slow. Japan's record current account surplus could damage the global economy and give other countries an excuse for protectionism, a report by the economic council, an advisory group, warned yesterday.</p>

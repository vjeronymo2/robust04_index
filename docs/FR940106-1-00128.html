			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As presently described, longfin smelt range from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River estuary and South San Francisco Bay, California, to Prince William Sound, Alaska (Miller and Lea 1972). The present-day distribution of longfin smelt is probably due to lower sea levels in the Pleistocene, which would have enlarged estuaries up and down the Pacific coast and shortened the distances between estuaries, as well as provide more habitat (Peter Moyle, University of California, Davis, pers. comm., 1993). Unverified reports of off-shore collection of longfin smelt exist, approximately 5 to 6 miles off shore in Alaska (Bruce Wing, National Marine Fisheries Service, Auke Bay, Alaska, pers. comm., 1993) and 3 to 4 miles off shore in northern California (Larry Quirollo, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on inferred abundance, longfin smelt may be common in Willapa Bay, Skagit Bay, and Puget Sound in Washington and Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay in Oregon (Monaco  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990). Largely using sampling data, Monaco  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1990) also reported that longfin smelt were common to highly abundant in the Columbia River and Grays Harbor, Washington. Few data exist on the recent status of the Oregon and Washington longfin smelt; however, indications are that this species may be reproducing and surviving in the Oregon and Washington estuaries (Bob Emmett, National Marine Fisheries Service, Hammond, Oregon, pers. comm., 1993). A land-locked population exists in Harrison Lake in British Columbia. British Columbia longfin smelt have also been recorded at the Fraser River estuary and near Prince Rupert and Vancouver (Hart 1973). Alaska longfin smelt are found at the Dixon Entrance, Yakutat Bay, Prince William Sound, and Cook Inlet (Wing, pers. comm., 1993). In California, the longfin smelt occurs (or did occur) in the Klamath River mouth, Humboldt Bay, Eel River mouth, Van Duzen River mouth, and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary (Moyle 1976; Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992; Ron Fritzsche, Humboldt State University, pers. comm., 1993). The Estuary supports the largest and most southerly longfin smelt population in California (Lee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The strongest information on the decline of longfin smelt comes from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary of California. Longfin smelt were once one of the most abundant fish caught by trawl surveys in the Sacramento-San Joaquin (Herbold  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1992) and Humboldt Bay estuaries (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993). Longfin smelt numbers in the Estuary fluctuated widely in the past, but since 1983 abundance has dropped dramatically and remained at record lows. In Humboldt Bay, longfin smelt were the fourth most abundant fish captured in trawls in the late 1960s and early 1970s (Roger Barnhart, National Biological Survey, pers. comm., 1993). However, since 1988, no longfin smelt have been captured in Humboldt Bay using similar sampling methods (Tim Mulligan, Humboldt State University, pers. comm., 1993). Historical records of longfin smelt from the mouth of the Van Duzen River exist; however, in recent years, no evidence of the fish exists for this location (Fritzsche, pers. comm., 1993). The Eel River, which is about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) from Humboldt Bay, is relatively small and probably contains little habitat appropriate for longfin smelt. Longfin smelt likely occurred in the Eel River only when high river outflows introduced fish from Humboldt Bay. Longfin smelt numbers probably declined in the Eel River at the same time declines occurred in Humboldt Bay. Recent surveys have not found the longfin in the Eel estuary (Moyle, pers. comm., 1993). In Oregon and Washington, no population trend data exist for any of the estuaries, although the indications are that the species is surviving and reproducing in several estuaries (Emmett, pers. comm., 1993). In Alaska, large numbers of longfin smelt are found in the Gulf of Alaska (Bruce Wing, National Marine Fisheries Service, pers. comm., 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary the decline in longfin smelt abundance is associated with fresh water diversions from the Delta to support California's agricultural industry in the Central Valley and the vast urban areas of southern California. Strong relationships between outflow and longfin smelt abundance indicate that outflows less than 3,400 cubic feet per second (cfs) result in reproductive failure for longfin smelt (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Because of its 2-year life span, such flows for more than 2 or 3 consecutive years could push this species toward extinction. From 1986 to 1991, outflows hovered close to that number, partly due to high proportions of inflow diverted. Movement of the entrapment zone (mixing zone at the freshwater-saltwater interface) up-river due to low outflows has constricted the range of the longfin smelt and made it increasingly vulnerable to diversion into man-made structures. Low outflows have failed to disperse larvae downstream to the productive nursery areas in Suisun Bay away from the pumps. The water exports from the Delta by far exceed those from any other estuary on the west coast of North America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sediment production as a result of human activities and developments in the Humboldt, Eel, Van Duzen, and Klamath watersheds may be a cause of the decline of longfin smelt in those estuaries. Soil washed into the streams can deposit in estuaries downstream. Sedimentation in the spawning habitat could have reduced the spawning success of this species due to physical scouring or suffocation of eggs (Barnhart, pers. comm., 1993). Although human activities upstream of estuaries in Oregon, Washington, Canada, and Alaska would likely result in similar impacts, the Service does not have population trend data for these portions of the species' range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: NAB to write down value of stake in rival bank DIRECTORS of National Australia Bank (NAB), one of Australia's four top trading banks, yesterday announced a write-down of its holding in banking rival ANZ. NAB plans to write down to market value its stake of just over 5 per cent in the results for the year to September 30. NAB's 50.6m ANZ shares are stated in its books at ADollars 5.38, (USDollars 3.95) compared with yesterday's closing price of ADollars 2.94 on Australian stock exchanges, down 3 cents on the day. At this level, NAB's policy would wipe more than ADollars 123m from its net profits for the year. The write-down follows similar action by Westpac in its recent report for the first half to March, which included a write-down to market value of its 8.3 per cent stake in ANZ. There are no other significant stated cross-shareholdings between the leading Australian banks. NAB directors said yesterday no tax benefit would arise from the ANZ write-down. They said NAB had also revalued its property assets, resulting in a ADollars 357m cut in value which would be adjusted against reserves with no impact on operating results. NAB shares rose 1 cent to ADollars 7.34 after the announcement yesterday, suggesting the write-downs had been factored into the bank's share price.</p>

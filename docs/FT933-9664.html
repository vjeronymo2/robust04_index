			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Beijing sets sights on 10.5% inflation rate CHINA could slow inflation to an annual 10.5 per cent, according to a senior government analyst. Mr Lai Guangxian, director of the economic forecasting department of Beijing's state information centre, said the rate depended on the effectiveness of the government's current macro-economic control measures. Mr Lai, quoted in Sunday's official Business Weekly newspaper, said China's total annual money supply could be kept to about Yn150bn (Pounds 17.4bn). Money supply in the first half, according to government figures, was Yn52.8bn and growing at an annual rate of 50 per cent. Control of fixed assets investment - which grew by an annual rate of 61 per cent in the first half - was especially important, Mr Lai said. 'The slowdown in inflation could be achieved by controlling the country's total investment in fixed assets to a growth rate of about 28 per cent and limiting total retail sales growth to about 18 per cent for the year,' the Business Weekly said. First-half retail sales increased 21.6 per cent on the same period last year. Figures released last month by the state statistical bureau show China's economy grew in the first half by an annual rate of 13.9 per cent, more than a full percentage point higher than the 12.8 per cent recorded for 1992. Inflation was shown to be running at a year-on-year 14 per cent nationally, but 21.6 per cent in 35 big cities. Investment in fixed assets shot up to Yn354.2bn, with investment by the state sector growing by 70.7 per cent, to Yn219bn. In June the government began implementing austerity measures aimed at cooling the economy, which has been compared by both local and international observers to a runaway train. The measures have so far included directives to specialised banks to recall all high-risk loans, stop lending to non-banking financial institutions and stop running commercial companies. Bank lending and deposit rates have been increased with the aim of boosting faith in banks and to stabilise domestic prices. The official People's Daily said Beijing's call to strengthen control over economic growth rates had yielded 'preliminary results in certain areas'. But in a separate, strongly worded commentary, the Communist party said local officials must obey new policies and stop trying to shield their regions from the go-slow order.</p>

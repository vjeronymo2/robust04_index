			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Former Foreign Minister  Michio Watanabe decided today to bolt the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and create a new one, a step that  will probably spark another major split in the LDP.    Watanabe, a faction leader within the fractious LDP, told  reporters, "I will give up my party membership as a matter of  course."    Watanabe, also a former deputy prime minister, has vowed to  run in the Diet (Parliament) premiership election which will  select the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa, who  abruptly announced his resignation on April 8.    On Friday, LDP President Yohei Kono met Watanabe and asked  him not to leave the LDP, the largest single party in the Diet.    The LDP lost its parliamentary majority after 38 years of  rule last summer in the wake of major defections led by Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hata and former LDP Secretary General  Ichiro Ozawa later formed Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), now  one of the key components in the seven-party ruling coalition.</p>

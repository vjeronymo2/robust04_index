			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Fiscal fears It would be dangerous to read too much into yesterday's steep falls in UK equities and gilts, given the low trading volume in both markets. Financial markets have a lot to contend with just the same. Not only have the disappointing results for the government in the Euro-elections given rise to demands for tax cuts, there is growing unease on the inflation front, too. The latest producer price figures look fine as far as output prices are concerned. Input prices, however, have stopped falling on a year-on-year basis, which is bound to add to nervousness ahead of tomorrow's average earnings figures. Since November's budget, the policy balance has involved a combination of relative fiscal tightness with monetary looseness. The political temptation now might be to alter that mix, especially since growth looks set to keep the public sector borrowing requirement moving downwards. Presumably more votes are to be gained by scrapping the next increase in VAT on fuel than would be lost by raising base rates, especially given the proportion of voters who either have fixed rate mortgages or still depend for income on building society deposit accounts. This week's Mansion House speech may yield some clue about the chancellor's thinking. Given present funding difficulties, the gilts market would probably respond badly to a softer line on taxes. In theory, higher economic growth means equities should have less to fear. But what would be billed as tax cuts might simply be tax increases foregone, while evidence of another volte-face by a beleaguered government would hardly instil confidence in any market.</p>

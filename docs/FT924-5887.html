			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market slides on Opec jitters WORLD OIL prices slid yesterday amid market jitters about this week's meeting of nations from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. Reports that Saudi Arabia would resist cutting its oil output when ministers meet on Wednesday knocked 20 cents a barrel off the price of North Sea Brent crude oil at the opening of trading. The Brent blend January delivery price then settled at Dollars 19.07 1/2 a barrel in a slow market. 'The market has finally had a message from Riyadh,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, manager of Smith Barney's oil trading desk in London. Other traders dismissed the reports as posturing in the run-up to the Opec meeting but remained gloomy about the outlook for oil prices. 'The most bullish scenario I can see is that they roll over the September agreement and prices stay where they are,' said a trading manager from one international oil company. Opec agreed to produce 24.2m barrels of oil a day at its last meeting, but most industry observers estimate that output has been running at between 25m and 25.3m b/d. Iran refused to embrace the September agreement and has been publicly demonstrating the nation's ability to pump 3.8m to 4m b/d. Some commentators put Iran's sustained output at around 3.6m b/d. Iran is staking its claim for a bigger share in any allocation based on output capacity rather than historical quotas. The traditional political tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia - Opec's biggest producer - is expected to make agreement more difficult to reach at this week's meeting. Saudi Arabia says it has stuck to its production allocation of 8.4m b/d in the last couple of months and is not prepared to cut back further. Independent observers estimate that the kingdom has been producing at this level but selling more into the market from stocks it built up during the third quarter. Oil stocks held by consumers threaten to undermine prices if Opec fails to agree to rein in production. Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York, says that the US built its stocks in October compared with last year when it used up 1m b/d from inventories during that month. If demand remains low as colder winter weather fails to materialise those stocks could flood on to the market and depress prices. Supply and demand in the oil market are not very far out of line at present but traders have become nervous in advance of the Opec meeting as increasing signs of disarray become evident within the producers' club. Opec ministers must give a clear signal to the market of their intentions to cut production if they are not to see a further slide in price.</p>

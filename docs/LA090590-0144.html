			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> NO CLUES YET TO WHEREABOUTS OF 90-YEAR-OLD LAGUNA HILLS MAN  </P> <P> The Orange County Sheriff's Department and the wife of a missing 90-year-old  Laguna Hills man remained baffled today about his disappearance.  </P> <P> Ted Adams, who lives in Leisure World with his 87-year-old wife, Alice, was  last seen driving his red and white 1978 Cadillac El Dorado near the  intersection of Alicia Parkway and Jeronimo Road at 3:45 p.m. Tuesday,  Sheriff's Department spokesman Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Adams was trailing a friend driving another car when he apparently made a wrong  turn, Olson said.  </P> <P> Since then, deputies have been scouring the region where he disappeared and  have put out a missing persons bulletin to local and out-of-state agencies.  Sheriff's investigators do not suspect foul play, Olson said.  </P> <P> "We've had things like this before," Olson said. "And they do show up in some  strange places. He could have gone far and wide."  </P></p>

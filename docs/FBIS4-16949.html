			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report in the "State Duma Hearings on Foreign </F> Economic Activity" column: "Sergey Glazyev Wants To Take  Control of Arms Export"]    [Text] The effectiveness of parliamentary hearings as a  process in the search for solutions is close to zero so far, and  yesterday's discussion in the Duma of foreign activity problems  confirmed this. Nonetheless, the aspiration by Economic Policy  Committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev to tighten up control of  foreign economic activity caused concern of such exporters as  the Rosvooruzheniye corporation: The firm refused to provide  the hearing information about its activity.    The subject of arms export and related investment problems  of  the military industrial complex enterprises were discussed in  camera, with the participation of general designers, and prior  to that representatives of the government, Foreign Economic  Relations, and Central Bank apparatuses briefed the deputies on  the general state and prospects of foreign economic activity.    Ivan Materov, first deputy foreign economic relations  minister, told the house that at present the government cannot  make decisions on lifting export quotas because the insolvency  of Russian consumers leaves them without the requisite  resources, which have not been sold abroad only because no  export licenses have been granted. Materov, however, confirmed  that from 1995 most of the quotas will be phased out. Sergey  Tsyplakov, chief of the government apparatus' foreign economic  activity department, motivated the need to lift export quotas by  the fact that the current quota and license system encourages  abuses: "In some export-related spheres things are running  wild." The government apparatus representative expressed  special concern over the growing disparity between Russian  exporters' contractual prices and world prices. Mr. Tsyplakov  closed his statement with the conclusion about the need to step  up state control of foreign economic activity.    The participants also recognized as a priority the search  for  sources to repay Russia's foreign debt for which purpose it is  proposed to use promissory note circulation and sell Russian  state property (quite possibly, Petr Aven and Alfa-Bank will  attend to this in the end).    According to information in KOMMERSANT-DAILY's possession,  the Glazyev committee in the very near future is to submit to  the Duma's consideration a number of bills on regulating foreign  economic activity (On Foreign Economic Activity, On Changes to  the Law on Foreign Investments in the RFSFR and Concession  Contracts, and On Production-Sharing Arrangements) which  envision a clear-cut separation of all functions of the federal  power bodies in the sphere of foreign economic activity.    One of the indispensable elements of the future system is  tough control of arms exports. According to information in  KOMMERSANT-DAILY's possession, at yesterday's closed session  Rosvooruzheniye's monopoly activity in this sphere received a  rather negative assessment on the part of military industrial  complex enterprise representatives who are unhappy with the  distribution of incomes from the sale of their production. It  is noteworthy that Sergey Glazyev regards the cadre and  technological potential of these enterprises as the foundation  for overcoming industrial decline in Russia.</p>

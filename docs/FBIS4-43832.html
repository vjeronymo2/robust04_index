			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alessandra Longo: "Task Force of 40-Somethings </F> Formed To `Marry' MSI and AN"]    [Text] "The party? It is like a father. Then one meets a  girl...." So says Marco Zacchera, the man whom Fini has  appointed as head of "organization."    "There has never been a bust of Il Duce on my desk... On the  contrary: The other day, as soon as my appointment became  official, a party member said to me: `Marco, I am going to bring  you something nice, a souvenir...' I quickly retorted: `Thanks,  but I am interested only if it has a value on the antiques  market....'"    Marco Zacchera, 42 years old, with a 14-year-old daughter,  sits behind the new desk assigned to him by MSI [Italian Social  Movement] Secretary Gianfranco Fini. A desk that suddenly has  become a nerve-center. He was appointed to "head the  organization of the party." It is he who will have to resolve  the squabbles that break out in the party's sections and local  headquarters, including those stemming from the disruptive  presence of the new symbol, the AN [National Alliance]. It is he  who will oversee the issuance of membership cards.    Previously, Alterio Matteoli headed membership. He is now  assigned to environment issues. But previously, the MSI was an  opposition party. And previously, above all, there was not that  still mysterious catchall called the AN.    Zacchera, a Piedmontese, a Bocconi graduate in economics and  trade, a former regional councilman, and now a newly elected  member of the Chamber of Deputies, is aware of having taken on a  thankless task: "This is not an easy moment for our militants.  Many still have the mentality of those who have always been on  the outside. They use the blunt language of opposition. After  years of darkness they see people arriving whom they do not  know, people appearing on `their' electoral lists, those from  the AN... And they ask themselves: `Who are these people? Where  do they come from?' I understand bewilderment and diffidence. I  do not understand, and I reject, nostalgic attitudes, attitudes  of outward bunkering; those, I do not understand; they only do  us harm. On the outside we are still branded, labeled; but in  all truth, the MSI's members sometimes bring it on themselves."    The so-called Fini team consists of the 40-somethings within  the party. They will have to deal with those who, like Teodoro  Buontempo, of the purist and hard-line wing, called for a  "moratorium" until the party congress. Deputies Roberto Menia  from Trieste and Gianni Mastrangelo from Apulia will be working  with Zacchera. They will have to coordinate with Antonio  Mazzone, a deputy from Naples, the new head of local agencies,  who in turn will have four teammates: Riccardo Migliori  (regional policies); Giuseppe Tagliente, mayor of Vasto,  (mayoral activities); Vincenzo Nespoli (municipalities); and  Marcello Perina (provinces). As yet unfilled is the void in the  public relations sector, a sensitive task. The candidate's name  most frequently whispered is that of Gianni Alemanno, a Rauti  follower.    A party made up solely of "Finians?" Zacchera smiles:  "Obviously, the secretary prefers to put himself in the hands of  people who are in agreement with him. But this does not mean  being dogmatic. I have many friends also among the Rautians."    First rule: Develop the art of getting along. "I learned  that  in the family," the new head of organization says. His family is  of DC [Christian Democratic Party] extraction and culture. In  1946, his grandfather was the DC leader in Verbania, Zacchera's  hometown. His father was deputy mayor of Stresa. Five brothers,  "five diverse opinions." "My brother Vittorio," says Zacchera,  "was a communal councilman in Verbania under the banner of the  hammer and sickle. I was there too, but as group leader of the  MSI..."    "I am not a nostalgic," says Zacchera. True, but there are a  lot of nostalgia still about, and it will be difficult to get  them to swallow the secretary's "reform" views... The  nostalgists are afraid to lose their roots. They want neither to  abjure nor to repudiate them, and they do not appreciate the  passage in Fini's remarks to the Chamber, in which he said:  "Antifascism has been an essential step toward democracy..."  Zacchera leaves no doubt as to his leanings: "I identify fully  with those remarks... I am a convinced supporter of the AN. The  MSI must be structured in such a way as to be able to talk with  the AN. It must convince its members of this... Dissolve the  MSI? I am absolutely certain that the secretary has no such  thought of doing it, just like that, on the spot, one two. Only  a party congress can decide to merge with the AN. But these  things must be worked out little by little..."    What relations does Zacchera have with the old party? "The  party is like a father. You love him, you respect him. Then, one  day..." One day... enter the AN? "Yes, one day, you find a  pretty girl and you fall in love. Father remains in your heart,  but you marry. And you can only hope he will bless the  nuptials... and life goes on."</p>

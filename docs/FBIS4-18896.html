			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F> Fini by "G.D. Ro."; place and date not given: "It Was the  League Which Knocked on Our Door"]    [Text] Rome -- [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Following a  "long-range war" made up of rather scathing statements, you have  finally met eye to eye. Deputy Fini, how did you find the  Senator [League Secretary Bossi]?    [Fini] I know him. In some respects, Bossi is even quite  amiable. But, on the other hand, he is also unpredictable.  After a few moments of friendliness, he begins to attack, to  overturn... everything that can be overturned.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] How did you feel?    [Fini] I have a very peculiar character. I am a cool-minded  person. I did no let him overpower me in any way, I am used to  political battles.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Did you expect this kind of move from  Bossi -- coming like this, suddenly, to speak with you? Was it  the League that knocked at your door?    [Fini] Last Tuesday afternoon [5 April], [League lower house  floor leader] Maroni turned up at our group's office in the  Chamber of Deputies. He met [National Alliance lower house  floor leader] Tatarella. I learned this later, when I spoke on  the phone to Luigi Rossi. No, frankly, I did not expect them to  approach us. I was pleasantly surprised, among other things  because apparently they have forgotten the consultations they  were supposed to have with the center and the Left.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] What do you think of this thaw?    [Fini] I am glad. I had advocated this repeatedly: Let us  stop just asserting our respective principles. How can we give  birth to a new system if we go on like this?    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] You are accepting federalism. Is this  not out of keeping with your tradition?    [Fini] Federalism, in theory, is neither good nor bad. The  essential thing is to ensure national unity is not endangered.  American and German federalism are built upon a strong national  sense, which is never called into question. However, things are  different in Italy.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Is this why you want presidentialism  as  a counterweight?    [Fini] Of course. There are several forms of  presidentialism, a high form which provides for the president of  the republic's direct election; another form based on the people  electing the prime minister. We must find constitutional  solutions enabling a synthesis. This, however, is a task for  the constitutional experts. I might say something misleading.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] If you do not mind my asking again:  How could you convert to federalism?    [Fini] Let me stress that, even in our platform, we did not  rule anything out a priori. We asked for an efficient state,  safeguarding national unity. It is now up to constitutional  engineers, working at a negotiating table, to find the right  solutions. No agreement has yet been reached.    [CORRIERE DELLA SERA] Perhaps you and the League shared a  common interest, namely that of not allowing Berlusconi's  personality to overshadow you?    [Fini] I am only interested in one thing: enabling a  coalition government to be formed -- and coalition governments  are effectively established when the political parties involved  are on an equal footing.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: European equities Continental European equity issues are about to reach flood proportions. As bankers and brokers seek to cram in deals before their summer holidays, five issues of Dollars 1bn or more and several of a lesser size are due to hit the market. Given the recent poor performance of equities and the waning appetite among international investors for new issues, some offerings could be in for a difficult run. A warning sign came in last week's Dollars 1.1bn Endesa sale by Spain. Not only was the issue price at the low end of expectations. The shares initially traded below the issue price. The next big issue is the Dollars 3.5bn sale of shares in KPN by the Dutch government. Pricing is expected to be announced this morning. After that comes the Dollars 1.3bn Pharmacia offering by Sweden and the Dollars 3bn INA sale by Italy. Also in the pipeline from Italy are Mediobanca's Dollars 1bn share issue, Cariplo's Dollars 1.2bn issue and Mondadori's Dollars 500m offering. It seems unlikely that any of these issues will be pulled. Once such large offerings get under way, they acquire a momentum of their own. Moreover, when governments are privatising companies, the loss of political face from cancelling a flotation would be huge. Still, US and UK institutions - which in the past have been the mainstays of international equity offerings - are no longer so keen. US investors are not as flush with cash as they were at the end of last year, while UK shareholders have recently had to cope with an excess of domestic flotations. Investors may not boycott the European issues but they will expect generous prices.</p>

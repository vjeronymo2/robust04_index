			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: VME plans to invest SKr135m VME Group, the construction equipment group owned jointly by Volvo of Sweden and Clark Equipment of the US, plans to invest SKr135m (Dollars 21.8m) in its articulated dumptruck business, including SKr80m for a new factory in Sweden. The investment is one of the very few so far this year in the construction equipment industry, which has been hit by recession in the US and UK. In February VME announced a 10 per cent rise in 1990 operating profits to Dollars 79m, against the industry trend and helped by a strong performance in continental Europe. VME is the world's largest producer of articulated dumptrucks and will be investing the money in its Swedish-based subsidiary VME Articulated Haulers. Manufacturing will be moved to a new plant near the existing one at Braas, Sweden. VME plans to modernise the dumptruck frames and bodies and reorganise the workforce. Production at the new plant will begin in autumn, 1992. VME also plans to concentrate production of rigid dumptrucks at its plant in Guelph, Canada. Production at the group's rigid hauler operations in Landskrona, Sweden, will cease at the end of 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest (DDP/ADN)--Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel  met his Hungarian counterpart Geza Jeszenszky in Budapest today.  The main focus of the meeting was Hungary's integration into  the European Union (EU), the Western European Union (WEU), and  NATO.    Kinkel will address a joint forum this evening of the  Friedrich Naumann Foundation and the opposition Federation of  Young Democrats (Fidesz) and the Alliance of Free Democrats  (SZDSZ) on the subject of "The Visegrad Countries and the EU".    [Budapest Kossuth Radio Network in Hungarian at 1700 GMT on  15 April reports that Foreign Minister Jeszenszky spoke to  journalists after his discussions with Kinkel and denied that  Hungary and Ukraine support the Greek-Romanian-Bulgarian  proposal for lifting the embargo against rump Yugoslavia.]</p>

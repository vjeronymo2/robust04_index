			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BANK HELP ASKED ON DRUG MONEY  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh demanded greater help today from bankers and  lawyers in uncovering money laundering by drug dealers and demolishing "the  house that crack built."  </P> <P> Federal authorities now are adept at discerning patterns of cash recycling by  criminals, Thornburgh said, but face a "pattern of increasing sophistication"  by the cocaine cartels and other organizations.  </P> <P> The U.S. banking and legal communities are the main line of defense against the  dealers' $100-billion annual U.S. drug revenues, he told a seminar on the drug  money laundering problem.  </P> <P> Thornburgh told the bankers and lawyers that the annual cash intake of U.S.  crack cocaine and other street drug deals, mostly represented in $20 bills or  less, weighs 26 million pounds. So drug cartels' main dilemma is, "How do you  push 26 million pounds of these 20s through a bank window . . . without  attracting attention?"  </P></p>

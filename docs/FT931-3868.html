			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Liberal Democrats show consistency on Maastricht Sir, Your leader 'Major must persevere' (March 10) is wrong to accuse the Liberal Democrats of having become 'shameless opportunists' over the progress of the Maastricht Treaty ratification legislation. We have been principled and consistent throughout. Last November we supported the government over the 'paving motion' debate; subsequently, unlike the Labour Party, we have been willing to vote with the government over key procedural votes which have made possible the passage of the Bill. In several of these divisions our votes have been essential to secure progress. We have made clear from the outset our ambition to see Maastricht improved in two particular respects - viz, reversing the UK opt-out over the social chapter and winning greater institutional democracy at all European levels. Monday's vote was consistent with the latter objective. The real 'blame for delay' rests with a prime minister who has been too timid for too long in seeking to face down his rebels. This week's setback is a failure of coherent Tory government, not constructive Liberal Democrat opposition. Charles Kennedy, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA</p>

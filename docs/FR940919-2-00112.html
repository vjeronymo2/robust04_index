			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Team's conducted extensive fact-finding visits and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interviews with members of the disability community. Team members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visited 421 locations in 33 States and conducted over 3,600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interviews. Almost 2,900 of these involved front-line employees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managers and executives. The Team conducted an additional 111  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interviews by telephone. The Team also interviewed over 750  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties external to SSA for their views. They also publicized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface/electronic mail addresses and fax and voice telephone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers for those who were not contacted or had additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to provide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals and groups both internal and external to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process were interviewed for ideas about a new process. The Team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited a wide spectrum of opinions about problems with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current disability process and directions for redesign. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to individuals in the SSA and DDS communities, the team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> talked to a wide variety of externals including physicians,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health maintenance organizations and hospital officials,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability advocates, attorneys, professional association groups,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal judges, other Federal agencies, and Congressional staffs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to site visits and contacts, Team members provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and organizations with general information about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reengineering effort, key research areas, and some unconventional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ideas about the disability process so that the interviewees would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an opportunity to think about process issues. The Team  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encouraged interviewees to provide open and honest opinions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions, and ideas. The interviews provided useful insights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into the problems confronting the disability program and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations for solving these problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Focus Groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A series of 12 focus groups were held throughout the country  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to obtain input from members of our claimant population and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public regarding their experiences with and expectations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the SSA disability process.

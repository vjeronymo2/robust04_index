			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Self-preservation instinct wins day - Andrew Baxter on the victory of Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, head of Lancer Boss LAST week's victory for Lancer Boss Group in a two-year planning battle with environmentalists marks yet another coup for a man with a reputation as one of Britain's most autocratic industrialists. Critics describe Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, chairman and co-founder of the largest UK-owned lift truck producer, as irritable, intolerant, and difficult to work with. Sir Neville and his brother Mr Trevor Bowman-Shaw own 100 per cent of Boss, which they built from scratch in 1958 to the world's ninth biggest lift truck manufacturer. Sir Neville admits that 'people skills' are not his strong point. But he does claim 'a very strongly developed sense of self-preservation'. And for Lancer Boss to survive and prosper in the increasingly competitive world lift truck industry, Sir Neville realised that it needed to replace its factories scattered across the Bedfordshire town of Leighton Buzzard with a plant that could function effectively as a high-volume producer. Sir Neville had made no secret of the alternative if the row over a 95-metre encroachment into the green belt had brought defeat for Boss. Difficult planning procedures are causing industrialists to relocate on the Continent, he says, and Boss might well have followed suit. But the Boss chairman has a knack of getting his message across, a useful asset in a country where the manufacturing sector has had to fight increasingly hard to be heard. Along with many industrialists, Sir Neville has been looking to Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, to achieve 'a better balance' between industry and employment, and the environment. And whatever the involvement of the Department of Trade and Industry, the need to safeguard 600 jobs, and perhaps create 500 more eventually, clearly weighed heavily with Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. But, despite being a committed Tory, Sir Neville remains worried about whether the Conservative philosophy of the early 1980s - that economic growth prospects depended more on building the service economy rather than manufacturing - has been laid to rest. A fan of former prime minister Lady Thatcher, he acknowledges what is, possibly, her blind spot: 'She's done so much good, but by God she was wrong about manufacturing.' But the root of Britain's manufacturing decline goes much deeper, he says, blaming the legacy of Victorian and Edwardian snobbery about industry. 'There are still houses in this country where I'm asked what I do and the questioners' nose is turned up at the thought of sitting next to an industrialist, not a gynaecologist, a doctor, a banker or a broker. Now in Germany, I'm treated like God Almighty in comparison.' But Sir Neville also criticises 'socialist-minded teachers who preach about the rat race and warn that if you don't do well you'll end up in a factory. So you've got both ends attacking us, and it's quite wrong because we're the wealth creators.' It's a situation which, sadly, he cannot see changing quickly. Much of the company's success boils down to Sir Neville's survival instinct, coupled with what he calls 'an irritating ability to judge a commercial design. Although I say it myself I'm quite a good innovator, not just in designing trucks, but in systems and procedures.' He admits that he could not be considered a 'people person . . . my worst characteristic is that I can still rile, which is stupid and I regret it. I am afraid of emotion and welfare, and therefore take difficult decisions separately and easily, leaving these issues to personnel.' He objects, however, to being called ruthless, which suggests malice rather than objectivity, and strongly defends a policy which focuses on getting the products right. Sir Neville has had plenty of opportunity to practice his emotion-free decision-making and to learn from mistakes made during the past 33 years, which nearly ruined the company. The front axle fell off the brothers' first machine the day after it was delivered, but more than a decade of rapid growth followed. Then things went badly wrong in 1974 after the company standardised on engines from the then struggling Perkins group and began manufacturing at a grant-aided factory in Peterlee, seriously overstretching a management team based at Leighton Buzzard. After three rounds of redundancies that virtually halved the workforce, Lancer Boss was cash rich again by 1979, and Sir Neville began looking for foreign acquisitions, realising the necessity for the company's long-term survival of establishing a strong European presence and a broad product range. Several false starts in the early 1980s ended when the company snapped up Munich-based Steinbock in 1983, followed by Barcelona-based SAM Fenwick in 1987 and a majority stake in Hyco of Milan last year. Last month Boss bought Manualp, the largest materials handling equipment distributor in central France. And this week HycoBoss, as the Italian company is now called, unveiled three new container handlers. The Steinbock acquisition has given Sir Neville his most revealing insights about different attitudes to manufacturing and engineering skills in the UK and Germany. 'I would say 45 is the oldest you would want to employ an Englishman because they are poorly educated, and, even worse, badly trained vocationally,' he says. 'A man lacking vocational knowledge will often commit himself, full of enthusiasm, to a project, and then fail. In contrast, it is more difficult to get the Germans, who are better educated, to accept a plan, but once they do they know enough to achieve it.' The difference might explain why Boss has historically suffered badly in the UK from high staff turnover, especially among middle-aged managers. But Sir Neville maintains that the company is now recruiting better and improving training, and makes no apology for giving his managers a rough ride: 'It's no use me, at the age of 62, being prepared to change, if some 30-year-old is beginning to think about his pension.'</p>

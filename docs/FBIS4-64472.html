			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Social Democratic Party Chairman Rudolf </F> Scharping by Olaf Opitz, Ulrich Reitz, and Herbert Weber; place  and date not given: "Not the Chancellor's Election Club"]    [Text] [FOCUS] The Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] may discuss its government platform until the party  congress takes place. After that, it must be silent. You have  changed the party into a chancellor's election club, even though  you are not yet chancellor.    [Scharping] The SPD will always be a party that takes  pleasure in discussion and is open to reform. It will never be  a chancellor's election club. But the government program will  be adopted in June. If anyone then has a different opinion it  is clear that such an opinion will not be shared by the SPD. It  is comparable to soccer. In training, a misplaced pass is  tolerable, but in a match, it may lead to defeat.    [FOCUS] You are speaking from experience. The tax debate in  March was a classical misplaced pass.    [Scharping] We must concentrate all our instruments to fight  unemployment and reach the goal of social justice. We want  economic recovery, which is why the tax quota will not be  increased. Kohl and Waigel have imposed unprecedented burdens  on the citizens. Now everyone knows that the SPD will abolish  the solidarity surcharge on all incomes, because the Federal  Government has imposed it on every taxpayer. The SPD wants a  tax-free subsistence minimum, a considerably improved family  allowance, and merely a surcharge for less than 20 percent at  the upper end of the income spiral. The limit will be 120,000  German marks [DM] for married people and 60,000 for singles.  This makes more sense economically, because it eases the lower-  and medium-income groups of tax burdens. Such a measure will  have a favorable effect on the economic cycle.    [FOCUS] Such a measure would hit the elites that you need  for economic recovery.    [Scharping] My understanding of elites has nothing to do  with incomes or the search for personal advantages. Otherwise,  you would also have to consider Zwick and Schneider [two corrupt  entrepreneurs] as forming part of the elite.    [FOCUS] You are creating an envy barrier.    [Scharping] Do you have any other prejudices in store?    [FOCUS] After all, the upper half of the taxpayers finance  90 percent of the total income tax.    [Scharping] That is a misleading figure.    [FOCUS] It was calculated by officials in the Federal  Finance Ministry.    [Scharping] It only makes sense to put the tax revenue in  proportion to the total sum of incomes.    [FOCUS] Acrobatics with figures. Every average calculation  is inaccurate.    [Scharping] Now you are criticizing your own questions.  Under the Bonn coalition, those who pay DM2,000 in taxes will  in the future have to pay DM2,150. The SPD thinks that it  should be DM50 more, which would be reasonable for such high  incomes.    [FOCUS] You want the middle class to pay according to the  motto that those who do not have much should get something from  those who have a bit more. As usual, it is hard to get at the  highest income groups. Stars, top sportsmen, serious  entrepreneurs move to tax oases abroad. Zwick and Schneider  disappear. Skilled workers and engineers stay and pay.    [Scharping] I do not take part in discussions on the  superrich. Zwick and Schneider are cases for the public  prosecutor; they can hardly be used as examples in your  comparison. The SPD wants everyone to help finance German unity  in accordance with their financial capacity. By the way, this  is also in line with our constitution. That is the point. The  situation now is this: Workers and employees, small and  medium-sized enterprises, and employment-intensive firms have  had to pay an excessively high share through ancillary wage  costs. The SPD certainly is not the only one to state that  higher income earners can make a slightly higher contribution.  A real upswing requires economic activity at home and companies  that invest. We want to ease them of some of their burdens.  People like [Employers' Federation President] Murmann and  [German Industry Federation President] Tyll Necker share these  ideas. I do not think we can impute social envy to them.    [FOCUS] For how long would the surcharge planned by the SPD  have to be paid?    [Scharping] The SPD does not want to increase the tax quota  but is seeking just distribution! As a result of the wrong way  of financing German unity, the Kohl government has accumulated  an incredible debt mountain. There is still no end in sight to  the necessary annual transfer of approximately DM16 billion to  eastern Germany. As long as there is such a high financial  requirement, no responsible finance politician can abolish such  a surcharge. To stimulate growth and employment it is much more  important to lower the ancillary wage costs. With clear  economic growth, we can reduce the state quota over the medium  term.    [FOCUS] Let us discuss the misplaced passes again. Your  comrades in Kiel are calling for a speed limit, a property tax,  an energy tax....    [Scharping] We cannot invite the party members to take part  in the discussion and then complain about their statements,  including proposals that do not get a majority. I am opposed to  symbolism in politics.    [FOCUS] Why do you reject a speed limit?    [Scharping] There are better ideas than to impose bans.  Remote data processing would be an idea. We must differentiate  in terms of traffic and the environment.    [FOCUS] There are many road signs imposing bans in  Rhineland-Palatinate.    [Scharping] If you have come by highway A61 you will  certainly have seen that we are changing this.    [FOCUS] No. We think ecologically and have come by train.    [Scharping] That is commendable, but you really missed  something. On that highway you can study the advantages of a  differentiated approach. We have limited the speed on  four-track highways, but there is virtually no speed limit on  six-track highways. Following the introduction of the ban on  passing for trucks, accidents have drastically decreased.    [FOCUS] What are you going to do with the speed limit? Will  or will it not be introduced?    [Scharping] The speed will be limited but in a  differentiated way. We are seeking European harmonization,  which must include options allowing us to consider traffic and  environmental conditions.    [FOCUS] Why are you opposed to a general speed limit?    [Scharping] We must create a reliable framework for the  economic sector, including the automobile industry. We want  environment-considerate growth. In Japan, "ecolution," a  combination of evolution and ecology, is being pushed. In the  United States, the state and the automobile sector are jointly  seeking a "clean car." However, in Germany, we waited very long  before we introduced the catalytic converter. An ecological car  is above all a technical challenge.    [FOCUS] The banks are an important economic factor. They  played a disastrous role in the Schneider bankruptcy. How can  this be prevented in the future?    [Scharping] The Schneider bankruptcy is going at the expense  of many small- and medium-sized enterprises and at the  taxpayers' expense. The Schneider case has led to an intensive  debate on the necessary extent of the supervision of banks.  This issue has for months been intensively discussed in a  different context between the Bundesbank and commercial banks.  The banks should do everything to prevent damage to craftsmen  at their cost. The decision whether every bank should do so  separately, or whether they should create a common, adequate  emergency fund, should be left to the banks. In any case, they  must help the people concerned. After all, the reputation of  German banks is at stake.    [FOCUS] This is only an appeal. Do you also intend to  regulate it by law?    [Scharping] There has been a discussion for years on the  concentration of economic power with the banks -- and thus also  on the concentration of risks. However, before we call for laws  we must know whether current provisions have been violated or  whether the laws are really inadequate. If there are gaps or  deficiencies in the current laws, our legislative bodies are  called upon to act. I think that in such a case, we should do  what is necessary.</p>

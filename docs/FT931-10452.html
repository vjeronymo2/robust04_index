			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Savoy Pictures seeks share listing after public issue SAVOY PICTURES Entertainment, the recently formed US film production company whose investors include the Pritzker family, Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi and Carlton Communications of the UK, is planning to raise about Dollars 30m by way of a public share offer aimed at quoting the company on the Nasdaq over-the-counter stock market. Proceeds of the share offer, which would be added to Savoy's current paid-in capital of Dollars 165m, are expected to be used to help finance a roster of more than a dozen movies that could establish Savoy as a new competitor among the traditional Hollywood major studios. Savoy is headed by Mr Victor Kaufman, who was president of Columbia Pictures before it was acquired in 1989 by Sony of Japan. Although formed only a year ago, the company is already on track to spend about Dollars 250m a year producing and releasing feature movies. An indication of the scale of Savoy's ambitions is the initial roster of films underway. These include Mr Robert De Niro's debut as a director of A Bronx Tale and films to be directed by Sir Richard Attenborough and Mr Mike Nichols. Savoy is also planning films to be produced in association with the entertainment division of CBS Television and with Mr Ray Stark, the veteran Hollywood producer. Savoy has already committed Dollars 46m to acquire film projects. Allen &amp; Company, the New York investment bank that owns about 9 per cent of Savoy and is managing underwriter of the new share offer, has an option to acquire more stock. The initial share offer would place about 12.5 per cent of Savoy's equity on the stock market. Savoy, which would have a market capitalisation of between Dollars 208m and Dollars 240m after the share offer, is now 40 per cent owned by GHK Investments, a limited partnership managed by Mr Jay Pritzker. Carlton of the UK holds 9 per cent of Savoy while a further 6 per cent is held by Home Box Office (HBO), the cable programming subsidiary of Time Warner, the media and entertainment group. Mr Berlusconi is believed to have about 5 per cent of the company.</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Labouring under a tangle of rules - Problems in Spain Mr Tony Phillips produces a 92-page booklet from a drawer in his desk and says: 'I have never seen anything as complex as this before.' The abstruse publication, which sets out the in-house wages and working conditions agreement at Finanzauto, leading domestic supplier of earthmoving equipment, helps explain why Spain has a competitiveness problem and the most daunting official unemployment levels in Europe. According to Barcelona businessman Mr Carlos Ferrer Salat, president of UNICE, the European employers' confederation, 'Europe has the most regulated labour market in the world, and Spain's is the most regulated in Europe.' The latest labour survey puts Spain's jobless total at 3.7m, 24 per cent of the working population. A South African-born manager, Mr Phillips was posted to Spain 18 months ago to run Finanzauto, following its acquisition by J Bibby &amp; Sons, the UK industrial group controlled by Barlow Rand of South Africa. He is still baffled by the 60 job classifications, each with its own pay scale, that are listed in the booklet to cover the company's non-supervisory labour force of 1,350. To Mr Phillips's irritation, the in-house agreement establishes a basic 8am-3pm working day and a 37.5-hour week. The working day 'locks us out of sync with our customers' and the working week is 'a darn sight too short'. Finanzauto's employees are also protected by labour laws weighted towards job security. Mr Phillips says it cost Bibby 'a very large sum indeed' last year to negotiate redundancies, mostly through early retirement, that brought Finanzauto's labour force down from an inflated 1,950 to 1,493. The company paid out an average of nearly Pta8m (Dollars 57,000) per laid-off employee, a severance sum representing 45 days' pay per year worked, as stipulated by Spanish law. Finanzauto posted losses of Dollars 41m when it closed its financial year in September, dragging down the results of both Bibby and Barlow Rand. Faced with a construction industry slump, Mr Phillips's best hope of turning the company round lies in rendering wholly obsolete the offending booklet. In common with other Spanish chief executives, Mr Phillips argues the high cost of firing is a deterrent to hiring and Spain's rigid labour laws have played a significant part in the rise in unemployment. Fortunately, Spain's government is now backing his fight. A bill before parliament seeks substantial reforms to rules enshrined in company agreements such as Finanzauto's. It promotes functional and geographical mobility and cheaper firing procedures. Despite hostility from unions, parliament is expected to approve the law by the summer. Existing labour legislation is a hybrid drawing on the Franco period, when trade unions were banned but workers were guaranteed a job for life and on subsequent social democrat policies which boosted union power and further regulated employment. Had the new labour bill been law last year, Bibby could have cut Finanzauto's labour force at a fraction of the cost - 20 days per year worked and a maximum severance package equal to a year's salary.</p>

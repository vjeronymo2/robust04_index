			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: Driven to distraction Sir, Dominic Lawson's stress (October 24) on the need for companies to pay more attention to customers in a recession is expanded impressively by the report on sales-people by Sales and Marketing Solutions of York ('Shaken sales staff slip up on job', October 26). Throughout 1992, as ordinary consumers, my wife and I have had sales-people-related problems in parting with modest amounts of money to buy shoes, compact discs and, most recently, cars for each of us. My wife's request to change her VW Polo for the latest model was met with disbelief and it was only by showing impatience and insisting she was not window-shopping but wanted to buy a car that she succeeded. I put in a request to garages for figures to change my own G-registered vehicle in July and received no response. As an experiment, this month I tried 10 car dealers (Peugeot, Renault, VW-Audi, Mercedes-Benz etc). Only three dealers responded immediately and only one of them (Mercedes-Benz) was animated and keen enough to ensure I changed the car. When I read in your pages of a recession in the UK car industry, I now add mentally 'largely self-induced'. Peter Wood, Newbold Farm, Duntisbourne, Gloucestershire GL7 7JN</p>

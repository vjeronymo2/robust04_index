			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Baltic states, Albania in EC link The EC yesterday widened economic links with its neighbours by signing 10-year trade and co-operation accords with Albania and the three Baltic states, David Buchan reports from Brussels. The EC will scrap all discriminatory quotas against imports from the four countries, while they pledge not to use licensing or foreign exchange controls to impede imports from the EC. Ministers from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia hailed the accords as a step on their 'return to Europe'. They hoped yesterday's pacts, which give the Baltic states the benefits they briefly had under the EC's 1990 trade and co-operation accord with the Soviet Union, would be followed by eventual talks on free trade with Brussels. But Baltic ministers said that while Russian troops remained on their soil, Russia should not be 'integrated' into Europe.</p>

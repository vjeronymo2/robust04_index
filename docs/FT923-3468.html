			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Futures recover STERLING futures dipped even further in early morning trading yesterday as dealers became increasingly concerned about the pound's fall the night before on the foreign exchanges. However, futures recovered later in the day as the pound stabilised at around DM2.79 against the D-Mark, and the dollar rallied further against the German currency. In the early morning, the December short sterling contract opened 6 basis points down at 89.17 and quickly slipped to a low of 89.14. It later rebounded to finish 13 basis points up on the day at 89.30. Trading in the September contract, which expires next week, was far less volatile. After declining to a low of 89.26, the contract moved forward to end at 89.45. One clearing bank dealer said there was no sign that the Bank of England had yet bought sterling on the foreign exchanges by means of its recent D-Mark borrowing facility, and that this helped to support the currency. The market remained very tense, however. Unlike Wednesday's trading, yesterday's rumours pointed to an easing of German policy. One trader noted that there were suggestions that the German government could reintroduce the income tax surcharge which would help the Bundesbank reduce rates. Period rates in the interbank market also reflected slight optimism after the hairy close to trading on Wednesday. Three-month money softened to end at 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side from a previous close of 10 5/8 per cent. One-month money, an impor-tant indicator of whether the Bank of England will have to raise rates, also eased, from 10 1/2 per cent on the offered side to 10 1/4 per cent. The softening of the short dates was partly caused by the Bank of England's accom-modating position in the money market, dealing in all four bands. In the morning, the Bank bought Pounds 29m of Band 3 bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 4m of Band 4 Treasury bills and Pounds 258m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent. Later the Bank purchased Pounds 45m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 12m of Band 4 bank bills. The forecast was later revised to around Pounds 850m, and the Bank purchased Pounds 106m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. There was late assistance of Pounds 220m.</p>

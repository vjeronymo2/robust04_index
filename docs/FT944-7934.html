			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Company News: Battle begins for Spanish telecoms prize - Bids for licence to operate a second GSM mobile service open today The final countdown in one of the biggest corporate contests to be held in Spain will begin today. Under television lights and closely watched by some of the bigger names of Spanish business and the international telecoms community, Mr Jose Borrell, minister for public works, transport and telecommunications, will open two bulky envelopes. The envelopes will contain rival bids for a mobile telephony licence, the first significant incursion into the highly-regulated and monopoly-run Spanish telecommunications industry. The licence will be awarded before the end of this year. After examining the bids, Mr Borrell will give one of the two rival consortia the go-ahead to develop a second pan-European GSM (global system of mobile communications) digital network to compete with the one to be installed by Telefonica, the large government-controlled telecoms group. The prize is substantial. The betting is on start-up figures that, including the initial cash fee to the government, will be upwards of Pta200bn (Dollars 1.5bn). Initial investment for the network - which, under the terms of the tender, must offer GSM coverage for all Spanish cities of more than 10,000 inhabitants within five years - will be at least Pta100bn. As for the opponents, in one corner is a group called SRM. It is headed by Mr Jordi Mercader, a former chairman of the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), the public-sector conglomerate, and has the UK's Vodafone as its principal operator. In the other corner stands Airtel-Sistelcom-Reditel (ASR), headed by Mr Eduardo Serra, a former senior INI executive who went on to become junior defence minister. This group is backed by AirTouch, the US telecoms group. Vodafone has a 23 per cent stake in Cometa-SRM and AirTouch has a 16 per cent holding in ASR. Spain, with a mature basic telephony base, lags comparable economies in the mobile business. Mr Borrell claims he is setting Spain on a deregulation course. Once he has decided which second operator is to deliver a mobile service, the minister will introduce legislation that will both create, and liberalise, the cable television business in Spain. He also promises that basic telephony will be liberalised by 1998, with the award of a licence to the private sector. All eyes - and a lot of money - are now focused on the mobile telephone contest and on the referee's role that Mr Borrell undertakes today. But even before the bids are opened, the contest has its critics. The chief criticism is that the government has distorted the competition with its own greed; the two consortia are being forced to bid above an initial expensive opening price set by Mr Borrell. Mr Borrell's department has said a minimum of Pta50bn 5) must be delivered in advance to obtain the GSM licence. The rival bidders are likely to come close to doubling that sum. 'I'd be surprised if the winning cash bid is not close to Pta100bn,' says Mr Fernando Pardo, a partner of Price Waterhouse in Madrid and the consultancy firm's local telecommunications expert. The government is clearly anxious to earn as much as possible from the second licence in order to lower its public deficit. It is also, according to critics, placing an exceptionally high burden on those bidding for the second licence in order to defend Telefonica. A clear consequence of such an attitude is that the cost of the contest has crowded out several domestic companies. If the government wanted to encourage a wide network of Spanish enterprises to invest in the telecommunications sector, it has singularly failed to do so; only a reduced contingent of blue chip companies remain in the second licence contest. Mr Borrell, when awarding the licence, will be looking at which of the rival bids offers most in terms of job creation; which would offer additional industrial investment unconnected with the mobile business; and which puts a premium on Spanish-based research and development, as opposed to imported technology. 'The driving force (of the tender) is the creation of a good GSM system for the country,' maintains Mr Claudio Boada, managing director in Spain of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which is advising the transport and communications ministry over the award. Telefonica, which already operates an analog cellular phone network, expects to earn Pta40bn from 400,000 subscribers this year. Price Waterhouse confidently expects that the mobile business will have 2m users with the development of GSM by 1998 and that the market will be worth Pta210bn by that date. It is not surprising, therefore, that the big guns in Spanish banking have lined up behind the two consortia. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) has taken a 30 per cent stake in Cometa-SRM; Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano, (BCH) share a 27 per cent holding in ASR. Argentaria, the state-controlled financial group and the other of Spain's big four high-street banks, is understood to be backing Telefonica's GSM venture. The other shareholders in the two consortia constitute a revealing list of who has financial muscle in Spain and a willingness to bet on new technology. Barcelona's La Caixa, the biggest domestic savings bank, is behind the Cometa-SRM bid, while five middle-ranking regional savings institutions have teamed to back ASR. The big electrical utilities, Endesa, Iberdrola and Sevillana, have sided with Cometa-SRM, while the smaller Fecsa and Union Fenosa utilities support ASR. But just as interesting is the roll-call of those who avoided the contest. Both consortia suffered last minute withdrawals. Among the big names that pulled out were Repsol, the government-controlled oil, chemical and gas group; El Corte Ingles, the cash-rich retail store group; and Prisa, the leading multimedia company which publishes the newspaper El Pais.</p>

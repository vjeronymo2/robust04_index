			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Argos held back by costs of new chain INTERIM profits of Argos, the catalogue retailer, fell 11.3 per cent to Pounds 9.5m pre-tax. The group said profits would have risen but for the costs of an experimental chain of furniture shops. Mr David Donne, chairman, said sales since the start of the second half in mid-June, had shown 'a slight improvement and are marginally positive on a comparable basis'. He said this might mean the low point in consumer spending had been reached. The interim dividend was increased by 4.8 per cent to 2.2p and Argos shares rose 15p to 219p. Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said it was too early to forecast Christmas trading, when the group makes most of its profits. Argos, which was demerged from BAT Industries in 1990, said the Chesterman chain of four furniture shops had lost Pounds 2.25m in the first half in pre-opening costs and trading losses. This was Pounds 2m more than in the comparable period. Without that both trading and pre-tax profits would have risen. Mr Smith said that Chesterman had not done as well as hoped. Research suggested low awareness of the stores among furniture buyers and an advertising change was planned. He said that Chesterman's losses in the second half were likely to be of the same order as the first half. There would also be provisions of Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.5m in the 1992 figures to cover reorganisation of the Argos distribution system. Group sales in the 24 weeks to June 13 were 3.4 per cent higher at Pounds 331.8m. However, sales area increased by 4.3 per cent and comparable store sales were 0.9 per cent lower. The autumn/winter catalogue was launched two weeks ago. Mr Bob Stewart, finance director, said that, of the goods which had been repeated from the previous catalogue, 80 per cent were at the same price or cheaper. Trading profits fell from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.3m, as costs such as staff and rents rose faster than sales. However, interest received on the group's cash - which averaged Pounds 88m in the first half compared with Pounds 59m in the same period of 1991 - rose from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 4.2m. After a tax rate of 35.2 per cent, up from 33.6 per cent, earnings per share were 2.08p, down from 2.4p. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: OMV recovery gives hope for return to profit OMV, the troubled Austrian integrated oil and chemical group, reports a 1992 net loss of Sch264.5m (Dollars 23.8m), somewhat less than the Sch300m forecast in January. In 1991, the group made a net profit of Sch1.72bn. The recovery trend has continued into the first quarter of 1993, with a loss of Sch125m comparing with a Sch247m deficit in the same 1992 period. Mr Richard Schenz, who became president last summer following the sudden resignation of Mr Siegfried Meysel, said there was evidence of some improvement in the group's markets, and he hoped for a return to modest profits for the year as a whole. The directors were meanwhile concentrating on cutting costs. The dividend for 1992 would be cut from Sch20 per share to Sch15 and capital spending this year would be reduced from Sch6bn last year to Sch4bn. Group sales last year were flat at just under Sch83bn, with sales in the integrated oil and gas businesses up 2.7 per cent to Sch67.1bn, while chemical sales were down 7.7 per cent to Sch8.37bn and plastics revenues plunged 14.1 per cent to Sch7.37bn. A divisional breakdown of after-tax results showed the exploration and production division moved from a Sch390m loss to a Sch310m profit, while the gas division raised its profit from Sch1.34bn to Sch1.53bn. OMV said its selling memorandum for prospective strategic shareholders would be ready by mid-May. The Austrian state industrial holding company, OIAG, intends to sell part of its 72 per cent stake, and OMV has said it would like to have two or three strategic shareholders with 10 to 20 per cent stakes. Potential candidates include governments of oil and gas-producing countries and international oil companies. Mr Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, finance director, said he hoped the selection process, in which OMV is being advised by Lehman Brothers, could be completed by year-end.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution comply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the institutional refund policy established in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with &sect;668.22. The Secretary considers this provision to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations without substantive modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in addition to the statutory requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreements, an institution would have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agree to be liable for all improperly spent or unspent funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received under the title IV, HEA programs, including funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered by a third-party servicer, and refunds that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or its servicer may be required to make. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was proposed and discussed in the NPRM published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendments of 1992 and the Technical Amendments of 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended the HEA to require that an institution that has a change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in ownership resulting in a change in control reestablish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional eligibility and undergo a certification review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before it may participate in any title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Secretary is proposing to remove the provision in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current regulations that permitted the new participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement of an institution that changed ownership to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective on the date of the change of ownership. Instead, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations, the program participation agreement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution that changes ownership would be effective on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date that the Secretary signs the agreement, just as any other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new program participation agreement would.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to specify that a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation agreement expires if the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation ends because: (1) The institution closes or stops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing educational programs for a reason other than a normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacation period or a natural disaster that directly affects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or the institution's students; (2) the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loses its institutional eligibility under 34 CFR part 600; (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's period of participation, as specified under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.13, expires (that is, the four-year limit on participation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limits on participation established pursuant to provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification, or shorter periods established by the Secretary),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the institution's provisional certification is revoked under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.13; (4) the Secretary determines under &sect;668.13(c) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that is applying for certification has jeopardized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its ability to perform its financial responsibilities by not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting the factors of financial responsibility under &sect;668.15 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards of administrative capability under &sect;668.16 (in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of an institution whose participation has been limited or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended under subpart G of this part, or voluntarily enters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into provisional certification); or (5) the Secretary receives a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice from the appropriate SPRE that the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation should be withdrawn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These provisions would conform to the provisions in proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.26 governing the end of an institution's participation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> title IV, HEA program. The first of these circumstances listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above is purely a clarification of existing practice. The last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three describe circumstances mandated by the change made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA by the Amendments of 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.15&blank;Factors of Financial Responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to redesignate &sect;668.13 as &sect;668.15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section includes provisions dealing with third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers that were proposed in the NPRM published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 17, 1994 (in part II). The Secretary will not repeat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discussion of those provisions here. However, this third-party servicer NPRM proposed to apply the general standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility that are proposed in this NPRM to third-party servicers that contract with lenders or guaranty agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to administer any aspect of the title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 487 of the HEA requires the Secretary to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to determine the financial responsibility of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution as a part of the Secretary's determination that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution is able to participate in a title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498 of the HEA mandates some of the standards that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary must use in making a determination of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. In general, section 498 of the HEA adopted, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications, the standards used by the Secretary in current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.13 of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require an institution to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is financially responsible under the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

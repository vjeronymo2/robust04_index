			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Improved engineering outcome pegs decline at Delta to 24% A STRONG performance from its engineering division helped to offset the impact of weak prices on electrical cables at Delta, leaving pre-tax profit 24 per cent down from Pounds 87.1m to Pounds 65.8m in 1991. Turnover fell to Pounds 774m, against Pounds 793.6m. Mr Robert Easton, chief executive, said the main damage was caused by pressure on prices in the UK power cables market as the privatised electricity companies husbanded their cash and as European competition intensified. Operating profit in the cables division came out at Pounds 15.1m, less than half the comparable Pounds 31m, on sales of Pounds 279.4m (Pounds 307.2m). Engineering, on the other hand, advanced to Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 19.8m) on Pounds 295.1m (Pounds 279.6m) turnover. Demand for plumbing products and gas controls was particularly strong in Germany and Spain. Sites were still being closed, but one positive move was the switching of the production of fire-fighting valves from Germany to the UK, 'where costs are much lower. It's much more efficient to manufacture in Walsall than Frankfurt,' Mr Easton said. Industrial services was affected by the downturn in Australia and rationalisation costs. Profit fell to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 24.1m). Circuit protection suffered from destocking, reflected in profit down by nearly Pounds 4m to Pounds 13.7m. Some cushioning was provided by the Malaysian business and a recovery in exports to the Middle East. Delta took the cost of redundancies and closures above the line and did not quantify them. Mr Easton said more than 3,500 people had left the group since 1989. The process was expected to moderate this year. The group ended the year with net debt of Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 41.2m) for gearing of 13 per cent. There was ample borrowing capacity to make acquisitions, Mr Easton said. In the US, he wanted the group to grow to five times its present sales of Pounds 48m by the mid-1990s. Earnings per share fell to 28p (35.7p). A maintained final dividend of 9.8p makes an unchanged total of 14p. COMMENT Mr Easton is perhaps the first industrialist to describe the recession as history, especially when his company is still being affected by it. His equanimity is to some extent justified by the resilience Delta has shown. In spite of its 50 per cent exposure to the UK, earnings per share have fallen by less than 24 per cent since the 1989 peak. The benefit of prompt cost cuts and a tempering of the reorganisation bill this year should restore profit growth, although cables markets are likely to remain difficult. Indeed the collapse in cables profits from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 4.4m between the first and second halves was the most disappointing aspect of the figures. A pre-tax forecast of Pounds 70m-Pounds 75m this year gives a prospective p/e of about 14 on yesterday's close of 446p. Its track record, strong balance sheet and comfortable dividend cover has earned a small premium to the market. Although there is little scope for short-term progress, the shares remain worth holding.</p>

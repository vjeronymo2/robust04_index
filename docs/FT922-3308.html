			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Business welcomes new Thai premier THAILAND'S business community and foreign investors yesterday welcomed the surprise reappointment of Mr Anand Panyarachun, a businessmen and former diplomat, as interim prime minister, but warned that the military were not yet a spent force in Thai politics. After weeks of gloom and uncertainty, the stock market rose 7.3 per cent on the news, with the SET index rising 49.85 points to close at 737.23. Volume was an exceptionally high Baht 11.56bn (Pounds 248m). 'The Anand move will certainly buy time,' said a foreign executive of one multinational company. Mr Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice-president of Siam Commercial Bank, said he was 'extremely delighted. Now the country's economy will survive'. Mr Anand, who ran the country between the coup d'etat in February 1991 and elections in March is expected to appoint a cabinet of technocrats and use his four months in office before new elections to push through much-needed infrastructure projects to relieve congestion in Thailand's transport and communications networks. General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the previous prime minister, was forced to resign nearly three weeks ago after troops had killed dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators, and the military establishment was further humiliated when their latest candidate for the job, Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, was passed over in favour of Mr Anand at the last minute on Wednesday as he was preparing to celebrate his elevation to the premier-ship. Few Thais believe that the armed forces would dare to intervene before the new elections because Mr Anand's appointment was seen to be supported by King Bhumipol Adulyadej, the influential constitutional monarch.</p>

Kim has been sought by the government since last year for  his  alleged involvement in irregularities in the nation's military  build-up program, Yulgok.    A local newspaper report yesterday said Kim, who has been in  the United States since May 1993, has recently filed an  application for permanent residentship with the U.S. government.    The report added there is possibility that Kim may seek  political asylum in the United States to avoid Seoul's  investigation.    But officials of the Foreign Ministry in Seoul said they  have  no such information. They said the U.S. State Department is  expected to notify them when such a celebrity as Kim seeks a  U.S. residentship. But there were no such report from the U.S.  government concerning Kim, the officials said.    Nor has the ministry any plans to inquire with the U.S.  government about the matter at the moment, they said.    The officials doubted the possibility that Kim had filed a  request with the U.S. government. They said Kim doesn't need  new permission to stay in America for his visa still holds good  for a few more years.    Kim went to the United States in May 1993, three months  after  the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam government, at the  invitation of a research institute in Washington.    He has not returned home since then, even when his mother  died late last year.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of US Communications (4): Baby Bells take action after storm warning - The seven regional Bell operating companies whose monopolies are under threat The US Baby Bell operators are like the man who has just heard a hurricane warning. It could destroy his house and life, but, on the other hand, it might go off in a completely different direction. Either way, he is stunned, dreads the worst, and takes frenzied defensive action. For the seven local Bell operators, the hurricane warning is the effective abolition of their local monopolies, which is advancing much faster than almost anyone believed possible barely a year ago. At one extreme, the upshot could be the end of the Baby Bell system, as it currently exists, with two or three vast multi-media companies dominating local telecoms delivery across the US. At the other, a modified, somewhat more competitive, version of the status quo could last for years yet. Because of this, the Baby Bells are in a hyper-active state, dashing about in all directions in a bid to secure their valuable goods and chattels from destruction. Some are sending a large part of their possessions abroad. Almost all are seeking to lash themselves to cable or entertainment companies, the better to master the storm. Everyone is hoping to compete in the telecoms business in new regions of the US. To gauge the industry's state of mind you need only compare the extreme reactions. 'The changes coming will dwarf the break up of the Bell system a decade ago. We're going to have a few large companies, probably in the form of consortia,' said Mr Richard Notebaert, vice-chairman of Ameritech, which covers 12m subscribers in the Midwest. Mr Jeff Rubin, chief finance officer of Nynex, which covers the north-east, is gazing at a different crystal ball: 'The world will be much less different in ten years time than many think - it'll be like the airline industry, where everyone has gone down different highways and byways but still ended up in roughly the same business.' The collapse last month of the Dollars 21.4bn merger between Bell Atlantic, the largest Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) by access lines, and TCI, the largest cable television operator, gives succour to Mr Rubin. But even he went on to predict that 10 years hence Nynex could be drawing 'between a quarter and a half' of its revenues from overseas operations. At the very least, the Baby Bells are going to be doing 'same business' on a far broader canvas than now. The RBOCs face a threefold challenge: regulatory reform at home; technological advance, bringing new media (such as cellular and broadband) on stream and promoting convergence between the existing media of telecoms, computing and entertainment; and international liberalisation, opening up the world to US telecoms operators of all kinds as never before.</p>

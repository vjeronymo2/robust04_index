			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Printer hammers its message home One way to make a big impression in the fiercely competitive industrial printer market is to hammer a way to success. At least that is the approach at Swedish-owned Facit, which this week introduced a new printhead technology to the UK market. Facit has been selling its nine-pin printhead using the so-called Flexhammer process for 16 years, but has now launched a 24-pin printhead. The tungsten carbide-tipped hammers are held back from the paper electronically, but spring forward when the current is stopped to hit the paper. The new printhead can produce up to seven copies, and is designed to last for more than 1.5bn characters. The heavy printer in which it is fitted is aimed at applications such as invoicing where high-quality flexible printing, along with economic performance, is essential. Facit: UK, 0634 868000</p>

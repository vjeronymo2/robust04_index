			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511); Beijing XINHUA Domestic </F> Service in Chinese at 0921 GMT on 30 January transmits a service  message canceling the following item]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Jan (XINHUA) -- This reporter has  learned from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation that China continued extending economic and  technical aid to some developing countries in 1993 within its  ability, a positive move in developing friendly cooperative  relations with Third World nations.    It is reported that according to new aid agreements it  signed  last year with 61 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and  the South Pacific, China will implement 272 economic and  technical aid projects in 72 [as received] recipient nations, of  which 77 are turnkey projects, 113 are technical cooperation  projects and cooperation projects of other types, and 82 are  preconstruction projects. All of these projects have been  proceeding satisfactorily.    To meet the economic restructuring and development plans of  recipient nations, China will open wholly foreign-owned and  jointly owned enterprises as well as leasing firms in foreign  countries through economic and technical assistance channels.  Forty-five such projects were explored and discussed with 24  recipient nations last year, resulting in the signing of 12  agreements between enterprises on both sides. China also  offered over 50 aid programs for general goods and materials to  41 countries to help them solve production problems, meet  certain needs for their people's livelihood, and overcome  difficulties caused by natural disasters.    In cooperation with UN development agencies, China actively  participated in technical cooperation projects among developing  countries in 1993, offering a host of wide-ranging aid programs.  Among them were 23 China-sponsored short-term practical  technical training courses in food, aquaculture, agricultural  machinery, and small hydropower, in which more than 230  technicians from 46 developing countries were trained.    It has been learned that, in the future, while continuing  its  efforts to extend economic and technical assistance to foreign  countries, China will undergo reforms in foreign aid work,  primarily the following: focus on projects that help recipient  nations develop small and medium-sized production units with  local demands and resources and that train personnel; in  promoting direct cooperation between PRC enterprises and those  of recipient nations, help them develop their national economies  while integrating bilateral and multilateral economic and trade  ties and promoting better cooperation between governments; and  further perfect foreign-aid administration that emphasizes  standardized and scientific management.</p>

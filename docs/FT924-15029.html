			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Russian industry lobby on attack MR Arkady Volsky, leader of Russia's conservative industrial lobby, yesterday launched a rearguard attack against the Russian reformist cabinet from the region historically viewed as the crown jewel of the Russian empire, Ukraine. Speaking to a conference of Ukrainian, Russian and east European factory directors in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Mr Volsky expressed satisfaction at the speech made in Moscow by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. The leader of Civic Union told Ukrainian factory directors: 'It is pleasant that Mr Yeltsin echoed our views.' But he warned that he and his increasingly powerful lobby would not be appeased by a single speech. He said his group had an alternative economic reform programme and that if this was not adopted by the government he would lead Russia's factory directors into open opposition. 'We need to call a time out on reform,' Mr Volsky said. 'We should not take a step backwards but for now must jog in one spot.' Mr Volsky said he favours using China and South Korea as models rather than the western market economies Mr Gaidar seeks to emulate. Mr Volsky's choice of Kiev as a venue for these remarks is part of a wider campaign by Russian conservatives to play the Ukrainian card in an effort to force Mr Yeltsin to back down from radical reform. Last month's agreement between the Ukrainian and Russian central banks, lambasted by Russian reformers as opening a back door to inflationary policies, is another example of this tactic. 'The basic question is the harmonisation of reform programmes of the republics of the former Soviet Union,' Mr Volsky said. Mr Volsky would clearly like to 'harmonise' Russia's approach with that of Ukraine, whose state-dominated economic programme corresponds with his own preferences. The only bone of contention between Mr Volsky and Mr Vasyl Evtukhov, his Ukrainian counterpart, was the sensitive national issue of Ukraine's plan to introduce a separate currency. Mr Evtukhov advocated Ukraine's exit from the rouble zone. However, Mr Volsky said that members of the Commonwealth of Independent States should stick to a single currency.</p>

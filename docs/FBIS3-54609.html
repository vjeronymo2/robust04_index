			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres left a short time  ago for the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where he will meet with  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat tomorrow. Jerusalem believes Davos  will not be the last station in the negotiations with the  Palestinians. A member of the Israeli delegation to the Swiss  talks forecasted last night that 'Arafat and Peres will not sign  any agreement tomorrow. This evaluation is based on the reports  from Cairo that the drafting team, headed by Uri Savir and  Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], did not reach understandings.  Following two days of preparatory talks, the teams managed to  produce only a document detailing the points of agreement and  disagreement between the PLO and Israel. The two main points of  disagreement are still the border crossings -- in particular  Israel's demand to inspect suspicious-looking Palestinians  passing through the crossings -- and Jericho's jurisdiction.    Peres and 'Arafat will meet tomorrow, but they may hold  preliminary talks today to try to overcome the points in  dispute. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin had a tete-a-tete meeting  with Foreign Minister Peres last night prior to Peres' departure  for Davos today. Rabin is firm in his opposition to any  concessions or further flexibility on security issues. That is  the position Peres presented to 'Arafat in Oslo, and although  the atmosphere there was optimistic, the evaluations regarding  Davos are more pessimistic.</p>

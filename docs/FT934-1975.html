			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Thorp Go-ahead: Ministers accept economic case for waste plant British Nuclear Fuels has gained the decision it wanted, although a year later than it had hoped. BNF says the delay has cost it more than Pounds 100m. In giving the go-ahead, ministers made clear that they accepted the company's economic case for the plant. The company has said that Thorp will earn the UK Pounds 900m in its first 10 years of operation. It also says it will make Pounds 500m profit in that period, even after taking account of construction and decommissioning costs. Mr John Guinness, BNF chairman, said yesterday's decision 'is a major step forwards in allowing us to earn billions of pounds of overseas revenue for the UK'. BNF has stressed throughout the debate that it regards these estimates as conservative. It points out that it has customer orders to run at full capacity for 10 years, and has orders for more than 40 per cent of capacity for its second decade. The company says it expects to win more orders for reprocessing for the second decade. Japanese utilities are among its main hopes - Japan's reprocessing facility now under construction could be in operation by then, but the country might not have the capacity to reprocess all of its spent fuel. In the longer term BNF hopes it can build on its expertise and reputation from Thorp to sell nuclear waste management services internationally. It might try to get work helping clean up US military sites, or decommissioning and decontaminating eastern European and former Soviet reactors. Critics say these hopes - short and long-term - are unlikely to be fulfilled. They say that it will be difficult for BNF to win new business for Thorp because cheaper alternatives to reprocessing have emerged. In particular, utilities are likely to look to dry storage - storing used fuel in concrete bunkers for 50 years to 80 years before a final decision on disposal is taken. Support for this view comes from the decision by Scottish Nuclear, the power generator which is one of Thorp's UK customers, to opt for dry storage for part of its fuel. Scottish Nuclear says it vigorously backs the start-up of Thorp and will honour its reprocessing contracts with BNF. But it says dry storage is between 30 per cent and 40 per cent cheaper than reprocessing and it expects to save Pounds 45m a year from adopting that route. Mr Gordon MacKerron, energy economist at Sussex University's Science Policy Research Unit, said: 'I do not believe that there is any likelihood of more contracts beyond the first 10 years - customers no longer see any economic reason to reprocess because of its cost.' The worst outcome for BNF is that it fails to get new customers, and that existing customers pull out from contracts. In giving the go-ahead ministers said there was no evidence that customers would try to pull out, although critics have said there are political as well as economic reasons why they would be tempted to do so. In particular some economists have said that public hostility would make it hard for foreign customers to repatriate uranium and plutonium as their contracts require. BNF's reply is that under tough penalty clauses customers would be obliged to compensate it. But it has not disclosed the relevant details of the contracts. Critics have said that if customers started to withdraw, its profit estimates could be rapidly whittled away. As many of the responses to the second public consultation point out, BNF's projections correspond to only one of many scenarios for the next decade and beyond. The company is now in a position to test its belief that more business is out there. It may take years, however, to establish whether the fears of Thorp's critics about the economics of the plant are justified.</p>

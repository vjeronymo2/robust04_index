			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (9): Housing controls prevent an influx - Property The attractions of Guernsey as a place to live and work, with its regulatory independence, low tax rates and a pleasant climate, have led to strict controls over the island's housing market to prevent mass immigration from the UK. It became clear soon after the Second World War that without some form of control over the occupation of residential properties, prices would escalate out of reach of the local population. In 1948 the States, or local legislature, foresaw future problems and introduced a housing control law in a relatively mild form. This has since been amended and strengthened many times and it is now regarded as a highly effective barrier against an influx of outsiders. The island's 18,000 homes have been divided into two categories, with 90 per cent available for occupancy only by the local population - broadly those born in Guernsey or with Guernsey parents - and the remaining 10 per cent designated as 'open market' housing which anyone can buy and occupy. The only exceptions are those outsiders granted a housing licence by the local authority to occupy local homes, but these are given infrequently and generally only to people with job skills and qualifications that cannot be provided locally. Open-market housing, which was originally chosen because of its relatively high rateable value, is generally the larger executive type of house, and the number is fixed. No transfer into the open market category is allowed, and no new building plots are available. In such a restricted market and given the pressures that have followed the influx of highly paid executives in the financial services sector, prices have stayed high. According to Mr John Allen, managing director of Swoffers, a local estate agents, open-market prices climbed to 'dizzy heights' prior to the recession, with Pounds 2m the highest price achieved. But since the end of 1990, prices have retreated by about 25 per cent as potential buyers from the UK have had difficulties selling their homes and businesses. The base level for a modest open-market semi-detached house has fallen from Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 175,000 or even Pounds 150,000, and an old farmhouse in 10 acres and in good condition would now fetch between Pounds 650,000 and Pounds 800,000. Prices have also fallen on the local market as the recession has taken effect, but not nearly to the same extent. 'They have been bumping along rather than falling sharply,' says Mr Allen. In general, open-market houses fetch between two and three times their local equivalent, where the asking prices are around Pounds 90,000 to Pounds 100,000 for an average three-bedroom semi and Pounds 60,000 for a base-level two-bedroom terrace house. There are now probably between 150 and 200 open-market houses up for sale - a relatively high number given that there were only 60 transactions completed in each of the past two years, compared with 120 in 1989. One problem has been that owners are reluctant to cut prices that still hark back to the levels of two years ago. Mr Ben Lovell, of Lovell &amp; Partners in St Peter Port, believes the local market has begun to improve significantly, and is much more buoyant than just six months ago. 'We are lucky. When the recession hits the UK, it affects us later and not so sharply.' However, he accepts that neither the open nor the local market will recover fully until the UK housing and business sectors improve substantially. Mr Lovell believes Guernsey's unique system works well. 'It is very straightforward and uncomplicated.' Because the restricted supply keeps open-market values high, the signs of a relatively good value local market might tempt incomers to dodge the island rules. In practice, tighter employment laws would exclude such buyers from the jobs market. In addition, the island is too small a community to try bending the regulations, especially as the completion of any property transaction has to take place in the royal court in front of the bailiff. It is a public transaction, rather than a discreet transfer of deeds. Relatively few licences are granted for outsiders to buy local properties, but there is growing pressure on the housing authority to be more liberal in its judgments, particularly over short-term licences for key personnel in the hotel and restaurant sector. More homes are planned for locals, almost entirely in carefully designated built-up zones, in order to prevent more building in rural areas. Alderney and Sark do not have housing controls but property can be scarce and expensive. Alderney operates a work permit system, but it is very flexible and insists simply that incomers have no criminal record.</p>

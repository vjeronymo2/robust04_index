			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Today, for the first time ever, a group of  Jordanian citizens who are not of Palestinian origin was allowed  to cross into Israel. In coordination with the International  Red Cross, the Jordanians crossed the border over the Allenby  Bridge where they were given special entry visas for three days  only. They came here to visit Jordanian relatives held in  Israeli prisons. One of the visitors came to visit his cousin  who is serving a 25-year sentence for his role in the terrorist  attack on the Israeli Embassy in Singapore. [passage omitted]</p>

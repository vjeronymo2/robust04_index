			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Canada to tighten immigration CANADA is backing away from its reputation as one of the world's most hospitable countries by proposing a more selective system for admitting immigrants and refugees. Proposals tabled by Mr Bernard Valcourt, immigration minister, would speed up the processing of some cases, such as immediate family members of people already in the country, wealthy investors, and bona fide refugees. But immigration officers would also get new powers to turn away applicants for refugee status, and the right of appeal against refugee board decisions would be more limited. The aim is to cut the number of applications by about 40 per cent from the 30,000 processed last year. Canada takes in more immigrants and refugees than any other industrial country relative to its population. Almost 206,000 newcomers arrived in 1991, and the number is expected to rise to 250,000 this year.</p>

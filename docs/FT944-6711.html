			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: RBoS rethink Reassessment of the prospects for Royal Bank of Scotland ahead of figures on Thursday saw the Scottish clearer's shares lose 7 at 416p. The change of heart followed disappointing comments from the bank's insurance subsidiary Direct Line. BZW, whose ardour has been cooling for some time, finally put the stock on its sell list, saying Direct Line's profits would peak in two years' time and, as such, the RBoS valuation was too high. The investment bank believes that RBoS is at a current price to book value of 4.7 times and sees the share price falling to 380p. It forecast a profit on Thursday of Pounds 520m giving earnings per share of 36.4p and a 13.2p dividend. Barclays moved ahead 10 to 597p on switching out of Lloyds, up 3 at 567p. A large block of TSB sold at above the prevailing market price, and via a marketmaker anxious not to go short ahead of the Budget, saw the underlying stock gain 8 1/2 at 227p. Dealers hung fire on Singer &amp; Friedlander. The merchant bank confirmed it was in talks with Nordbanken, of Sweden, over buying the Carnegie brokerage but gave no further details. The shares held at 81p. Insurer General Accident slipped 5 to 536p, with institutions digesting a cautious note from Smith New Court which argued that the shares were now at an over-demanding premium of between 28 and 30 per cent above net asset value. Northern Ireland Electricity rose 5 to 362p after agreement to restore the Republican power link, out of service since 1975. Historically one of the Budget's more price sensitive sectors, drinks shares showed no obvious signs of nerves, with a number of stocks putting in a steady showing. Bass gained 5 at 531p and GrandMet put on 2 at 389p following a switch recommendation from Nomura Securities. The top Japanese house told clients to switch out of Guinness and into GrandMet given the way the stout producer has outperformed over the past month and GrandMet's weakness ahead of this week's interims. Guinness shed 3 to 453p. Allied Domecq rose 10 to 563p, partly in response to over-selling following last week's results but mostly on the perception that today's Budget statement will not produce duty increases. Ahead of next week's interims and helped by positive comment from broker James Capel, Scottish &amp; Newcastle appreciated 7 to 507p. Dollar sensitive stocks responded to the stronger US currency. Glaxo gained 5 at 626p and Unilever 9 at 1112p. International conglomerate Hanson, which reports full-year figures on Thursday, moved up 4 to 231p. Health care group Smith &amp; Nephew eased marginally to 151p following a strong performance recently. NatWest Securities issued a weighty review which argued inter alia that demand for oil was rising as OECD countries emerge from recession and Iraq oil was unlikely to return to the market in significant quantities before the 1996 US election. The house maintains its forecast of Dollars 19 a barrel for Brent crude and focuses on stocks with 'low valuations and high leverage to a still improving industry background'. The choices include BP, which rose 1 1/2 to 418 1/2 p, and Lasmo, which improved 2 1/2 to 146 1/2 p in spite of news that Mr Norman Davidson Kelly, the company's corporate development director, is to resign at the end of the month. Shell Transport failed to get above 696p in spite of a recommendation on its Royal Dutch arm by PaineWebber. British Steel moved forward 3 to 156p in turnover of 11m shares, helped by US press reports of strong North American steel prices extending into 1995 and possibly 1996. Among engineering shares, Siebe recovered 8 to 558p in advance of next week's interim results. TI Group firmed 6 to 372p, while renewed focus on a big foreign partner for its Rolls-Royce Motor Cars business underpinned a rise of 8 to 184p in Vickers. Textile leader Coats Viyella eased 3 to 199p after Smith New Court cut forecasts. Courtaulds Textiles shed 11 to 449p in sympathy. Analysts are concerned that the unseasonally warm weather will hit autumn sales, possibly forcing companies to discount prices. MEPC, which unveils interim results on Thursday, gained a penny at 400p, but Land Securities had a less resilient day, tumbling 9 to 589p ex-dividend following an unfavourable note about asset values from property adviser Savills. Diversified industrial group Williams Holdings held at 348p following the Pounds 80m purchase of the Angus fire equipment business from engineering services concern BBA, up 3 at 203p. Heavily dealt with 7.8m shares changing hands, BTR managed to hold steady at 285p despite weekend press suggestions of nervousness among some institutional shareholders following last week's resignation of the group's chief operating officer.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Smith advances A steep rise in profits from Pounds 38.7m to Pounds 95.2m at Smith New Court saw the shares advance 4 to 373p. Analysts were impressed by the stockbroking firm's increasingly international business. Mr Chris Smith at James Capel called it 'a very well-balanced set of results; the quality of earnings is going up and it is now more of an investment than a punt on the market'. He forecast the current year at or slightly below yesterday's figures, with earnings of between 50p to 60p per share. Mr Philip Gibbs at BZW said Smith was likely to extend its product range and market share in the current year, and he expected to upgrade his 'pretty conservative estimate' for current year profit of Pounds 90m. Turnover in Royal Insurance, up 5 at 260p, was higher than average at 3.9m. The volume was partly due to switching from Sun Alliance, which dropped 12 to 314p on profit-taking after its 12 per cent outperformance in the past fortnight, but was also due to news that Lloyd's of London had won a US industrial pollution case. Royal Insurance has one of the largest exposures to pollution damage claims. Further consideration of Wednesday's good results from CE Heath boosted the shares 12 to 352p, but accompanying takeover rumours were described as 'wide of the mark' by NatWest Securities' Mr Tony Silverman. Bradstock Group's 5 per cent profits increase left the shares unchanged at 114p. A profits warning from merchant bank Rea Brothers pushed it down 13 to 62p. Royal Bank of Scotland bucked the market trend, rising 12 to 422p after a buy note from Credit Lyonnais Laing. Mr Martin Hughes said the bank offered excellent prospects not shown by other banks, with growth expected in business and dividends. Abbey National dipped 5 to 422p, with NatWest Securities rumoured to be negative but Goldman Sachs rumoured as positive. Other banks eased back from Wednesday's gains. The recovery in the crude oil price boosted oil giant BP, offsetting recent concern that the ban on the export of Alaskan crude may not be lifted following objections in the US Congress. The shares gained 3 1/2 at 408 1/2 p in trade of 12m. The firmer oil price also helped Enterprise Oil, the shares advancing 7 to 398p, as talk that its bid for Lasmo would fail continued to circulate. However, the oils team at Strauss Turnbull believe Lasmo investors should accept the offer, particularly because 'the revised bid terms confer benefits on Lasmo shareholders at the expense of Enterprise shareholders'. The day's turnover in Enterprise of 2.9m was said to have included a block of 175,000 bought at a 2p premium for the new account, which begins on Monday. Lasmo eased 2 1/2 to 141p as the bid interest in the stock continued to fade. Two-way business in Shell Transport brought volume of 4.6m as the stock closed unchanged at 714p. Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank and securities house, changed from a cautious stance on the brewery sector to one of 'cautiously optimistic'. Analyst Mr Andrew Holland said recent results and company meetings had seemed to indicate that the worst of the wholesale price war was now over. 'All the bad news on discounting is now in the share prices,' he said. 'We could see some modest upturns from here.' The broker removed Scottish &amp; Newcastle from its sell list. The shares firmed a penny to 518p. Hints from the Bank of England that interest rates will have to rise hit builders and building material groups hard. Among the former, Barratt Developments fell 10 1/2 to 189 1/2 p, John Laing 9 1/2 to 282 1/2 p, Persimmon 5 to 237p and Taylor Woodrow 7 to 124p. Materials groups included Marley, off 9 at 139p, Hepworth, down 14 at 307p, Redland, 20 cheaper at 470p, and RMC, 35 weaker at 813p. High street retailers were also undermined by the rate rise speculation and mixed retail sales figures. Kingfisher slid 8 to 502p and Great Universal Stores 6 to 573p. But Dixons was 3 firmer at 191p as the figures showed electrical sales stronger. Fears about the take-up of the shares from its recent rights offer continued to dog Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel, which fell 14 to 303p. Dealers reported some confusion in dealing forms for private clients wishing to take up the issue. News of the restructuring of the Milk Marketing Board saw gains from Unigate, up 4 at 391p, and Northern Foods, ahead 2 at 217p. Figures below market expectations left Alvis 6 cheaper at 66p. The day's biggest volume was recorded in British Steel as active two-way business sent turnover up to 16m. The share price closed unchanged at 136 1/2 p. Allied Leisure slipped 2 to 25p after announcing that it is to take an exceptional charge in its accounts for the current year.</p>

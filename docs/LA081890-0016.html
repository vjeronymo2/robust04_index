			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORCES BEHIND IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> We have no guarantee that Mexico and other countries will reform their  economies in the next 30 years and illegal immigration will subside. However,  if we enforce our immigration laws it will awaken other countries to expedite  economic and political reforms and address their population problems.  </P> <P> Economic advancement seems to be assisted by population control. U.S. people  are becoming resentful that our country is an escape valve for another  country's population explosion.  </P> <P> It simply is not true that we cannot stop illegal immigration now. If we make  the effort we can have adequate barricades, we can increase the size of our  Border Patrol and INS, levy fines and enforce deportations, all of which will  send a clear message to unscrupulous employers and illegal aliens that our laws  and IRCA can work and are meant to be obeyed.  </P> <P> These actions will require a priority from the President and Congress. U.S.  taxpayers are aware of the billions of tax dollars going to subsidize illegal  aliens.  </P> <P> TED HILTON  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

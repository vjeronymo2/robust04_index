			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 6 Apr (PL) -- Speaking here today, Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina called for a more humane  approach to Latin American integration "because its sole purpose  is the well-being of our peoples."    The minister spoke at the Latin American Integration  Association (ALADI) headquarters. He called on association  members to work for the convergence of subregional processes and  for joint action on economic, social, and political issues. He  referred to the need to accomplish more in this sense by  gradually integrating production and service sectors.    In regard to the island's situation, Robaina asserted that  his government is taking concrete steps to restore as quickly as  possible the principal economic indicators.    Robaina added that in his country everything is subject to  debate at several levels so as to resolve current problems.    He also denounced the economic, commercial, and financial  blockade imposed by the United States for the past 30 years and  said the measure was a flagrant, massive, and systematic  violation of human rights.    The minister added that the Caribbean country will not  negotiate over its sovereignty or its right to speak for itself.  Nor will it abandon the social achievements it has accomplished.    The head of Cuban diplomacy arrived in Uruguay last Monday  for an official three-day visit which will continue until  tomorrow, 7 April, according to reports.    During his stay, Robaina was received by President Luis  Alberto Lacalle and met with cabinet members, including his  colleague Sergio Abreu, businessmen, intellectuals, and  compatriots who reside in that country.    Robaina's South American tour includes Ecuador, Peru,  Argentina, and Paraguay, according to sources in the Caribbean  delegation.</p>

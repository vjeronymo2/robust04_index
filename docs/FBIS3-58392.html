			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Jan 11 (AFP) -- France emphasized Tuesday  [11 January] that NATO was poised for tough action in Bosnia  including possible use of air power to support UN troops there  regardless of opposition from Serb troops or other warring  parties.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the most pressing  task at hand was to reopen the airport in the northeast Bosnian  city of Tuzla for use as a delivery point for UN humanitarian  aid.    "Today we have decided to go there despite the refusal of  the  Serbs," Juppe told reporters here at the close of a two-day  North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) summit.    "It's not a question of launching preventive or offensive  air  strikes, but we are setting up at the Tuzla airport so that it  will function and we warn that...if obstacles appear there will  be a riposte," Juppe said.    The French minister's remarks were the strongest  interpretation among Western officials of the summit's call to  UN troop commanders urgently to draft contingency plans for NATO  action at Tuzla and the eastern city of Srbrenica.    The decision, contained in the summit's final communique,  also aimed to ensure that some 300 Canadian UN troops in  Srbrenica for the past six months currently being blocked by  Serb forces from leaving were immediately permitted to do so.    French President Francois Mitterrand stressed NATO's  "determination to eliminate obstacles" preventing the UN  Protection Force from accomplishing its mission in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "We can no longer count on the goodwill of the three warring  parties and the first duty of the United Nations forces is to  ensure the safety of their comrades engaged in peacekeeping  activities," Mitterrand said.    "That will be the case in Srebrenica and at Tuzla airport,"  he added.    The proposal for action at Tuzla and Srebrenica was put  forward jointly by Britain and France, but Paris has in recent  weeks taken the lead -- despite U.S. misgivings -- for NATO to  prepare for tougher military action in Bosnia to support UN  troops.    Mitterrand said the wording of the passage on Bosnia  included  in the final communique had been drawn up by British Prime  Minister John Major and Juppe and was checked by U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher.    A French official, who asked not to be named, said earlier  that Christopher had telephoned Juppe on the eve of the summit  and had urged Paris not to press the Tuzla-Srebrenica plan at  the summit.    Mitterrand refused to specify what kind of action was  envisaged, saying that it was "not usual" to make such  information available for security reasons.    Last August NATO announced it would resort to air strikes to  protect UN troops on the ground and in Moslem safe areas if the  United Nations formally requested it.</p>

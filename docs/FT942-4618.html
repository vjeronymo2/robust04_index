			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Bosnian factions sign accord The warring factions in Bosnia yesterday signed a United Nations-brokered agreement for a one-month nationwide ceasefire and an immediate exchange of all prisoners. The truce is due to come into force at noon local time tomorrow The surprise accord came after Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN's special envoy for ex-Yugoslavia, had said late on Tuesday that it would take 'a miracle' to get a deal. While yesterday's pact falls far short of the four-month truce he had sought at the start of talks on Monday, it was, he said, 'a first step' towards a complete cessation of hostilities. The two sides have agreed to refrain from 'any offensive military operations or other provocative actions'. Unlike in the original UN plan, there is no provision for pulling back heavy weapons from the frontlines or for the separation of forces by UN troops. Instead, the UN Protection Force (Unprofor) will merely 'monitor' the ceasefire. The pact represents a moral victory for the mainly Moslem Bosnian government, which had pressed for a four-week renewable ceasefire linked to negotiations on a political settlement for Bosnia.</p>

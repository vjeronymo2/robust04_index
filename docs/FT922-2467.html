			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Indigestion in the body politic: Germany is trying to reconcile affluence and sacrifice Arriving in Frankfurt, Germany, there is little to suggest that much is amiss in Europe's biggest industrial democracy. The taxi from the airport is a top-of-the-range BMW 7 series. Poking above the modern skyscrapers that gave the city its nickname of 'Mainhattan' is a pencil-shaped building taller than London's Canary Wharf that is nearly fully let. Department stores lure shoppers with ground-floor displays of gold jewellery and French perfumes rather than racks of modestly priced clothing as in previous years. But Germany is experiencing problems. The recent wage conflict, which ballooned into an 11-day strike of public-service workers, upset the nation's social consensus and damaged its image abroad. The coalition in Bonn is in disarray. The Bundesbank's latest monthly report, published yesterday, shows how unification is much more difficult and costly than expected. Germany has become a land of mixed fortunes. Huge transfer payments from public budgets in the west to consumers in the east have fostered private affluence and administrative despair. While supporting eastern living standards and production, in the west they have resulted in large and growing budget deficits and raised the question of how far Germany is capable of dealing with its problems. A recent visit to Frankfurt, Leipzig, Dresden and Bonn, revealed the contrast between the west Germany of 20 years ago and today's unified country, but it raised more questions than answers. Germany has changed greatly and not just because of unification. Some of the legendary discipline is still apparent, notably in the curious reluctance of people to defy red signals at pedestrian crossings when there is no traffic. But recent tensions, such as the public-sector strike, show how western Germany has ceased to be a model of Stakhanovite effort and highlight its difficulties in reconciling its affluence with the sacrifices required to absorb the new eastern Lander. As always, it is wrong to judge the nation by Bonn, the capital. Bonn, with its peculiar population mix of politicians, bureaucrats, diplomats and journalists, has ever been a hot-bed of rumour and a fertile breeding ground for neuroses. It may be, as some long-resident observers maintain, that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition of right-wing Christian parties and liberal Free Democrats is near collapse after almost 10 years in office. While unsettling, this does not yet spell gloom for the entire country. Indeed, Mr Klaus Friedrich, a senior economist in the Frankfurt headquarters of Dresdner Bank, maintains that foreigners rather than Germans are the ones now falling prey to 'angst' about the state of Germany. Unification has created tensions, and statesmanship is in short supply, he admits. But unification, although a shock, will be successfully managed. 'It is like a python that has swallowed a sheep. It takes time to digest,' he says. A few hundred kilometres to the east, in Dresden - the bank's original home  -gritty determination rather than confidence seems to be the order of the day. 'Things are much worse than we expected,' explains Mr Josef Hoss, who has moved from Bavaria to be head of finance in the city administration. 'But basically we should and can be optimistic. Dresden and Saxony have economic potential despite 40 years as part of east Germany.' But Mr Hoss and his fellow city leaders have to overcome daunting difficulties to realise this potential. Holding up investment are 40,000 claims for restitution or compensation from former property owners in the city and he has only 60 officials to clear the backlog. The monotonous blocks of flats near his office are a constant reminder of the city's sub-standard housing stock. Dresden's infrastructure is inadequate: even a properly managed rubbish dump is lacking. The handicaps facing the old industrial companies of eastern Germany are also great. They have lost their markets in the former Comecon trading area, been savaged by west German competition and obliged to pay wages approaching western levels. Mr Hans-Jurgen Alt, general manager of the Saxon Industry Federation and another recent arrival from the west, says his members' unit wage costs are twice those in the west. Nor, so far, has there been any strong inflow of private investment to upgrade industrial productivity. The Federal Economics Ministry in Bonn complains that corporate investment per head of population in eastern Germany is only 60 per cent of western German levels. The big fear is that the new Lander will eventually share the latest 'British disease' of having a modern and efficient industrial base that is too small to sustain high employment and wealth creation. Infrastructure investment, by contrast, is growing strongly and per head of population is currently 130 per cent of western levels. But financing is a headache. Dresden met just 5 per cent of its financing needs from its own tax base last year compared with 30 to 35 per cent in most western German cities. The collapse of much of the city's industry meant that it gathered only DM39m (Pounds 13.4m) in local business taxes last year. 'Normally I should get between DM440m and DM500m from a city this size,' Mr Hoss says. Revenues are rising slowly. But the former east Germany will depend on transfers from the west for many years. Transfers to the whole of eastern Germany totalled DM140bn in 1991 and could reach DM180bn in 1992. At this rate, the east is absorbing wealth at a faster rate than is being generated by economic growth, says Mr Ulrich Ramm, chief economist of Commerzbank. The logical response should be belt-tightening in the west. But there is little sign so far that this need has been recognised. Indeed, the public-sector workers' strike showed how far Germany's powerful trade unions are from accepting sacrifice. The counterpart to the social peace and consensual industrial relations that characterise the outsiders' view of Germany has been the system's capacity to deliver steadily rising living standards. Any upset in this routine has invariably resulted in a struggle over how to share out the national cake and the recent strike action was no exception to this rule. The unwillingness of west Germans to shoulder the cost of union puzzled and hurt Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor. With hindsight, analysts agree that the government was wrong to create the impression that unification would be cost the taxpayer little or nothing. Some pundits believe the absence so far of solidarity between west and east reflects a more deep-seated problem of generational change, accentuated by the hedonistic nature of western German society. According to Mr Meinhard Miegel, the director of the Institute for Economic and Social Research, a right-of-centre think tank in Bonn: 'You are dealing with a society in western Germany in which ideas of patriotism have been deliberately de-emphasised over many years. It is difficult, therefore, for the government to play the patriotic card and tell west Germans why they must give something up.' But is this picture of a spoilt nation unwilling to cope with unforeseen problems universally applicable? Will German unification act as a running sore on the nation's polity and economy for decades to come? Or will Germany shake off its current malaise and make a success of unification? There are some hopeful pointers: The new Lander are attracting a small but dedicated elite of officials and administrators from the west. People like Messrs Alt and Hoss and Mr Rudiger Thiele, who gave up a senior position in the federal chancellery in Bonn to become state secretary in the Saxony economics ministry, are prepared to put up with less comfortable surroundings and long hours of work to help rebuild eastern Germany. Closer analysis of recent wage settlements suggests the struggle to share the national wealth is becoming less intense. Although high at 5.4 per cent, the public-service workers' settlement was well below earlier demands for double-digit pay increases. The powerful I G Metall union's 21-month deal for 4m engineering workers was notable for including a 3 per cent wage increase covering the final nine months. Although companies in the east face a huge cost burden because the trade unions insist that they must bring their wage levels up to western levels by 1994, there are signs of a more pragmatic approach at local level. Mr Thiele cites the case of M Z Zschopau, a Dresden engineering company, where the local I G Metall branch has agreed that its workers should accept a temporary 10 per cent pay cut on the understanding that they will be paid the money, if and when the company makes a profit. In Saxony, at least, there are hopes that private investment will pick up after a slow start. Some large plants, such as a new Volkswagen works in Zwickau due for completion in 1994, will encourage components suppliers. The region, unlike some other parts of the former east Germany, has a strong industrial tradition with a well-educated and hard-working labour force. While Saxony cannot offer low wages - unlike nearby Poland and Czechoslovakia - it has political and economic stability. Psychologically and financially, much will depend on the ability of the Bonn government to cut its deficits. After two years of fiscal laxity, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, is finalising plans for an austere budget to be announced early in July. By cutting spending sharply the government would show leadership. But such belt-tightening can only succeed if the west German public accepts that unification will mean lower or slower-growing living standards for many years through wage restraint and reduced public spending. Meanwhile, estimates of the time needed to solve the problems of unification grow daily. Optimists now say adjustment could take 10 years. Others, including Mr Miegel, suggest that 20 or 25 years are necessary to bring the new Lander up to western German standards. Chancellor Kohl and his embattled coalition must gain general acceptance of such unpalatable prospects before Germany's next national election in 1994. On the evidence of a recent visit, Germany's ruling class of officials, politicians and businessmen seems in no doubt that the country will ultimately make a success of unification. But so far there are only limited signs that the German public has the necessary patience to see the changes through.</p>

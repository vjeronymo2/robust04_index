			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Jump at Case helps Tenneco climb 67% Tenneco, the diversified US industrial group, recorded a 67 per cent rise in net income in the second quarter. The improvement follows stronger operating earnings from most of its businesses, especially the Case farm machinery business. Mr Dana Mead, chairman and chief executive, predicted 'stronger operating results overall' in the second half of the year. The strength of the US economy and a recovery in Europe, as well as Tenneco's own quality-improvement programme supported this outlook, he said. Case, 29 per cent of whose shares were floated recently, recorded a jump in operating income to Dollars 111m, from Dollars 54m the year before, on revenues up 4 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. The company attributed this advance largely to demand from dealers replenishing their inventories, especially in North America, where production was up 20 per cent. Among other divisions, the biggest profit increases came in packaging, up 47 per cent to Dollars 44m; natural gas, which recorded a rise of 17 per cent to Dollars 89m; and automotive parts, up 11 per cent to Dollars 82m (before a one-off charge of Dollars 5m). The company's packaging operations were helped by the industry-wide increases in containerboard pricing. In addition, Tenneco said it was operating at full capacity in plastic-container products, and was installing new equipment to expand its production by 10 per cent by the end of the year in this area. The natural gas business benefited from a new rate structure, which the company said would even out highs and lows throughout the year. The automotive business, meanwhile, advanced on high new car production in North America.</p>

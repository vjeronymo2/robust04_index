			<p>BFN     [Text] Suthichai Yun, editor-in-chief of THE NATION  Publishing Group, will halt all his political programs on radio  to underscore the "lack of freedom of expression" on the  country's radio stations.    The decision came after the Army Territorial Defense  Department "requested" the publishing group to delete all  political comments from radio FM 96, which was leased to a  private company, PK Advertising Co. and sub-contracted to the  Nation Publishing Group to produce news and commentary programs.    "Since we can't have the freedom to comment freely on the  country's political, military and social affairs, we have  decided to pull out all our commentary programs from the radio  station," he said, adding that non-political programs will be  back on the air today, "to keep our communication channel with  our listeners open and to deliver the vital message that this is  the best we have to offer the public under the circumstances".    Suthichai said he had decided to stop all his radio programs  -- including his morning and evening political talk shows on FM  97 owned by the government-run Public Relations Department --  "to protest against this government's failure to live up to its  promise to respect the people's right to information through  radio". He said radio commentators in Thailand still get  "thinly-veiled threats" for their frank, critical remarks  against government agencies and the military.    "Radio producers and commentators are often threatened with  termination of their contracts if they report or comment frankly  on current affairs. Since government agencies still own and  control all the 400-odd radio stations, they still consider the  frequencies their own mouthpieces. Nobody is allowed to  criticize the government agencies which own those frequencies,"  he said.    "This government has not done anything to return radio  stations to the people. I feel it is time to show how serious  the problem is. I will not resume my radio commentaries until  such time that we have the freedom to express our opinions  frankly, freely and professionally," Suthichai said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon)  published a declaration on the situation on March 29 denouncing  the undisguised nuclear racket and intensified adventurous  aggressive and belligerent moves of the U.S. imperialists and  the South Korean puppets against the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of  National Salvation.    "It is none other than the pro-American traitor Kim Yong-sam  wearing a `civilian' veil that has brought a disaster to the  nation," it said, and went on:    "The nation has to decide on whether it will undergo a war  disaster with Kim Yong-sam left alone or will win peace with him  removed."    The declaration called on all the patriotic people who love  the country and the nation to staunchly join in the nationwide  struggle for overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique.    It further said:    "The nuclear racket kicked up by the United States is a plot  to stifle socialism on the globe from the ideological point of  view, a trick to manage third world countries like slaves with a  whip of the nuclear power from the political point of view and a  scheme to realise its new idea of putting priority to Asia and  `neoglobalism' with our nation as the hostage of a nuclear war  from the strategic point of view."    It called on all the fellow countrymen to rise up in the  nationwide struggle for thwarting the U.S. nuclear racket and  war provocation moves against the North.</p>

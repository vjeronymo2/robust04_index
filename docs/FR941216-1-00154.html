			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The blender shall be electrically bonded throughout. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Blending equipment shall be constructed so oxidizer material is not subjected to pinching, friction, or impact between metal-to-metal surfaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When ammonium perchlorate is blended using powered mechanical equipment, operating personnel shall be protected. Remote control of mechanical blending is advisory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) When powered mechanical methods are used for blending mass-detonating materials (such as REDX or HMX), the operation shall be remotely controlled and personnel protected (See Note 1 to Appendix A to this subpart). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grinding oxidizers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) When impact-type mills are used, there shall be sufficient clearance between stationary and moving parts to prevent metal-to-metal contact. Clearances shall be checked as often as needed to ensure they are adequate. Mill bearings should be wind swept (purged) to prevent contamination. Impact-type grinders shall not be used for mass-detoning materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Oxidizer feed materials shall be passed through a screen mesh with openings no greater than the clearance between hammer and plate. Screen mesh size for ammonium nitrate should be the smallest that allows free flow of the prills. Magnetic separations shall be used if screening is not possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Use only compatible lubricants in grinding equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Heat sensitive devices should be installed on the bearing housing of grinding and conditioning equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Determine the cleaning cycle and method used for grinding equipment and include in operating procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Grinding operations should be provided with wet dust-collection systems, where appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Pneumatic grinding operations shall be thoroughly grounded and bonded to provide for electrostatic charge dissipation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preparation of fuel compositions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Sensitivity characteristics of fuel compositions should be determined prior to production mixing operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Establish compatibility of materials. Develop procedures that preclude the formation of highly sensitive compositions or hazardous conditions during processing, such as, dry AP and powdered metal mixtures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Equipment, piping, and vessels used in fuel preparation should be bonded to form a continuous electrical path with each other and to building ground. When metallic powder and flammable liquids are transferred (poured) from one container to another, the containers should be bonded together prior to transfer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Minimize the formation and accumulation of dust in all preparation operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Fume hoods, dust socks, closed systems, and dust/fume vacuum exhaust hoses are to be used, as appropriate, to prevent vapors and dust getting into the operating areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transfer operations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Finely divided powdered ingredients should be transferred by methods that control flow rate and minimize electrostatic charge generation which would result from ``slug'' dumping. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Flammable solvents should be transferred only after the transfer and receiving vessels have been electrically bonded to eliminate electrostatic potential differences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.205  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Mixing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Secure hardware and associated equipment to prevent loose items falling into mixers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Liquids and powders to be added to the mix vessels shall first pass through a screen or orifice with an opening(s) less than the smallest clearance in the mixer. Smaller amounts of material may be added directly, provided a positive means exists to ensure the material does not contain any foreign material. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Materials which cannot be screened and are opaque or not easily inspected should be examined by other means, such as X-ray. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) When consistent with the process system and requirements, a cover shall be placed over the mixer bowl after changing or mixing operations are completed. This is to prevent the accidental introduction of foreign objects into the mixer and also to preclude sunlight impinging directly on the materials in the bowl. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Use only nonsparking devices to scrape down the sides and blades of mixtures by hand. Set up controls to prevent these and other devices from being accidentally introduced into the mixer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Account for all loose tools and equipment before starting or continuing mixing operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Do not allow objects in the mixer operating area (such as jewelry, pens, and coins) that may accidentally be introduced into mixers. Suggest using pocketless coveralls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Direct and unobstructed routes shall be provided for personnel egress from mixer buildings or bays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Personnel shall not attempt to fight propellant fires. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Propellant mixers should be equipped, inside and outside of the mixing vessel, with a high-speed deluge system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

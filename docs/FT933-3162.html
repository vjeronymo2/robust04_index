			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Darty purchase helps Kingfisher to 30% increase KINGFISHER, the retail group that includes Woolworths, B&amp;Q, Comet and Superdrug, showed it was reaping the benefits from its purchase of Darty, France's largest electrical retailer, as it announced a 30.6 per cent interim profit increase. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 rose from Pounds 62.8m to Pounds 82m - towards the upper end of expectations - including a Pounds 16.1m contribution from Darty since the acquisition was completed at the end of May. Excluding Darty, profits increased 8 per cent. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman, warned that retailing in the UK would continue to be highly competitive with increasing pressure on margins. 'But we have seen a somewhat firmer undertone to sales in recent months.' Sir Geoffrey claimed success for Kingfisher's strategy of lowering prices to drive up volume, with retail turnover excluding Darty rising 9.4 per cent and all four UK chains increasing market share. But he said Kingfisher faced a period of volume increases outstripping profits growth, while the group completed the 'virtuous circle' by improving merchandise and service, cutting costs and increasing productivity. The impact of the Mulcahy strategy was clearest at B&amp;Q, which has adopted an 'everyday low prices' campaign for 500 items, accounting for about 20 per cent of sales. Turnover rose 8.5 per cent to Pounds 600m, but profits rose only Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 41.6m. At Superdrug, which has cut prices on some products, sales rose 4.4 per cent to Pounds 290m, with profits unchanged at Pounds 12.8m. Woolworths saw sales rise 12 per cent to Pounds 514m, with profits rising from Pounds 0.8m to Pounds 2.1m, while Comet increased sales 13 per cent to Pounds 210m, and turned a Pounds 0.5m loss into a Pounds 0.7m profit. Chartwell Land, the property arm now focusing on retail property for the Kingfisher group, lifted profits from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 19.5m. The Pounds 16.1m contribution from Darty was in line with expectations, but Sir Geoffrey warned that sales had declined in recent months, and little improvement in the French electricals market was likely until next year. Group turnover, including Pounds 155m at Darty, increased 17.7 per cent to Pounds 1.83bn. Earnings per share rose 18.3 per cent to 10.2p, and the interim dividend was lifted to 4.4p (from 4.2p).

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 1--Significant changes have been  made in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, to pave the way for  banking sector reforms and establishment of private sector  banks. The amendments to the Act were made through an ordinance  promulgated on Monday.    The ceiling on voting rights of a shareholder in a banking  company has been raised from the present 1 per cent to 10 per  cent. This will allow promoters of private sector banks to  exercise voting rights up to 10 per cent.    The Act has been amended to allow splitting of the post of  chairman and managing director. The ordinance provides for a  part-time non-executive chairman. The existing provisions  stipulate that a bank is to be headed by a chairman-cum-managing  director.    Section 16 of the Act has been amended to stipulate that no  banking company incorporated in India shall have as a director  on its board any person who is a director of any other banking  company. The amended section also provides that no banking  company shall have on its board more than three directors who  are directors of companies which among themselves are entitled  to exercise voting rights in excess of 20 per cent of the total  voting rights.    The penalties provided for contravention of the provisions  of  the Act have also been revised upwards so that they have the  necessary deterrent effect. For contraventions or defaults by  persons, the penalty has been raised from Rs 2,000 [rupees] to a  minimum of Rs 50,000, while for banking companies, the penalty  has been increased from Rs 2,000 to a minimum of Rs 5 lakhs.    The promulgation of an ordinance to bring about the changes  in the Act underlines the urgency the government attaches to the  setting up of banks in the private sector. The Reserve Bank of  India has cleared a number of proposals from the private sector  to set up banks. They, however, could not start operation  without the necessary changes in the Act. The demand to raise  the ceiling on voting rights was made by promoters of private  sector banks, including Mr S.P. Hinduja who is one of the  promoters of the proposed Indusind Bank.    The provision to split the post of chairman and managing  director will not only allow the private sector banks with the  flexibility of choosing between the two managerial structures (a  full-time chairman-cum-managing director or a part-time chairman  plus a managing director), but will also enable the government  to bring about a change at the top management of the  nationalised banks.    The finance ministry is reportedly keen on changing the top  heavy structure of the banks to infuse a sense of team work in  the emerging competitive environment. In the case of some of the  nationalised banks, there is virtually no communication between  the chairmen and managing directors and the executive directors.  Feed-back from many executive directors indicates that the chief  executives will often keep them underutilised or keep them away  from important portfolios. The splitting of the post of chairman  and managing director will bring about a system in which the  chairman will be free to concentrate on business strategies and  policy issues, whereas the operational aspects can be looked  after by the managing director.</p>

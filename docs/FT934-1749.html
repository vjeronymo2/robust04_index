			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Building societies urged to merge Medium-size building societies face the choice of merging with each other or being taken over and - probably - eliminated. That is the message of a study published today by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, which says that medium-size building societies need to achieve cost savings and to form their own regional branch networks to enable them to compete more effectively with the banks. The paper highlights the effectiveness of mergers for larger societies, where they take over a small society and close its head office and most branches, over combinations between the largest societies. The paper says that when serious competition from the retail banks intensifies societies will be unable to rely on wider margins to maintain profits at an acceptable level, and will need to cut costs. But while banks can cut branches and transfer business, an individual society will almost certainly not be in that position - in total, societies have only half the number of branches that banks have. Building Societies - Diversification and Cost Cutting to Combat Declining Business. Morgan Grenfell, 23 Gt Winchester St, London, EC2P 2AX. Pounds 75.</p>

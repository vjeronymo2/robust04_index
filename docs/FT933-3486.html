			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Lloyd's may seek market cash to settle writs LLOYD'S OF LONDON may ask the agencies that manage syndicates at the market and brokers who trade there to make financial contributions to help settle long-running litigation involving Names. Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said that Lloyd's 'might well come to the conclusion that the chairman should invite people in the market to contribute to a fund if this made a settlement possible'. Money to settle legal actions involving several thousand Names - the individuals who pledge their wealth to back the market - could also come from two other sources: errors and omissions insurers, which insure agencies against legal awards for negligence, and the Lloyd's central fund, which meets claims when Names are unable to fulfil their obligations. 'If we come to the point where we need some money in addition I'm confident that the chairman will be able to persuade the market that we need their help,' said Mr Middleton, adding that he was now more confident about a settlement than he had been three months ago. Last year efforts to persuade agencies and brokers to contribute to a Pounds 50m hardship fund for stricken Names were unsuccessful. This failure was partially because Lloyd's failed in its efforts to secure charitable status for the proposed scheme. But Mr Middleton said the scheme had failed because 'the old Lloyd's people made public pronouncements before they had done their homework'. Sir Jeremy Morse, former chairman of Lloyds Bank, who heads a Lloyd's panel examining the financial resources available for a settlement, would be involved in any market appeal. Figures published yesterday in Lloyd's guide to corporate membership showed the extent to which the central fund has been stretched by recent claims. At 31 August the amount 'earmarked' from the central fund to meet claims that Names have not yet paid or may be unable to pay amounted to Pounds 1.195bn, briefly in excess of the fund's Pounds 1bn, compared to Pounds 636m at the same time last year and Pounds 200m in 1991. The amount of funds 'earmarked' typically declines as Names meet calls upon them. By the end of last year the amount 'earmarked' had fallen to Pounds 354.9m, for example. Lloyd's has other assets which can be matched against these liabilities. The guide also shows that overall net assets available to the society of Lloyd's have declined in recent years. By the end of 1992 these amounted to Pounds 6.091bn, compared with Pounds 6.537bn at the end of 1991.</p>

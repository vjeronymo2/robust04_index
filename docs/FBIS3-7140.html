Since such collusion and conspiracy is mainly aimed at our  country, they are of an even more dangerous nature.    The United States and Japan are attempting to continually  maintain the Japan-U.S. security treaty--the remnant of the cold  war--on the pretext of instability on the Korean peninsula.    The U.S. and Japanese authorities jointly claimed at the  first Japan-U.S. security consultative meeting held in Tokyo  some time ago that the importance of the Japan-U.S. security  treaty was further heightened following the cold war.    By raving about so-called regional instability, the United  States is maintaining its armed forces deployed in advance areas  in the Asian-Pacific areas including Japan, and is undisguisedly  posing a military threat and pressuring our country.    Allowing the United States access to ports and land for  military bases, Japan even offered to foot maintenance expenses.  Furthermore, Japan welcomed the stationing of U.S. Forces--the  basic factor for regional instability--in Japan, and is  frantically running amok to realize its ambition of becoming a  big military power to expand overseas with the United States on  its back.    The amount of expenses shared by Japan to maintain U.S.  Forces in Japan has increased 40 times since 1978 and reached  $4.6 billion last year. Meanwhile, last year alone, the United  States turned over $9 billion in military equipment required for  the modernization of Japan's Self-Defense Forces.    The United States and Japan undisguisedly strengthened  collusion and conspiratorial relations in an attempt to realize  a theatrical missile defense system. The United States and  Japan are even going to conclude a treaty on mutual adaptability  [sangho yungtongsong] of materials and manpower in order for  Japan to furnish unlimited logistical support to U.S. Forces in  Japan in an emergency, including transportation vessels and  manpower.    The U.S.-Japan military collusion against our country has  entered a very grave phase at a time when the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks has been ruptured. During the period from  mid-February to early March, troops of the 2d Division of the  Northern District Command of Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force  and U.S. Army troops based in the U.S. mainland staged a joint  military exercise on the Kamihurano training ground in Hokkaido,  Japan. The purpose of this training exercise was reportedly to  accelerate preparations for joint operational activities by U.S.  and Japanese troops in the event of an emergency in a cold area  with much snowfall.    Since the United States ruptured DPRK-U.S. talks and  strengthened the military threat to our country, Japan actively  cooperated and joined U.S. maneuvers to crush our republic. As  the United States decided to deploy Patriot missiles to South  Korea and began provocative steps of moving the missiles, Japan,  keeping step with this, openly staged an exercise on 22 March of  mobilizing Patriot missiles on a Japan Air Self-Defense Force  base in Shariki, Aomori Prefecture, in northern Honshu.    Japan will join the United States when the latter provokes a  new war on the Korean peninsula. Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUN  exposes on 23 March the undisguised assertions for taking legal  steps to remove restrictions in incumbent laws in order for  Japan to support U.S. Forces in Japan in the event of a military  clash breaking out on the Korean peninsula.    Japan is attempting to mobilize airplanes and ships of the  Self-Defense Forces into South Korea under the pretext of  evacuating Japanese residents in South Korea in the event that  the United States starts a new war on the Korean peninsula.    Late last year, the Japanese Government already revised its  law on the Self-Defense Forces on the pretext of rescuing  Japanese residents overseas and worked out a policy on  dispatching airplanes of Self-Defense Forces overseas.    U.S. naval ships, including the aircraft carriers Carl  Vinson  and Independence, frigates, and cruisers, are maintaining a  posture of mobilization and deployment to the coast of the  Korean peninsula by using Japanese bases.    Thus, U.S.-Japan military collusion and conspiracy which  places our country as the main target of attack have become more  undisguised.</p>

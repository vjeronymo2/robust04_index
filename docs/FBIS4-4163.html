			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhenhua (3769 2182 5478): "New Changes in </F> Anglo-American Special Relationship"]    [Text] Britain is situated in Europe, but over the years  it has been "emotionally" closer to the other side of the  Atlantic--the United States. In particular, the two countries  forged special ties during and after World War II, thus making  Britain an "exception" to its European partners, which simply  called it the Atlantic faction (as opposed to the European  faction). Since the end of the Cold War, Anglo-American  relations have undergone profound changes along with the changes  in the macroscopic climate. Some people hold that the special  ties between Britain and the United States will "inevitably  disappear," and others even say that the so-called special ties  between the two countries do not exist any longer. Some Western  media said: Ever since Clinton assumed power, the special ties  between Britain and the United States have deteriorated to a  "worrying extent." This is because the Conservatives did not  support Clinton in the U.S. election. Therefore, how should the  changes in Anglo-American relations in the post-Cold War period  be assessed, and what are the reasons for these changes?  <H5>  State Interests At the Roots </H5>   Generally speaking, personal friendships between leaders of  different countries certainly have importance in relations  between the countries concerned. People always equated the  special ties between Britain and the United States with close  wartime cooperation between Churchill and Roosevelt, the  partnership between Macmillan and Eisenhower and Kennedy, and  the close personal relationship between Mrs. Thatcher and  Reagan. Hence, when Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher stepped down and a  generation of people influenced by World War II left the  political arena with Bush, people were very naturally inclined  to think that the special ties between Britain and the United  States "were scaling down." They also predicted that the  special ties "would inevitably disappear." Some British  newspapers played up the event in late 1992 when Major failed to  meet Clinton, then president-elect, during his visit to  Washington, saying that Clinton had deliberately given the cold  shoulder to Major. Similarly, Downing Street officials wanted  Major to receive an invitation to visit the White House on the  eve of the NATO summit, which was held in Brussels earlier this  year. During the Reagan and Bush presidencies, such a visit was  merely routine for the leaders of the two countries to consult  with each other before making decisions on major issues.  However, the United States did not show due respect, and the  White House did not send any invitation to Major. It was  alleged that Major had professed that he could never build close  ties with Clinton.    However, state and national interests are, in the final  analysis, the basis for deciding state relations. Personal  relationships between leaders ultimately hinge on state and  national interests. It is true that a series of conflicts and  frictions have arisen between Britain and the United States  since the advent of the Clinton presidency. In his election  campaign, Clinton proposed dispatching a peace envoy to Northern  Ireland and reconsidering the membership composition of the  Security Council. Britain was very unhappy and doubtful about  this, holding that the former amounted to interference in  Britain's internal affairs and the latter was intended to expand  the permanent membership of the Security Council (with the  accession of Germany and Japan to the council), which would  weaken and undermine its power status (permanent membership of  the Security Council being one of the important symbols which  props up the status of Great Britain). On intervening in the  crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the two countries also  disagreed and argued with each other. Britain was against a  U.S. proposal for NATO's direct intervention in an ethnic  conflict, worrying that this move would endanger the lives of  British soldiers performing humanitarian duties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the United States did not possess  such misgivings as there were no U.S. troops there.    During the Cold War years, it was common for Britain and the  United States to have conflicts and policy differences on some  concrete issues. However, under the then prerequisite of  jointly dealing with the Soviet "threat," the two countries  usually consulted with each other and made appropriate  concessions and compromises to settle conflicts. In general,  Britain avoided openly criticizing U.S. policy, whereas the  United States paid heed to Britain's views and took Britain's  demands and interests into consideration. However, with the end  of the Cold War, the two countries lost their common enemy and  the historical conditions and foundation on which their special  relationship relied. Hence, their conflicts have become  outstanding and the system of consultation has weakened. The  role of Anglo-American relations in the diplomacy of the two  countries is faced with a problem of reorientation. The U.S.  ambassador to Britain frankly admitted that "because of the  changes in Europe and in the world, U.S.-British relations must  obviously change," but the question lies in "whether or not the  United States and Britain still have similar interests. In this  regard, I am not sure."    Have No Alternative But To Face Reality    In recent years, Anglo-American relations have become cooler  and cooler, which is inseparable from the fact that Britain's  international status and influence has declined since the end of  the Cold War. In a certain sense, Britain was a beneficiary of  the Cold War. As one of the major victor countries in World War  II and the second power of the capitalist world during the  initial post-war stage, Britain played an important role, along  with the United States, in the process of forming and developing  the post-war political and economic order. Later, Britain  gradually declined and became a second-class, moderately  developed country. However, it enjoyed certain prerogatives and  superiority in defense in the West and in high-level global  diplomacy under the Cold War situation, particularly due to its  long-standing status as the closest ally of the United States.  Therefore, it could play a larger role and exert greater  influence than its strength allowed and played a certain  mediating role in U.S.-Soviet dialogue, in East-West relations,  and in relations between Europe and the United States. With the  end of the Cold War, Britain's position has been weakened.  Today, a country's international status is directly affected by  its economic strength, and thus, Britain is weak. At present,  Britain's population accounts for 1 percent of the world  population, its GDP accounts for 4 percent, and its volume of  trade accounts for 5 percent. Britain's economic strength ranks  fourth in Europe (after Germany, France, and Italy). In  addition, as NATO becomes less important as a military  organization, Britain's military strength and political  superiority due to its contribution to NATO's defense is  gradually becoming less valuable. In short, at present, the  importance of Britain to U.S. diplomatic and global strategy is  obviously weakening.    A sharp contrast with Britain is Germany. After shaking off  various restrictions and fetters imposed on it under the Cold  War system, Germany has appeared in the international arena as a  leading or dominant power and has superseded Britain as the  United States' key partner for cooperation. In particular, the  drastic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's  disintegration have given Germany much room for maneuver. Now,  the United States treats Britain coldly and sets the focus of  its Europe policy in striving for Germany's support and  cooperation, saying that its relations with Germany is a kind of  leading partnership.    The fact that Anglo-American relations have weakened is also  closely related to the eastward shift of the U.S. diplomatic  focus. As pointed out by certain western scholars, the United  States, in a certain sense, was also a loser in the Cold War.  The Cold War caused a heavy burden to the United States and led  to a relative decline in its power. At present, the United  States is perplexed by domestic economic problems, and it is  gradually shifting its attention and international interests  from Europe to America as well as to the East Asia and Pacific  regions, where rapid economic development is in sight. The  United States has drastically reduced and will continue to cut  its forces stationed in Europe, and its influence in Europe has  already shrunk and will continue to shrink. Meanwhile, the fact  that Britain and the United States are becoming estranged from  each other also reflects the Clinton administration's declining  interest in and attention to Western Europe.  <H5>  Mutual Support Still Counts </H5>   As a European country with a moderate level of strength,  Britain is focussing its key national interests and policies on  Europe. It is irreversibly involved in the process of European  integration. However, the former Great Britain is not willing to  confine its role and influence to Europe. The ruling clique in  Britain will not easily give up its special relationship with  the United States and still wants to rely on residual close ties  with the latter to continue to "punch above its weight" in the  world (a remark made by Douglas Hurd). In fact, special  Anglo-American ties and British's membership of the EC may not  necessarily be incompatible with each other. Close  Anglo-American historical and cultural ties enable it to better  understand the U.S. way of thinking and exert influence on the  United States more easily. On the other hand, Britain is also a  member of the EC and its pragmatic tradition, balanced thinking,  and broad field of vision from a global viewpoint can contribute  to the formation of a united and sound "European choice," thus  playing a certain unique role in coordinating European-American  relations.    It seems that even after the Cold War, the United States  still needs Britain, its faithful ally. Although the United  States won the Cold War, its relative strength has been much  weakened. In order to ensure its leading position in the new  post-Cold War global order, Washington needs the support and  help of its allies. With the disappearance of the Soviet  threat, internal conflicts between Western countries are  becoming outstanding. Some original U.S. allies have, to a  different extent and in different respects, become open or  potential enemies. Under these circumstances, Britain's support  and help seems to be more valuable and important. In the post  Cold War process of readjusting its European policy and its  relations with Europe, the United States obviously needs  Britain's support. Whether the question is about  European-American economic and trade relations or about NATO's  reorganization and restructuring, Britain's position and  attitude is close to that of the United States. When the United  States utilizes the United Nations and other multilateral  organizations to forcibly implement its own concepts of human  rights and values in the name of keeping international peace and  maintaining the new world order, Britain often plays the role of  the most faithful U.S. ally.    However, this writer should point out that as far as the  readjustment of British foreign policy is concerned, close  Anglo- American ties do not only have positive significance and  effects. If such ties are handled well, Britain can definitely  have greater weight and influence in the international arena,  but if they are not handled properly, other European countries  may treat such ties as a "Trojan horse" of the United States,  which will become a constraint on Britain's further integration  into Europe.</p>

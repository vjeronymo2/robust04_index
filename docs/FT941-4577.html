			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Kone to sell cranes business Kone, the Finnish elevators group, is to sell its cranes unit to Industri Kapital, a Scandinavian industrial investment fund, for more than FM600m (Dollars 108.3m). The sale is part of the group's continuing focus on core business, and follows last year's disposal of MacGregor-Navire, the world's leading supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment. The deal will increase Kone's equity-to-assets ratio to around 40 per cent Kone Cranes is a world leader in industrial and ship-to-shore cranes, and has 40 companies in 20 countries. It had sales of FM1.93bn in 1993, up 26 per cent, and its order book rose 12 per cent to FM1.01bn. Industri Kapital is backed by a group of Scandinavian banks, insurance companies and funds, and is already a significant shareholder in a number of Nordic industrial and service companies. Mr Bjorn Saven, Industri Kapital managing director, said Kone Cranes had 'a leading market position in an attractive market niche where we see good potential for further development'. He said the aim was to seek a stock market listing for the unit. Exact terms of the sale will be based on asset values within Kone Cranes when the deal is finalised over the next few weeks.</p>

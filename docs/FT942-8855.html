			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries jump after Fed raises interest rates After a morning of quiet anticipation, US Treasury bonds prices jumped yesterday afternoon on news that the Federal Reserve would lift short-term interest rates by 50 basis points. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 25/32 higher at 87 9/16 , with the yield slipping about 20 basis points to 7.276 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  5/32 at 99 1/4 , to yield 5.894 per cent. In early activity, investors were unwilling to make any fresh commitments as most were convinced the Fed would raise rates again after a meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee in Washington. Although there was a general consensus that a policy move was imminent, there was disagreement among traders over how aggressively the central bank would act. Most believed the discount rate - which the Fed charges on loans to commercial banks - was due for an increase of 50 basis points. In its previous three moves this year, the central bank had left the discount rate unchanged. However, traders were divided on whether the Fed would lift its target for the Federal funds rate - charged by banks on overnight loans to one another  -by 50 or 25 basis points. In each of the previous tightenings, the Fed chose the more timid of the two figures. In the event, it decided on a more aggressive approach, lifting both the discount rate and Fed funds target by 50 basis points, to 3.50 per cent and 4.25 per cent respectively. The market's response was immediate. The moves helped the long end of the yield curve by easing any lingering concern over inflationary pressures. Shorter-term securities benefited as well, because the bold strike appeared to dispel the uncertainty engendered by the Fed's earlier gradualism. The decisiveness of yesterday's move suggested it was the last in the current series. This view was reinforced by the central bank in its announcement of the policy change. 'These actions, combined with the three previous adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993,' it said. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, had said his goal was to shift the bank's policy until it had a 'neutral' impact on the economy. European trading was also overshadowed by the FOMC meeting, leaving most markets to drift sideways in moderate turnover. After tracking German bonds in the morning, French bonds spurted ahead in the afternoon. Some traders said this was caused by late short-covering in the futures pits in expectation of bond-positive news from the Fed. Moreover, investors were switching from Germany into France, said Mr Brian Hilliard, senior international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in London. The June notional French bond future rose 0.34 points to close at 121.10. The June Bund future was down 0.16 points in after-hours trading at 95.67. In Germany, the focus today will be on the Bundesbank's latest allocation of securities repurchase agreements. German money market traders surveyed by MMS International expect the minimum rate to fall by 12 basis points to 5.23 per cent. Trade in the UK government bond market was again quiet ahead of the results of the FOMC meeting and today's UK economic data. The market firmed in afternoon trading, largely on the back of strength in US Treasuries, The June long gilt futures contract was up  5/16 at 105 11/32 in after-hours trading. The Bank of England announcement that its May 25 gilt auction would be of Pounds 2bn of 7.0 per cent 1997 stock, convertible into 9.0 per cent 2012 stock, for the first time on August 6, drew little reaction 'This is a very uncertain issue,' said Mr Don Smith of Midland Global Markets. 'There is no other stock like it in the market, which makes pricing it very difficult.' But analysts said there would be sufficient demand. Today's release of UK average earnings and RPI data coincides with the publication of the minutes of the March meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. 'The avalanche of information could cause quite a choppy time in the markets, especially if there is a pick-up in earnings and inflation, and if there are signs of a disagreement between the chancellor and the governor,' said Mr Smith. The Italian bond market is awaiting today's vote of confidence in the Senate on prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's government. Although his coalition is short of a majority in the Senate, most observers expect him to scrape through. Meanwhile, technical distortions at the long end of the Italian yield curve have created buying opportunities, said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg.</p>

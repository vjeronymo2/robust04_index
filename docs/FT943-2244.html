			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Observer: Pea-soup pop art Stick around long enough and you'll become part of the furniture. Back in 1962 Campbell Soup, the US food group, reacted nervously to the late Andy Warhol's screen prints featuring the company's red-and-white soup cans. 'We didn't know what to make of it. We thought someone was making fun of us,' says Kevin Lowery, Campbell's public affairs chief. That was probably exactly what was happening, but, boy, did it do wonders for brand recognition. So 30-plus years on, Campbell is searching out the next Andy Warhol. Hence an 'Art of Soup' contest in which artists are invited to re-interpret the Campbell soup can. Budding Warhols may work in any medium, including sculpture, video and 'wearables'. Professionals, amateurs and children of 12 and under will be judged separately, and there will be prizes of up to Dollars 10,000 for some. So is this art or just an artful PR stunt? Who cares, so long as it's (internationally) famous for 15 minutes.</p>

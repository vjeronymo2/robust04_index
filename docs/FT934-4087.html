			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Management: The best way to run a company - or not Is total quality management just a passing fad of dubious practical value, or does it improve corporate performance so much that it will become a standard business practice? That is the question posed by the Conference Board, the independent US business policy organisation, in a recent report* which tries to pull together some common threads from 20 studies, many of them previously unpublished. The sources include studies sponsored by the Conference Board itself, as well as management consultants such as Booz Allen and Ernst &amp; Young, and an in-house probe conducted by IBM. Critics argue that TQM might not be as effective as initially thought, or could even be damaging to a company's performance if poorly implemented. The Conference Board study, however, reaches a cautiously optimistic conclusion: 'Most managers at companies using TQM say it does work, but some say it hasn't been very helpful.' In other words, TQM works, but with qualifications. The report says that TQM efforts are still increasing at US companies through techniques that include continuous process improvement, just-in-time manufacturing, teamwork, benchmarking, statistical process control and employee participation. A majority of firms in the studies' samples have started TQM only in the past two years - and industrial companies have adopted it more commonly than service ones. The report says most of the studies suggest that TQM can improve company performance on measures including market share, customer satisfaction, employee performance, process costs, cycle time, profits and return on investment. 'However, they do not show that every company trying TQM methods will quickly achieve progress on each measure.' The Conference Board reckons that a firm's success in adopting TQM is related to the specific combination of techniques it applies. 'For instance, continuous improvement methods (through process innovation) are commonly considered integral to TQM. However, at least one of the studies finds that a majority of TQM practitioners are not using these methods, and that firms using them achieve better results than firms which do not.' The report says that none of the studies 'provides any substantial evidence that TQM is having a negative impact on company performance.' The major concern for companies is whether it will have a neutral or positive effect on the business. That said, the methodologies employed in studying the subject are still fairly limited: most research only collects management impressions. 'The few that focus on lower-level employee perceptions do not always agree with the others. Moreover, response rates tend to be low and there is little in the way of independent measurement of TQM practices.' The debate is not yet over. *Does Quality Work? A Review of Relevant Studies.

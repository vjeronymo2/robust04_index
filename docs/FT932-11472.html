			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / United we stand, divided we fall: Quentin Peel reports on the malaise in Germany after the latest political resignation The trouble with Mr Bjorn Engholm, the dashing and popular leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, is that he never really seemed to want the power which he was supposed to be seeking. He was the man who should have been campaigning furiously to overthrow Mr Helmut Kohl as German chancellor in next year's national elections. His heart was never in it. Instead he has become the most important victim in a series of self-inflicted resignations at the heart of the political establishment. His sudden and extraordinary decision to quit yesterday for an apparently trivial mistake in misleading a parliamentary inquiry five years ago provides graphic confirmation of the malaise affecting the German body politic in the wake of German unification. At a moment when the SPD should be far more popular than the ruling conservative coalition, which is undermined by its own internal squabbles and an acute downturn in the national economy, the resignation has thrown the opposition into disarray. On the one hand, it reflects the struggle for a new identity among social democrats throughout Europe. More than that, it seems to reflect a pervasive pessimism, almost a will for self-destruction, in the whole German political establishment. The same could be said of the strike launched at midnight on Sunday night by thousands of steel and engineering workers in east Germany. They are demanding pay rises which might be expected to force many of their employers into immediate bankruptcy. The only obvious logic behind the engineering workers' campaign for a pay rise of more than 20 per cent is that they are seeking to raise the level at which they can claim unemployment benefit when their firms close down. Less than three years after the process of German unification was launched with heady optimism, the country has slipped into a recessionary gloom which is in danger of becoming self-fulfilling. And yet the facts, both political and economic, do not seem to justify the extent of the pessimism. The last major figure to resign was Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister and candidate for the leader of the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the ruling coalition. He quit in January after admitting signing a letter promoting a product - a plastic safety chip for supermarket trolleys - manufactured by a distant relative. His successor as economics minister, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, says that the economy may now be facing its steepest recession since the second world war. The mood of German industry, as measured by the respected Ifo institute in Munich, has been in virtual free fall since last year. Industrial orders were down 15 per cent in the first two months of the year compared with the same period in 1992, and manufacturing production was down 11 per cent. Retail sales fell nine per cent, and unemployment, both east and west, has topped 3m. The economic gloom has compounded fears that the process of German unification has brought postwar economic prosperity to an end for good. The merchants of doom declare that eastern Germany will be eternally condemned to be an industrial backwater, a German Mezzogiorno, while the western economy will be dragged down by the burden of interminable cash transfers to support it. They fear that the country's structural problems are compounded by a political vacuum at the top, and the disturbing reappearance of the far right in local elections. They even question the reliability of Germany as a bastion of postwar west European democracy. There is gloom at home, and schadenfreude abroad. The truth is that the pessimism is as overstated today as the optimism was in 1990. It is all too simplistic, short-sighted, and ultimately wrong. German democracy is not in danger, and the German economy is fundamentally strong, if muscle-bound. But the country is going through a traumatic period of readjustment. There is a threat that the pervasive gloom could prove self-fulfilling, by extending and aggravating that process of readjustment. First, the recession. It is so sharp precisely because of the artificial boost to the economy which came from unification. Parts of German industry were working at extraordinarily high levels of capacity utilisation (90 per cent and more) in the post-unification boom to cope with domestic demand. The belated effects of the international recession, coinciding with the end of the first east German spending spree, has seemed unnaturally drastic. Clearly that is a temporary problem, although one which has caused a slump in business confidence. The Ifo institute says the pessimism is exaggerated. 'In spite of the extremely precarious situation, one cannot talk of 'the worst recession since the war', or of an 'economic catastrophe', as some people are doing,' it said in its March report. Ifo suggests that recovery could begin even before the end of the year, thanks to a recovery in exports to the US. What of the unification process? Most westerners actively involved in the eastern economy are convinced that the mood is worse than the situation merits. It is a reflection of the trauma of abandoning a monolithic socialist society for divisive capitalist competition. East Germany is today a divided society, primarily defined by who has a job and who is unemployed. Manufacturing industry is what has been devastated. Against that must be put the investment being pumped into rebuilding. Mr Kohl summed it up recently. Between 1990 and 1992 almost DM27bn (Pounds 10.9bn) was spent on rebuilding the transportation system: 5,600km of roads were renewed, 770 bridges rebuilt, 2,200km of railway track relayed, and 650km electrified. Anyone who drives around the so-called 'new federal states' in the east can see both the results: road works in every town and village, sewers and water mains being rebuilt. On top of the transport investment comes Deutsche Telekom. As the largest single investor in the eastern Lander, it spent DM11bn on capital investments in the east last year, and will do the same again in 1993: DM5bn went to east German manufacturers and suppliers. Then there is the housing programme. The government has doubled - from DM30bn to DM60bn - the amount that can be borrowed to finance modernisation of the decrepit east German housing stock. It will, Mr Kohl believes, become 'the locomotive for the upswing in the east'. Such huge sums of money are having a knock-on effect. Small service operators - plumbers, electricians, painters and paint-suppliers, small builders and decorators - are springing up in every small town and village. Their activities are slow to show up in the statistics, especially when the statistical base is still suspect. But they are making a visible contribution. The great worry about east German industry is that the high wages demanded to catch up with the west will discourage big investors. Mr Lothar Spath, former prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, the most prosperous state in the west, and now chief executive of Jenoptik, the laser-electronics arm of what used to be Carl Zeiss Jena, is convinced the problem is not insuperable. 'It is too late to keep our wages down,' he says. 'So we must become a high-technology, capital-intensive economy instead.' At Jenoptik, he has scrapped every product the company makes but one - a laser machine making semiconductors for the former Soviet military - and is reorienting the company to identify competitive products for western markets. The combination of a modernised infrastructure, investment in the most up-to-date manufacturing plant (such as the Opel factory at Eisenach) and a workforce which is, by all accounts, more flexible and adaptable than in the west, suggest that recovery in the east may come more swiftly than expected. The more intractable challenge may prove to be reforming the western economy. Mr Rexrodt may believe the recession is steep. But he is not a pessimist. Rather, he is convinced that painful structural changes in Germany are now possible. He is planning to produce a package of measures for reform by the autumn, to make Standort Deutschland - Germany as an investment location - attractive once more. 'It is not just a question of wages policy,' he says. 'It is much more. Our socio-political structures need to be changed.' He spells out a series of areas for reform: reduced enterprise taxation; better promotion of R&amp;D; more flexible labour practices; promotion of technical education vs academic disciplines; a reliable energy policy, including nuclear energy; accelerated privatisation of railways, roads and telecommunications. Last month, Mr Kohl announced plans for a national conference on the educational system: 'We are a country where the pensioners get ever younger, and the students get ever older,' he told the Bundestag. 'We have ever shorter working lives, ever shorter working weeks, and ever longer holidays: our competitiveness is in danger. 'A successful industrial nation which hopes to have a future cannot afford to become little more than a collective amusement park.' The question is can he, or Mr Rexrodt, deliver? For the Kohl coalition stands accused of failing to provide leadership, failing to take tough decisions on economic reform, and falling back on easy compromises. That is the background against which Mr Engholm has decided to quit. He was, it must be said, a confirmed pessimist himself: both over the process of German unification, and over the medium-term prospects for the German economy. But he has also been a committed player in the game of German consensus politics, like Mr Kohl himself. Both leaders showed that they could do business when they succeeded before Easter in negotiating a 'solidarity pact' to help revive the east German economy. The deal has been criticised for its failure to reduce government spending enough in the wealthy west to finance the subsidies to the east: too much will come from borrowing, and too little from savings. Yet the importance of the deal was its political message: that both sides of the political establishment, along with employers and trade unions, and the powerful German Lander, were prepared to bury their differences in the interests of national unification. It was a result greeted with obvious enthusiasm and relief by both Mr Kohl and Mr Engholm. The SPD leader had also shown a willingness to seek consensus solutions on other key issues, like the control of the flood of asylum-seekers and would-be immigrants from eastern Europe, and the use of German soldiers in international peace-keeping operations. On those issues, he faced constant criticism from within his own party ranks. His failure to persuade the party to seek and hold the centre ground in German politics was almost certainly a reason for his decision to quit. The question now is whether Mr Engholm's departure from the political scene, and the disarray it has left behind, will undermine the tentative cross-party consensus on unification. Any successor - such as Mr Gerhard Schroder, the current premier of Lower Saxony - will be tempted to opt for confrontation. What is certain is that it leaves Chancellor Kohl without a serious challenger, either in his own party, or in the opposition. It is an ironic position for a man whose popularity is supposed to be at an all-time low. On the other hand, it may be a just reward for a man who has steadfastly refused to be a pessimist in politics.</p>

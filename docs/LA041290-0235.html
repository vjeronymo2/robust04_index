			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OAKLAND'S MIKE NORRIS GETS AN 'A' FROM FANS FOR COMEBACK EFFORT  </P> <P> Mike Norris was never speechless before, and seven years later he had plenty to  say about his return to the major leagues.  </P> <P> "I just can't say enough about the fans and that ovation," said Norris, who was  granted a thunderous ovation by the Oakland Coliseum fans Wednesday when he  pitched two scoreless innings in the Athletics' 3-0 loss to the Minnesota  Twins.  </P> <P> Norris, recovering from arm injuries and cocaine addiction that forced him out  of baseball for three years, made his first major league appearance since Aug.  6, 1983.  </P> <P> "The most incredible thing I've ever experienced," Norris said of the welcome.  "Better than the 22 games, the first year in the majors . . . better than all  of it."  </P> <P> Norris, 35, says his battle against drugs is over and professes to be a devout  Christian. Now he's fighting emotion.  </P> <P> "What I'm battling right now is just an immense amount of adrenalin," he said.  "I'm just pumped up tremendously. I had to go into the bathroom after the first  inning and just thank the Lord for giving me this chance."  </P> <P> Norris was 22-9 with a 2.53 ERA for Oakland in 1980 and 12-9 in the  strike-shortened 1981 season, but went 11-16 over the next two seasons, slowed  by an assortment of injuries and addictions. He spent the 1984 season disabled,  tried brief minor-league comebacks in '85 and '86, then left baseball seemingly  for good until deciding on one more comeback try last season.  </P> <P> Norris was 6-6 with a 3.18 ERA for the A's AAA Tacoma farm in 1989, good enough  numbers to put him on the A's 40-man roster for 1990. And even though the A's  must trim the rosters soon, Manager Tony La Russa says Norris will have every  opportunity to stay.  </P> <P> "The need for pitching is so important, so Norris will be here," La Russa said.  "He has a lot of composure, plus a lot of different pitches. He'll help us. He  won't be affected by numbers as long as he plays."  </P> <P> Norris, whose last relief stint was in 1979, says he'll accept a relief role  with the A's.  </P> <P> "Just to be one of the 24 or 25 guys on the best ballclub in baseball means a  lot to me," he said.  </P> <P> Most teams have only a handful of veterans who remember Norris' style of  pitching. The Twins were the last major league team Norris faced.  </P> <P> "I saw Gary Gaetti going around the bench and telling guys about my screwball,"  Norris said. "But I still feel like I can get them out, even if they know it's  coming."  </P> <P> Kent Hrbek, the other Twin who previously faced Norris, said he didn't remember  much about him.  </P> <P> "I'm not a guy who believes in second chances like that," Hrbek said, "but it's  nice to see guys who can come back."  </P> <P> Norris knows that his new opportunity may come under scrutiny, but he's on a  staff that may be the best in baseball for reviving once-forgotten pitchers.  The A's signed Dave Stewart and Dennis Eckersley after each was given an  outright release by his former team.  </P> <P> "No one's forgotten me here," Norris said. "Why keep hurting a guy for what he  did five, six years ago? The Lord forgives us, so why can't people?"  </P></p>

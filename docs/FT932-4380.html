			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Warm welcome for two UK corporate deals TWO prime UK corporate borrowers tapped the Euro-sterling bond market yesterday, while a range of issues in other currencies kept dealers busy. New issues from British Gas and Marks &amp; Spencer totalling Pounds 400m met strong demand from investors. British Gas' Pounds 250m 15-year deal met surprisingly strong demand from European and Far-Eastern investors, who normally do not buy paper maturing in more than 10-years. Longer-dated sterling bonds are normally the preserve of UK pension fund managers and insurance companies. However, the positive yield curve in the sterling bond market, coupled with low yields in most other markets, has encouraged overseas investors to extend maturity. The deal, arranged by Samuel Montagu and Salomon Brothers, was priced to yield 30 basis points over the 9 per cent gilt due 2008. British Gas said the pricing represented 'the tightest spread and the longest maturity' that the company had achieved on a Euro-sterling issue. Strong demand from a broad range of investors helped the spread to tighten to 28 basis points at the end of trading yesterday. Although British Gas is now rated AA2 by Moody's and AA+ by Standard &amp; Poors, after losing AAA status, the name is still regarded favourably, partly because it is a utility. The launch spread of 30 basis points offered a pick-up over existing 15-year deals for the Gefco, the UK export agency trading at 20 basis points over the comparable gilt and KFW, the German development agency, at a spread of 16 basis points. Marks and Spencer's Pounds 150m five-and-a-half year issue also met strong demand, attracting both institutional and retail investors. At a yield spread of 25 basis points over the comparable gilt - though the extra six-months maturity provides an additional saving for the borrower - the issue was not priced particularly generously. However investors are prepared to pay a premium for the name, because of its rarity value. The proceeds are swapped into floating-rate sterling and will be used to refinance a five-year issue launched in 1988 - the company's last foray into the sterling sector. The spread tightened slightly to 23 basis points, according to lead manager S. G. Warburg. Elsewhere, a handful of dollar issues emerged, including a Dollars 500m issue for KFW International, arranged by Deutsche Bank. The City of Kobe's long-rumoured 10-year deal also emerged. In the floating-rate note market, Italy added a further Dollars 500m to Monday's Dollars 1.5bn issue, while the Bank of China launched its expected Dollars 200m five-year deal via CSFB.</p>

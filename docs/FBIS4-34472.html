			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Affairs Column" by Dora Kramer: "Franco's Group </F> Withdraws From PSDB Campaign"]    [Text] The much-ballyhooed incorporation last week of  Telerj [Rio de Janeiro Telephone Company] President Jose de  Castro into Fernando Henrique Cardoso's campaign was canceled on  Friday [10 June]. Civilian Household Minister Henrique  Hargreaves has also decided to maintain a prudent distance.  Hargreaves, Castro, and Itamar Franco are disheartened by the  campaign committee. On 9 June the president complained to  Cardoso over the phone. This happened just as Vox Populi polls  are showing that government support is helping the PSDB  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidacy.    The palace group is upset over the treatment it has received  from some members of the Brasilia electoral committee and feels  its efforts to curb the wave of dissatisfaction have not been  duly recognized. Hargreaves said: "I am a minister of the  Itamar Franco government, and I am not campaigning for anyone,  although I may consider Cardoso the best candidate and will help  him individually, but not as member of the government." Over  the past few weeks Hargreaves has traveled around Brazil. He  has confessed that those trips have worn him out.    He went to Bahia, Sao Paulo, and Para in an effort to  politically adjust some tremors which were beginning to  undermine the foundations of the alliance, namely the PFL  [Liberal Front Party]. Hargreaves has also been trying to stop  the exodus of a group of PFL senators who, as holders of a large  number of votes, consider inadmissible the way they are being  treated by the top PSDB leadership.    These senators feel neglected, overlooked, and rejected; not  just from the campaign but from the central decisions as well.  Many are considering giving up Cardoso's campaign, especially  because they feel better treated by the entourage surrounding  Leonel Brizola or Orestes Quercia than by the PSDB group. Over  the past few days Hargreaves has been seeking appeasement. So  far no one knows if he was successful or not. Last Friday Jose  de Castro was getting ready for a similar task.    Over the weekend, however, a private conversation was held  at  Planalto Palace among these and other personalities who  reassessed the implicit inclusion into the campaign of some  top-level people. They decided it would not be prudent,  especially because they interpreted some signs they did not  like. They felt within the already organized command there is  the impression the new group could cause the loss of authority,  changes in direction, and changes in the established goals.    Although Pimenta da Veiga, Cardoso's political coordinator,  has repeated lately that he does not dispute the "monopoly of  victory" and will respect any suggestion, the palace group and  former Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] do not  fully believe it. Thus, they decided to remain, but at a  distance. ACM clearly told Hargreaves: "I have many votes to  contribute. What I do not have is the youth to fight for a  post, command, or power in the electoral campaign."    Hargreaves and Jose de Castro share the same idea. They will  continue to work for Cardoso, mainly because he is the candidate  preferred by them and by Franco, but they do not want any  further intimacy with the campaign central committee. They feel  the committee lacks the humility to recognize who controls the  largest share of votes (the PFL), while there is too much  self-sufficiency.    Officially, however, the Planalto Palace will not give any  explicit explanation for the withdrawal of its troops. It will  not give, if there is no demand, any explanation. Nevertheless,  the ministers are still working on the campaign and the  government is working hard for its candidate.    If anyone is really interested in learning the reason for  the  absence of the palace group from the daily activity of those who  seek to elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso, quick answers are  available. Jose de Castro will say problems within Telebras  [Brazilian Telecommunications, Inc.] keep him busy at the Telerj  presidency, while Hargreaves will argue that he never worked for  any committee. He will remain where he has always been,  discreetly, at the Civilian Household.    Cardoso is aware of the uneasiness. He did as he did with  Franco last week; he phoned as soon as he learned that the  president was upset because the candidate was not looking for  him, was not asking for political counsels, and was no longer  visiting the Planalto Palace. It is quite possible that this  week he will contact the palace-committee circle to calm down  the most excited spirits. If he does not do so, serious rifts  may be expected very soon.</p>

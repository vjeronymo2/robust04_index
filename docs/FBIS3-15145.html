In his view, the procrastination is not to the benefit of  the  Belarussian economy because the plants have started to "hold  back" to Russian rubles and default on fuel payment. In the  meantime, he said, union opponents on both sides have launched a  debate on how "one state is trying to cheat the other."</p>

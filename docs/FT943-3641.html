			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Forte expected to beat Accor for Meridien hotels chain Forte, the UK hotels and restaurants group, is favoured to win its long-running battle with Accor of France to gain control of Meridien, the luxury hotels chain owned by Air France. The state-owned airline is expected to make an announcement on Wednesday. Hotel industry observers in London, however, were cautioning yesterday against excessive optimism on Forte's behalf. They note that Accor used its political influence in France to postpone a Forte victory before. Accor lobbyists are believed to have stepped up their activities over the past few days, arguing for the chain to remain in French hands. 'We know they're going like fury,' one UK industry observer said yesterday. Air France declined to comment on the sale of a controlling stake in Meridien ahead of Wednesday's board meeting. But officials confirmed that a decision had been taken based on the size of the relative offers. Forte's offer values the hotel chain chain at FFr1.9bn while Accor's offer is thought to value the company at FFr1.7bn. Both offers represent an increase of FFr100m since the bids were first tabled in April. A decision on the bids was delayed, after Accor lobbied the centre-right government of French prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur. Finance for Accor's offer is being provided by Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal of Saudi Arabia. It is understood that the eventual winner's bid would be reduced if Meridien lost a significant number of hotel management contracts as a result of a change of ownership. Air France, which is seeking to reduce its debt burden is expected to sell the majority of its 57 per cent stake in the hotels chain. The European Commission has ordered the completion of the sale by the end of this year as a condition for a French state capital injection of FFr20bn for the lossmaking airline. Meridien's management has expressed its preference for the bid from Forte. But some unions at the hotel chain are opposed to the sale and are planning a demonstration at Air France today in protest at the move. The Meridien group, which comprises 58 hotels, fell into loss last year. The company blamed the losses, which totalled FFr29.7m, on difficult market conditions, particularly in its French operations.</p>

The present round of a regular exchange of opinions, which is  taking place with the participation of the representatives of  both the executive and the legislative powers, followed the  talks between the Russian foreign minister and Cypriot Foreign  Minister Alexandros Mikhailidhis, who visited Moscow during the  first 10 days of June.

Moscow and Nicosia have a similar  point of view on many international problems. The head of the  Russian diplomacy said, in particular, that they were going to  continue providing assistance in the settlement of the Cypriot  problem. In this instance, he said, the parties had a chance to  compare their views and found out that their actions were  similar.    Galina Sidorova, political adviser of the Russian minister,  said to journalists that Nicosia acknowledged Moscow's positive  role in the Cypriot settlement once again during the talks. One  of the topics of conversation was a report prepared by the  secretary general of the United Nations, which spells out all  the aspects of the problem and proposes a plan of action that  the world community could take in this matter.    According to her, Nicosia has taken a positive stance with  regard to Russia's joining the Council of Europe. Beginning in  November, Cyprus will be chairing the foreign ministers  committee of the Council of Europe, and our partners have  stressed their determination to facilitate this process.</p>

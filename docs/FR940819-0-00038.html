			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Split Specimen Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Split specimen testing, which is expressly required under the Act, is a procedure under which an original urine specimen is divided into two containers, each of which is sealed, labeled, and maintained separately. If the primary specimen tests positive, the split or secondary specimen can be tested to ensure that the confirmed positive was not caused by error or tampering. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, DOT has revised its procedural rule to require split specimen testing for all drug testing performed under the auspices of the FAA antidrug rule (and those of the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration). Consistent with the provisions of the DOT rule, this final rule provides that split specimen testing is in lieu of the right to request a retest of the original specimen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters objected to the split specimen testing requirement as unnecessary and unduly burdensome. These commenters stated that split specimen provisions should not be included in the final rule. The FAA is constrained by the requirements of the Act and must provide for split specimen testing. All aviation entities with FAA-approved antidrug programs must therefore ensure that they have split specimen testing provisions in place by August 15, 1994, including providing appropriate amendments to their antidrug program plans to the FAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both the Act and the DOT's revised rule provide that an employee is entitled to split specimen testing if the employee requests such testing within 3 days of receiving notice of the positive drug test result, and this final rule incorporates an analogous provision. The NPRM proposed that the request must be in writing. Commenters noted that the requirement for a written request conflicts with the limited time available during which to make the request to have a split specimen tested. The FAA has deleted the proposed requirement that an employee request the split specimen test in writing. The final rule also revises the provision regarding MRO verification of the primary specimen. The NPRM proposed that the MRO ``may'' proceed with verification pending receipt of the split specimen test result. Although this language was permissive, it was not the intent of the FAA that verification could be delayed solely based on an employee's request for a split specimen test. Rather, the provision was intended to recognize that factors other than the request for the split specimen analysis could affect the verification process. The final rule makes the intent of the FAA explicit. Finally, the rule provides that no employer or agency action is stayed during the request period or while waiting for a split specimen test result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Clarifying Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Rule Language  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

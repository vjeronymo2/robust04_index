			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: DTI concerned over USM THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is throwing its weight behind efforts to ensure that the planned closure of the Unlisted Securities Market does not leave London without a market for smaller stocks. Baroness Denton, the minister responsible for small businesses, is understood to be planning to meet City experts to discuss her concern at the impact of the USM's closure. While recognising that the recession has hit the USM hard, she is thought to believe a longer-term view of the market's value should be taken. She is understood to sympathise with fears that the lack of a junior market could force owners of small companies to sell out entirely to realise funds tied up in the businesses. But no government money is thought to be available to ensure a market for smaller companies survives. The Stock Exchange, which intends to open an 'identifiable smaller companies sector' on the Official List, has recommended shutting the USM at the end of 1995. But a final decision is not due until later this month. It has pledged to take into account comments received before today. If the closure goes ahead, no new issues will be allowed on the USM after June 30. The government's position on the closure is complicated by last year's transfer of responsibility for regulating financial markets and non-bank financial services to the Treasury from the department of trade and industry. In the Treasury's view, it is up to the Stock Exchange to decide whether or not it wants to operate a second market. Officials emphasised, however, that anyone meeting regulatory requirements can operate such a market if the Stock Exchange does shut the USM. Since the Stock Exchange authorities signalled the demise of the USM last December, a groundswell of opinion in favour of keeping a junior market has developed. The City Group for Smaller Companies is urging the exchange to delay closure pending proposals for an alternative market with separate governance.</p>

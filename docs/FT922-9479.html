			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Radical schools syllabus based on opting out - Education AFTER FOUR years of radical but piecemeal tinkering, the government intends in the coming session to enshrine in legislation its blueprint for state schools in the 21st century. A white paper will be published before the summer, with legislation soon after. The regime for schools that have opted out of local education authority control will be the white paper's main preoccupation. Of the 25,000 state schools in England and Wales, only 217 are currently grant-maintained - funded directly from Whitehall, with their governors enjoying almost unfettered control over their management, budgets and recruitment, subject to fulfilling the national curriculum. A substantial increase in that number is top of the agenda for Mr John Patten, the new education secretary. He wants to see most of England and Wales's 4,000 secondary schools grant-maintained within a few years, and to make inroads into the primary sector, which currently boasts only 34 grant-maintained schools out of 21,000. The Tory election manifesto proposed that primary schools be allowed to opt out in groups - to share management and overhead costs, even budgets. A plan on those lines will doubtless feature in the white paper. It is also likely to include provision for a funding council for grant-maintained schools. The education department believes that if more than 1,000 schools opt out then it will be obliged to introduce some form of funding body. It is estimated that this number may be achieved within two years. However, Mr Patten will not only be concerned with numbers and funding. His white paper will have to address two other crucial issues: the future of local education authorities, shorn of day-to-day control of schools; and the type of education to be provided by grant-maintained schools. Some Tories would like to see local education authorities abolished outright once opting out has achieved a critical mass. Mr Kenneth Clarke, Mr Patten's predecessor, was no fan of local government. Mr Patten may be more sympathetic to retaining a distinct servicing and 'enabling' role for councils in a reformed system. The issue of selection is at the heart of the second aspect. The Tory manifesto pledged to allow grant-maintained schools to introduce selection 'if that is what parents clearly want and it fits in with the wider needs of the local area'. The wording was deliberately vague. Mr Patten will want to avoid the trauma involved in a wholesale return to selection through some newfangled 11-plus exam. Yet he recognises the popularity of grammar schools, particularly in the Tory shires (where most of the remaining 159 are located), and is keen to promote diversity and choice for parents. Extending the idea of 'magnet' schools and city technology colleges, specialising in particular areas of the curriculum, is the most plausible way forward. The Queen's Speech also promised 'to promote vocational training for young people and adults'. Although less divisive politically and requiring no legislation, this is as important an issue as opting out. The first general vocational qualifications - intended to offer a vocational alternative to A-levels for full-time students - are to be piloted over the coming year. Whether a success or failure, the fate of these qualifications may have a profound impact on the shape of post-16 year old education.</p>

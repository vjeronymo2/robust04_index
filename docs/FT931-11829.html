			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Chernobyl victims need Dollars 55bn, says Ukraine VICTIMS of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 required medical aid costing some Dollars 55bn (Pounds 36.4bn), Mr Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine, said in Davos yesterday at the annual World Economic Forum. Around 11m people had fallen victim to the disaster in some way, he said. Estimated health costs came to about Dollars 5,000 per person by international norms. 'To make these people healthy, we need Dollars 55bn.' Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine could not do without nuclear energy. But Chernobyl had become a moral factor for both Ukraine and the international community. Preparations were now under way to make safe a sarcophagus built over the failed reactor in 1986. All three reactors at the Chernobyl site would be shut down by the end of 1993, 'because they are not safe at all'. There have been several accidents at Ukrainian nuclear facilities recently, two at Chernobyl. Two of the Chernobyl reactors are operating at the moment. At other plants, the priority was to modernise operational units and those still under construction. 'We can introduce up to three units a year,' Mr Kravchuk added. 'This is why we are looking for technical and financial assistance from the west.' Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said last night he hoped a new Bank fund launched by the Group of Seven nations to help upgrade nuclear power plants in eastern Europe could be operating by March. According to an expert study, the east European states would need help with 60 nuclear plants, 14 of which should be closed. Mr Attali estimated that the fund would need Dollars 60m for its legal establishment and Dollars 400m to start work. According to Mr Eberhard von Koerber, executive vice-president of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, it was widely recognised that the Dollars 10bn cost of making nuclear power plants in eastern Europe safe would have to be borne largely by the west. But so far, even the Dollars 700m agreed at the G7 Munich summit had not been raised, and 'even when modest funding is arranged, it is blocked by bureaucratic impediments'.</p>

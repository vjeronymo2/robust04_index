			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: US West plans Dollars 610m charge to cover job cuts US WEST, the Denver-based regional telecommunications company, yesterday announced plans to cut 9,000 jobs - 15 per cent of its workforce. The move is part of a modernisation programme to cope with rapidly-growing competition in the previously monopolistic US local telephone industry. It will take a special Dollars 610m after-tax charge against third-quarter earnings. US West, one of the seven regional 'Baby Bell' phone companies, said it would also be the first local US telecommunications group to adopt a new accounting method allowing it to depreciate its plant and equipment more rapidly. The accounting move, which is also a response to growing competition, will involve a third-quarter, one-time, non-cash charge of Dollars 3.2bn after tax. US local telecommunications companies face escalating competition from cable companies, long-distance carriers, and new metropolitan service carriers as the industry gradually converges with television to provide new multi-media inter-active services. Although all local companies have been trimming their workforces and modernising plant to cope with these changes, US West's move is among the most dramatic. The company, which serves 14 states in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific north-west, is to consolidate operating centres in 560 communities into 26 new centres by 1995. The 9,000 jobs, which include 1,000 already announced, will be phased out over the next three years, mostly through lay-offs. US West said it was 'reinventing' many of its internal operations to make itself more responsive to customer demands. For example, customers would be able to get a new phone service in record time. The accounting change involves moving from Financial Accounting Standard 71, which governs regulated industries such as local telecommunications, and requires depreciation of plant and equipment to be set using lives approved by regulators, which tend to be very long. US West will now adopt in its financial reporting shorter, more market-based depreciation lives, though this will not affect the books it keeps for regulatory purposes or phone charges. For example, copper wire will now be depreciated over 15 years rather than 27.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Kabul seeks UN help AFGHAN troops appeared to have advanced yesterday in an offensive against rebels besieging the capital as the government appealed for UN aid for Kabul's beleaguered population, Reuter reports from Islamabad. However, a spokesman for the dissident Hezb-e-Islami said the fighting had reached a stalemate. Pakistan yesterday assured Afghanistan's government that it was not arming guerrillas attacking Kabul. UN officials were trying to arrange the evacuation of about 230 diplomats and their families from Kabul.</p>

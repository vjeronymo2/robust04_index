			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: Stars of American Ballet - Dance STELLAR is, we believe, as stellar does. The 'stars' of American Ballet in Britain on a brief visit, and at Northampton's admirable Derngate Theatre this week, are principals and soloists with American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet, though not quite those originally scheduled. (Admirers of Darci Kistler should note that this wonderful dancer is not with the group). There was something resolutely unstellar about the fare at Tuesday's opening, and even more so about the presentation. A round of applause for the only design element - a silhouette of the New York skyline - is a sure sign that we are in starvation corner, where the rule is black drapes and dreary outfits. The evening was not a happy one. It is, indeed, one of those occasions when you wonder 'Can it get worse?', and the reply from the stage is a determined 'Yes'. The opening Apollo - Robert LaFosse, with Susan Jaffe, Melissa Podcassy, Sandra Brown - was respectable enough, I suppose, but LaFosse is altogether too winning in manner for my taste (the young god as head waiter) and the Muses breezed through their solos without looking very closely at them. This Apollo, and the succeeding Some Assembly Required, a serious, if neurotic, duet by Clark Tippet which ABT showed us a couple of years ago, were the only valid matters of the evening. What followed defied belief, defied the idea of ballet as a serious art, and, I suppose, defied us to start throwing ripe fruit. In Come Unto Me Bruce Padgett, got up like Michael Jackson as Captain Hook, bayed some rock music (of his own confection) while three chaps and a girl trudged through his dances amid dry ice and relentless noise. The men were, I think, trying to develop their pectorals. The girl, with the erotic frenzy characteristic of Olive Oyl, offered herself to the lads. Nonsense reigned. Johann Renvall's version of the Romeo and Juliet balcony pas de deux was cliche-time in Old Verona: everything you have ever seen about two lovers in this situation, and hoped never to sit through again. LaFosse's Spring Break was soaked in dew, as three girls and four men were ecstatic, too youthful, and gorge-risingly cute. The score, by Martin Stock, could have been composed by Mendelssohn's aunt. So could the choreography. The costumes made the dancers look bulgy. The dances made them look foolish. The last moments of this degringolade were concerned with LaFosse's A Salute to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in which five couples dashed inelegantly about while gems from Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin et al, were nailed to the floor in four-square and mushy piano arrangements. The title, is, of course, wrong. It is a salute to Fred Rogers and Ginger Astaire - looking at it, you knew why you'd never heard of them before. And never wanted to again. Stars of American Ballet are at The Derngate Theatre, Northampton, until 4 September.</p>

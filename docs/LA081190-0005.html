			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION OF CONTRACTOR MAY WIDEN  </P> <P> Labor fraud charges filed this week against a Lancaster contractor in  connection with a recent public works project have raised concerns among  Lancaster officials about the contractor's labor practices on five other city  projects.  </P> <P> Lancaster City Atty. David McEwen said Friday that he plans to look into the  possibility of further investigation and other legal options in the wake of the  criminal case filed Wednesday against the owners of Paxin Electric Inc.  </P> <P> "It's something we need to look into," McEwen said. "I would have some concerns  over whether it affects the contractor's ability to perform. I need more facts  on what our legal rights are."  </P> <P> McEwen said it may be legally difficult, and perhaps inappropriate, to suspend  or revoke more than $800,000 in city contracts currently held by Paxin  Electric.  </P> <P> State labor officials have accused company President James Paxin, 38, and his  wife, Brenda, 40, of defrauding employees out of about $170,000 on projects at  Lancaster City Hall and a Santa Clarita park in 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> Lancaster City Councilmen Arnie Rodio and George Root said in interviews Friday  that the criminal charges and previous fines levied against Paxin by state  labor authorities for the same type of offense raise the possibility that  similar wage violations may be occurring on current projects. Rodio said the  city should examine the feasibility of halting Paxin's work on those contracts.  </P> <P> "I don't believe we should judge the guy guilty," Rodio said. But, he added,  "If there's something the city can do, we'll do it . . . He's entitled to a  fair profit, but he's not entitled to make it on the backs of his workers."  </P> <P> The Paxins and their attorney have declined to comment.  </P> <P> Because the city has limited powers of investigation, city officials said, one  possibility would be to ask state labor investigators to determine whether  Paxin is paying state-mandated prevailing wages and if his records are  accurate. The state requires contractors carrying out public works projects to  pay certain wages to workers.  </P> <P> Roger Miller, regional manager of the state Division of Labor Standards  Enforcement, said his office often responds to such requests from public  agencies. And he said there may be further review of other Paxin projects  anyway as part of the criminal case.  </P> <P> The Paxins were charged with conspiracy and misappropriating employee wages on  subcontracting work at Lancaster City Hall and the Santa Clarita Park by paying  workers less than the required wage. James Paxin was also charged with filing  falsified pay sheets on which employees were allegedly forced to document that  they received higher wages than he actually paid them.  </P> <P> Paxin's company was previously fined more than $50,000 for similar violations  of state law, Miller said.  </P> <P> Paxin Electric is working on about $650,000 in electrical subcontracts for the  city, plus a large electrical subcontract on the $8-million Lancaster  Performing Arts Center currently being built by the city.  </P> <P> City officials said they do not know how much Paxin's performing arts center  contract is worth because the general contractor is not required to inform them  of the amount. There was no comment from the project's general contractor,  Cates Construction Inc. of Lancaster. Cates was also the general contractor on  the City Hall project, for which Paxin was charged by the Los Angeles County  district attorney's office this week after a nine-month investigation by the  state labor standards division.  </P> <P> Paxin also was recently awarded a $127,000 contract for wiring a Lancaster  baseball field and recently completed an $82,000 underground wiring project,  both as a general contractor, officials said.  </P> <P> By contrast, Councilman George Theophanis, who described himself as a longtime  friend of Paxin's, said Friday that he sees no need for the city to scrutinize  Paxin's contracts until the criminal case is resolved.  </P> <P> "That ought to be entirely up to the state," Theophanis said. "I have no reason  to believe he's guilty."  </P> <P> Councilman Henry Hearns said that unless a worker comes forward with a specific  complaint, there is little the city can do other than make sure that paperwork  submitted to it by the company is in good order. Mayor William Pursley was on  vacation.  </P></p>

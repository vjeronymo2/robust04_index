			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Visiting top Chinese  legislator Qiao Shi and Mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen today  expressed the hope that the friendly ties between China and  Berlin will further grow.    Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)  Standing Committee, said at a meeting here this morning with  Diepgen that Berlin has established good ties with the Chinese  cities of Shanghai and Beijing. Efforts should be further made  by the two sides to promote such cooperation, he added.    Diepgen said Berlin is willing to make full use of its  advantages to expand its cooperation with China.    The mayor told Qiao that he is scheduled to visit China in  April this year.    Qiao said the forthcoming visit by Diepgen will give new  impetus to the ties between Berlin and the Chinese cities.    Germany is China's largest trading partner in Europe.  Bilateral trade amounted to 6.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1992  and last year it further increased to reach over nine billion  U.S. dollars.    German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to China last November  enabled bilateral ties to enter a new stage.    Both Qiao and Diepgen expressed their confidence in the  growth of ties between the two countries.    Qiao expressed the hope that foreign companies will invest  in  the infrastructure in China's central and western parts, which  are less developed than the coastal areas, so as to facilitate  their balanced economic development.</p>

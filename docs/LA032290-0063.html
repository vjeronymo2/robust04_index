			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE SHUT OUT FOR 9TH TIME  </P> <P> All the numbers weighed in Cal State Northridge's favor Wednesday. All but the  final score, that is.  </P> <P> Despite playing error-free softball and outhitting Minnesota, the Lady Matadors  lost, 1-0, in Pony tournament pool play at Fullerton.  </P> <P> Northridge (14-12), which was shut out for the ninth time this season, stranded  seven baserunners, including four at third. Jeanne Mixon collected two of  CSUN's six hits.  </P> <P> Senior Debbie Dickmann struck out 10 and walked one for Northridge, which plays  Arizona and Toledo today. Minnesota, which improved to 8-12, had four hits.  </P> <P> In another softball game:  </P> <P> Moorpark 9, Pierce 0 -- Robin Thomas (11-2), a freshman right-hander from  Newbury Park High, allowed four hits, struck out eight and walked none, leading  the Raiders to their 43rd consecutive Western State Conference home victory.  </P> <P> Jamie Heggan went three for three and scored four runs for Moorpark (11-4, 4-0  in conference play). Raider Melissa Maples had two hits as did teammate Missy  Cress, the 1989 WSC Most Valuable Player.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Wisconsin-Superior 11-3, The Master's 10-12 -- The Mustangs fell behind early  in both games but erupted late in the second to salvage a nonconference split  at home.  </P> <P> In the first game, Wisconsin-Superior scored five runs in the first inning and  one in each of the succeeding innings. The Mustangs (11-13) used five hits,  three walks and two errors to bat around in the nine-run fifth.  </P> <P> Jeff Cole, Mark MacArthur and Kevin Backes had two hits each in the nightcap,  called after 4 1/2 innings because of darkness.  </P> <P> Chapman 8, Cal Lutheran 1 -- Chapman's Steve Halweg (1-0) struck out five and  held the Kingsmen to five hits in a nonconference game at Chapman.  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Golden West d. Canyons 15-3, 15-8, 15-9 -- Eric Henkels, a freshman from St.  Francis High, led the Cougars (1-13) with seven kills in a South Coast  Conference match at Canyons.  </P></p>

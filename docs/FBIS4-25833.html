			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The Ministries of  Agriculture and Chemical Industry Tuesday [14 June] signed an  agreement on wide-ranging co-operation in developing and  promoting pesticides and chemical fertilizer.    The two ministries will also exchange information on issues  such as the production of pesticides and chemical fertilizer,  the acreage of crops and forecasts for plant diseases and insect  pests, the agreement states.    They will probe new ways and means to scientifically apply  fertilizer and pesticides so as to raise their utilization rate  and reduce production costs.    According to the agreement, they will link the chemical  fertilizer plants and the agricultural sector more closely as  producer and consumer, by facilitating the circulation of  chemical fertilizer and pesticides.    Meanwhile, the two ministries, in co-operation with other  departments, promised to bolster market supervision and  management, and halt the manufacturing and circulation of fake  and low-quality products.    Also stated in the agreement is that the two ministries will  help develop rural and township chemical plants, especially  those in central and western China, and encourage them to  conduct technical exchanges and co-operation with their  state-owned counterparts.    Signed by Liu Jiang and Gu Xiulian, the respective  ministers,  the agreement is sponsored by the State Council, which says it  is conducive to the progress of agriculture and the  agro-chemical industry.    Official statistics show that the use of pesticides has  enabled China to make 30 billion yuan (about 3.4 billion U.S.  dollars) in direct economic benefits every year.    The damage caused by plant diseases and insect pests are  inclined to be heavy this year, and some 210,000 tons of  pesticides are needed nationwide, according to official  forecasts.    An official at the Ministry of Chemical Industry said that  the ministry is now making every possible effort to guarantee  the supply of all sorts of pesticides.</p>

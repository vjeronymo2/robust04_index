			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> IS BEGGING PROTECTED SPEECH OR A BLIGHT ON PUBLIC SPACE?  </P> <P> The homeless plaintiffs argued that begging is a form of speech -- a request  for help. The Metropolitan Transit Authority responded that begging is not  speech at all, but rather an act -- and an offensive one to many subway riders.  Judge Leonard Sand agreed with the beggars:  </P> <P> "The simple request for money by a beggar or panhandler cannot but remind the  passer-by that people in the city live in poverty and often lack the essentials  for survival. Even the beggar sitting in Grand Central Station with a tin cup  at his feet conveys the message that he and others like him are in need. While  often disturbing and sometimes alarmingly graphic, begging is unmistakably  informative and persuasive speech."  </P> <P> Judge Sand cited Supreme Court cases which had concluded that organized  charities which solicit for others do have a First Amendment right to send  their message, and he reasoned that there can be no constitutional distinction  drawn between the more refined entreaties of the professional fund-raiser and  the "more personal, emotionally charged" face-to-face importuning of the subway  beggar.  </P> <P> The judge recognized that begging is disturbing to many citizens. But he  rejected the argument of the Transit Authority that government has the power to  protect its citizens from being forced to confront the cruel reality of  homelessness and poverty. The principal effect of the prohibition against  begging, he said, was to keep "a public problem involving human beings out of  sight and therefore out of mind." Having ruled that beggars have a  constitutional right to ask for help, the judge then went on to offer some  protection to those who are solicited. Obviously, any citizen has a right to  say no to a beggar's plea. The citizen also has a right to be protected from  repeatedly being harassed, accosted, touched or threatened by a beggar -- or  anyone else, for that matter.  </P> <P> The judge made it plain that government does have the power to enact reasonable  rules regulating the manner and locations in which begging may take place.  Indeed, existing criminal statutes already prohibit most of the legally  objectionable aspects of aggressive begging. The problem with the New York  subway regulation was that it was an absolute ban to all begging: It prohibited  even the most polite request directed at the most willing giver.  </P> <P> Judge Sand's decision -- if it is eventually upheld -- may become a Magna Carta  for our poorest citizens. He wrote: "A true test of one's commitment to  constitutional principles is the extent to which recognition is given to the  rights of those in our midst who are the least affluent, least powerful and  least welcome.  </P> <P> It remains to be seen whether the Supreme Court -- which in recent years has  received flunking grades when it comes to protecting the poor and the  disenfranchised -- will understand that freedom of speech includes the right of  the homeless to beg for sustenance on the subway, as surely as it includes the  right of corporate executives to lobby for tax breaks in Congress.  </P></p>

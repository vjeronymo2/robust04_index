			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Provide, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, the personnel and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment needed to perform radiological monitoring and assessment activities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Request supplemental assistance and technical support from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies as needed; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Arrange consultation and support services through appropriate Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to all other entities (e.g., private contractors) with radiological monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions and capabilities, and technical and medical advice on handling radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Transition of Response Coordination Responsibility. The DOE FRMAC Director will work closely with the Senior EPA representative to facilitate a smooth transition of the Federal radiological monitoring and assessment coordination responsibility to EPA at a mutually agreeable time and after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with the States and LFA. The following conditions are intended to be met prior to this transfer:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The immediate emergency condition has been stabilized;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Offsite releases of radioactive material have ceased, and there is little or no potential for further unintentional offsite releases;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The offsite radiological conditions have been characterized and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate consequences have been assessed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) An initial long-range monitoring plan has been developed in conjunction with the affected States and appropriate Federal agencies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) EPA has received adequate assurances from the other Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they will commit the required resources, personnel, and funds for the duration of the Federal response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Prior to assuming responsibility for the FRMAC, EPA will provide resources, including personnel, equipment, and laboratory support (including mobile laboratories), to assist DOE in monitoring radioactivity levels in the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Assume coordination of Federal radiological monitoring and assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities from DOE after the transition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Assist in the development and implementation of a long-term monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Provide nationwide environmental monitoring data from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Radiation Ambient Monitoring Systems for assessing the national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Role of the Lead Federal Agency (LFA).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Approve the release of official Federal offsite monitoring data and assessments to the State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Provide other available radiological monitoring data to the State and to the FRMAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Role of Other Federal Agencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies carrying out responsibilities related to radiological monitoring and assessment during a Federal response also will coordinate their activities with FRMAC. This coordination will not limit the normal working relationship between a Federal agency and its State counterparts nor restrict the flow of information from that agency to the States. The radiological monitoring and assessment responsibilities of the other Federal agencies include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Department of Agriculture (USDA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Inspect meat and meat products, poultry and poultry products, and egg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products identified for interstate and foreign commerce to assure that they are safe for human consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Assist, in conjunction with HHS, in monitoring the production,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing, storage, and distribution of food through the wholesale level to eliminate contaminated product or to reduce the contamination in the product to a safe level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Collect agricultural samples within the Ingestion Exposure Pathway  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emergency Planning Zone. Assist in the evaluation and assessment of data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the impact of the emergency on agriculture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Department of Commerce (DOC). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Prepare operational weather forecasts tailored to support emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Prepare and disseminate predictions of plume trajectories, dispersion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and deposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Archive, as a special collection, the meteorological data from national observing systems applicable to the monitoring and assessment of the response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by O. Padenko from Vladivostok; from the "Pacific </F> Ocean" program]    [Text] Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Kray  administration who has just returned from Moscow, held a news  conference in Vladivostok. He began by rebutting criticism by  the VLADIVOSTOK newspaper, which in an article, accused him of  lobbying for Japanese technology to process nuclear submarine  waste. The newspaper claimed that, unlike the costly equipment  from Japan, our Far East scientists offer a version which is  both cheaper and much more effective.    However, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko emphasized that our equipment  was still at the laboratory stage, while the Japanese technology  has already been tried in industrial applications at every  Japanese nuclear station and could quickly save Maritime Kray  residents from a catastrophic accumulation of nuclear waste.  What is more, the equipment will be installed free of charge.    After this, the governor made the following statement:    [Begin Nazdratenko recording] On the basis of edict No. 54-1  of the Russian Federation State Duma, issued on 11 February  1994, on the legal basis for the election of organs of state  power of federal members of the Russian Federation and of organs  of local self rule, and on guaranteeing the voting rights of  citizens; and in accordance with article No. 5 of decree No.  2265 from the President of the Russian Federation, issued on 22  December 1993, on guarantees of local self rule in the Russian  Federation; and taking into consideration the numerous appeals  by city and rayon administrations, political parties, public  movements, and voters, and the need to search for a means of  social protection for the needy in society; and in coordination  with the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation,  I hereby decree:    1. To transfer the date of elections for the Maritime Kray  Duma and organs of local self rule from 27 March 1994 to 23  October 1994.    2. To recommend to the Election Commission of the Maritime  Kray that it prepare, before 30 April 1994, a proposal to ensure  the implementation of the above-mentioned decree.    3. That Tereshkov, head of the finance department, and  Stepanovich, head of the accounts department, are to direct  funding allocated by the kray administration for conducting the  election campaign to city and rayon administrations to solve  issues of social protection for needy citizens. [end recording]    [Padenko] Then Yevgeniy Nazdratenko answered questions by  journalists on such topics as the scandalous action taken  against Viktor Cherepkov, the mayor of Vladivostok. He denied  reports by several news agencies that claimed the municipality  building was surrounded by OMON [special purpose militia unit]  troops, bonfires and many protesters bearing placards. We  journalists verified this denial personally when we visited the  municipality building immediately after the news conference.  There were no bonfires or demonstrations. The building is  protected by reinforced police units, and the tenth floor, where  the offices of the city administration leadership are located,  are a shambles. Repairs to the offices are being carried out,  they are also being cleaned and furniture is being replaced  because, it seems, the previous leadership did not even keep  their own workplace clean. The new leaders saw the similarity  between this scene and the neglect in the city. The new  authorities, therefore, issued decree No.1 declaring a sanitary  and epidemiological emergency in Vladivostok. It was signed by  Konstantin Tolstoshein, acting head of city administration.  Here is his what he said:    [Begin Tolstoshein recording] We must clean the city before  9 May, in time for the national holiday, the holiday of  veterans, the holiday of victory. Church holidays fall on  approximately the same dates. We simply must tidy the city and  make it look as it should.    The second issue is the work of the city transport  authorities. The way the city transport system works today...    [Padenko, interrupting] ...Free of charge.    [Tolstoshein] Free of charge or not is a secondary issue.  First, it must start working in an orderly fashion. Trains,  trams, and trolley buses must function properly. There is a  problem: The dacha season is about to begin, and electric  trains should be running. After all, not everyone in  Vladivostok has a car, so we have to deal with this issue, too.    Third, there are very few stores in the city that cater to  veterans of World War II, or Afghanistan, Chernobyl victims, or  diabetics; most of them are closed. In other words, we are also  working on this problem. I have met and resolved this issue  with the state reserve, so we will open several additional  stores over the next few days, and we will supply food products  and necessities there at much lower prices.    Fourth, strange as it may seem, the winter is over, and we  are taking care of the city, cleaning and washing it and so on,  but we have already started to prepare for next winter. [end  recording]    [Padenko] A demonstration supporting the ousted mayor was  held yesterday in Vladivostok central square. Even Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy was expected, though he did not fly in.    A commission from Moscow began its work in the kray  administration building. The highest legislative organs are  looking into the Cherepkov affair, and Viktor Ivanovich  [Cherepkov] himself declared a hunger strike in his home.</p>

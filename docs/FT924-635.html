			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Observer: Sacks tax The Swiss may be a bit befuddled after voting for isolation from the rest of Europe in a referendum earlier this month, but they are still Swiss. From January 1 in many communities, new regulations come into effect on the handling of household rubbish, designed mainly to require people to pay directly for rubbish collection. In Zurich, refuse will not be picked up unless it is in specially coloured bags that include the tax in their purchase price. Of course, these are now sold out. In Basle, residents must purchase and stick on each bag a little tax stamp. And woe betide those who fail to do so. 'The local authority is entitled to open bags that do not have a sticker attached to discover the culprits,' a city notice warns. And being a Swiss authority, no doubt it will.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab says job cuts inevitable SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile expects to announce a major package of cost-cutting measures, including heavy redundancies, before the end of this month, due to a sharp deterioration in trading conditions. The group will not confirm Swedish press reports that as many as 2,300 jobs are to go at its Trollhatten plant, nearly a third of the workforce there, but it does not deny that significant job losses are inevitable. Saab, which is jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, reiterated yesterday that it plans to reduce its break-even production level to 70,000 units from the current 100,000. It says sales this year will amount to just 87,000 cars, the same as last year, but well below the 101,000 target it originally set. Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, who took over as chief executive in September, has already promised further rationalisation, on top of the cuts which have already taken place in the last two and half years. The group is heading for a SKr2.2bn (Dollars 370.68m) loss this year - its fourth consecutive year of losses - and is not confident of a return to the black next year. Crucial to its turnround prospects is the timing of the launch of its new model, which it may now try to bring forward to the middle of next year. Earlier this week, fellow Swedish motor vehicle group Volvo announced 4,500 job losses across its car and truck operations and the closure of two of its three Swedish car plants. Like Volvo, Saab has been badly hit by falling sales in its three key markets, the US, UK and Sweden.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Arts: Rattle's Mahler 10 - Royal Festival Hall "Towards the Millennium' has reached second base. The celebration of this century's music dreamed up by Simon Rattle and the late Michael Vyner as a joint venture between the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the London Sinfonietta is this spring exploring the richest of all its decades, from 1911-1920. Rattle and the CBSO opened the London series on Saturday with a concert they had given in Birmingham two nights earlier: Mahler's Tenth Symphony, sketched in 1911 and given in Deryck Cooke's performing version, was coupled with the work that two years later built upon late Mahler in a surreal, expressionist way, the Three Orchestral Pieces by Alban Berg. Rattle's steady progress through the Mahler symphonies took in the Tenth at an early stage; it was the first of the symphonies he recorded (with the Bournemouth SO), and he has continued steadfastly to promote its virtues. His account of Cooke's completion is presented without apology, as a natural and fully achieved part of the canon. There is no over-emphasis of the work's despair; even in the work's most anguished moments Rattle sought out beautiful textures and elegant lines, as if the resignation of the Ninth Symphony had been transmuted into something more positive and consoling. So even the famous climax of the opening movement was made more striking for its unearthly sound quality than its piled-up dissonances, and the repeated drum strokes of the finale seemed less brutal cut-offs than moments of articulation, redirecting the argument as it careered towards its last affirmation. There may be doubts about some aspects of Cooke's version. (Mine are not concerned with the idiom and continuity of the music but with its length: had he lived might not Mahler have tightened the finale in particular?). It was offered here as a rounded and profoundly compassionate musical journey. From seats well forward in the Festival Hall, more than close enough to detect any hint of a loose end or scrambled textures, the Birmingham performance was a marvel of unity. The orchestra's lean, refined string tone appears to gain constantly in expressiveness; the wind playing becomes more and more characterful and secure: the brass in particular had a field day in the Mahler, with vivid, penetrating solos (first horn, trumpet and tuba outstanding). A memorable start, then, to a festival series of immense promise over the next month.</p>

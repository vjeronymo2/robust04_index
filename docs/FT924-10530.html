			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nomura may not aid small brokers NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest broker, yesterday warned that there are tough times ahead for the securities industry and that the company may not have the resources to overhaul all of its ailing affiliated brokers. Mr Yukio Aida, chairman, said Nomura had a tradition of assisting smaller brokers which are affiliated with the company, but 'even Nomura' may be incapable of rescuing these brokers in the present difficult circumstances. 'Some of these affiliates are in bad shape. We are concerned about this. I am apprehensive,' Mr Aida said. His comments followed the release last week of miserable first-half results by Japanese brokers. All 10 of the country's second-tier brokers reported a loss and Nomura itself showed a net loss of Y8.5bn (Dollars 69.67m). Mr Aida said most Japanese securities companies have begun a restructuring necessary for their 'survival', and that Nomura has concentrated on cutting personnel and computer costs. Nomura has close ties with two second-tier brokers, Sanyo Securities and Kokusai Securities, and links with about another 30 smaller brokers. These smaller brokers are more reliant on individual investors, who have withdrawn from the market because of the collapse in share prices and the spate of securities scandals last year. The plight of smaller brokers was highlighted yesterday by a Tokyo Stock Exchange report that its member brokers have suffered their first collective loss. The TSE said its 124 members, including 25 foreign companies, had a combined pre-tax loss of Y177.2bn in the first half, compared with a combined profit of Y7.1bn last year. Those losses would have been much larger if the companies had written off the losses on their securities holdings - in an attempt to encourage the stock market in August, the finance ministry allowed brokers to delay the write-off until the end of the fiscal year in March. Mr Aida said that a government assistance package announced in August had helped the stock market, but the stimulus so far had been a 'bit artificial', and the role the government can play in the market was limited. He said the market had been weighed down by the difficulties of the country's manufacturers, particularly the export-oriented companies, whose profits have been bruised by the appreciation of the yen. However, 'in the longer-term', he said, many of these companies are likely to prosper. As for the securities industry's relationship with the Ministry of Finance, which was severely strained during the scandals last year, Mr Aida said that the links have been restored but that the brokers are now less 'mothered' by the ministry. 'Before last year, the ministry was like a father and a mother. Now it is more of a father. In the past, there was too much of the mother, and now aspects of the mother are disappearing,' he said.</p>

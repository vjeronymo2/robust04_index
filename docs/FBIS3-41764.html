			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: ``Chernobyl Echo''] </F>   [Text] (ITAR-TASS) -- An increase in oncological diseases  of the thyroid gland has been observed among the children  victimized by the Chernobyl catastrophe in rayons of Byelarus.    An increase in cancerous diseases of the thyroid gland after  Chernobyl had been predicted by specialists but for later time  periods. In 10 years before the Chernobyl catastrophe, only 7  cases of thyroid cancer were discovered in children. In 1990  alone, 47 such cases were recorded, and 43 cases were recorded  in the first half of 1993. The overwhelming majority of cases of  disease have occurred in the Gomel Oblast. Ranking second is not  the Mogilev Oblast as might be expected, but rather the Brest  Oblast.    The village of Olmany in the oblast's Stolin Rayon, which  used to be known in Byelarus for its literature thanks to Yakub  Kolas's novel ``Tryasina'' has now become famous for its  ``radiation.'' The level of contamination of the soil with  cesium in this swamp-surrounded small corner is just 1-5  Ci/km[.sup]2[/]; however, the coefficient of radionuclide  transfer into products grown here is extremely high.    Gastrointestinal tract injury has been noted in many  children  of the village of Olmany, and the health of 77 children (of the  250 living here) is in such a threatened state that oncological  diseases are inevitable in several years for them without  preventive medical measures. In 1991 physicians discovered  dangerous changes in the digestive systems of 8.1 percent of  Olmany's children, whereas today every fourth child has such  changes.    Specialists confirm that local residents must either be  resettled or completely switched over to products that are  shipped in. Indeed, even giving the children here regular trips  to Germany, Italy, and summer rest bases in clean rayons to  improve their sanitary conditions will not help them because  after they return home, their health status will return to its  previous level owing to strong irradiation.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Clinton underlines his support for Nafta pact: President calls on US to embrace global economy THE White House yesterday produced an extraordinary display of bipartisanship, pageantry and salesmanship which laid to rest any doubts about President Bill Clinton's commitment to congressional passage of a North American Free Trade Agreement. However, an unexpected twist in Mexico City saw President Carlos Salinas using the same occasion - for the signing of labour, environmental and import surge side agreements - as an opportunity to downplay the deal's importance to the Mexican economy. 'No one will do for Mexico what Mexico does not do for itself,' he said. In Washington, Mr Clinton said his administration would 'make our case as hard and as well as we can,' in support of the pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. 'Nafta will create jobs - good paying jobs. If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't support this agreement.' The US ceremony began with the entrance of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter and Ford walking abreast to the strains of Hail to the Chief. Vice-president Al Gore, the first up to the podium, praised the 'long series of commitments by presidents of both parties' which paved the way for Nafta. He lauded the bipartisan US foreign policy, in place since the second world war, as 'how we won the cold war . . . how we promoted peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.' Mr Clinton ad libbed at length - too much length, so that the three ex-presidents eventually sat down - but he rescued his performance with several moments of real eloquence. Most important, he framed the Nafta debate, in a way that has been previously lacking, as about whether Americans would 'embrace' the changes in the global economy or 'try to resist them and try to preserve the economic structures of yesterday'. The president said workers had become 'vulnerable to fear tactics - that is behind most of the opposition to Nafta'. However, he said, 'when you live in a time of change, the only way to recover your security is to broaden your horizons and to adapt to the change.' Each former president urged support for Nafta. It fell to Mr Jimmy Carter to take on Mr Ross Perot, the billionaire leading opposition to Nafta, as 'a demagogue . . . who has unlimited financial resources' and 'is extremely careless with the truth'. The decline in GNP, which if repeated in the quarter that ends this month would mean the country was officially in recession, will put pressure on the month-old coalition government to increase its plans for a further pump-priming economic package, due to be announced tomorrow. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said yesterday he saw no evidence of imminent recovery. However, he expected further benefits of previous economic stimulus packages to emerge. The Economic Planning Agency, traditionally more optimistic than the central bank, said it still thought there would be recovery in the second half of the current tax year to March. Private sector analysts' forecasts for the full year range widely, from an economic decline to something below last year's 1.5 per cent growth, itself the lowest for 18 years. 'The trade surplus is going up and there is no growth in the short term. Now let's get some policy response,' said Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. The stimulatory measures due tomorrow will be the third such package in the past 16 months, during which the government has allotted nearly Y24,000bn (Dollars 226bn) of public spending. Growth reached 2.3 per cent in the first quarter, holding out the short-lived prospect of a recovery. The previous two spending packages have begun to flow through, as seen in a 5.2 per cent rise in public investment over the previous quarter. Yet this was not enough to offset the continued slide in external demand - down 0.5 per cent, reflecting a fall in exports - and the decline in private consumption, down 0.6 per cent as Japanese spent less on cars, furniture and clothes. Japan's trade surplus widened to Dollars 7.54bn last month, up 7.5 per cent from Dollars 7.02bn in the same month last year. Sluggish domestic demand and the impact of the rising yen on the dollar value of Japan's exports were the main factors. In yen terms, the surplus fell 11.3 per cent over the same period. Japan's surplus with the US, its main trading partner, rose from Dollars 3.13bn to Dollars 3.45bn. This adds to strains with Washington just a few weeks before Mr Morihiro Hosokawa meets US president Bill Clinton for the first time since he became prime minister. A 3.3 per cent annualised rise in August in bankruptcies with liabilities of more than Y10m was also reported by private credit agency, Teikoku Data Bank. This was the first increase in four months; compared with July, company collapses were up 5.6 per cent.</p>

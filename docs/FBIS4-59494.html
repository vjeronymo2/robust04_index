			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, the chief of Hamas' Political  Bureau, has reaffirmed that resisting the occupation is a  strategic option for Hamas until the occupation is defeated and  all Palestinian lands are liberated, primarily Jerusalem, the  capital of Palestine and the land of the prophet's ascension to  heavens and of all holy sites.    In an exclusive statement to AL-MAJD in Beirut, Abu-Marzuq  said military action is a primary means of resistance against  the Israeli occupation. It has been proven that the Israeli  occupation knows no language other than that of force. Take,  for example, the outcome of the negotiations, which began with  the illusion of the "state" and ended up in the farce of  "Gaza-Jericho".    On the Cairo agreement signed recently between 'Arafat and  Rabin, Abu-Marzuq said: It is a farce. This agreement, as its  clauses show, is worse than the Camp David Accords. The points  of this agreement explain the vague Oslo accord in favor of the  Zionist enemy and at the expense of Palestinian, Arab, and  Islamic interests.    Asked by AL-MAJD about the movement's official position on  the agreement and the possibility of dealing with it as a fait  accompli, Abu-Marzuq wondered sarcastically: Can any sane  person accept this agreement or deal with it? Especially since  many of those who support a settlement are now weaseling out of  the agreement and refusing to deal with it.    Abu-Marzuq then said in a very serious tone: This "farcical"  agreement does not commit Hamas and its heroes to anything at  all. We are going ahead with our jihad scheme without paying  heed to what 'Arafat and his tools conclude with the Zionists.    Answering a question about the relationship between Hamas  and  the alliance of the 10 factions, Abu-Marzuq said: We have a  good relationship despite recent reports casting doubt on this  relationship, which will remain pivotal for us.    Abu-Marzuq further stressed that Hamas seeks to develop this  relationship so the alliance can undertake its important jihad  role to defeat the Oslo and Cairo accords, as an indispensable  step before resuming the plan of liberation.    Abu-Marzuq, who had just heard about the unjust Zionist  bombing of the [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]  General Command positions in al-Na'imah, expressed his sympathy  and solidarity with the heroes of the General Command, saying:  We complement each other in the same trench and course.    On Jordan-Hamas ties after the recent problems resulting  from  Israeli threats, Abu-Marzuq said: Our brothers in Jordan know  well that the threats of Rabin and Peres came to distract  attention from Rabin's internal crisis first and from what was  being cooked up between 'Arafat and Peres without the knowledge  of Jordan, Syria, and the Arabs.    Abu-Marzuq asserted that Hamas is keen to preserve Jordan's  security and stability. Jordan is the land of mobilization and  steadfastness and the first line of confrontation against the  enemy occupying the land of Palestine. Abu-Marzuq said he looks  forward to good brotherly and lasting relations with Jordan.    On the fate of the 10 factions that oppose the settlement if  a Syrian-Israeli agreement is reached, Abu-Marzuq said he rules  out the possibility of such agreement in the short run,  considering the solid Syrian position. He stressed, however,  that the major organizational body of Hamas is inside the  occupied territories. Therefore, it remains free from influence  by any Palestinian or Arab agreements.    Commenting on the entry of the Palestinian police force into  Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq said: These forces are from the  sons of the Palestinian people and some of them fought heroic  battles for liberation. Therefore, we will welcome their  presence among the people there as long as they are protecting  the people's security. This position will change if these forces  change their attitude and turn into political forces to suppress  strugglers and opponents from various national and Islamic  political currents and persuasions.</p>

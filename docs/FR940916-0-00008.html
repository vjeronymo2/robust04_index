			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments to 7 CFR part 1468 set forth in this interim rule will not result in any change in the public reporting burden or in the application for payment. Therefore, the information collection requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act are not applicable to the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments are requested with respect to this interim rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations at 7 CFR part 1468 currently set forth the provisions which are used to administer the wool and mohair programs. These programs are authorized by the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 amended the Wool Act by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Requiring the Secretary of Agriculture not to deduct marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading in determining net sales proceeds and national payment rates for shorn wool or mohair; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Revising the payment limitation for wool and mohair producers for the 1995 marketing year from $125,000 to $100,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the Wool Act authorizes the Secretary to deduct a 1 percent assessment from Wool Act payments made to producers during the 1991 and 1992 marketing years. Such authority has not been renewed. Removing the 1 percent assessment will increase producer's Wool Act payments by the 1 percent that was withheld from the 1991 and 1992 marketing year payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not deducting marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading in determining net sales proceeds and national payment rates for shorn wool and mohair will reduce total Wool Act payments by a small amount. Producers who have marketing charges for commissions, coring, and grading will have their payments increased slightly; but the national payment rate will be reduced slightly. This action should encourage more producers to core and grade their wool and mohair to obtain a higher price for their wool or mohair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decrease in the payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year from $125,000 to $100,000 will reduce payments slightly. The persons affected by this change would be larger producers who earn over $100,000 for a marketing year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statutory requirement not to deduct marketing charges for commissions, grading, and coring in determining net sales proceeds requires a change in definitions. All references to ``net sales proceeds'' have been changed to ``net proceeds for payment purposes''. A definition for ``net proceeds for payment purposes'' has been added in &sect;1468.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.3 is amended by adding the definitions for (1) commission; (2) coring; (3) deductible marketing charges; (4) grading; (5) gross proceeds; (6) net proceeds; (7) net proceeds for payment purposes; (8) nondeductible marketing charges; and (9) nonmarketing charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.4 is amended to reduce the payment limitation for the 1995 marketing year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.5 is amended to change the reference to net sales proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.6 is amended to exclude non-deductible marketing charges in determining net proceeds for payment purposes. Section 1468.6 is also amended to change the reference to net sales proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.8 is amended to exclude non-deductible marketing charges in determining net proceeds for payment purposes. Section 1468.8 is also amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds, and to remove the 1 percent assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.10 is amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.13 is amended to change the reference for net sales proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1468.15 is removed to withdraw the provision for assessments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is necessary that this regulation be placed in effect as soon as possible. Since the Omnibus Reconciliation Act amendments went into effect during the 1993 marketing year and assistance in process is being affected by the statutory changes, these changes need to be implemented immediately so as to impact the 1993 and 1994 marketing years. Accordingly, good cause is shown for making this rule effective without prior public notice and comment. Comments will be reviewed after the interim rule is effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1468  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant programs_agriculture, Livestock, Mohair, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Wool.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, 7 CFR part 1468 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

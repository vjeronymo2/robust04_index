			<p>BFN     [Text] On 1 April, a small number of scoundrels incited  some villagers, who were unaware of the truth, to obstruct  public security officers and policemen from arresting two  criminals in Jiachong Town in the Daya Bay Administrative  District of Huizhou City. The villagers stormed the Jiachong  Town Police Station, smashed police equipment, and beat up  police officers and policemen, resulting in a serious incident.    At about 0500 on the morning of 1 April, Jiachong Town  Police  Station under the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau dispatched  about 10 police officers and policemen to Baigang Village to  arrest the criminals Chen Renshan and Chen Yonghui on blackmail  charges. As scheduled, the two criminals were soon rounded up  by the police. However, as the police were taking away the  criminal Chen Renshan, he suddenly shouted: "Help!"  Immediately, Chen Renshan's brothers and sisters-in-law ran  forward with sticks and rocks in their hands. Policeman Liu  Jinxin, who was at the front of the police squad, was hit in the  head by a brick thrown by Chen Renchao, Chen Renshan's elder  brother. Liu Jinxin lost consciousness. The crowd then rescued  Chen Renshan amidst chaos. After rescuing Chen Renshan, Chen  Renchao turned and began chasing and beating the policeman Zhou  Jinbao. Zhou fired a warning shot at once, but failed to stop  Chen. With his life under threat, Zhou again opened fire and hit  Chen Renchao in the leg, thus temporarily bringing the situation  under control.    At about 0900 on the morning of 1 April, Liu Rihua, the  political instructor of Jiachong Town Police Station, set out  for Baigang Village with a team of police officers and policemen  to explain the truth to the villagers. However, on their way to  the village, they were met by a group of villagers armed with  all types of weapons who were heading for Jiachong Town Police  Station to cause trouble. After being persuaded and educated by  the police, some villagers returned to the village. However,  incited by Chen Renshan and some other people, more than 100  villagers still went ahead and reached the police station where  they demanded the immediate release of the criminal Chen  Yonghui. The police then formed a human wall to repel the  crowd. Failing to enter the police station, Chen Renshan  incited the villagers to take down the station's sign board.  The crowd then smashed the sign board and began frenziedly  cuffing and kicking the police officers and policemen. At that  moment, Zhang Xinde, chief of Daya Bay Public Security Bureau,  arrived at the scene with a team of police officers and  policemen. While educating the villagers on the legal system,  the police acted resolutely and arrested Chen Renshan, Chen  Shaowen, Chen Renhua, Chen Huijun, Chen Qiaoning, and some other  ring leaders, thereby putting an end to the incident.    At present, Daya Bay Public Security Bureau is investigating  the incident and is expected to mete out, in accordance with the  law, stern punishment to those principal culprits who brazenly  obstructed public security police officers and policemen from  performing their official duties, incited the masses to storm  the police station, and beat up police officers and policemen.</p>

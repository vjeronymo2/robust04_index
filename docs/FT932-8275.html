			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Gold bugs throw caution to the winds - North American expression of the gold price phenomenon Before the latest spurt in the gold price, many North American analysts were urging investors in gold mining shares to be cautious. Handsome profits could already be taken, and the value of most companies' ore reserves less production costs did not appear to justify the heady level of share prices. That advice has gone unheeded in the past week. The surge in the gold price to almost Dollars 370 an ounce has uncorked yet another buying binge in the stock market. The climb in North American gold shares has far outstripped the bullion price. The Toronto Stock Exchange's gold and silver index spurted ahead by 11.5 per cent last week. At its closing level of 8,234 on Monday, the index had risen by 57 per cent so far this year, and by 67 per cent since the start of 1992. The most popular shares have been those with the highest sensitivity to changes in the bullion price. Echo Bay Mines, whose earnings stand to climb by 50 per cent for each 10 per cent rise in the gold price, jumped CDollars 4.25 last week to CDollars 14.25 in exceptionally heavy trading. Homestake Mining, which has only a slightly lower leverage, has forged ahead in less than a year from USDollars 9.63 to USDollars 17.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. Gold bugs have latched on to a spate of positive signals to justify their bullishness. Mr George Soros, the heavyweight New York investment fund manager, appeared to demonstrate his faith in the yellow metal last month by buying a stake in Newmont Mining from Sir James Goldsmith. The fire was then stoked by Sir James buying a big chunk of gold call options. The bullion price has been propelled further by early signs of an upward blip in the US inflation rate, and by reports that demand for high carat gold jewellery has risen sharply in China and India over the past 18 months. Mr Warren Myers, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, has yet to be convinced that higher inflation - the engine of four of the gold sector's five past bull markets - is imminent. But he has little doubt that technical indicators are pointing to a 'genuine turnround' in the gold market. 'There must be something new brewing which, stupidly, I have not yet seen,' he says. Although caution remains his watchword, Mr Myers is advising clients to hang on to such gold blue chips as American Barrick and Placer Dome. Thanks to the industry's most extensive hedging programme, Barrick is guaranteed a price of at least Dollars 400 an ounce for its entire 1993 and 1994 output. It realised an average price of Dollars 410 an ounce in the first quarter of this year, compared to the Comex average of Dollars 330. Earnings are thus well protected against a possible reversal in the bullion price. Other analysts see little value in current share prices. Mr Barry Allan, at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Toronto, says it may be 'a couple of years' before the bullion price reaches the levels of Dollars 400 an ounce and above now being discounted by the stock market. If the gold price does keep rising, Mr Allan worries that investors may be tempted to switch from equities to the commodity markets. Few would be bold enough to assert that shares have reached a ceiling for the time being. But recent buyers of North American gold mining stocks will probably need a sharp eye, a hard stomach and nimble footwork to ensure a decent return on their investment. Trading on Monday this week demonstrated that the relatively small market in gold mining shares, estimated by one analyst at Dollars 40bn to Dollars 50bn worldwide, can be as volatile coming down as going up. Although the Comex June contract lost only 30 cents to Dollars 368, Toronto's gold and silver index slipped by 1.5 per cent.</p>

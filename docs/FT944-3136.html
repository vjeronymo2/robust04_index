			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Thai minister quits in land row: No-confidence vote avoided Thailand's agriculture minister resigned yesterday, averting a no-confidence motion that could have shaken the government anew just days after the defection of a key party in the ruling coalition, Agencies report from Bangkok. The opposition had planned to call a no-confidence motion today against the minister, Mr Niphon Promphan, and his former deputy, Mr Suthep Thueksuban, because of allegations that Mr Suthep had manipulated a land reform programme to favour rich landowners. Mr Niphon submitted his resignation to Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, to take responsibility for the scandal threatening to taint the government and Mr Chuan's Democrat party. Both Mr Niphon and Mr Suthep, members of the Democrat party, insist they are innocent. Mr Suthep resigned as deputy agriculture minister last week, saying it would allow him to defend his actions without being accused of trying to cling to his position. A no-confidence motion could have opened more divisions in the two-year-old Chuan administration days after it was thrown into crisis by the withdrawal last Friday of the New Aspiration party. The party, the second largest in the coalition, pulled out after siding with the opposition to vote down democratic reforms. On Monday the Chart Pattana (National Development) party agreed to bring its 60 seats to the government, giving the coalition 201 votes in the 360-seat House of Representatives. Mr Chuan's Democrat party will take over the all-important interior ministry in a cabinet reshuffle caused by last week's defection of the coalition partner, party officials said yesterday. Mr Sanan Kachornprasart, now industry minister, will take over the interior portfolio, whose responsibilities include police and local government. The interior post was vacated by General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the New Aspiration party leader, when his party withdrew from the government. Mr Sanan, who is also Democrat party secretary general, said Chart Pattana would get 14 of the 45 government ministry portfolios, including deputy prime minister and junior minister posts.</p>

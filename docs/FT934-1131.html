			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Observer: White hot head basher The brashly ebullient Heinz Schimmelbusch, ousted from his perch at Metallgesellschaft, was always something of an anomaly on the German industrial scene. No surprises, then, that Karl-Josef ('Kajo') Neukirchen, the man installed last Friday as the new chief executive at the troubled company, is cast in a rather different mould. A tough, no-nonsense hatchet-man blessed with film star good looks, Neukirchen's cool reserve presumably appeals rather more to the all-powerful big banks when it comes to sorting out intractable corporate problems. Recessionary times have been good to the 51-year-old company doctor who first made his mark in 1987-88 when he was spirited in to clear up the problems at engineering group Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz. He put the company back on its feet, one in four workers lost their jobs, and he moved on to Hoesch in 1991. There he lasted only until the following summer, as the steelmaker fell victim to rivals Krupp in one of Germany's extremely rare hostile takeovers. But he walked away with a multi-million pay-off. Since then, the physics and business graduate from Bonn has picked up chairmanships of the supervisory boards of both FAG Kugelfischer and the ailing Klockner-Werke. At the former, he has once again demonstrated his willingness to take unpleasant decisions swiftly - nearly half the workers have gone amid one of the most drastic restructurings of 1993. Yesterday he was back in executive mode at Metallgesellschaft's Frankfurt headquarters where the atmosphere must be anything but festive.</p>

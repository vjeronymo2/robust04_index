			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions warned on Labour links row UNION leaders were warned yesterday that they risked damaging the Labour party's reputation by opposing reforms of their links with the party urged by Mr John Smith, its leader, Ralph Atkins writes. As leaders of six of Britain's biggest unions prepared to meet later this week to discuss tactics for opposing the move, Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader, warned that Labour would be 'cruelly handicapped' if it continued to be regarded as being dominated by trade unions. Labour party officials say Mr Smith is braced for a showdown with unions over his plans to introduce one-member-one-vote for the selection and re-selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. The row is expected to come to a head at Labour's conference in October. Ranged against Mr Smith are likely to be the Transport and General Workers' union, the GMB general union, the MSF technicians' union, the UCW communications union and RMT, the rail and seamen's union. Mr Smith may also make the main Labour speech when the Commons debates the principle of the Maastricht treaty's social chapter, probably later this year. Labour party strategists are considering the move as part of an effort to increase the number of high-profile Commons appearances made by the Labour leader. Strategists feel the set-piece Commons speech remains Mr Smith's forte rather than the thrust and counter-thrust of prime minister's questions.</p>

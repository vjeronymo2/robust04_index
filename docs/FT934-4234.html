			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / The Long View: When Scrooge becomes Santa You would have thought Kenneth Clarke had produced a giveaway Budget, to judge from the astonishingly euphoric reactions. In fact he has loaded big new taxes on top of those pre-programmed last March by Norman Lamont. By 1995-96 the two 1993 Budgets will have imposed another Pounds 15bn in taxes, and over the next four years total taxes will rise from 34 to 38 per cent of GDP. So how on earth, in the first pre-Christmas Budget, did such a Scrooge manage to present himself almost in the guise of Santa Claus? Certainly the political presentation was as adroit as Norman Lamont's had been clumsy. In cleaning up the mess left by Lamont's gaffes over VAT on domestic energy Clarke seized an opportunity to appear as the pensioner's friend. He drew back generously from extending the VAT base further. Wretched public sector workers will bear much of the burden, and his tax increases were largely hidden and deferred. Indeed, you do not have to be very cynical to judge that many of the taxes have only been imposed in order to be flamboyantly removed again in the run-up to the next general election. So long, that is, as the economy performs more or less as expected. Above all, this was a Budget for the financial markets. More than ever the markets are being driven by interest rates, which it now appears probable will come down further and stay down. Many institutional fund managers plot their investment strategy on the basis of computer valuation models which say that if long government bond yields fall the equity market must rise, almost in proportion. Because the decline in gilt yields this year has been sharp - more than two percentage points  - the models say share prices are still cheap. But the models may need to be tweaked. It is interesting to look back at the circumstances in which long-dated gilts last yielded the current 6 3/4 per cent, in June 1967. That was a few months ahead of Harold Wilson's devaluation, in the early stages of the long financial deterioration which culminated in gilt yields of 16 per cent in 1974 and inflation of 27 per cent in 1975. In June 1967 German bonds yielded a little more than gilts, at 6.9 per cent. Now, in spite of an intimidating borrowing requirement, German bonds return under 6 per cent. At home, Bank Rate was 5 1/2 per cent, exactly as now. But the valuation of equities looked rather different: the dividend yield on the All-Share Index was 5.2 per cent, compared with today's 3.6 per cent. It follows that investors today are considerably more optimistic about the prospects for growth in profits and dividends than they were in 1967. Do they have reason to be? Before the Budget, the basic policy problem appeared to revolve around the threatened twin deficits - the public sector borrowing requirement and the adverse balance of payments. If you promoted economic growth the PSBR would decline but the trade gap would become much worse, and eventually destabilising. If you restrained domestic demand in order to control the external deficit the PSBR would expand exponentially, potentially becoming unfinanceable. Entirely undaunted, the Treasury has swept such contradictions aside. It blithely assumes that the economy will grow remorselessly at a so-called 'trend' rate of 3 per cent, regardless of the mounting tax burden. As for the trade crisis, this has simply disappeared. The latest trade statistics have miraculously improved (although the quality of the new post-Single Market European Union figures is highly suspect). Invisible earnings have conveniently become more visible. The current account deficit will only be 1 1/2 per cent of GDP next year, instead of 3 per cent. The obvious precedent is the 1981 Howe Budget which orthodox economists predicted would lead to disaster but which paved the way for the growth of the mid-1980s. Higher taxes permitted reductions in interest rates (and a downwards float of sterling too). The Keynesians are a spent force these days but Wynne Godley, king of the doomsters, from his bolthole in America, has pronounced his curse on the Treasury's growth forecasts. Essentially, Kenneth Clarke has completed the reversal of economic strategy following the failure of the UK's flirtation with the European exchange rate mechanism. While in the ERM we were forced to adopt Germany's lax fiscal policy offset by high interest rates. Fiscal policy is now being brutally rebalanced, but interest rates may need to go down to 4 per cent next year to offset the negative impact on the growth of the economy. If the drop in the cost of capital, which the markets have been celebrating this week, gives a boost to investment and output, all will be well. But a re-run of the 1980s cannot provide the answer. That expansion depended far too much on the housing boom, not least on the stimulation from the release of housing equity that rose from Pounds 5bn in 1982 to Pounds 15bn in 1986 and a peak Pounds 22bn in 1988. This mortgage-financed boom not only helped to create the late 1980s inflation but also tipped the economy off balance into excessive consumption. We must not go down this road again. In fact, by progressively reducing tax relief on mortgage interest the government is removing some of the financial fuel for a renewed housing market bubble (although it may need to go further). The question is, however, if we must not depend upon a housing boom to stimulate the British economy, what can we rely on? It is hard not to conclude that the equity market will soon be disappointed by the sluggishness of profits growth. Santa-Scrooge this week took the British economy back through time towards financial stability. With luck, he has laid to rest the inflationary ghost of Christmas past. But for all the stock market's enthusiasm, it is less than clear that he will be able to summon up the expansive spirit of Christmas yet to come.</p>

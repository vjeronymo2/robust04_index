			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Rail sell-off threatens to limit scope of discount fares Rail passengers travelling on cut-price tickets may find themselves paying more for their journeys or facing a reduced service if present plans for discount fares after privatisation are adopted. The full impact of the government's approach to discount fares emerged yesterday after publication by Transport 2000, a pressure group, of details of a leaked internal British Rail document. It described promises that rail companies would honour each other's tickets as 'a bit of a con'. The companies that take over BR's operations will not be obliged to accept discounted tickets issued by other companies, Transport 2000 said. It claimed that eight out of 10 rail tickets sold are discounted Apex, Saver or Supersaver tickets, although BR said it estimated that at most half of rail tickets, excluding season tickets, were discounted. Travellers who buy a discounted return fare might find themselves unable to take the first train home, because it is run by a rival company, or be forced to buy another ticket, Transport 2000 said. 'Customers might turn up at the station to find they cannot catch the next three trains as they are run by another company,' said Mr Barry Doe, a travel consultant. 'I don't think the public will tolerate that.' The office of franchise director, which is in charge of selling off BR's routes, said there had never been any intention to compel the rail operators to recognise each other's discount fares, although they will be expected to accept full-fare and season tickets. Forcing rail companies to accept discount tickets by 'central Diktat' would undermine the process of privatisation and stifle innovation on fares, it added. But it does expect the rail operators to reach mutual agreements to recognise each other's tickets as a way of increasing business. The leaked BR document, written by Mr Michael Beswick, a senior manager, said: 'Anyone with knowledge of the BR fares structure will regard interavailability - being confined to full-fare tickets - as a bit of a con. It is however probably an income-maximising option for the railway industry.' BR confirmed that the document was genuine. Mr Stephen Joseph, Transport 2000 director, said: 'This paper shows that some of our worst fears about rail privatisation are coming true. Many travellers will face backdoor fare increases or will be barred from using some trains. The rail sell-off will make the complex fare structure even more confusing for passengers.' A traveller paying Pounds 59 for a Supersaver ticket from London to Glasgow would have to return with the same railway company or pay a total of Pounds 126 to travel. Transport 2000 plans to ask ministers to have operators agree cheap fares for every route. Sea Containers, a shipping company that has expressed an interest in bidding for the rail franchises, said it expected rail companies to negotiate deals to accept each other's tickets. 'We would want to develop the principle of allowing pensioners and others to travel more cheaply off-peak. The future depends on getting as many people to travel as possible.'

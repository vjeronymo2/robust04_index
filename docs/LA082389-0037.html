			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 BIG FIRMS MAY AVOID ROLLBACKS;  </P> <P> GILLESPIE SAYS LOWER INSURANCE RATES UNLIKELY FOR MOST DRIVERS  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said Tuesday that three of California's  largest auto insurers -- State Farm Mutual, the Farmers group and the  Automobile Club of Southern California -- are among hundreds of companies that  are likely to be exempted from all rollbacks called for under Proposition 103.  </P> <P> The three big companies alone control a third of the California insurance  market.  </P> <P> It is now "a fair prediction that by and large" most Californians are "not  going to get lower auto insurance rates" as a result of the insurance  initiative passed last November, Gillespie said, unless the Legislature adopts  other reforms, such as no-fault insurance.  </P> <P> Although she did not categorically rule out ordering rollbacks for 219  companies, including the three big sellers, she put them on a "slow track"  hearing process she said could take as long as 10 years to complete.  </P> <P> This represented a sharp departure from her earlier promise to make all her  rollback decisions by Nov. 8. She explained Tuesday that there is simply too  much to do by that time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fashioning 'Guidelines'  </P> <P> She said that instead she now hopes to have fashioned "guidelines" by then that  she hopes some companies will voluntarily follow.  </P> <P> Gillespie also conceded Tuesday that the state's least efficient insurers are  most likely to be given exemptions because they operate on a thinner profit  margin, while more efficient companies showing healthier profits are most  likely to be ordered to give the rollbacks.  </P> <P> The Republican commissioner's statements were greeted with outrage by consumer  leaders and Democratic politicians as the political dispute surrounding  insurance issues intensified.  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Ralph Nader declared, "Gillespie has now displayed the fraud  of her office by prejudging the rollbacks before securing and analyzing the  facts. Her attack on the rollback rights of millions of California consumers  assures that she will become a decisive political albatross around the necks of  Republican office seekers next year."  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said, "The snail's pace process announced today  means that the rate rollbacks consumers demanded in Proposition 103 are years  away, if ever . . . California's consumers voted for real insurance reform and  deserve a better deal."  </P> <P> Gillespie announced her actions at a news conference one day before a deadline  for setting hearings or allowing automatic exemptions from the rollbacks.  </P> <P> She said that she is granting Proposition 103 exemptions to 183 small  companies, most of which do less than $20 million in annual California  business. No further proceedings are in prospect for them. They simply do not  have to refund any money to their California customers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Gillespie called hearings for 13 companies and filed an intent to  hold hearings for 34 others. She said she believes these firms ought to be  subject to rollback orders totaling more than $800 million, most of it in other  than auto insurance lines, such as homeowners, commercial and fire.  </P> <P> Among the 13 companies are seven companies Gillespie has tentatively ordered to  give a total of $305 million in rollbacks, subject to hearings. Gillespie said  these companies, including Allstate, Safeco, 20th Century and USAA, are among  the most efficient sellers, which accordingly make higher than normal profits.  </P> <P> The commissioner projected that $815 million in rollbacks will eventually be  ordered, compared to about $4 billion that would have resulted if Proposition  103's call for a 20% rollback of premiums from 1987 levels were fully  implemented.  </P> <P> Gillespie remarked that she has come under fire from investors who note that  the rollback procedure she is following penalizes the more efficient companies.  But, she said, she is circumscribed by a recent state Supreme Court decision  that said companies were entitled to relief if they could show that the  rollbacks would prevent them from earning "a fair rate of return."  </P> <P> Inefficient companies are likely to receive a lower return than efficient ones,  but Gillespie has set a flat 11.2% annual return as the standard she will use  for all companies, ignoring consumer group suggestions that she not give credit  for company inefficiencies.  </P> <P> The other 219 companies that filed for exemptions, including the three big  sellers, will be put on the "slow track" hearing process that could take 10  years to complete. Actually, Gillespie said, by Nov. 8 she only expects to  complete the 13 hearings she already has scheduled. Out of these, she said, her  rollback guidelines will come.  </P> <P> The 219 insurers on the slow track are companies that Gillespie said she does  not believe have sufficient profit levels to give rollbacks. She remarked that  she was agreeing to eventual hearings for these companies only because Van de  Kamp and State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis had formally demanded  them under provisions of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> "A couple of California politicians have petitioned the department," Gillespie  remarked disdainfully. "The requests were unnecessary; the paper work  redundant."  </P> <P> But Van de Kamp and Collis said they believed they were right in calling for  the hearings.  </P> <P> "The only good news is that, at my request, (these) requests for exemption from  the new law will not be granted until at least some hearing occurs, although no  schedule yet exists for that review, which the commissioner conceded could drag  on as long as 10 years," Van de Kamp said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Likely Candidate  </P> <P> Collis, a prospective candidate for the commissioner's post when it becomes  elective next year, said, "If Voter Revolt and other consumer groups, the  attorney general and I hadn't intervened on behalf of consumers, she apparently  would have granted all the exemption requests.  </P> <P> "We have felt that Commissioner Gillespie is biased in favor of the insurance  industry," Collis added. "But now the industry is running the department."  </P> <P> Another prospective contender for the Democratic nomination for commissioner,  television commentator Bill Press, said:  </P> <P> "I think she (Gillespie) ought to resign . . . She is defying the law and the  will the voters. She has prejudged the issue. I don't trust her numbers. I  don't think she's done the independent analysis of the numbers the insurers  have given her that is required. It's an act of political suicide."  </P> <P> Harvey Rosenfield, head of Voter Revolt and the author of Proposition 103,  said, "Gillespie must go. (She) has now proven herself to be hopelessly biased  toward the insurance industry. . . .  </P> <P> "Independent studies show that State Farm, Farmers and the Auto Club are among  the most highly profitable insurance companies in California. Their rates have  been excessive for many years. Yet Gillespie claims that they cannot afford to  roll back their rates. She has based her conclusions on the insurance  industry's own phony numbers and artificial bookkeeping practices. It is a  travesty of justice."  </P> <P> But Gillespie said that her department personnel had concluded, based on their  own assessments, that the companies in question simply do not realize the 11.2%  standard for defining a "fair rate of return."  </P> <P> She said State Farm Mutual, for instance, is receiving only a 6% return on its  California business and that Farmers "is having a problem." She did not  elaborate.  </P> <P> In the news conference, Gillespie had a less confident demeanor than at many  prior such meetings, remarking frequently that deciding on the rollbacks was an  extremely complicated and difficult business.  </P> <P> "What we have tried to do is use common sense," she said. "We have tried to  disentangle the morass."  </P> <P> Although the commissioner freely gave her estimates for how companies would  fare during the hearing process on exemptions, she also said at one point, "We  cannot prejudge."  </P> <P> On Aug. 1, Gillespie had set hearings for Allstate, State Farm Fire and  Casualty (a secondary State Farm company), USAA, California State Auto Assn.,  Safeco, 20th Century and Progressive Casualty, tentatively ordering the $305  million in rollbacks.  </P> <P> Tuesday, she called for quick hearings on six other companies, United Pacific,  United States Fidelity and Guaranty, Government Employees Insurance Co.  (GEICO), Fireman's Fund, Century-National and Calfarm. "This new group  represents potential rollbacks of more than $110 million to California  policyholders," she remarked.  </P> <P> The 34 other insurers served with a notice of intent to hold hearings "could  represent about $400 million in potential rollbacks," she said.  </P> <P> Altogether, those companies called for hearings off the slow track appear to be  above the 11.2% profit line she has set as the standard, Gillespie said.  </P></p>

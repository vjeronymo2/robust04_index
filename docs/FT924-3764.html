			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong rebounds by 5 per cent SHARE prices rose marginally in low volume as reports of negative third quarter GNP growth dampened activity ahead of the weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 35.61 to 17,265.69, a 1.1 per cent gain on the week, after fluctuating within a narrow band of 17,186.86 and 17,301.10 on small-lot profit-taking and light buying by public funds. Volume fell to 180m shares from 242m, dropping below 200m shares for the first time since November 24 as dealers refrained from trading. Some observers attributed the lack of activity to a mandatory exam for brokers this weekend, set by the Japan Securities Dealers Association. Some 30,000 brokerage employees will be tested on the rules and laws governing the securities business. Declines outpaced advances by 541 to 398 with 190 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.23 to 1,302.85 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 0.74 to 1,050.81. Investors failed to react to lower money market rates, due to worries over deteriorating domestic economic conditions. Although negative growth in GNP has raised hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, traders said that investors will wait for the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment, out next week, before making any decisions. A cut in the short-term prime rate by Sanwa Bank and hopes of lower interest rates helped interest-rate sensitive stocks. Nippon Steel was the day's most active issue, rising Y2 to Y295, while NKK advanced Y4 to Y256. High-technology shares were lower on profit-taking, with NEC down Y9 to Y650 and Sony retreating Y50 to Y4,050. Dealers flocked to stocks related to MRSA, a new virus contracted mainly in hospitals. Morinaga Milk Industry, which surged on Thursday on reports of research into a steriliser against MRSA, was traded actively but closed Y9 lower at Y691 on profit-taking. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 48.53 to 18,670.07 in volume of 22.5m shares. Profit-taking depressed Shimano, the bicycle parts maker, Y40 to Y1,830, and Nintendo lost Y100 to Y11,000. Roundup HONG KONG recovered some of the week's losses but analysts warned that the market was still very nervous. Manila was closed for a public holiday. HONG KONG leapt 5 per cent at the opening in a technical reaction to Thursday's steep fall, but activity levelled off by midsession with the Hang Seng index closing 289.89 higher at 5,268.10. The market has lost some 12 per cent on the week following tension between China and Britain over the future of democracy in the colony. Among the most actives, HSBC rose HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 55, Cheung Kong added 60 cents to HKDollars 18.60 and Hang Seng Bank was up HKDollars 3.75 at HKDollars 47.50. BANGKOK weakened on rumours, later denied, that two major property groups were facing bankruptcy charges in Hong Kong. The SET index fell 8.26 to 860.33, a 1 per cent decline on the week, in turnover of Bt4bn. The rumours caused sales of Bangkok Land, down Bt3 at Bt95, and Tanayong which fell by its 10 per cent limit to Bt72 before ending down Bt4.50 at Bt75. SINGAPORE eased in late profit-taking as investors switched their attention to Hong Kong. The Straits Times industrial index lost 5.64 to 1,442.70, barely changed on the week, as volume declined to 74m shares from 86.6m. SEOUL fell for the fourth consecutive day as investors remained nervous about the forthcoming presidential elections. The composite index shed 3.65 to 635.28, a 2.4 per cent fall on the week. TAIWAN rose on bargain-hunting and the weighted index rose 37.31 to 3,651.39, up 0.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of TDollars 5.8bn.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PURCHASERS' INDEX DROPS AGAIN IN JUNE;  </P> <P> 2ND STRAIGHT DIP SEEN AS SIGN OF CONTINUED COOLING OF ECONOMY  </P> <P> In another sign of an economic slowdown, the nation's purchasing managers  reported Monday that the U.S. manufacturing economy declined in June for the  second straight month.  </P> <P> Analysts said the monthly report by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management  provided more evidence of an across-the-board economic slackening but not a  recession.  </P> <P> "It's telling us what we've already been sensing: that the economy has been  growing less rapidly," said Robert Chandross, chief economist with Lloyds Bank  PLC in New York. "But I don't think it is an indication that would signal we're  in a recession."  </P> <P> The purchasing managers' index slumped to 48.8% from 49.7% in May. The decline  put the index at its lowest level since July, 1986, when it was 48%. The May  decline was the first in 33 months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Orders Declined  </P> <P> A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is generally expanding; below 50,  that the economy is generally declining. The difference from 50 indicates the  intensity of the change.  </P> <P> Production by the nation's factories was the only indicator to increase, while  new orders declined for the first time since May, 1986, and inventories also  fell. Vendor deliveries were faster for the second month -- a sign of declining  demand -- after 31 months in which they were reported slower.  </P> <P> "The total economy continued down the path toward slower growth as it ended the  second quarter," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the Tempe, Ariz.-based trade  group.  </P> <P> "The best news is that inflation appears to be slowing at a faster pace than  the overall economy," said Bretz, director of materials management at Pitney  Bowes Inc.  </P> <P> The purchasing managers' price index fell for the second consecutive month, to  48.5%, down sharply from 57.6% in May and the lowest since it was 42.8% in  April, 1986.  </P> <P> It was the first time in 34 months that more purchasers reported price  decreases than increases, indicating that inflation may be ebbing.  </P> <P> While the purchasing report surveys only the manufacturing sector and gives  equal weight to small and large firms, it is the first economic gauge released  each month and generally receives wide attention as an early signal.  </P> <P> The group's figures are compiled through a monthly survey of purchasing  executives at more than 250 industrial companies. The report was released  Monday morning for immediate use in a policy change from previous months when  it was released on Friday and ordered held for publication until Monday.  </P> <P> The report follows economic news last month indicating further softness.  </P> <P> Orders to factories for manufactured goods slumped 2.7% in May; the key index  of leading economic indicators dropped 1.2%, its steepest decline since the  October, 1987, stock market crash; durable goods orders plunged at the steepest  rate in 10 months, and consumer spending also declined sharply.  </P> <P> Many analysts believe that the declines are consistent with the Federal  Reserve's attempt to engineer a so-called soft landing with slower growth and  less inflation that won't drive the economy into a recession.  </P> <P> "We do expect to see a very slow economy in the next three quarters, but we do  not expect to see a recession," said David Wyss, chief financial economist for  DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2% Growth Seen  </P> <P> The purchasing management group said its overall index has averaged 51.4% for  the first half of 1989 but 50.5% for the second quarter. It said the  second-quarter figure indicates annual growth of about 2% in the gross national  product, the value of all goods and services produced.  </P> <P> The group said the index would have to fall below 44% before signaling a  decline in the inflation-adjusted GNP.  </P> <P> New orders declined in June after 48 months of expansion, falling to 47.2% from  53.4% in May. It was the indicator's lowest level since 47.2% in September,  1984.  </P> <P> Production, though, expanded in June for the 35th straight month, rising to  52.4% from 51.1% in May. Inventories were 49.7%, the nearest level to growth  since last December's 50.8%. The group's inventories index was 41.9% in May.  </P> <P> The group said 65% of members that use steel plan to increase inventories to  guard against possible production slowdowns when labor contracts expire at some  mills July 31.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- According to a report  from the United States, an investigative report released by the  U.S. Government publication the FEDERAL REGISTER [LIAN BANG JI  SHI 5114 6721 6764 0057] has confirmed that the Beijing No. One  Prison did not export, and is not likely to export in the  future, socks produced by inmates working at its Qinghe Sock  Factory. The facts of the case, concocted by Congressman Wolf,  member of the U.S. House of Representatives, state that in 1991,  "China's Beijing No. One Prison was exporting goods to the  United States". This case has finally been vindicated by the  facts.    On 27 March 1991, Representative Wolf and others visited the  Beijing No. One Prison. When they toured the prison's sock  workshop, Wolf attempted to take away without permission several  pairs of semifinished socks on the table, but he was stopped  then and there by the prison staff. After the tour, the warden  gave each and every visitor five pair of socks as souvenirs. A  few days later, however, Wolf, through the media outside China,  without grounds, accused the Beijing prison of exporting socks  it produced to the United States. Testifying to the U.S. Senate  Committee on Foreign Relations after he returned to the United  States, Wolf brazenly accused China, displaying the five pairs  of socks given to him as gift, and claimed they were "proof"  that China was exporting goods made by inmates in reformatories  to the United States. Although China made an immediate  clarification and explained the real situation on many  occasions, Wolf still disregarded the basic facts and continued  his totally groundless charges on many other occasions. Thus,  the "case of the Beijing prison's sock exports" suddenly created  a hue and cry in the U.S. Congress and in the media, creating a  very bad impression of China.    Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy in China  submitted a request to the relevant Chinese authorities to send  some officials to visit the Beijing No. One Prison, and the  authorities made arrangements for three officials of the U.S.  Embassy in China to visit the prison on 30 March 1993. During  the visit, the officials conducted a detailed investigation of  the matter regarding Wolf's accusation that the prison was  exporting inmate-produced socks to the United States. The  officials then reported the results of their investigation to  the U.S. Government. Later, Wolf again spread the lies he  created and attacked China, without grounds, at another news  conference held in the United States in the summer of 1993. The  Chinese authorities time and again urged the United States to  publicize the results of the investigation conducted by the  embassy officials. On 13 December 1993, the U.S. Government  publicized the results of the investigation in the FEDERAL  REGISTER, and thus the factory was vindicated.    An official of the relevant Chinese authorities pointed out,  with regard to products produced by reformatories, the policy of  the Chinese Government is clear: Reformatory-operated  businesses do not have the right to carry out economic and trade  activities with foreign countries or to conduct import-export  business. China has been strictly abiding by the "Memorandum of  Understanding on Banning the Import and Export of  Prison-Produced Products" ever since it was signed by China and  the United States. Facts are the most convincing proof.</p>

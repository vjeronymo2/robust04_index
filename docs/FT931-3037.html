			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Exchange gains and losses This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. FOREIGN exchange gains and losses for companies on all monetary assets and liabilities are to be taxed or relieved as income as they accrue, in what the Chancellor described as a measure to enhance London's status as a world financial centre. Exchange gains and losses on monetary assets (such as cash, bank deposits and debts receivable) and liabilities will be taxed or relieved as income receipts or deductions (for trading items, as part of trading profits or losses). Monetary assets in foreign currency which are currently subject to capital gains tax will cease to be so. Exchange differences on monetary items will be recognised as they accrue (as happens for accounts purposes when the items are translated into sterling). Unrealised exchange gains above certain limits may be partially deferred (where they arise on long-term capital items). Trading profits before capital allowances may be calculated by reference to currencies other than sterling where certain conditions are met. There will be provision for exchange differences on a borrowing which 'matches' a non-monetary asset to be deferred until the asset is disposed of.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Eighteen cities,  including Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Harbin, have been  selected to be pilot cities to carry out comprehensive reforms  aimed at establishing a socialist market economy.    This was revealed at the national conference on pilot cities  carrying out comprehensive reform which opened today here in the  capital of north China's Hebei Province.    The other 14 cities selected are Changchun, Shenyang,  Nanjing, Chengdu, Xian, Chongqing, Ningbo, Anshan, Tangshan,  Yantai, Tongling, Changzhou, Quanzhou and Yanji.    These 18 cities have better sense of reform, better  foundation for economic reform and development, and heavier  weight in the overall situation. They were selected to probe  for a way of deepening the reform and opening wider to the  outside world and sum up experience to pave the way for urban  reform throughout the country, sources from the current  conference said.    During the experiment, however, the central government will  not offer any more preferential treatment to the selected  cities, the sources said. Instead, the selected cities should  completely carry out all the reform measures and the  macro-control policies promulgated by the central government.  The emphasis of the reform will be put on establishing a modern  enterprise system.</p>

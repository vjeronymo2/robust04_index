			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Now some aid for UK science Sir, As a scientist, I would like to express my thanks to the former chancellor and to the Bank of England for their sterling support of science in the former Soviet Union. A significant chunk of their spending to support the pound last year was, I gather, channelled via the generosity of Mr George Soros to this purpose. Over the past month or so my colleagues and I have been deluged with requests from the International Science Foundation to review research proposals, many excellent, from science groups in the former Soviet states. These proposals are typically tightly budgeted requests for modest sums, to carry out first-rate science. In cost-effectiveness this is probably the best aid yet given to the former Soviet states. By sustaining the scientific morale of eastern Europe, it does far more than an opera house of bankers for reconstruction and development. Perhaps the former chancellor will sing some more during his ablutions. The present chancellor might even consider similar aid to UK science. Here, research is at present mostly carried out by harassed post-doctoral fellows on short-term contracts and with no prospects. Those who are lucky enough to have jobs as lecturers and professors are too busy responding to quality audits, selectivity exercises and other aspects of the UK's Stalinist regime of accountability and control (something not suffered by our colleagues in the west). At our college, they closed down chemistry recently for lack of interest. At an annual salary of Pounds 17,000 for a bright young lecturer, with an Oxbridge first, a doctorate and post-doctoral experience, or Pounds 30,000 for a high-flying 45-year-old professor (no cars, no fringe benefits), a slight diversion of the Pounds 23bn motorway money to aid science would go far to aid the UK's recovery. It is too much to ask for a lane off the M25, but could we at least have a hard shoulder? E G Nisbet, Holly Cottage, Middle Hill, Englefield Green, Surrey TW20 0JP</p>

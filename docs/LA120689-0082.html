			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: SENSIBLE STEPS IN DISCIPLINE  </P> <P> How to discipline is a source of many family arguments. How much do you know  about this important subject and how different styles affect children?  </P> <P> Here's a chance to test your views with those of some experts.  </P> <P> QUESTIONS:  </P> <P> 1 -- It's not important for parents to agree on styles of discipline.  </P> <P> 2 -- Children should never know that a parent is angry with them because it  erodes their self-esteem and their sense of belonging.  </P> <P> 3 -- There's no need for a parent to explain the reason for demanding certain  behavior. A command in itself should be sufficient.  </P> <P> 4 -- Children raised by traditional-style authoritarian parents are more likely  to abuse drugs and alcohol as adults than children raised in other homes.  </P> <P> 5 -- Authoritarian and authoritative parents discipline in the same way.  </P> <P> 6 -- Basically, permissive parents are probably the best parents in terms of  how their children develop.  </P> <P> ANSWERS:  </P> <P> 1 -- FALSE. Consistency in discipline is important, and if a child discovers he  can get away with something with one parent, but not with the other, or if  their styles of discipline are totally different, the youngster will be  confused.  </P> <P> 2 -- FALSE. It's all right for children to know that a parent is angry. Anger  is an acceptable part of love, but children need to learn constructive outlets  for anger. Parents and children need to learn to talk about their feelings with  each other.  </P> <P> 3 -- FALSE. Parents who use the do-it-because-I-say-so discipline are  authoritarian and their children don't learn how to think, analyze or make  decisions on their own. They become followers rather than leaders.  </P> <P> 4 -- FALSE. Studies conducted by Berkeley psychologist Diana Baumrind revealed  that while children raised by authoritarian parents were immature, showed poor  self-esteem and weren't motivated to do well in school, they had a relatively  low level of alcohol and drug abuse.  </P> <P> 5 -- FALSE. Authoritative parents take the time to explain the reasons for  following certain commands, unlike authoritarian parents. They set limits of  behavior, but they consider the child's point of view when setting limits.  Children of authoritative parents, unlike children of permissive or  authoritarian parents, are outstandingly well-adjusted, mature, happy,  motivated, independent and socially adept.  </P> <P> 6 -- FALSE. The 12-year longitudinal Berkeley study revealed that the children  who were worse off were those raised by permissive parents. Like those reared  by rigid authoritarian parents, they had low self-esteem.  </P></p>

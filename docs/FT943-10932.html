			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Two US regional banks to merge in pooling deal Two North Carolina-based banks announced a merger to create a south-east regional grouping with assets of Dollars 18bn, signalling a rare merger of equals among US banks. The pace of bank takeovers in the US has slowed as acquirers have been forced to pay ever higher premiums. By accounting for their deal as a pooling of interests, BB&amp;T Financial and Southern National yesterday announced a deal in which neither company's shareholders will pay a premium for control. The deal, which creates a bank with market capitalisation of more than Dollars 2bn, also signals the growing pressure on banks in the south-east caused by the likely passage of interstate banking legislation. Until now, banks in the region have been protected from takeover by institutions from elsewhere in the US by the so-called South-Eastern Compact, a series of loose agreements between states. The compact is already breaking down under new legislation passed by individual states over the past year, including North Carolina, and will dissolve when the remaining barriers to takeovers are removed by the proposed federal legislation. Mr John Allison, chairman and chief executive of BB&amp;T and of the merged company, said the merger was in part a response to interstate banking, which was likely to lead to more competition. The two banks predicted annual cost savings of Dollars 50m. Mr Glenn Orr, head of Southern National, said he would give up his executive duties but keep a seat on the board. Past attempts by banks to share management power 'helps to perpetuate an atmosphere of separate banks and creates confusion among employees,' he said.</p>

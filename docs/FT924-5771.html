			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Arts: The Nutcracker - Ballet It is going to be a hard winter. There are the brightest berries on my holly-bush; Santa, damn him, is already lurking in some stores; and I have sighted the first Nutcracker of the season in Wimbledon. As any observer will tell you, the earlier you see that harbinger of doom, the worse the season is going to be. This particular manifestation of Yuletide merriment is owed to the Moscow City Ballet, returned to our shores with yet another quaint recension of a ballet classic, thanks to the ingenuities of its director, Victor Smirnov-Golovanov. The programme book states, with unwavering gaze, that Mr Smirnov-Golovanov aims 'to teach his young company the original ideas of the great 19th century choreographers, with none of the later additions and changes. He encourages his dancers to use their own character delineations whilst adhering faithfully to the original choreography'. If only] The most original idea about this Nutcracker is that Smirnov-Golovanov's choreography is 'after the original by Marius Petipa'. Since the original choreography - as the Royal Ballet has largely reproduced it from contemporary notation - is by Lev Ivanov, we are immediately faced with problems of credibility. Since what Smirnov-Golovanov provides is, at best, dull stuff, dully danced, belief is further strained. Petipa it ain't - nor yet Ivanov. The evidence would suggest, as on the troupe's last two visits, that this is a minor company whose existence is owed to its ability to tour, efficiently if not especially creditably, shrunken versions of the classics that will appeal to audiences who do not have much occasion to see more gifted ensembles. Smirnov-Golovanov has a well-drilled female corps de ballet, some weedy chaps, and performances are made interesting for aficionados when he acquires an important guest artist: Semenyaka in 1991; Yury Posokhov earlier this year. Both dancers were beings from another planet in the context of the company's regular personnel. In this new production, Smirnov-Golovanov has somewhat complicated Nutcracker's dramatic argument. The magician, Drosselmeyer, obtrudes confusingly through the action, and at one moment seems about to embark upon a menage a trois with Clara and her Nutcracker Prince. The second act is now a Kingdom of Flowers rather than of sweets - an unexceptionable change were it not for the fact that Drosselmeyer is given a mimsy solo to the Mirlitons music, which introduces a wild element of farce into the proceedings. (It was danced with effulgent winsomeness by Dmitri Romanov, who is not my ideal as a Drosselmeyer anyway). Other performances are dutiful: on Monday night I saw Elvira Rikova as Clara and Yevgeny Mamrenko as her prince. The dancing which I most enjoyed came from Natalia Yakovleva as the Flower Fairy, suggesting wider artistic horizons, and a more elegant technique, than was generally on view. The 'character delineations', mentioned in the programme, looked pretty odd during the opening scene: for part of the time we might have been at a meeting of Cross-dressers Anonymous instead of a Christmas party. Design by Natalia Povago is the triumph of nylon - though the Flower Fairy has a beautiful tutu. The score is adequately played. Stylistically, the whole affair is dismal.

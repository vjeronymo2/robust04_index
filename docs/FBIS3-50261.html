The assembly is currently in recess until 1600  [1500 GMT] so that the heads of the deputy caucuses can reach an  agreement. Srdjan Savic reports:    [Savic] At the beginning of the session, chairman Vojislav  Dimitrijevic told deputies that he had received a new nomination  only from the Socialist Party of Serbia for the post of the  chairman of the assembly. The party's new candidate is Dragan  Tomic, head of the party's deputy caucus.    Vuk Draskovic, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement,  explained why DEPOS [Democratic Movement of Serbia] had not  proposed its new candidate today. He said that the parliament's  left and right parties' attempts to outvote one another were in  vain, and that it was necessary to reach a political agreement  on the division of responsibility for the legislative,  executive, and judiciary authorities. The Socialists bear the  greatest responsible for all compromises and agreements, because  they are the first party on the political ladder, Draskovic  said. [passage omitted]</p>

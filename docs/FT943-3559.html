			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium market bullish despite increase in stocks A bigger-than-expected rise in producer stocks reported yesterday took the aluminium market by surprise. But, once the initial impact was absorbed, the news made scarcely a dent on the market's bullish sentiment and the aluminium price seemed determined to keep heading towards USDollars 1,600 a tonne. Many analysts had been predicting that the International Primary Aluminium Institute (IPAI) would report producer stocks virtually unchanged. However, the organisation said total stocks, which had fallen every month since February, rose by 80,000 tonnes in July to 3.614m tonnes. Some traders pointed out that July marked the start of shut-downs for the northern hemisphere summer holidays in many aluminium consuming industries. Also, a fall in London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks in July - by a record 104,000 tonnes - more than compensated for the rise in producer stocks. They suggested that aluminium would go on to test Dollars 1,600 a tonne, which analysts say is the next important technical resistance point. There were words of caution from some observers, however. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, said the aluminium price was getting ahead of itself. 'There are still huge stocks overhanding the market - about 14 weeks of consumption - and eventually the market will realise this and settle down to sideways trading. Things are often overdone in the early stages of a recovery and the first-quarter rise in (aluminium) prices is not sustainable to the year-end.' The output cuts made by aluminium producers so far this year were 'having an impact beyond their wildest dreams'. As long as the producers stuck to their guns, there would be a supply deficit of about 400,000 tonnes this year and one of 1m tonnes in 1995, he said. Consequently, Mr MacMillan is forecasting aluminium prices averaging 65 cents a lb this year (Dollars 1,433 a tonne) and 75 cents (Dollars 1,653) in 1995. Aluminium for delivery in three months on the LME closed last night up Dollars 5.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,592.</p>

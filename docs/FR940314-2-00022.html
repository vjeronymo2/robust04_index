FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi is differentiated by size and by grade. The sizes express the maximum and minimum dimensions of the lumps of FeSi found in a given shipment. FeSi grades are defined by the percentages by weight of contained silicon and other minor elements. FeSi is most commonly sold to the iron and steel industries in standard grades of 75 percent and 50 percent FeSi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Calcium silicon, ferrocalcium silicon, and magnesium FeSi are specifically excluded from the scope of this order. Calcium silicon is an alloy containing, by weight, not more than five percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and 28 to 32 percent calcium. Ferrocalcium silicon is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, 60 to 65 percent silicon, and more than 10 percent calcium. Magnesium FeSi is a ferroalloy containing, by weight, not less than four percent iron, not more than 55 percent silicon, and not less than 2.75 percent magnesium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi is currently classifiable under the following subheadings of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS): 7202.21.1000, 7202.21.5000, 7202.21.7500, 7202.21.9000, 7202.29.0010, and 7202.29.0050. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this order is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FeSi in the form of slag is included within the scope of this order if it meets, generally, the chemical content definition stated above and is capable of being used as FeSi. FeSi is used primarily as an alloying agent in the production of steel and cast iron. It is also used in the steel industry as a deoxidizer and a reducing agent, and by cast iron producers as an inoculant. Parties that believe their importations of slag do not meet these definitions should contact the Department and request a scope determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Antidumping Duty Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 24, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department that imports of FeSi from Brazil materially injure a U.S. industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 735(e) of the Act, on February 15, 1994, the Department issued an amended final determination that FeSi from Brazil is being sold at less than fair value (59 FR 8598, February 23, 1994) to correct ministerial errors. On February 18, 1994, the ITC, after considering the Department's amended final determination, reaffirmed its determination that the domestic industry producing FeSi is materially injured by reason of subject imports from Brazil, including imports from Minasligas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with section 736 of the Act, the Department will direct Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value (FMV) of the merchandise exceeds the United States price (USP) for all entries of FeSi from Brazil. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of FeSi from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 16, 1993, the date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 43323). On or after the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties, the following cash deposits for the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

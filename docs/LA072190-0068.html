			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOMB BLAST RIPS LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE; NO INJURIES REPORTED;  </P> <P> TERRORISM: APPARENT IRA WARNING ALLOWS TIME TO EVACUATE THE BUILDING AND  SURROUNDING AREA.  </P> <P> A bomb apparently planted by the Irish Republican Army exploded Friday in the  visitors' gallery at the London Stock Exchange, but there were no casualties  because the building had been evacuated after a telephoned warning.  </P> <P> It was the first such warning since the start of what appears to be a summer  bombing campaign against political and financial targets in London.  </P> <P> About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49 a.m., a man who said he was a member  of the IRA told a British news service that a bomb had been placed at the  exchange and was about to explode.  </P> <P> Police officials said that if there had been no warning Friday, the human toll  would have been very high.  </P> <P> "There would have been injuries and probably fatalities among the people on the  trading floor," Police Cmdr. Hugh Moore said.  </P> <P> He said the warning, which allowed the police to evacuate about 300 employees,  did not detract from the gravity of the incident.  </P> <P> "We had only half an hour to reach the scene, evacuate the building and clear  the surrounding streets," he said. "If we had been a few minutes later getting  there, it would have been too late. These devices are unpredictable, and you  cannot guarantee when they'll go off."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was appalled by Friday's attack but  relieved that there had been no casualties.  </P> <P> Damage to the exchange building was extensive, however. Cmdr. George  Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said the bomb  blew a 20-by-7-foot hole in the building's facade, destroyed most of the  visitors' gallery and littered the street outside with rubble. He said the bomb  appeared to have been placed in the visitors' gallery men's room, possibly  during the night.  </P> <P> The explosion had little impact on stock trading, which is carried out largely  by computer at brokerage houses elsewhere. The volume of business conducted on  the trading floor has declined to the point that the visitors' gallery is  scheduled to be closed.  </P> <P> Public reaction was generally light-hearted.  </P> <P> "A computer crash would have hit London's financial markets far harder than  today's explosion," the Press Assn., Britain's domestic news agency, quoted one  broker as saying.  </P> <P> Outside the exchange building, many of the evacuated brokers continued to  conduct business by means of cellular telephones. There was a brief, 10-point  rally in share prices, which the Press Assn. attributed to "the British spirit  of refusing to be intimidated."  </P> <P> It was the police and intelligence services that appeared to be the most  concerned about the explosion. One source said that because the bomb was  designed to cause disruption rather than bloodshed, it tended to support fears  that the IRA is returning to the terrorist tactics of the 1970s.  </P> <P> At a late hour Friday there had been no formal IRA claim of responsibility for  the bomb, but the man who made the warning telephone call reportedly used a  code word, known only to militants and the police, that is used to distinguish  warnings from hoax calls.  </P> <P> "This is the IRA," he told the news agency Reuters. "The bomb is due to go off  in half an hour at the Stock Exchange. Clear the building."  </P> <P> If the IRA was involved, it was their first such move since last month's  bombing of the Carlton Club, a popular haunt of members of the ruling  Conservative Party.  </P> <P> Some observers noted that Friday's bombing occurred precisely eight years after  two IRA bombs exploded in London's Hyde Park as cavalry troops rode past,  killing 11 soldiers and injuring 53 others.  </P> <P> </P> <P> (Southland Edition) IRA BOMBING WAVE  </P> <P>  A chronology of attacks blamed on the Irish Republican Army since  </P> <P> August, 1988, when the current wave of assaults began:  </P> <P> August 1988: IRA renews mainland bombing campaign after 4-year lull, blowing up  an London army barracks.

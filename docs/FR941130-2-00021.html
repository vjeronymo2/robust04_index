			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Adjust the reservation charges applicable to Rate Schedules FTS&hyph;7 and FTS&hyph;8 to reflect the impact of ``rolling in'' the costs associated with the expanded facilities. Texas Eastern states that the rate treatment is a material aspect of the agreements between it and the customers and therefore requests that the Commission specifically authorize this treatment, consistent with the Commission's previous ``firm-up'' orders, the agreement of the parties and Section 10 of Rate Schedules FTS&hyph;7 and FTS&hyph;8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the annual cost of service for the facilities proposed herein, Texas Eastern proposes for Rate Schedule FTS&hyph;7, a revised reservation charge of $7.138 per dth. For Rate Schedule FTS&hyph;8, Texas Eastern estimates a revised reservation charge of $6.972 per dth. Texas Eastern asserts that provision of this service will, therefore, have no impact on the rate or services of Texas Eastern's other customers. Prior to the commencement of the proposed incremental services, Texas Eastern states that it will file revised tariff sheets for Rate Schedules FTS&hyph;7 and FTS&hyph;8 to reflect the adjusted reservation charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment date: December 7, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP95&hyph;78&hyph;000] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on November 15, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco), Post Office Box 1396, Houston,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;78&hyph;000 a request pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.208 of the Commission's Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Natural Gas Act for authorization to construct and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate facilities located at Compressor Station 200, Chester  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> County, Pennsylvania to comply with the Clear Air Act Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1990, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;426&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, all as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transco states that the Clear Air Act Amendments of 1990 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state implementation plans pursuant thereto require certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (oxides of nitrogen) air emissions at certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Transco's compressor stations. Transco proposes to install  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain facilities at the compressor stations to achieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It is stated that Transco plans to install  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these facilities pursuant to its part 157 subpart F blanket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate.  <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Transco states that it would file under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior notice procedure if the total cost of installing facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a compressor station exceeded $6.6 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Transco states that it plans to install these facilities under the blanket authorization based on the precedent established in an order issued to Transco on December 27, 1993, in Docket No. CP93&hyph;737&hyph;000 (65 FERC &para; 61,408). It is indicated that in that order the Commission authorized Transco to install under its blanket certificate a turbocharger at one of its compressor stations as a pilot project to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, Transco states that at Station No. 200 in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chester County, Pennsylvania it plans to install turbocharger and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated equipment on six of the thirteen existing engines in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions. It is stated that these engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently do not have turbochargers on them. It is also stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that on the other seven engines, Transco states that it plans to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify the existing turbochargers to increase their capacity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> install associated equipment in order to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that, in both cases, these emissions would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced because of an increase in the air-to-fuel ratio and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine adjustments. Transco states that the higher air content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serves to increase the heat capacity of the mixture in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion chamber, which lowers combustion temperature and thus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduces the formation of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

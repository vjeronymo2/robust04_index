			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BUSH HAILS 'CLEAR MINDS, PRODUCTIVE LIVES' IN SAFE, DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS  </P> <P> President Bush, opening a week of White House events focusing on youth, today  called for a day when every school in the nation will be "safe and drug free."  </P> <P> At a Rose Garden ceremony, Bush honored schools for their efforts to rid their  corridors and classrooms of drugs.  </P> <P> Forty-seven schools from 24 states and the District of Columbia were honored in  the annual Drug-Free Schools recognition program, launched by drug policy  coordinator William J. Bennett when he was secretary of education in the Ronald  Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> "As I look around here today, I see some of the top commandos in the war on  drugs -- our teachers, community leaders, parents and students," the President  said.  </P> <P> "You're the ones winning this war, because you are the ones looking to  tomorrow, you're the ones who know it takes a clear mind to get a good  education and lead a productive life. You understand that students have a right  to learn in drug-free schools."  </P></p>

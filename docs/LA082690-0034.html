			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALTADENANS CITED FOR FIGHT AGAINST CRIME  </P> <P> An Altadena neighborhood group has won a state award for community organization  against crime.  </P> <P> The California Stop Crime Coalition, whose members are appointed by the  governor, selected the Royce Street Neighborhood Watch for a Governor's Crime  Prevention Award.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. John Samuel told the Altadena Town Council on Tuesday that the  West Altadena street has come a long way.  </P> <P> "A year ago," Samuel said, "Royce Street was ridden with crime and blatant drug  dealing. It was called the worst street in the county." Today, he said, because  of combined resident and department cleanup efforts, it's one of the best.  </P> <P> The award will be presented to the Royce Street group at a banquet Sept. 21 in  San Jose.  </P> <P> The coalition will pass out Governor's Crime Prevention Awards in seven  categories. In addition to the Royce Street group -- which won the top award in  the community organization category -- several other Los Angeles County cities  and individuals will be honored.  </P> <P> The city of Lakewood will receive a Vehicle Theft Prevention award; Los Angeles  Police Sgt. George Gascon will get a Law Enforcement Practitioner Award, and  the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department will take honors in the Alcohol and  Drug Prevention category for its program entitled "Drugs, Pregnancy and You."

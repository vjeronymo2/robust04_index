			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The American charge d' affaires met with General  Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the minister of interior, and said that  there are 200 Thai laborers working in chemical and nuclear  weapons plants in Libya. After that, Mr. Suthat Ngoenmun, the  deputy minister of interior, admitted that there are Thai  workers employed at those plants. But he said that they are  engaged in laying pipes to produce clean water. The Labor Skills  Development Department was then ordered to draft a ministry  regulation prohibiting Thai laborers from being sent to work at  foreign munitions plants. In just 3 to 4 days, the Labor Skills  Development Department submitted a draft regulation to the  ministry's legal section. But the resolution was not approved,  because it was felt that the present labor law does not give the  ministry authority in such cases. However, the director-general  of the Labor Skills Development Department already has the  authority to prohibit this. There is no need to issue a ministry  regulation.    Last week, Mrs. Amphon Chunnanon, the director-general of  the  Labor Skills Development Department, told reporters that after  it became clear that a ministry regulation couldn't be issued,  the department issued an order prohibiting Thai workers from  being sent to work at a foreign munitions plant regardless of  the type of weapons produced there. This prohibition does not  apply just to Libya but to all countries. It is difficult to say  how effective this will be. Normally, employment companies  declare that they are sending workers to perform one type of  job, but they may actually perform some other job. The  department can't follow them to see what they are actually  doing. Furthermore, a large number of workers have gone abroad  to work without going through the Labor Skills Development  Department. This is a major problem today. Those laborers may be  working at plants where we do not want them to work.    Unfortunately, the director-general of the Labor Skills  Development Department did not state frankly that prohibiting  workers from working at foreign munitions plants is aimed simply  at sucking up to the Americans. Actually, it will be difficult  to prohibit workers from doing that.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Ukraine to return N-missiles UKRAINE was reported yesterday to have backed down from its threat to retain possession of tactical nuclear weapons on its territory. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, told parliamentary deputies he had been assured by Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, that the missiles would be returned to Russia by July 1 as planned. A Nato spokesman was also quoted as saying Ukraine had pledged to do so. Last week, Mr Kravchuk announced he would halt the transport of the missiles because of instability in Russia. In Kiev, Maj Gen Georgy Zhevitsa, chief of the Ukrainian general staff, said he had no information of a change of policy. But a western diplomat in Moscow commented: 'We can assume that someone in the west has sat pretty hard on Mr Kravchuk.' If confirmed, this would be the second turnaround in Ukrainian policy due to international pressure in the past few days. Last week, the government agreed to jointly repay the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union, having originally insisted on individual repayment of its share, put at 16.37 per cent. Meanwhile, another warning of disintegration in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) armed forces was delivered yesterday by Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, CIS chief-of-staff. Speaking to the army daily newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, Gen Samsonov said the army was facing widespread desertions and evasions of the draft in the face of rising ethnic struggles, especially in the Caucasus. 'The situation has arisen where we can no longer defend ourselves. There is no-one left. There are units in which officers have to stand guard. It is shameful,' he said.</p>

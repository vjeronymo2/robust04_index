			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Tit for tat Is it the sun, or is it to keep out the peeping toms from across the square? Whatever the reason, US investment banker Morgan Stanley seems intent on reversing the trend towards greater transparency in Britain's financial markets by shrouding its affairs in secrecy. It is replacing the windows of its Cabot Square headquarters, in London's Canary Wharf, with reflective glass panes. As a result Morgan's rivals across the Square at Credit Suisse First Boston will no longer be able to train their binoculars on the firm's innermost secrets. Expect CSFB to follow suit.</p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Falling raw material costs behind Kalon's 55% rise to Pounds 6.2m KALON, the paint group embroiled in a hostile Pounds 91m bid for its Wolverhampton rival Manders, announced a 55 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.16m for the six months to December 31. Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director, said the profits increase had been due to falling raw material prices and improved efficiencies throughout the group. He rejected accusations that it had achieved windfall profits from one-off price rises led by companies such as ICI. The group had proved 'beyond all doubt that its performance has been sustainable and has been sustained  .. This is not a flash in the pan,' he said. Kalon also announced acceptances totalling 6.5 per cent of Manders shares in its 8-for-3 paper offer, extended to August 10. Mr Roger Akers, Manders chief executive, dismissed the extension in the face of 'overwhelming rejection' of the offer. He said the increase in acceptances was 'fractional', excluding the undertaking from one institutional investor for 5.93 per cent at the first closing date. During the first half, Kalon increased sales by 9 per cent to Pounds 52.4m. Mr Hennessy said the company had boosted its share of a declining trade paint market as well as increasing its hold on the retail sector, largely through supplying the big DIY retailers. Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.19m to Pounds 5.93m, largely due to a 42 per cent increase in decorative paints to Pounds 6.01m. There were three loss-makers: chemicals, industrial coatings and Smyth-Morris in Spain. Mr Hennessy admitted the company's record outside of paints had not been good, and there was some way to go in stemming the losses. But steps had been taken, and losses had been cut by 12 per cent to Pounds 242,000 in industrial coatings, for example. During the first half, Kalon improved its cash position by Pounds 7m to Pounds 8.1m. Earnings per share increased from 2.33p to 3.45p. The dividend was raised from 0.7p to 1p. See Lex</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Honda climbs out of the front seat: A look at the end of a special relationship between the Japanese carmaker and Rover When Honda took its minority equity stake in the Rover group four years ago, it was the symbolic value - not the size of the stake nor the financial valuation - that was crucial. The 20 per cent holding was the cement in a relationship unique between Japanese and European carmakers. It made the relationship long-term and set it apart from any other collaboration the two groups might have had with other rival carmakers at the same time. Honda's decision yesterday to sever this equity link is just as crucial, and just as symbolic. It says that the Honda-Rover special relationship is over. The cement has crumbled. When BMW emerged three weeks ago in London as the triumphant buyer of British Aerospace's 80 per cent holding in Rover, Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW chairman, voiced the pious hope that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars will naturally continue its agreements with Honda in every respect'. That hope was dashed yesterday. The ending of the equity link at Honda's insistence removes, too, for the foreseeable future any thoughts of a grander global alliance between Honda on the one side and BMW-Rover on the other. BMW has caused Honda seriously to lose face at home. Honda's European strategy was different to that of its domestic rivals Toyota and Nissan. As Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, admitted yesterday, the strategy had been built to an important extent around collaboration with Rover, and is now in tatters. At the same time Honda and BMW are potent direct rivals in the world auto market, particularly in the US, where Honda's separate luxury performance brand, Acura, competes head-on with BMW. Both have built their brand images on engineering excellence and high performance with a heavy accent on motor sport. Yesterday's events in Tokyo rule out any joint Honda-BMW alliance. What now must be determined is the pace and manner of the disengagement of the industrial links between Honda and Rover. With frostiness, Mr Kawamoto said only that 'the series of contracts now existing between Honda and Rover will be reviewed in future business discussions. 'Until now our European strategy has included collaboration with Rover. In the future we intend to create a more independent operation in Europe, using our own resources.' The relationship was unmistakeably being reduced to only a 'series of contracts'. As far as Mr Pischetsrieder was concerned, yesterday's one-and-a-half hours of talks had been conducted in a 'friendly' atmosphere. The coldness of Mr Kawamoto's later public statement apparently came as a surprise to the urbane BMW boss. But there can be no excuse for any more surprises. Honda has spelled out its unhappiness and anger at the takeover of Rover by BMW through the symbolic cutting of the equity link. Now it is time for the realpolitik. The most pressing questions are how long should the Honda-Rover relationship take to disentangle, and how disruptive should the process be to either party? Rover is now only a pawn in this process. The decisions will be made in Tokyo and in Munich. It is in Honda's power to disrupt very quickly a significant part of Rover's car production, if it were to choose to invoke the three-month termination clauses of its licensing agreements. These cover products such as the Rover 600 executive car - launched last year and produced at Rover's Cowley, Oxford, plant; the Rover 400 family car, produced at Rover's Longbridge, Birmingham, plant; and the Honda PG1 gearbox, which Rover produces at Longbridge for fitting with its own 2-litre T-series engine in several of its products. While Honda so far has restricted itself privately to spelling out the potential strength of the cards it has in its hands, BMW was at pains yesterday to insist privately that it expected all Rover's existing projects with Honda to continue. It would not be in Honda's commercial interest to abandon them. A similar view emerged yesterday from the all-important components suppliers in Europe, which play a vital role in the success of both the Honda and Rover operations, and which in many cases supply identical parts for the Honda Concerto-Rover 200/400 and for the Honda Accord-Rover 600. They expect existing programmes to continue. 'We don't feel unease at the moment, because we think it is highly unlikely that Honda will enact a Domesday scenario,' said a leading components supplier. 'But they will take it down over time. There is a lot of money involved. They will not cut off their nose to spite their face.' The sister cars Honda Accord and Rover 600 were only launched last year. While Rover produces the 600 under licence at its Cowley plant, and Honda produces the Accord at its own Pounds 370m Swindon assembly plant, the supply programme is closely woven together with a largely identical supplier base. At the same time, Honda supplies 2.0- and 2.3-litre engines for the Rover 600 from its Swindon engine plant, while Rover supplies Honda with the Accord's body panels from the Rover stamping plant at Swindon. If commercial realpolitik dictates that the present generation Accord-Rover 600 programme is left undisturbed, this alone will ensure that the Honda-Rover industrial links cannot be severed entirely yet. More vulnerable to potential disruption could be the so-called project Rover Theta-Honda HH. This is the new-generation family car Honda and Rover are developing to replace the present Rover 200/400-Honda Concerto. The project is already advanced and production is due to begin in the autumn. Honda Europe said yesterday that many of its suppliers were 'already tooling up and getting ready' to supply components for the car. Its Swindon plant has 201 suppliers in Europe and many are also common suppliers to Rover. 'We would be very surprised if Honda pulls out of this programme given the level of investment that has been made and how close they are to getting it into production,' said another leading UK components supplier yesterday. If Honda allows the Theta-HH programme to go ahead - Rover will produce its version under a licensing agreement - the two companies will be forced to maintain close ties beyond the year 2000. The economics of the components supply programme and the economies of scale also suggest that Honda cannot sensibly drop Rover quickly. Last year Rover production of its 200/400 version of the current generation car totalled 162,095, compared to production of only 18,406 for the much less successful Concerto. The new generation cars are likely to have a production ratio of at least 1 to 4 in favour of Rover. Other factors also suggest that current Honda-Rover projects - in production and under development - will continue. The Japanese carmaker is still relatively weak in Europe. Its total new car sales across 17 markets in west Europe amounted to only 162,000 last year, giving it a west European market share of 1.4 per cent compared with the 3.5 per cent of Nissan and the 2.8 per cent of Toyota. At home, Honda is experiencing serious overcapacity, which could prove expensive to redress in the middle of recession, where three successive years of declining sales are sapping the company's finances. In the vital US market, where the Accord was once all-conquering, the car has been knocked from its perch as the best-seller. Honda is having to invest heavily in a much more aggressive marketing campaign to try to halt the decline. In Europe, Rover always represented a low-cost way into a market where Honda was weaker than its Japanese rivals. It will now shut the door on the transfer of technology to Rover, which will have to look to the lessons it has already learned and to BMW to ensure that it stays on the path towards becoming a world-class producer. Honda will drop Rover in the long run, but the UK carmaker may still be able to secure a soft landing until Honda is in a position to cut all links. Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Money Markets: Europe rates steady INTEREST RATES were steady in Europe yesterday after the German Bundesbank set an unchanged fixed rate at a one-month securities repurchase agreement tender and the Bank of Spain left its money market intervention rate unchanged. Wholesale rates in London were also stable as hopes of lower bank base rates received the second setback in two day's. Monday's news of high retail sales in March was followed yesterday by a larger than expected UK current account deficit in the same month. Call money in Frankfurt was unchanged at 8.85 per cent following the Bundesbank's offer of a securities repurchase agreement tender at a fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. Dealers expect the supply of funds to roughly match the DM10.8bn draining from the banking system today as an earlier facility expires. In Madrid the Bank of Spain supplied liquidity to the domestic money market at an unchanged 13.5 per cent at the regular thrice-monthly repurchase tender for central bank certificates. In London three-month interbank was steady at 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent and 12-month money was unchanged at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent. On Liffe short sterling futures maintained a recent weaker trend. June delivery opened unchanged at 88.64, but closed at 88.59. Day-to-day credit remained in short supply on the cash market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,350m, but revised this to Pounds 1,200m at noon and to Pounds 1,250m in the afternoon. Total help of Pounds 1,172m was provided. In early operations the authorities bought Pounds 73m bank bills outright in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 124m bills were purchased, by way of Pounds 47m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 77m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 975m bills were bought, via Pounds 1m Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent, Pounds 545m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 429m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 7m, with the unwinding of a repurchase agreement on bills absorbing Pounds 1,374m and bank balances below target Pounds 130m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 65m to liquidity and a fall in the note circulation of Pounds 95m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Viktor Chernomyrdin, Like Bill </F> Clinton, Understands That Money Is More Important Than Human  Rights. Russian Premier's Visit to Beijing Crowned With Series  of Agreements"]    [Text] Beijing -- Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Beijing  has been crowned with the signing of a series of agreements  which are designed to ease the development of trade and economic  cooperation as well as contacts between the two countries'  citizens.    The accords envisage that citizens be exempt from dual  taxation, prescribe a procedure for border transit and ties  between border services, and determine measures for the  protection of the environment, the exploitation of the resources  of rivers on the border, and the development of maritime  shipping. A separate document regulates the exchange of  information and experience in agriculture.    In the opinion of members of the Russian delegation, these  agreements could help our state enterprises and private business  become established in the gigantic Chinese market. Indeed, this  is the main point of our premier's visit to the PRC.    Meeting with representatives of Chinese business circles, he  tried to show that there is no reason to be afraid of investing  money in Russia and concluding large-scale contracts with it.  Whether or not he managed to convince his audience, people used  to the unpredictability of the political and economic situation  in our country, is unclear. In any event, the legal basis for  cooperation was determined by the signing of the new documents.    Admittedly, the competition for the Chinese market is  becoming increasingly intense. That is the reason for the U.S.  President's sensational decision to abandon the linkage between  the observance of human rights and terms of trade with China.    For Russia, of course, which has a border with China,  relations with it are even more important than for the United  States. It is no wonder that in conversation with the Chinese,  as sources report, the head of our government avoided subjects  which they find sensitive, such as the violation of human  rights. This decision made it possible to promote Russian  economic interests, at least in those areas where fierce  competition is not in evidence yet -- in the supply of the  latest types of military hardware. The United States and other  Western countries are still observing the embargo in this field  imposed on China after the suppression of the demonstrations in  Tiananmen Square.    According to some information, particularly intensive talks  were held on new supplies of Russian fighters and the transfer  of aircraft construction technology.</p>

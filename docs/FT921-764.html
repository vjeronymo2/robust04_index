			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: South Africa adopts a new stance  -The Reserve Bank's move into the financial rand market THE decision this week by the Reserve Bank of South Africa to intervene in the financial rand market should make the country a more attractive investment proposition for foreigners by reducing currency risk. The decision has been welcomed by users of the market, who say the Reserve Bank's intervention will increase stability. The market has traditionally been very volatile, trading on thin volumes. The bank will intervene by buying or selling financial rands against US dollars. The financial rand is a fixed pool of investment currency for foreigners, introduced in 1985 at the time of the country's debt standstill, to protect the balance of payments. The reasoning was that foreign holders of South African equities should be treated on the same terms as those who had loaned money to the country, which had then been blocked by the standstill. Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said intervention should have five main advantages: The total supply of financial rand would reduce if, as expected, the bank is a net purchaser; The bank's intervention should narrow the discount between the commercial and financial rand; The market will enjoy greater stability; The application of gold and foreign exchange reserves will provide an additional means for the bank to control domestic liquidity; Foreign creditors with claims within the debt standstill net will be able to sell the balances indirectly through authorised dealers in foreign exchange to the Reserve Bank. Mr Jaap Meijer, deputy governor of the bank, stressed the money market angle behind the decision to enter the market. He noted that a marked improvement in the country's balance of payments position in the first nine months of 1991 led to an easing of liquidity in the money markets such that the bank struggled to keep an adequate shortage. It was useful, he said, to have this additional instrument to regulate liquidity. He said the amounts involved would probably be fairly small compared with the monthly shifts in reserves. Mr Mike Brown, economist at Frankel Max Pollak, the stockbroker, said he thought the move was designed to increase confidence in the country. 'They want to normalise the country's involvement in international capital markets and they don't believe you can do that with a major discount between the commercial and investment currencies.' A large discount raised doubts in investors' minds as to the discount they would have to pay to get money out of the country. Mr Brown said that although the new policy could dampen equity prices, which traditionally gain from a weak financial rand, it would probably boost investment in gilts because a narrowing of the financial rand discount offered a capital gain. The volatility of the financial rand is shown by the fact that the discount to the commercial rand widened from 8 per cent at the beginning of December to 33 per cent in mid-February amid rumours of a new tax on foreign investors. One aspect of the new policy is that it could provide investors with a one-way bet. If the discount widens perceptibly, investors will feel safe to buy financial rands in the expectation that the Reserve Bank will be intervening to support the price. The Reserve Bank has often said that it would like to abolish the two-tier currency system, thus removing the stigma of an unsound economy. Bank officials believe, however, that there remains too much uncertainty to contemplate abolishing it. Other determing factors will be the country's balance of payments position and its reserves, as well as whether it obtains IMF support.</p>

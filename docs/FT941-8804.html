			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Financial markets welcome move The decision yesterday by the Bundesbank to cut its discount rate by half a percentage point was welcomed in financial markets as confirmation that European interest rates are on a downward trend. Analysts cautioned, however, that it was unlikely all European countries would follow suit until there was a clearer sign from Germany. The Bundesbank's move was described as 'very cautious' and other countries are expected to be equally careful. The Dutch and Belgian central banks quickly followed the German lead, but analysts stressed that although the Bundesbank's move signalled an easing of monetary policy, its cut yesterday was confined to the discount rate. Both the repo and Lombard rates were left unchanged. 'The Bundesbank is creating room for a real cut in their effective monetary instrument, the repo rate,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International. 'The good news is that they have unlocked that door, but they have not yet opened it.' The repo is the rate that sets the money market rate and it is the key instrument used by the Bundesbank for implementing monetary policy. The discount rate, which was cut to 5.25 per cent, establishes a floor for German interest rates. For money market rates to move lower, however, would require a lowering of the repo rate, which was yesterday left at 6 per cent. The Lombard rate, the upper ceiling at which the Bundesbank offers liquidity to the system, was also unchanged at 6.75 per cent. Belgium cut its equivalent of the repo rate by only 15 basis points, while the Dutch left their repo equivalent - the special advances rate  - unchanged, while trimming two other rates. Austria, which is not a member of the ERM, cut its discount and Lombard rates by a quarter percentage point. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, welcomed the Bundesbank rate cut as 'a timely move that has given a much better tone to European bond markets,' but said there would be 'few immediate changes' in European interest rates. Mr Chertkow said the 'hard core' ERM currencies would probably await a Bundesbank decision on its repo rate. But if a currency such as the French franc were to appreciate to FFr3.38 to the D-mark, the central bank may be tempted to cut rates independently of the Bundesbank. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said the Bundesbank wanted to reassure markets that it had not departed from its long-term path of lower rates, despite concerns over the IG Metall wage dispute and expectation of poor January money supply figures. There has recently been evidence of investors in German bond markets becoming disenchanted at Germany's failure to ease policy more quickly. If this were to translate into large-scale selling, this would drive up long-term interest rates. Mr Chertkow said yesterday's move had probably averted this scenario.</p>

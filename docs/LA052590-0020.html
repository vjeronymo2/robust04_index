			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM FINED $450,000 FOR MISHANDLING OF ASBESTOS  </P> <P> A Los Angeles development company was fined $450,000 Thursday for violating  hazardous waste regulations in connection with the improper disposal of  asbestos during demolition of an Atwater Village pottery factory, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Perlita in L.A. Inc. pleaded no contest to one count of illegal disposal of  hazardous waste during an arraignment hearing in Los Angeles County Municipal  Court, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. Brodney.  </P> <P> The West Los Angeles company, one of its site supervisors and two contractors  were charged last month with allowing friable asbestos -- crumbly material that  could release airborne particles -- to escape in December, 1988, when they  demolished kilns and factory structures at the defunct Franciscan Ceramics  plant. The structures at 2901 Los Feliz Blvd. were being demolished in  preparation for development of the 45-acre site.  </P> <P> Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, Perlita, in addition to the fine, was  placed on three years probation by Municipal Judge Candace Beason, Brodney  said. Environmental regulations allow for corporate violators to be charged as  if they were an individual person.  </P> <P> "You can't put a corporation in jail," Brodney said. "They are paying a fine.  $450,000 is a substantial fine." Brodney said other companies in Los Angeles  County have been fined $600,000 or more for similar violations.  </P> <P> Brodney said Perlita is also cleaning up the ceramics plant site and has  already paid $150,000 to clean bricks that were taken from the kilns and  transported to a brick-crushing plant in Barstow.  </P> <P> At the arraignment hearing Thursday, Pradeep Agnihotri of El Toro, John Edwards  of Arcadia and Al Sesar of Newport Beach pleaded innocent to two counts each of  illegal disposal and transportation of hazardous waste.  </P> <P> Agnihotri, 33, was the site manager for Perlita, and Edwards, 52, operated a  company that demolished the kiln structures, authorities said. The debris was  trucked to Barstow by a company operated by the 37-year-old Sesar.  </P> <P> Brodney said the kiln structures contained powdered asbestos insulation that  should have been vacuumed out and bagged in accordance with health regulations.  </P> <P> "They should have known those kilns had asbestos in them," Brodney said. "They  just knocked them down, scooped it all up and put it in trucks, and it was  taken to San Bernardino for recycling."  </P> <P> Brodney said if the asbestos had not been discovered by health inspectors  shortly after the demolition, the contaminated bricks would have been crushed  and the material then possibly used to make roof tiles.  </P> <P> Though the kilns were torn down during two weeks of heavy Santa Ana wind  activity in the area, health authorities who later tested air quality near the  site could not determine if any of the asbestos became airborne during the  demolition, Brodney said.  </P> <P> Perlita in L.A. is the corporate name for the Franciscan Promenade partnership,  which is completing cleanup of the property before development, officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A SQUEEZE in stock index futures sent the June contract on the FT-SE sharply forward in heavy turnover and pulled the underlying cash market higher, writes Joel Kibazo. Having started the session at 2,653, June was sold down before independent traders, having expected a quiet session, rushed to cover short positions. The squeeze that followed was further fuelled by large buying of the Footsie 100 option. The combination of the two factors not only pulled the underlying cash market higher, but saw June trade at a healthy premium for most of the session. June eventually closed at 2,688, up 41 on the previous session and 25 points over its estimated fair value premium to cash of 22. Turnover reached 9,162 contracts. In traded options, volume reached 50,380 lots. This was boosted by the total volume in the Footsie 100 option - 28,764 lots. James Capel was reported to have been prominent in the business, being responsible for 12,000 contracts of that total. Tesco was the top-traded stock option at 3,289 lots. This was followed by Lasmo, in which bid talk was heard. It traded 2,887 lots and was followed by Scottish Power at 1,282 trades.</p>

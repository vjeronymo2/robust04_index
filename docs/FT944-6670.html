			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / New Zealand Labour party moves up in polls Support for New Zealand's Labour party has improved with opinion polls timed to coincide with its annual conference at the weekend showing it with 25 points against the National government's 42. The change in Labour's fortunes has been dramatic: less than three months ago it came in fifth place in a a by-election in the South Island Selwyn constituency, a seat it nearly won in last year's general elections. The polls suggests that the New Zealand political scene is set to return to its traditional dominance by its two old established parties. Labour's resurrection has been partly due to hard work by Ms Helen Clark, the party leader in distancing it from the right wing policies that it followed in government between 1984 and 1990 that caused its eventual landslide defeat. Labour's unity has been helped by the departure of both left and wing ring critics to join other parties. It recently unveiled populist economic policy featuring higher taxes for the well off, bigger family support payments, industry planning and a venture capital fund. However it has also benefited handsomely from the surprise decision of Jim Anderton to step down as leader of the Alliance party, an unusual grouping of left and centre parties. A charismatic former president of the Labour party, Mr Anderton broke away to form his own left wing party in 1988. This was promptly joined by some minor political groups favouring such disparate policies as monetary reform and Maori rights and also the Green movement. Mr Anderton's consistent rating as preferred prime minister helped the Alliance become the country's second top polling party. But his resignation saw the Alliance support drop by 20 per cent to 23 points, its lowest level this year. The Alliance is now led by an Ms Sandra Lee, who is considered too inexperienced to be able to revive its fortunes. The fourth political party now represented in parliament, New Zealand First, led by Maori MP Winston Peters, has slumped badly in public support following a public spat over its funding. However, the advent of a new electoral system, which will reduce the number of electorate seats from 99 to 66, is causing concern among sitting MPs. They believe the reduced number of seats means fewer of them can represent the existing main parties, and many are known to be considering joining or forming new parties, which they calculate will prosper under proportional representation.</p>

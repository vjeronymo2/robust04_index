			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wheels within wheels . . . During the financial year 1992/93, I worked in the health service. I used my own car on my employer's business and was paid a mileage allowance. For the first half of the year I used a car of 1993cc, and for the second half one of 2993cc. On changing my car, I learnt I was being assessed under rates agreed between 'the Revenue, the health service and the Whitley Council' and not the fixed profit car scheme (FPCS). As a result, I have incurred a taxable profit of more than Pounds 300 for the larger-engined vehicle, even though my mileage payment was slightly below the top 'tax-free' rate under the FPCS. My tax office has told me the rates applying to the health service are not negotiable and that the only alternative is to ask to be assessed on a 'statutory' basis. Is there any redress? The FPCS is a voluntary scheme which employers may choose, if it suits them. It is not open to an employee to claim the benefit of the FPCS if his employer has not chosen to operate it. 'Statutory basis' means you have to make a detailed claim for expenses and capital allowances, based upon an analysis of your daily use of the car. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

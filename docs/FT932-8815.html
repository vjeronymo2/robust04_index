			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fund managers dropping US stocks in favour of Japanese LEADING UK institutional fund managers strongly prefer Japanese equities to US stock, according to the May survey by Gallup for stockbrokers Smith New Court. Some 24 per cent of fund managers said they would increase their holdings in Japanese equities compared with 1 per cent in the December survey. A balance of 23 per cent claimed they would decrease holdings in US equities against 16 per cent intending to raise holdings in December. Mr Peter Lyon, global strategist at Smith New Court, said the Japanese equity market was significantly outperforming the US. 'That disparity suggests there may be a belated shift by UK fund managers toward Japanese equities and away from US equities.' The survey also shows managers moving away from gilts with 14 per cent intending to decrease holdings compared with 9 per cent in March. Smith New Court said this was prompted by fears about UK inflation which they believe are unfounded. Managers are more optimistic about the 12-month outlook for UK equities than any other main market; 79 per cent said they were bullish about the UK equity market compared with 62 per cent in January. The survey suggests confidence about the UK economy continues to increase with 35 per cent of very optimistic, more than twice as many as the January survey. They have improved their earnings forecasts for 1993 from 13.8 per cent 14.7 per cent. The managers expect inflation to pick up in 1993 and 1994, but by less than was expected in the early surveys carried out after sterling's exit from the ERM. The survey was backed by 89 institutions, handling funds worth Pounds 629bn</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PARKER ADVANCES TO DIVISION III SEMIS  </P> <P> Francis Parker Coach Doug Huffman didn't see his usual playoff-tough team  Tuesday night in the first round of the state Division III girls' volleyball  playoffs.  </P> <P> His starting seniors, Amy and Jill Meier, weren't on their games, and his  juniors and sophomores seemed to feel the playoff pressure.  </P> <P> But junior reserve Sarah Tubbesing apparently was numb to it all as she came up  with big serve after big serve in the deciding fifth game to pull out a 15-13,  7-15, 15-8, 11-15, 15-10 victory for Francis Parker over visiting San Joaquin  Memorial of Fresno.  </P> <P> "I think we were a little nervous," Huffman said. "We started off pretty slow  and didn't do a very good job of controlling the ball. This was not one of our  best games."  </P> <P> Parker advanced into Saturday's semifinals against Winward Mar Vista or  Mammoth.  </P> <P> In the deciding fifth game, Tubbesing, a defensive specialist who does not  start, served three aces and was partly responsible for another four Parker  points.  </P> <P> "She served to specific areas and took them out of their offense," Huffman  said."  </P> <P> Parker (22-1) led, 7-3, early in the fifth game, but sloppy net play let San  Joaquin (20-7) back in the game. But with the score tied at eight, sophomore  Paula McNamee had a kill and a block to give Parker back the lead, 10-8. Then  at 11-8, Tubbesing then served three consecutive winning points.  </P> <P> Parker had an opportunity to put the match away after four games as it held an  11-10 lead. But the Lancers had trouble handling San Joaquin's Renae Chavez's  serves and lost the last five points of the game.  </P></p>

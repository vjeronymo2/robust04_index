			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil prices could be fully floated by the end of 1993 RUSSIAN oil prices could be fully floated by the end of 1993, according to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, deputy prime minister responsible for energy policy, Reuter reports from Moscow. Asked when oil prices would be freed to world levels, he told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: 'This won't happen in the nearest future. Perhaps by the end of 1993 . . . and it will be a gradual raising of prices in stages under the control of the state.' President Boris Yeltsin last week more than doubled the price of crude oil to 4,000 roubles (Dollars 20) a tonne in a bid to revitalise the country's crisis-ridden energy sector. Debts between enterprises have soared since January as prices have been raised. The fuel and energy complex was owed 525bn roubles while it owes others 386bn roubles, Mr Chernomyrdin said. More than 20,000 perfectly good wells were idle, resulting in a loss of 280m barrels of oil a year.</p>

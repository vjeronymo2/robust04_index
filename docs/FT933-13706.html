			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: All hands on Danish krone The Danish krone finished the week clinging to its position in the ERM after a concerted effort to defend it by European central banks, writes Stephanie Flanders. A string of announcements on Friday morning confirmed that the Belgian, French, Spanish and German central banks were joining the Danish and Dutch authorities in purchasing the Danish currency. The Danish unit was under steady selling pressure throughout the day, which reached its height during the afternoon as speculators gambled on a weekend realignment. When London markets closed, the krone was trading just above its ERM floor of DKr3.9016 against the D-Mark, at DKr3.8885. The currency had closed on Thursday at DKr3.8925. Traders were divided about the volume of krone trading on either side. Rumours that the combined intervention of behalf of the krone totalled around DM3-4bn were generally considered plausible. Some thought that the Danish government's claim that it had enough reserves to defend the currency meant that large speculative selling had not quite begun. 'They could not say that if the big money was involved,' said one London-based trader. Julian Jessop, of Midland Global Markets, confirmed this: 'Today's pressure on the krone is the collective action of many small players. There's no-one big in the market saying it has to go.' By and large, the situation was hard to gauge, as Malcolm Barr at Chemical Bank in London explained: 'There are echoes of the previous ERM tumults,' he said, 'but at the same time the crisis has a different character, it is less frantic, despite all the central bank interventions.' Few thought that the ERM could ultimately survive a Danish devaluation. 'The Danish have made a show of good faith by increasing their interest rates to help the krone,' said one analyst. 'If the Bundesbank does not help them by cutting rates, the markets will really begin to wonder if they would do it for the franc.' The dollar was largely sidelined by events in the ERM, although there was a brief rally in the dollar-yen rate with the announcement of unexpectedly good US trade data. This took the dollar to Y108.70 at one point, before falling back as European markets closed, finishing at Y108.15, only slightly above Thursday's Y108.20. Despite the ERM turbulence, sterling lost ground yesterday against the D-mark and the dollar, falling throughout the day to close at DM2.550 and Dollars 1.4790 in London, down 1 1/2 pfennigs, and nearly a cent, on Thursday's finish.</p>

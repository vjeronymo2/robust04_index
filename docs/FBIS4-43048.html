			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Winfried Muenster: "Amazing Spring Harmony in </F> the NATO Camp"]    [Text] Istanbul, 10 June -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher considers the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program  the "most important strategic institution since the founding of  NATO." This plain statement contains a gentle reminder to his  European partners, above all, his counterpart in Bonn, Klaus  Kinkel. At the beginning of the NATO spring meeting, Kinkel had  created the impression that he was toying with the idea of a  "special relationship" between the Alliance and Russia, which  could devalue the PFP (NATO jargon).    PFP is the invitation of the Alliance to the members of the  defunct Warsaw Treaty and the CIS republics to enter into an as  close relationship with NATO as each one of them wishes. For  its part, NATO stops short at giving security guarantees, but  holds out prospects of de facto membership for some PFP members.    It would be almost too good to be true if this invitation  were followed in a way that its initiators, the Americans, have  in mind. NATO would lead such a partnership and would be the  supporting pillar of a security architecture which would  virtually cover the globe north of the Tropic of Cancer. In  this connection, the inner cohesion of the transatlantic  Alliance would remain intact, and the status of the United  States as the power guaranteeing Europe's protection and  security would not be in jeopardy, despite Russia's presence.  The East European neighbors would get what they were really  seeking -- the warming closeness of the Western super power.    Thus Christopher's preventive resistance to a Russian chair  with a higher back was only consistent, since Moscow with its  demand for a special status had ulterior motives. Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev had specifically suggested that the NATO  Cooperation Council be integrated into the CSCE and NATO itself  be forced, through a binding consultation mechanism, into a  subordinate relationship with the CSCE.    This was of course not acceptable to any of the 16 NATO  allies. However, Christopher was the only one to make his allies  aware that the PFP was intended as a flexible concept to honor  Russia as the first power of the East. What else could a  special relationship between Moscow and NATO bring about? It  would certainly not replace or make unnecessary the higher  hierarchy of the U.S.-Russian relationship nor, for that matter,  the Europeans' search for orderly relations with the  postcommunist Moscow.    So the U.S. secretary of state argued logically by referring  the Russians with their special wishes to the national capitals  from the start. Of course, in so doing, he kept in mind that  Washington is the most important of all capitals. But there is  a difference if it is the United States or Russia that has  "ulterior motives." The outstanding U.S. position in any  European security structure is absolutely indispensable and the  centerpiece of the Western security philosophy.    It was not to be expected at any point that differences of  opinion on the PFP would lead to a conflict within NATO. There  was never a controversy, but there were differences over the  precise formulation. What is more, in the difficult transition  phase following the Cold War, the Alliance demonstrated almost  amazing harmony in Istanbul, which sheds a paradoxical light on  the European Union. The Alliance is ruled by the principle of  strict unanimity, whereas the European Union has long viewed  itself as something of higher value and even supranational.  Nonetheless, it has not yet found its course in Europe. In  NATO, however, even the French, the traditional dissidents, have  fully endorsed the PFP project.    In Istanbul, the West had to find an answer to Russia's  special wishes. The answer has been found, there will be no  special status. However, the discussion on the PFP and Russia's  place in the European security architecture has not yet ended.  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev used delaying tactics  in Istanbul and called for further talks. He would possibly  have agreed to a supplementary protocol that Kinkel had  suggested prior to the NATO meeting.    The German foreign minister's argument is not unrealistic.  Kinkel wants the Alliance to take into account that actually, it  does not have the leeway of action that it claims it has toward  Russia. He argues that NATO will be careful not to act against  Moscow's declared will in East Europe, because, moreover, this  would lead away from its goal, since security cannot be created  there in confrontation with Russia. Antagonism would devalue  the PFP and even reverse it. Its higher goal is to make Moscow  agree to East Europe's orientation to the West.    No front line in Europe, is the Germans' motto. In dealing  with Russia, however, the European allies are constantly  reminded of the fact that it is the United States that has the  decisive say on European security problems. Europe has always  fared well with this principle.</p>

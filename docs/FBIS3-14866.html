			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] How does Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev assess the situation in Bosnia  now?    [Begin Kozyrev recording] We are against the use of  aircraft,  and we have a proposal that the use of aircraft should be  forbidden in the strictest terms in all conflict areas. In  particular, we were among the initiators of the adoption of the  resolution on a flight-free zone, i.e. on the nonuse of aircraft  in Bosnia. Hence, whichever side used these aircraft, it has to  proceed from the assumption that full responsibility lies with  the violator of, in this case, the Security Council resolution.  Certainly this episode is yet more evidence that the road in  Bosnia should lie not in the escalation of violence, in the use  of aviation etc., but only in looking for a political  settlement.

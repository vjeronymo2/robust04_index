			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MULRONEY URGES UNITY, OFFERS PLAN ON QUEBEC  </P> <P> In a rare televised speech, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Thursday urged  Canadians to "join together," and he proposed ways of resolving linguistic and  constitutional arguments that have raised the possibility of Quebec splitting  off from the rest of Canada.  </P> <P> In an attempt at compromise, Mulroney said he will introduce a new set of  constitutional amendments into the Canadian House of Commons next week. His  gesture was a tacit admission that another constitutional package that he  himself had wanted is unacceptable. The compromise amendments are intended to  be added to Mulroney's original ones, which were crafted in 1987.  </P> <P> Mulroney's remarks came at a time of growing public uneasiness and frustration  in Canada over the political leadership's inability to agree on what the  country stands for and how to embody those principles in law.  </P> <P> Canada has been unable to get all 10 provinces to sign its constitution, as  required. Over the last few months, arguments about the constitution have grown  so bitter that prominent businessmen and politicians now routinely speculate on  what the future would be like without Quebec.  </P> <P> The current discord stems from 1982, when Canada "repatriated" its constitution  from Britain. (Before then, its constitution was essentially an act of the  British Parliament.) Each of Canada's 10 provinces was supposed to sign the  constitution, but Quebec refused.  </P> <P> To bring Quebec aboard, Mulroney oversaw the drafting of a set of amendments in  1987 -- a package that has come to be known as the Meech Lake accord, after the  Quebec resort where it was discussed.  </P> <P> The Meech Lake amendments were mainly about redistributing economic and  political power between the federal government and the provinces. However, they  also recognized Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada. Quebec was  satisfied with this. All 10 provinces are required to ratify the accord by June  23.  </P> <P> At first, there was little controversy, but then elections were held. Three  newly elected provincial premiers began expressing strong doubts about the  accord.  </P> <P> One of the worst sticking points was the clause declaring Quebec a "distinct  society." Quebec had just enacted a law barring the use of any language except  French on outdoor signs. That action fueled suspicions that the Meech Lake  clause would encourage other divisive acts, such as the province establishing  its own foreign policy.  </P> <P> Canada has been mired in this debate for months. Quebec has insisted that the  accord be ratified as written, Mulroney has backed Quebec and the three holdout  provincial premiers have said they won't sign unless the accord is modified.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, ordinary Canadians have been steaming over the energy spent on what  has appeared to be a hopeless impasse.  </P> <P> By announcing that he would make additions to the Meech Lake accord to get  things moving again, Mulroney made a nod toward the dissatisfied  English-speaking provinces. But he risked incurring the wrath of Quebec.  </P> <P> The new amendments would still grant Quebec a "distinct society" status, but  they would also make the federal government responsible for promoting  bilingualism all across Canada. And that would displease Quebec, where  French-speakers have argued that their language must be shielded from English  if it is to survive.  </P> <P> Mulroney's new package of amendments was first introduced by New Brunswick  Premier Frank McKenna earlier this week. McKenna, who was one of the three  holdouts on the Meech Lake accord, told reporters, "It's time for all of us to  spike our guns with flowers."  </P> <P> But there was no guarantee that Mulroney's attempt at compromise would take  root and grow.  </P> <P> Just hours before the prime minister delivered his address, Newfoundland  Premier Clyde Wells, another Meech Lake holdout, moved in his provincial  legislature to kill the accord.  </P></p>

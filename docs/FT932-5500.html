			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: British Land 3.9% ahead as property values pick up AS WELL as announcing the Pounds 500m property buying partnership and a Pounds 132m rights issue yesterday, British Land reported a 3.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 34.6m for the year to end-March, writes Maggie Urry. Mr John Ritblat, chairman, said that 'the signs of recovery which I signalled a year ago are now more widely discernible'. He said that since the recession began, the group had bought Pounds 900m of properties and those were now valued at Pounds 109m over purchase price. A final dividend of 4.72p (4.28p) is proposed to give a total of 7p (6.35p), a rise of 10.2 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share rose 6.4 per cent to 13.3p. The fall in the value of the group's properties over the year was 3.3 per cent, a smaller drop than the 10.5 per cent and 9.6 per cent of the two previous years. During the year the group bought Pounds 166m of properties and sold Pounds 113m. Net assets per share fell from 326p to 307p. Gross rental income rose by 15.3 per cent to Pounds 146.6m, a feature being the rent review at the Euston Tower, and operating income was up 18.3 per cent to Pounds 125.5m. There was a Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 6.3m) profit on property trading. However, the interest charge rose from Pounds 79.1m to Pounds 93.2m. Mr John Weston Smith, finance director, said that the debt/equity ratio had been reduced. Year-end net debt was Pounds 882m and shareholders funds were Pounds 718.4m (Pounds 763.8m). The group had exercised its right to convert its Pounds 115m convertible bonds into convertible preference shares and had issued a Pounds 200m, 35-year debenture. The group also has over Pounds 600m of bank facilities. The group's debt now has an average maturity of 19 years at an average cost of 9.58 per cent. Mr Weston Smith said that there had been a slight increase in the proportion of voids in the portfolio to 3 per cent, but that 50 per cent of the group's properties were occupied either by government agencies or FT-SE 100 companies. The UK office portfolio had fallen in value by 12.2 per cent, but within that City of London offices had fallen by 11.4 per cent compared with a 31 per cent drop the previous year.</p>

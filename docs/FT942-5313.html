			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Russia wins debt scheduling agreement Western governments, continuing efforts to support Russian economic reforms, agreed at the weekend to reschedule Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn) in debt owed by Russia in 1994. The deal reached in Paris reschedules over 15 years with three years' grace debts towards the Paris Club of creditor governments, which are owed more than half of Russia's Dollars 80bn foreign debt. Russia urgently needs to reschedule its foreign debt to get round the burden of loans of which a significant proportion fall due around this year. The International Monetary Fund has calculated that Russia, which has overestimated its trade surplus for this year, has to plug a Dollars 25bn gap in its balance of payments this year, compared to a gap of Dollars 15bn last year. This year's obligations include Dollars 14.5bn owed in principal payments, plus Dollars 6bn in interest - a burden partly alleviated by this weekend's rescheduling agreement. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting Russian finance minister who negotiated this weekend's agreement, told reporters in Paris he expected 'fairly difficult negotiations on the rescheduling of all our debts on a long-term basis' this autumn. Western governments and multilateral organisations such as the IMF are expected to bring new funds to Russia this year. But a rescheduling agreement with western commercial banks, which are owed another Dollars 26bn, continues to elude Russia for the second year in a row because of Russia's insistence that banks should not be able to seize state-owned assets if it defaults on repayment. While the governments say they do not want to write off Russian debts to preserve its ability to borrow new credits in the future, the banks are waiting for it to come round to their point of view, confident it will need western bank finance in future. Russia has allocated Dollars 4.1bn for debt servicing this year.</p>

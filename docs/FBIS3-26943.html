			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report of interview with Zhao Leji, director of Qinghai </F> Provincial Finance Department, by staff reporter Zuo Xiling  (1563 6007 3781): "Our Countermeasures Under the New Tax  System"]    [Text] The State Council has decided that a tax sharing  management system is to be fully implemented throughout the  country as of 1 January this year. This important  transformation in the financial distribution system will  undoubtedly bring about new changes in our province's financial  distribution structure and produce great impact on our  province's economic development. For this reason, this reporter  recently interviewed Comrade Zhao Leji, our provincial finance  department director.    This reporter has learned from Director Zhao's briefing  that,  in the long run, with the implementation of the tax sharing  financial system, the financial capacity of the central  authorities will be strengthened and able to regulate financial  distribution among various localities, optimizing resource  disposition to gradually narrow the gaps between various  localities in terms of economic and social development.  However, a fairly long period of time will be needed.  According to the principle of structural reform characterized  by separating the system from difficulties and giving priority  to ensure the smooth promulgation of the new economic system, in  establishing the tax sharing financial management system  involving the central authorities and localities, no special  consideration has been given to our province as a region of  minority nationalities. It is obvious that we are encountering  financial difficulties.    Although the tax system reform has not increased the tax  loads of enterprises in our province as a whole, our province  has faced greater challenge in the competition in the unified  market of the whole country because the level of economic  efficiency of enterprises in our province is generally low. In  this connection, Zhao Leji maintained that our province must  adopt the following relevant countermeasures:    We must be firm and unshakable in developing the economy.  Value-added tax is our province's major source of financial  income. According to the new tax system reform, the central  authorities will get 75 percent of the tax. Value-added tax is  a general tax category. As long as our economy has been  developed, we can get 25 percent of the tax. If we add the 30  percent rebates from the amount of tax increase to this, we can  get about 40 percent returns. The tax income rebates which the  central authorities give to various localities will definitely  be linked to the growth of the value-added tax and consumption  tax of the whole country according to a certain coefficient. It  is obvious that, as long as we are firm and unshakable in  promoting economic development, the central authorities can get  more and so can we. This is the only way out for our province  to extricate itself from its financial predicament.    We must regulate our ideas on development and cultivate  local  financial resources. With the implementation of the tax sharing  system, the structure of our province's financial resources will  also change. This new setup will definitely have an impact on  the growth of our province's local financial resources and also  play a role in guiding our province's economic development.  Under the prerequisite of conforming with the state industrial  policy, the focus of augmenting our province's financial  resources should be shifted to the vigorous development of those  trades and products which are directly connected with our local  financial resources. We should pay attention to devoting our  limited funds to projects and links which have obvious  efficiency and can increase local financial incomes to expand  Qinghai's local financial capacity. According to the new tax  system, the resource tax on the majority of items is regarded as  local income. Our province is rich in natural resources and we  must fully exploit this strong point. We must promote the  exploitation of our natural resources such as hydropower, salt  lakes, petroleum, natural gas, metals, mineral products, and  asbestos mines. Business tax and income tax from local  enterprises are the main sources of local revenues. We must  vigorously develop our tertiary industry, speed up the pace of  reform and opening up, fully combine the importing of advanced  technology with internal economic connections, and develop  nongovernment-owned economic sectors, including collective,  individual, private, and joint-stock enterprises. Our tertiary  industry has very great potential and we have bright prospects  for developing our financial resources.    We must try in every possible way to increase economic  efficiency in our state-owned enterprises. According to the tax  sharing system, localities will have their own due shares. The  purpose in doing so is to encourage localities to enhance  economic efficiency in state-owned enterprises. However, in our  province one-third of our state-owned enterprises obviously lose  money in business, one-third losing money latently, and only  one-third is truly making profit. Although the tax loads of our  state-owned enterprises have not yet become heavier as a result  of the implementation of the tax sharing system, various systems  have been strictly standardized, including those governing  enterprise tax, tax reduction and exemption, repayment of  investment loans, income distribution, and so on. The majority  of state-owned enterprises in our province cannot adapt  themselves to such changes. In particular, they are facing a  big challenge in the unified markets of the whole country and in  the great environment of fair competition. To enhance  enterprise efficiency under the new financial system, we must,  at least, grasp the following focal points: First, we must  develop a sense of efficiency. The economic work focus of local  governments is to grasp enhancement of enterprise efficiency.  Efficiency should mainly be regarded as a yardstick for  examining enterprise achievements. Second, we must enhance the  efficiency of scale (gui mo xiao yi 6016 2875 2400 4135) and  establish a base for efficiency resources to develop a structure  of group-type financial resources (xing cheng ji tuan xing de  cai yuan ti xi 1748 2054 7162 097 0992 4104 2088 3293 7555 4762)  to promote development of scale, management of scale, expansion  of scale, and enhance enterprise competitiveness in market  competition. Third, we must establish supervisory mechanisms for  financial resources and examine the efficiency of financial  resources at all levels. Fourth, we must establish a modern  enterprise system to invigorate our state-owned enterprises and  gradually relieve the state of its unlimited responsibilities  for enterprises.    We must transform government functions, speed up socialized  management, and provide excellent services. With the  implementation of the tax sharing system, on the basis of  defining the control powers of the central government, it is  necessary to further define the control powers of local  governments. In other words, trades and projects which are  closely connected with the development of the local social  economy and undertakings should be independently developed by  local governments. This can clearly show the direction for  speeding up the changeover of local government functions. Local  governments must firmly seize on this favorable opportunity to  switch from directly running enterprises and commanding their  production and business operations activities to strengthening  social management and basic facilities projects and providing  still better services for the operations of enterprises to  create an environment which is more beneficial to macroscopic  economic environment.    Comrade Zhao Leji also pointed out that apart from relying  on  ourselves to increase incomes considerably, strictly exercise  control over expenditure, and solve some difficulties, the key  lay in striving for the help of the central authorities, so that  when they are establishing a system which governs the transfer  of payment system they will fully consider Qinghai's  difficulties and give our province the necessary support.</p>

In a statement released  by the British High Commission in Maseru yesterday, Baroness  Chalker said the British Government is deeply concerned at the  fighting that has taken place between elements of the Royal  Lesotho Defense Force. She pledged support for the efforts of  the Commonwealth's secretary general who is doing everything  possible to help make arrangements for certain Commonwealth  countries to assist Lesotho at this difficult time.    A fact-finding mission, which is made up of Army generals  and  commanders of Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa arrived in  the country this morning to assess the situation here. A series  of meetings are scheduled between the army leadership and the  Commonwealth envoys following previous meetings that took place  yesterday.</p>

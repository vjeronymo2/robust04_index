			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Haider Cancels Appearances in FRG"] </F>   [Text] Munich -- The German "League of Free Citizens" has  canceled election campaign rallies with its Chairman Manfred  Brunner and Freedom Party of Austria Chairman Joerg Haider in  several German cities. On Thursday [2 June] League Spokesman  Michael Schwilk justified the cancellation by pointing to the  "massive threat" by "chaotic leftists." One does not want  "deliberately to get involved in new riots," Schwilk said.  Brunner and Haider had been attacked in Hamburg with paint bags  and eggs.    Only in Bavaria can one "still feel relatively safe." Haider  and Brunner's election rally in Munich, which is planned for  next Sunday, is to go ahead as planned.</p>

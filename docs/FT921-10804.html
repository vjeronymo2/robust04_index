			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Big power users fight electricity price rises BIG industrial users of energy such as GKN and Blue Circle Cement will refuse to pay part of their electricity bills in April, when annual supply contracts are renewed, in protest at price increases. The companies say they will not pay the element in their bills that goes towards the annual subsidy for the UK's nuclear generation sector. This subsidy represents 11 per cent of an industrial user's payment, amounting to some Pounds 350m for industry as a whole. At a recent meeting of large electricity users, companies expressed anger at the prospect of rises of 25 per cent to 30 per cent in their electricity bills this year. The Major Energy Users' Council will meet Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, on February 12 to discuss the issue and to express members' concern about rising electricity prices. Large users have complained for some time that rising prices in the electricity wholesale market - on which annual contracts are based - are affecting their ability to compete with continental rivals. 'In the UK, major users are paying the same prices as domestic customers,' said Mr Tom Lowes, chief energy buyer for Blue Circle. The users' group says regular customers using large amounts of electricity should get a discount. Mr Lowes said the UK cement industry needs electricity prices of 1.9p to 2p per kilowatt hour - or the equivalent of other fuels  - in order to compete with continental rivals. This year he expects to have to pay about 2.6p. 'There is no way to pass electricity price costs on to consumers in the current recession - if the price of cement is put up, the UK will just get more imports,' he said. Most industrial companies are squeezing their own suppliers to bring costs below the rate of inflation. 'I am buying some things where the price has gone down,' said one member of the energy users' council, 'and I am certainly not paying more than a 3 per cent increase for most supplies.' The UK's electricity suppliers have argued that prices in the wholesale market must rise to reflect the true cost of power.</p>

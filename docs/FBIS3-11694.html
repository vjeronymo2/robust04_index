An 18 March meeting at Planalto  Palace was the most sensitive moment on the fragile path of  return to democracy, which began when a civilian movement  elected Tancredo Neves. The military leadership's reaction to  the Judicial Branch and Congress found that Itamar Franco was  absolutely willing to play the role of Juan Bordaberry (a former  Uruguayan president who in 1973 agreed to military tutelage and  was finally ousted in 1976). The military reaction also found  that there are no leaders capable of putting out the fire. From  now on, government decisions will need military endorsement.    The political interpretation that is being made -- though in  a restrained, discreet manner -- is that since 18 March, the  independence of the branches of government has been put to the  test, and that a sudden expression of military support has  transformed an unconcerned president into a strong chief of  state. Consequently, from a formal viewpoint, there is a  president under military tutelage, a Congress with impaired  morale, and a judicial branch that is resisting in order to  avoid kneeling down.    The 18 March meeting was dramatic. Civilian ministers with a  seat in Congress were excluded under the pretext of suspicion:  The agenda included salaries and, therefore, it was a matter of  personal, direct interest to Congress (as if the matter were not  also of personal interest to the military). Civilian Household  Chief Henrique Hargreaves and General Secretary Mauro Durante  began the meeting. The others, only four, arrived later, after  pressing calls.    The military chiefs gave their message in various forms.  Admiral Mario Flores (head of the Strategic Affairs Secretariat  -- SAE) outlined the more radical proposals, like closing  Congress, replacing STF [Supreme Federal Court] judges, and  calling for general elections (not for president). Flores  mentioned these proposals as information. If the president had  been receptive to these ideas, they would have turned into a  formal proposal; if not, they were reports conveyed by the  appropriate official.    For the military, the episode is a history of treason that  began in the negotiations phase before the economic program's  issuance. The harshest crisis of this episode occurred on 18  March at Planalto Palace, and the outcome is still unknown. It  is not merely a salary crisis but, above all, a crisis that has  uncovered the lack of maturity of the current members of the  three branches for the full exercise of democracy, and this  breach provides room for adventures.    The military leadership attempted to convince the economic  leadership to convert its salaries on the basis of the URV [Real  Value Unit] in force on 15 March. This request was denied after  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso gave assurances that  the conversion date for all salaries would be the 30th. In  giving that answer to the military, Cardoso was leaning on a  previous agreement with the STF, to which the provisional  measure enforcing the economic plan was submitted, having been  encouraged to go ahead.    Information that helped break the resistance of the  military,  which wanted to move the conversion of their salaries to an  earlier date, was the compulsory salary equity embedded in the  economic plan's provisional measure based on the mechanism of  dates: By setting the 30th as the date for conversion of all  salaries, the Executive Branch had in practice increased the  duration of the work month for the two other branches by 10 days  -- which traditionally pay their salaries on the 20th -- thus  enforcing salary equity. The Judicial Branch killed that "egg of  Columbus" the economic team believed it had found.    After learning that the STF and Congress made the conversion  on the 20th, the military felt it should not abide by any  previous commitment. They pressured President Itamar Franco, in  the absence of Minister Cardoso, to a forceful position,  rejecting the claim by STF Chairman Otavio Galotti that he would  enforce the Constitution. Galotti availed himself of Article 168  of the Constitution, but this article only sets forth that  transfer of executive branch funds must be done before the 20th,  without specifying whether salaries must be paid on that date.</p>

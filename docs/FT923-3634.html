			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Ukraine may bring back state controls THE Ukrainian government is to reintroduce state control of wages and prices, according to an economic action plan to be presented to parliament next Tuesday. The economic blueprint reflects the pragmatic and heavy-handed approach of its author, Mr Valentyn Symonenko, first deputy prime minister. The proposals of his more reformist predecessor, Mr Volodymyr Lanovoy, were praised by western experts but strangled by government infighting. However, Mr Symonenko, who has been granted wide powers to rule the Ukrainian economy by decree, has already won the approval of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr Vitold Fokin, the prime minister. If parliament backs his proposal next week, the plan will represent an unprecedented political consensus on what to do with Ukraine's faltering economy. Mr Symonenko has warned that Ukraine has fallen victim to a dangerous inflationary spiral of rising wages and prices. In a diagnosis that echoes the International Monetary Fund's report on Ukraine, the plan identifies the ballooning budget deficit, the collapse of the financial system and the deterioration of inter-republican trade as the main sources of Ukraine's economic malaise. When the IMF visited Kiev last week, their request for a written copy of the programme was denied. The IMF has yet to see the complete programme. Mr Symonenko's remedy is, in the short-term, to tighten administrative control over all sectors of the economy. In the long term, the plan insists that Ukraine is headed for a market economy and views privatisation and the introduction of a separate Ukrainian currency as the main forces to propel it along that path. Mr Symonenko's plan calls for stricter limits on the emission of credit and a curbing of the budget deficit, already running at Rbs69.6bn. Concrete proposals for reining in the deficit include ending the disastrous practice of allowing state enterprises to cover their own financial shortfall out of the government's budget, restricting industrial and agricultural subsidies, which currently place the greatest strain on the budget, and making the funding of all government programmes conditional on the government having sufficient revenue.</p>

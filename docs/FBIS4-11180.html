			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, National Action Party  [PAN] candidate for president, has ruled out the possibility  that an alliance of all the opposition forces in Mexico can  defeat the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] in the coming  August elections. Nevertheless, he said alliances could work  under certain circumstances to advance democracy and defend the  vote.    [Begin Fernandez recording] We can and should work with any  political party to advance democracy. [end recording]    During a news conference held at the foreign correspondents  section, Fernandez said there are two basic requirements for  holding pure, credible elections. First, the PRI should lower  its publicity expenses to keep them within legal limitations.  Second, the media should allocate time to candidates equitably  and serve the truth honestly.</p>

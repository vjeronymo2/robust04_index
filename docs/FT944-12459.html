			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices below the best following US data - Market report Economic data from the US dominated the London market yesterday, and although an attempt was made to break away above the FT-SE 3,100 mark, shares backed off when Wall Street fell at the opening of the new session. Once again, trading volume was very thin, causing increased volatility in London stocks. The FT-SE 100-share Index closed 13.6 up at 3,097.4, having moved towards 3,100 at the finish as markets steadied after an initially bearish reaction to rises in the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index and in US personal incomes, both seen as inflation threatening. Nervousness over inflationary pressures on interest rates were heightened in London after the announcement of a 7.3 per cent gain in domestic MO money supply, and a modest rise in the British Purchasing Managers' prices index set the scene for further important developments this week. Today brings publication of the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, and the monthly meeting between the chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England takes place tomorrow. Some analysts believe that the chances that UK base rates will be raised before the end of the year have increased as economic data in the US has suggested that economic expansion is bringing inflationary pressure in its train. However, Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney said he did not believe that a further policy tightening in the UK 'would be valid' at the moment. Inflationary pressure, he noted, is coming chiefly through commodity prices, over which the UK authorities have no control. Base rate worry cut into UK bond prices and this undermined a brave start by equities which took the Footsie index to within a few points of 3,100 in very early deals. The domestic economic data helped to reverse early gains and push the Footsie briefly into negative territory, taking it down to 3,079. However, a strong stock index futures market soon took underlying equities ahead again. By mid-session the market was comfortably through the 3,100 barrier with a gain of nearly 28 points on the Footsie. The negative reaction from Wall Street and the US bond markets to the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index soon undermined markets in Europe, and the advance in the London market was checked, share prices briefly losing about one-third of early gains before the Dow Jones Industrial Average steadied. The Dow index had trimmed its fall to around 8 points when London closed for the day. Traders shook their heads over another volatile session which had seen the market move through a range of more than 30 points, in both plus and minus trends on the Footsie, yet still brought disappointing turnover. Seaq volume was down to 486.7m shares from Friday's total which exceeded 500m. Renewed strength in the utility stocks, seen as candidates for further share buybacks or special dividends, boosted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which moved forward 15.3 to 3,516.9. But the blue chips, discouraged by the dollar's lack of vitality, focused around prospects for company trading news. Oil shares were strong as higher crude prices and Wall Street's response to good statements from the US oil majors set the scene for trading results due this morning from British Petroleum. Shares in BP hit new highs in sterling and dollar terms yesterday, fuelled by hopes for good news on the dividend front. A further easing in the British Aerospace shares, while VSEL remained just under the GEC offer price, suggested that the market is assuming that GEC will emerge as the winner from the bid duel.</p>

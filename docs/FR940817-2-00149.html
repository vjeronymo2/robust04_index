			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Notice to Interested Persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Those persons who may be interested in the pendency of the requested exemption include the fiduciaries of Plans which have invested, as of the effective date of this exemption, in HighMark and/or in any of the Funds, where the Bank served as investment adviser to such Funds and also served in any capacity as fiduciary for such Plans. In addition, it is represented that many other Plans for which the Bank serves in any capacity as a fiduciary may from time to time invest in HighMark and/or in any of the Funds to which the Bank may serve as investment adviser in the future. For this reason, the Bank does not know the number of Plans which may therefore be affected by this proposed exemption. Accordingly, the Department has determined that the only practical form of providing notice to interested persons is the distribution by the Bank by first class mail of a copy of the notice of pendency of this proposed exemption (the Notice) within thirty (30) days of the date of the publication of such Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to the fiduciaries of any of the Plans which are invested, on the date of the publication of the Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , in HighMark and/or any the Funds to which the Bank serves as investment adviser. Such distribution to interested persons shall include a copy of the Notice, as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , plus a copy of the supplemental statement, as required, pursuant to 29 CFR 2570.43(b)(2), which shall inform such interested persons of their right to comment and to request a hearing. The Bank also represents that it will provide a copy of the proposed exemption and/or a copy of the final exemption, if granted, to any Second Fiduciary of a Plan upon request. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Angelena C.

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Banks stay under pressure as carmakers rise Equity markets move in sequence, said Mr Robin Griffiths of James Capel yesterday, and on that basis the big buying of continental European stocks has yet to come, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Griffiths's technical analysis, broadly, backed up Capel's fundamental choice of markets in 1994. In Europe, ex the UK, they include France, Sweden, Italy and Spain to the exclusion of Switzerland and Germany, in particular. Mr Griffiths, however, pointed out that technical analysts look strongly at the fundamentals. 'If the world moves as it should,' he said, 'the two should talk with one voice.' FRANKFURT reflected the prevalent loss of faith in bank shares, and the global upsurge of confidence in automotive industry stocks. The Dax index rose 33.67 on the session to 2,118.96 - consolidating Wednesday's post-bourse gains - and held its ground to finish the afternoon at 2,119.69. Turnover eased from DM10.6bn to DM9.9bn. Rises of just over 1 per cent at Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank were only weak on the margin, but they followed a bad day on Wednesday. In carmakers BMW kept the bulk of its short covering gains on Wednesday afternoon, but it was still up DM26 to DM803 on the session with Daimler almost alongside at DM819, up DM18.20, and Volkswagen DM9 higher at DM450. Mr Glen Liddy at Kleinwort Benson said that banks had been waiting just too long for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. Kleinwort likes BMW, which rose again to DM816 in the post-bourse, looking for intrinsic earnings growth as Rover sales increase over the next two years, and synergy benefits thereafter as BMW and Rover are put together; but Daimler, said Mr Liddy, might find it hard to justify the gains currently coming piggyback on the BMW story. PARIS took a breather after Wednesday's break through 2,300, and the CAC-40 index closed off 5.29 at 2,296.77. Turnover was FFr4.9bn. Peugeot stood out with a FFr23 gain to FFr870. There have been a number of conflicting recommendations on the car group this week, with one US broker moving downwards and a French house taking the opposite tack yesterday. Elf Aquitaine ended down FFr6.50 at FFr424.30 as the public offer period came to an end, with estimates suggesting that it was at least 2.5 times subscribed. The results of the public offer will be made known on Monday after the bourse has closed; the offer price for institutions will also be revealed at the same time. AMSTERDAM was interested in KNP BT and Nedlloyd although the AEX finished barely altered, off 0.08 at 437.32. KNP BT, the paper group, advanced to a day's high of Fl 52.00, before finishing up Fl 2.50 at Fl 50.50 ahead of today's results. The stock was assisted by bullish comments by the company chairman yesterday, reiterating a view that a return to profit would be seen this year. Hoare Govett put out a buy recommendation on the stock recently and suggested that restructuring measures should enable the group to achieve a 20 per cent return on investments by 1996-1997. Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group, a strong performer so far this week on forecasts that it will return to profit this year, notched up a further Fl 1.90 to Fl 80.40. ZURICH was marked 1.4 per cent lower as domestic institutional investors saw firm early prices as an opportunity to launch another round of profit-taking. Late foreign selling also helped to push the SMI index 42 lower to 3,012.2, taking the cumulative fall this week to 4.9 per cent. Banks remained under pressure with UBS bearers, topping the actives list, shedding SFr26 to SFr1,439. Roche certificates, widely viewed as having led the recent rally, lost SFr140 to SFr6,950. Motor-Columbus added SFr25 to SFr1,750 after the chief executive was quoted as saying that there were potential buyers for the telecommunications and energy group, after its recent comprehensive restructuring. Sulzer rose SFr21 to SFr936 in response to the engineering group's announcement that it was merging its worldwide paper activities with those of Germany's Voith. MILAN absorbed technically inspired selling ahead of today's end of the February account as renewed demand emerged for the recently overshadowed telecoms sector. The Comit index edged 0.29 lower to 679.83. Stet was L106 higher at L4,739 after remarks by its Stet chairman were interpreted as suggesting that Sip would retain its mobile telephone business - and profits - throughout this year. Sip added L80 to L4,407. Ferruzzi rose L38 to L2,042 in heavy volume of 43m shares after the conclusion of its capital raising exercise. IMI gave up L344 to L13,086 on profit-taking after after last week's privatisation and Wednesday's market debut. STOCKHOLM, strongly tipped by a number of analysts as a star performer this year, fell 2.1 per cent on interest rate and corporate worries. The Affarsvarlden index shed 32.7 to 1,533.5. Ericsson B shares were SKr5 lower at SKr356 in spite of its more than doubled pre-tax profits. ISTANBUL tumbled another 10.2 per cent, down 1,697,89 to a provisional close of 14,087.82, for a cumulative 51.2 per cent fall since the all time high of January 13. TEL AVIV's Mishtanim index recovered by 4.35, or 1.8 per cent to 240.22 in response to the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo. However, dealers said that the broad market was still on a downtrend. Many small-capitalisation stocks, they said, closed the week with heavy losses after Wednesday's disclosure that two Israeli portfolio managers had been arrested on suspicion of manipulating shares in eight companies.

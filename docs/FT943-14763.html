			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Northern chambers report steady economic growth The business climate is improving steadily across most of the north of England and Scotland but export performance is patchy and mid-term confidence has fallen in the north-east, a clutch of surveys showed yesterday. The surveys, by three chambers of commerce, suggest that Scottish companies are the most optimistic in the northerly regions. Economic recovery is strengthening in Scotland with business confidence rising in all sectors except retailing, and demand increasing faster than in the first quarter of the year, according to the Scottish chambers of commerce. Optimism rose in the Scottish construction industry on the back of a modest rise in orders from the private sector, but orders in the public sector remained a cause of concern. Business improved in the tourism and leisure sectors. There is a significant rise in confidence among Scottish manufacturers, which reported a strong increase in sales and orders. This picture was at odds with surveys in north and north-east England, which both reported poorer export conditions. A quarterly survey by the Northern Development Company in association with the Teesside and Tyne and Wear Chambers of Commerce says companies in the north-east and Cumbria found improvements in UK sales and orders as well as export sales in the second quarter. There has been a fall in export orders, however, and in investment in plant, machinery and buildings. The survey shows business confidence in the medium term falling. A quarterly survey by Sheffield and Rotherham chamber of commerce and industry was slightly more upbeat. Companies said that demand and output were showing continuous, if uneven, growth in domestic markets. More than half of the manufacturers in the survey reported rising sales in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of the year, when 42 per cent said sales were up. Order books are growing, although export markets were disappointing.</p>

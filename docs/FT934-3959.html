			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Orchestra inquiry acts over criticisms The Arts Council plans to publish the controversial Hoffman report on London orchestras to allay criticisms of proposed funding changes. The changes would increase the Philharmonia's subsidy at the expense of the London Philharmonic and the Royal Philharmonic. The council's members, led by Lord Palumbo, the chairman, are expected to decide soon whether to implement the recommendation that the Philharmonia should receive a subsidy of about Pounds 1.2m, compared with Pounds 700,000 last year, while subsidies of the RPO and LPO are halved. The proposal has been made by the council's advisory panel on music, chaired by Mr Bryan Magee, the writer and former MP, following a meeting on Friday. The recommendation, based on a report by a special committee chaired by the judge, Sir Leonard Hoffmann, has attracted criticism because it puts the future of the RPO and the LPO in doubt. If the changes go ahead the RPO may move its base from London to Nottingham. A council member said there have been discussions between the Arts Council and Nottingham City Council on the relocation of the RPO. He said Nottingham was enthusiastic about providing a new home for the RPO, and added: 'They talked about building a new concert hall.' The Hoffman committee's report was being sent to council members yesterday. It says that the Philharmonia is better than the RPO and LPO by a wide margin on all criteria except marketing expertise and educational functions. Another council member said: 'On artistic and management grounds it is clearly ahead of the others.' Mr Magee and Lord Palumbo are convinced that London has too many orchestras and that council resources should be concentrated on just one of the three plus the London Symphony Orchestra, which is resident at the Barbican. The orchestras had originally feared that the losers from the Hoffmann review would receive no subsidy at all. Many council members believe that its reputation as a policy maker will be severely damaged if it fails to implement the Hoffmann recommendation. One council member said: 'If we back down on this one the council's cred-ibility will be shot to pieces.' Some council members are concerned that the recommendation will put the council in conflict with London's South Bank arts complex, which has given a long-term residency to the LPO. A council member said: 'There must be a danger that the South Bank would refuse to book the Philharmonia.' A Pounds 4m scenery store for the Royal Opera House is to be built near Aberdare in the Cynon Valley, south Wales. The store will receive an urban investment grant of more than Pounds 1m and will house all the opera house's scenery and props, which are now kept in several buildings near London.</p>

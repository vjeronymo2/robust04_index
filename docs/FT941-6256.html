			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Low newsprint prices keep Abitibi in red Low paper prices drove Abitibi-Price, the world's biggest newsprint producer, to its fourth consecutive year of losses in 1993, writes Bernard Simon. The Toronto-based company said newsprint prices in North America had shown no signs of recovery this year. However, it was counting on a combination of higher offshore prices, a 7 per cent cut in North American discounts, and price rise to lift operating results during 1994. Net losses last year totalled CDollars 121.7m (USDollars 90.1m), or CDollars 1.71 a share, a significant improvement on 1992's CDollars 220.9m deficit, equal to CDollars 3.19 a share. The results include a narrowing in losses from discontinued operations, to CDollars 13.4m from CDollars 27.8m. Sales rose to CDollars 1.87bn from CDollars 1.60bn while operating losses fell to CDollars 39.8m from CDollars 138.1m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Bardin: "The State Customs Committee Is </F> Setting Up a Fund as Part of the Federal Budget; the Customs  Service Will Be Self-Financed"]    [Text] The customs service has the most clearly  defined--on the level of federal law--operating base of all the  Russian agencies. The customs code specifically envisages the  creation of a special self-financing fund. In accordance with  this, a statute on the extra-budgetary fund for the development  of the Russian customs system was drafted, was approved by a  government decree, and was officially circulated yesterday.    The customs code created a new niche for Russian business  developing under the patronage of the State Customs Committee.  Of course, the customs service is not in dire straits. It  collects fees for licenses authorizing the use of a particular  customs procedure (for opening a customs or free warehouse, for  example) or qualifying certificates (particularly those granting  the right to act as a customs broker). The inclusion of credit  institutions guaranteeing the payment of customs fees in the  register also costs the banks a certain amount. Now these  payments, along with the traditional customs fees, the proceeds  from the sale of confiscated contraband and of property used as  security deposits, fines and other penalties, will be used to  set up a fund for the development of the customs system.    The fund is called extra-budgetary, but the approved statute  defines its resources as federal property and as part of the  federal budget. At the same time, the fund will be managed and  administered by the State Customs Committee and will not be  subject to expropriation. There is an obvious contradiction  here. It is clear that proceeds from the customs business will  be budget revenue. As for the use of these proceeds, however,  although the procedure for allocating budget resources for other  than their designated purpose is extremely complicated, it would  be wrong to completely exclude the possibility of a situation in  which the Ministry of Finance might shock the customs service  with the news that all of its money is gone. In short, the  extra-budgetary status of the customs fund is extremely  conditional. Only one thing is absolutely clear: The money in  the fund will not be subject to capitalization, distinguishing  it from a pension fund. Therefore, although the fund is certain  to improve the life of customs service personnel, the use of  this money will be subject to definite limits and could be  opposed by the Ministry of Finance.    [Box]  <H5>  The Customs Service Plans To Use the Fund for the Following </H5> Purposes:    --to combat crime in the customs sphere;    --to improve customs control and the customs registration of  freight shipments;    --to establish currency control and strategic export  control;    --to keep customs statistics;    --to provide state agencies, enterprises, and citizens with  information about customs procedures;    --to strengthen the material and technical base and develop  the social sphere of the customs system;    --to build and renovate vehicle checkpoints on the border;    --to build customs warehouses, temporary storage facilities,  and other structures;    --to finance measures connected with the financial and  personal security and social protection of customs service  personnel "in areas not covered by budget financing";    --to maintain the scientific research institutions of the  State Customs Committee;    --to finance enterprises of the customs system whose  operations will supplement the fund;    --to supplement resources for the financial incentives and  sociocultural measures of customs agencies (no more than 75  percent of total wages).</p>

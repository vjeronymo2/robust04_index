			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade Feb 22 (CTK) -- Nikola Koljevic, spokesman  of the Bosnian Serbs, today described as very interesting Czech  Defence Minister Antonin Baudys' proposal for solving the  conflict in Bosnia.    Baudys' proposal consists mainly in setting up a  seven-member  Executive Committee of Good Will (ECGW), including countries  "connected by their religious and cultural values" to the  warring groups in Bosnia. Russia, Greece, Pakistan, Turkey,  France and Italy could become members of such a committee,  Baudys suggested on Saturday [19 February].    "For us it is a new proposal. It should be discussed in  Skupstina (parliament). Nevertheless it is very interesting  especially because it is a practical proposal," Koljevic,  vice-president of the Serbian Republic in Bosnia, told CTK by  telephone from Pale near Sarajevo.    At the same time, he voiced certain doubts over "the  possibility of implementation of the proposal in practice."  Difficulties would arise in connection with full disarmament  which has been already unambiguously rejected by the Moslem side  at the Geneva talks, he said.    "However at least the restriction of weapons could certainly  be discussed. It would represent great progress since a truce,  if not peace, could be more easily achieved by this and the  antagonistic ethnic groups would have greater certainty. This  would be more realistic," Koljevic said.</p>

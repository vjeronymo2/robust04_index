			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Microchip success spurs Acorn share price SHARES IN Acorn Computers, the Cambridge-based workstation manufacturer in which Olivetti of Italy has a majority stake, have risen by about 40 per cent in the past few days. Throughout December, the price hovered around the 40p mark; yesterday it closed at 56p, having soared over 70p earlier in the week. The likely cause is news that a microprocessor chip developed by a subsidiary is to be used for a series of new US consumer electronics products. Acorn issued a statement yesterday denying knowledge of any factors which could have caused the share price movement. Mr Sam Wauchope, Acorn managing director, said there was nothing beneath the surface which had not been made public. Acorn, which made its reputation in the UK supplying computers to schools, holds a 49 per cent stake in Advanced Risc Machines, a semiconductor design house.</p>

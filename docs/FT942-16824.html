			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Average earnings rise by 3.6% The upward shift in the annual increase in average earnings across the economy to 3.6 per cent in January disguises wide sectoral variations from  2.1 per cent in agriculture and forestry to 9.3 per cent in coal and coke, Incomes Data Services, the pay analysis group, says today. The sharp increases in coal and coke are because those left in the industry are in the most productive pits with the highest earnings. Earnings in services rose by 3.2 per cent, less than manufacturing at 4.7 per cent. But within the service sector, pay in banking and finance rose by 5.6 per cent, well above education and health services with 1.2 per cent, and hotels and catering with 0.9 per cent. Within manufacturing, the highest increase was recorded in motor vehicles and parts, at 6.9 per cent - just ahead of metal goods at 6.4 per cent. The modest overall increase in average earnings - from 3.1 per cent in December to 3.6 per cent in January - was the first reversal of the steady downward trend of the past three years. The IDS report also shows that about half of the 4.7m women working part-time in Britain pay no income tax or National Insurance. The Department of Employment estimates that in April 1993 there were 2.6m women employees earning less than the PAYE threshold of Pounds 66.25 a week. Of these, 2.3m earned below the National Insurance lower limit of Pounds 56 a week. IDS comments: 'If most of the new jobs in Britain give earnings below these thresholds it is not good news for the chancellor.' IDS Report 662. 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

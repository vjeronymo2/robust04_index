			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi by Silvana </F> Mazzocchi; place and date not given: "Biondi: It will Backfire  on Mafia"]    [Text] Rome -- [Mazzocchi] Minister, [former Mafia boss]  Riina has issued a political message urging the government to  change the law on people who turn state's evidence and attacking  prison regulations for top criminals. What reassurances do you  think you can provide?    [Biondi] This will backfire on Riina: The law on criminals  that turn state's evidence will remain in force, and will in  fact be stepped up; I guarantee it. The Italian people can feel  confident: There will be no yielding on the government's part.    [Mazzocchi] Riina talked about a "communist conspiracy" and  addressed the government with unprecedented boldness and  disdain. And he did so in a court of law. How was that possible?    [Biondi] It is to be expected that a prisoner will complain  about prison regulations and that a defendant will complain  about those who accuse him. Just as it was to be expected that  he would take advantage of this tense situation in Italian  society to issue warnings and judgments. However, I regret that  the very people who should have expected it did not do so. In  prison Riina is subject to rule 41B, the toughest regulation.  So the fact that a man who is guarded day and night can speak  from a court of law, addressing the whole nation, if not a  crime, is certainly an error.    [Mazzocchi] What measures has the government adopted?    [Biondi] I have ordered an inspection. I hope soon to have  all the necessary information, and the Higher Magistrates  Council will reach a verdict on what has happened.    [Mazzocchi] What is your answer to those who are urging you  to make a statement?    [Biondi] I do not need to submit to any investigation either  with regard to the steadfastness that I will be able to  maintain, or with regard to the fact that I will not submit to  Mafia intimidation. And merely to think that an institutional  government could yield to Riina's threats is insulting and  offensive. The struggle against the Mafia remains an absolute  priority for this government, within observance of the law, of  course. So I cannot fail to agree with [former chairman of the  parliamentary Anti-Mafia Committee] Luciano Violante, when he  argues that the struggle against organized crime must not  separate the majority from the opposition.    [Mazzocchi] Let us return to Riina's demands. You promised  changes to the law on people who turn state's evidence. Do you  not think that now they would seem like a concession?    [Biondi] The fact that he demanded the abolition of the law  certainly causes us some concern in this regard. But I will  confine myself to examining what can be changed without being  weakened. And there are no plans to eliminate or weaken the  measures governing prison regulations as defined under Rule 41B  or to alter the legislation on people who turn state's evidence.  This, at least with regard to the ways in which evidence is  gathered. However, as regards the relationship between the  custody of someone who has turned state's evidence and his  handling during the trial stage or the methods for establishing  his reliability (not for the purposes of the trial, but for  practical purposes) with a view to any rewards, I noted which  points might be examined by a special committee formed by Conso.  The law must be brought into line with the principles of the a  constitutional state. We must be sure about what the person  turning state's evidence says, so that we can submit his  statements as decisive evidence in trials.    [Mazzocchi] What kind of changes are you talking about?    [Biondi] We must resolve certain problems concerning the  management of people who turn state's evidence. Must the people  who hold him in detention be the same as those who interview  him? How is his reliability to be established? The solution of  these and other problems does not weaken the struggle against  the Mafia, but indeed strengthens it. I can therefore guarantee  that the government will not take any steps that could weaken  the effectiveness of the law governing criminals who turn  state's evidence. And if Riina was hoping to address his  warning to a weak and indulgent government, I really think he  chose the wrong target. Because it will only backfire on him, as  I said before.    [Mazzocchi] Are you promising greater severity?    [Biondi] No, he will not make me alter course; not at all.  But since the public cannot fail to have been struck by what  has happened, I can assure you that not only will there be no  changes to guarantees of security (which is the responsibility  of the interior minister) but also that the judicial judgment of  criminals turning state's evidence will be carried out by the  judiciary with the same instruments that they have used hitherto.</p>

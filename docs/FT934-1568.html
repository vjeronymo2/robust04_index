			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Annenberg gives Dollars 500m to help troubled US schools Teachers labouring in US schools beset by violence and declining results yesterday received an early Christmas present. Mr Walter Annenberg, the publishing magnate and philanthropist who was President Richard Nixon's ambassador to London, announced he would give Dollars 500m (Pounds 335m) to help improve the US public education system. The 85-year-old Mr Annenberg, who has already donated hundreds of millions of dollars to universities and private schools, said he had been deeply troubled by the violence in some schools. 'If this continues it will not only erode the educational system but will destroy our way of life in the United States.' The gift is the largest ever made to the US public education system. It will initially include a Dollars 60m grant to the New American Schools Development Corporation, a government-sponsored initiative to promote innovation in education, and Dollars 15m for the Education Commission of the States to help local governments reform their school systems. Mr Annenberg will also give Dollars 15m to set up an Institute for School Reform at Brown University. The rest of the gift will be channelled through other educational organisations. Educators have expressed growing concern about the difficulties of teaching in schools whose students routinely carry guns and knives. Many inner city schools have set up metal detectors to screen students. One recent study showed that 100,000 students bring guns to school every day. Mr Annenberg, who sold his Triangle magazine publishing empire to Mr Rupert Murdoch for Dollars 3bn five years ago, earlier this year gave Dollars 120m each to the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California, and Dollars 100m to the Peddie School, a preparatory school which he attended.</p>

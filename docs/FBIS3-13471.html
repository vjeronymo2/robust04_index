More than 20 Jordanian companies will display clothes,  furniture, medicine and other products at an international  exhibition in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this  month, they said.    "The participation in this fair and other fairs is aimed at  restoring Jordanian manufacturers' share of the Gulf market to  the pre-Gulf crisis level," a spokesman for the participating  companies said in a statement.    "These non-traditional markets require a different set of  marketing and manufacturing standards and our manufacturers are  trying to meet them. In terms of quality and service, most  companies have undergone restructuring while revamping their  marketing practices to face new challenges."    Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states were among the biggest  markets for Jordanian products before they halted dealing over  its alleged sympathy with Iraq. Amman has denied backing Iraq's  1990 invasion of Kuwait and has tried to several times to  restore links but has been rebuffed.    The six members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,  Bahrain  and the UAE-- were also the main financial backers of Jordan  before the war, providing more than 12 billion dollars in aid  and billions more in remittances.    A suspension of Gulf aid aggravated Jordan's economic  problems, which include a debt of around eight billion dollars.    The Jordan Trade Association, the country's main export  promoter representing more than 80 firms, is spearheading the  participation in the March 16-20 fair in Dubai, the organisers,  al-Fajir company, said.</p>

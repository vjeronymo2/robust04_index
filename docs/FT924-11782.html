			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher In retrospect, it is easy to see how the Albert Fisher magic worked. A company with a plausible line about European food integration and economies of scale issues highly priced paper to buy lowly rated fruit trading businesses. It also takes the precaution of deferring part of the purchase price through earn-out contracts. The result is electrifying earnings growth until the deferred cash payments come home to roost. And sadly, the business does not yield the growth or synergies required to feed investors' heady expectations. Hence the company's sliding rating relative to the market over the past five years. Now the bubble has well and truly burst, the company will have a hard task generating the organic growth to replace acquisitions. The new chairman, Mr Stephen Walls, promises to tidy up and look for ways to increase value for shareholders. Even if he were to juggle assets with other food companies, the reconstituted sum seems unlikely to be worth more than the current parts. And it is difficult to place a high valuation on what looks more and more like a commodity trading company. Earthquakes, riots and hurricanes cut US profits last year, while near-perfect growing conditions elsewhere slashed European earnings. Besides, the company's trading problems do not begin and end with freak conditions in 1992. Over-competition in fresh produce, partly caused by renewed South African exports, will keep downward pressure on world fruit prices. Meanwhile the last drop of net cash will drain out of the business this year on capital expenditure and earn-out payments. The worst may be over, but shareholders have little to look forward to.</p>

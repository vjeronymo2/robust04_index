			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil coffee exports fall Brazil exported 1.3m sacks of coffee in August, down from 2.2m for the same month last year, according to figures from the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters (FEBEC). Due to record low prices, receipts were off even more sharply, at Dollars 64.3m for the month, compared to Dollars 151.4m last year. Despite lower monthly export figures, volume for the first eight months saw a 0.6 per cent increase compared to the same period last year, standing at 11.6m sacks. Again, depressed prices hurt income, down 23.1 per cent. This year's receipts through August were Dollars 700.8m, down from Dollars 911.5m for the same period in 1991.</p>

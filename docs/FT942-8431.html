			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Sickly steel Mr Karel van Miert, Europe's competition commissioner, may have been a shade premature yesterday in announcing the death of his 15-month-old plan to cut excess capacity in the European steel industry. Though the plan looks increasingly fragile, its condition need not be terminal. On balance, it is probably still just worth trying to revive it. The latest complications are, for once, not due to resistance by EU governments or steelmakers. Indeed, Brussels finally seems to be making headway in persuading unsubsidised producers to offer production cuts needed to complete the package by the end of this year. Rather, the cause is an unexpected decision by Mr van Miert's fellow commissioners to veto a proposed revision of the plan's terms to cover small steelmakers in northern Italy. Since the issue turns on legal technicalities, and not on principle, it ought to be soluble. It cannot seriously be argued that the plan deserves to survive because it is perfect. It manifestly is not. The child of political compromise, it calls on efficient, unsubsidised steelmakers to shoulder too much of the adjustment and requires too little of flabby state-owned producers. These had to be bribed into co-operation with promises of still further subsidies. Furthermore, some of their proposed capacity cuts look bogus. The strongest case for the plan is that the alternatives look even worse. Scuttling it would be unlikely to encourage healthy rationalisation. The more probable result would be another subsidy race which would penalise efficient producers and invite fresh US trade sanctions against European steel exports. The Commission's other option would be to declare a 'manifest crisis', empowering it to impose cuts and fix prices. That failed abysmally when tried in the 1980s. The commissioners should try again to settle their differences. That is far from an ideal outcome. But while European governments refuse to let the market solve industrial problems for which their past policies were largely responsible, it looks the least bad course available.</p>

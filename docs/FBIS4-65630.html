			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Spadolini: But Now It Will Be </F> Difficult To Govern"]    [Text] Rome -- "By a single vote -- the very same result as  in my vote..." Giovanni Spadolini, former speaker of the Senate,  could not fail to note the analogy with his own, most painful,  failure to be elected. "Now it will be very difficult to  govern," Spadolini said. "Great wisdom and balance will be  demanded from the government and Parliament..." Does Berlusconi  have these gifts? "I said from the government and Parliament.  It is not a matter of personal gifts."    Gianfranco Fini, the National Alliance leader, was not  surprised by the result in the Senate. "It could not have  worked out in any other way than it did. Those members of the  Italian Popular Party that distanced themselves from Mancino and  his entrenched and prejudiced position did well to do so."    "It went very well," Defense Minister Cesare Previti said  enthusiastically. "I hope now that through our deeds we will  succeed in convincing part of the opposition that we deserve  their confidence." Francesco Tabladini, the Northern League  group leader, took the result as a "victory for the League, for  its central position in this government, as well as for its  position as guarantor of the democratic institutions."    The CCD's [Christian Democratic Center] Clemente Mastella  made the following cautious comment: "It is a limited result  but it was sufficient to achieve a majority. For the present  the situation is calm, but later it will be necessary to contend  with the opposition forces at the parliamentary level..." Livio  Caputo, Forza Italia's under secretary for foreign affairs, had  this to say: "After this initial division, necessitated by  circumstances, it will be possible to work with the Popular  Party group in the committees on the substance of various  measures."</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Primary teaching plans rejected TEACHING UNIONS at the TUC yesterday rejected the government's plans to recruit non-graduate primary school teachers. Mrs Marian Darke, president of the National Union of Teachers, said such teachers were 'an insult to children. It's like saying a surgeon does not need to study anatomy before performing heart bypass surgery'. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, wants to allow men and women over the age of 25 with two A-levels to teach in primary schools after training for a year. At present they are required to take a four-year course.</p>

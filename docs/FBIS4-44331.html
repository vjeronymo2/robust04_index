			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PSOE Retorts That People's Party </F> Believes That `Democracy Is Lottery'"]    [Text] After learning of [People's Party (PP) Chairman]  Aznar's statements demanding an early election, PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] and CiU [Convergence and Union] leaders  stated yesterday that the two political parties are opposed  because they deem more important the government's stability in  order to combat the crisis. The PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]  was also opposed, while ERC [Republican Left of Catalonia]  reiterated its demand for Gonzalez' resignation.    Juan Pedro Hernandez Molto, PSOE of Castilla-La Mancha  secretary general and a prominent renewalist leader, said in the  Congress of Deputies that Aznar's remarks are unfortunate  statements for the country's general interests.    "You cannot present a version of democracy," he added, "as  if  it were a lottery in which you gamble until you strike it lucky.  The public knew that they were voting in elections to the  European Parliament, and that was their intention and the  interpretation that must be made."  <H5>  Conditional Support </H5>   Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Steering Committee  Chairman Jose Antoni Duran Lleida stated that "we believe that  the country needs not bringing the election forward but taking  important decisions, for which we want a strong government."    He added that as long as the government is able to  "guarantee  stability" and ensures the strengthening of the economic policy  that is good for the country, UDC is opposed to bringing the  election forward because "it means leaving the country open and  without a government for six or seven months."    Nevertheless, he warned that if the Socialists do not  guarantee the necessary stability "or their own internal  division renders unfeasible the continuation of the economic  policy, governability would be cut short by the Socialist  government, and our support would not make sense."    For his part, CiU deputy Jordi Casas said that beginning an  electoral period right now would mean several months with a  government with little ability to act, and what is needed "is  the contrary, in order to try to take advantage of the signs of  economic recovery."    He added that what could prove positive is a process of  bringing closer together all the political forces' stances in  order to improve the economic situation and create jobs.    PNV spokesman in the Congress Inaki Anasagasti was opposed  to  calling an early election on the ground that it would "set back"  the autonomous community elections that should be held in the  Basque Country in the fall.    Anasagasti stated that the possibility of bringing forward  the election should be considered only if the government "did  not have sufficient parliamentary support or did not have its  own party's support."    The Basque nationalist leader said that he "understands" the  strategy adopted by the People's Party following the European  elections, "because it should take advantage of the impetus  achieved with the magnificent 12 June results," although he  asserted that the elections to the European Parliament cannot be  turned into a general election.    Last, ERC deputy Pilar Rabola agreed with the PP chairman in  asking Felipe Gonzalez to bring forward the election.    However, Rabola specified that, "unlike Aznar, we are  demanding that it be brought forward not in order to govern but  because Felipe Gonzalez has lost his political credibility amid  so many corruption scandals."</p>

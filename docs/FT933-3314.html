			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (8): Why there's magic in hydraulics - Case Study / UCC International / Andrew Baxter looks at a company that has made a profit every month since it was founded more than 30 years ago ONE OF the most common criticisms of the UK engineering industry is that it is good - sometimes exceptionally good - at developing new products but rather less successful at commercially exploiting them. Justified or not, it is a charge that hundreds of engineering companies are trying to disprove - often in the face of obstacles such as financing problems and the need to keep shareholders happy. One company that does not have to worry about the City or the banks is UCC International, based in Thetford. The company was started more than 30 years ago by the ebullient Mr David Button, who is managing director and owns 92 per cent of the shares. Starting from modest premises in south London, Mr Button has ploughed some highly profitable furrows for UCC, building the company into a leading supplier of filters, suction elements and other more or less mundane parts used in hydraulics. Ten years ago, though, UCC branched out into system or condition monitoring, selling meters that measure fluid pressure and flow rate. Now, it has gone a step further by moving into contamination monitoring  - a step that brings unprecedented challenges and yet, if correctly handled, could transform the company. Mr Button and his team are trying to plug a gap in the market that will be familiar to any user of hydraulics, in everything from construction equipment and machine tools to aircraft. According to UCC, more than 80 per cent of machine breakdowns are caused by fluid power system failure, and 70 per cent of these are attributable to the presence of dirt. Contamination in hydraulic oil can range from being time- and money-consuming in an environment such as mining or construction to catastrophic in aerospace or funfair rides. Traditionally, contamination is tested by drawing off a sample and sending it to a laboratory for analysis, but UCC has come up with a sophisticated portable monitor that does the job on site in four minutes compared with a few days for laboratory testing. The implications for the variety of producers and end-users of hydraulic equipment could be enormous. Oil filters are often replaced before they need to be because the traditional testing is laborious. So an on-site test could save users thousands of pounds. Regular contamination checks with the new machine could also reduce downtime and lost production. UCC, says Mr Button, has a two-year advantage over its rivals in portable contamination monitoring, and now has to exploit its lead. The company has a number of things going for it. Mr Button notes proudly that UCC has made a profit every month since he founded the company. First, unlike many UK engineering companies UCC has no hang-ups about manufacturing. Product design is done in-house, but beyond that, says Mr Button, 'we're an assembly operation.' And UCC can break some of the accepted modern rules of manufacture. It has increased its stock levels in the current recession to ensure it can offer a faster response time to customers. Secondly, technology is kept in its place. The CM20 is a clever product which uses the light source to 'count' the contaminant particles as the oil flows through a small window. But the technology is never seen as an end in itself and always as a means to an end - creating a product that fulfils customers' needs at the right price. As a private company, UCC is also able to plough money into new product development at the rate that it sees fit - nearly 10 per cent of turnover which is very high for an engineering company. The CM20 took six years to develop and cost Pounds 1.1m, but UCC was able to stick with it, undeterred by technical hitches in development. Above all, perhaps, UCC has an enthusiasm and thirst for success that starts with Mr Button and permeates through the company of 140 employees. 'Magic' is Mr Button's favourite adjective and this is a company which has not forgotten that engineering can be fun. Recent developments at UCC give a clear clue as to why many UK companies fail to make a commercial success of a new product. Before the CM20, which cost Pounds 7,000, its most expensive product was Pounds 400 and its cheapest is Pounds 3. According to Mr Mark Batting, marketing director, UCC soon realised that it would have to establish contact with far more senior people than before to make a sale of this type. 'Typically, the managing director signs off for it,' he said. About 60 per cent of the distributors it used for its other products were not suitable for handling CM20, says Mr Button. But UCC has also had to spend heavily - in time and money - on educating the market about its new product, establishing its own credibility in contamination monitoring, and finding 'champions' for the product among potential customers. All this requires patience - a rare commodity in British manufacturing. The CM20 was launched three years ago and some customers have taken almost that long to reach a decision. The market for CM20 could eventually run into thousands, but Mr Button is not letting the success change his basic philosophies even if contamination monitoring doubles the size of the company. UCC will stay debt-free, and would enter into manufacturing and licensing deals if its Thetford plant was unable to keep up with demand. Mr Button is also determined not to sit on his laurels or become too dependent on one product. UCC's bread-and-butter products are not being neglected, and new versions of the CM20 are in the pipeline. Coming soon will be new products testing water in oil and viscosity.</p>

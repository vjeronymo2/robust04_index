			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Charities warn on impact of recession NEARLY two thirds of Britain's charities are suffering real decreases in income while demand for services is rising, the first study of the impact of the recession on the voluntary sector showed yesterday. The Charities Aid Foundation, which commissioned the survey, calculates that charities are losing income from all sources at the rate of Pounds 1bn a year. This means the voluntary sector's total income has fallen from about Pounds 18bn in 1990-91 to Pounds 16bn now. According to the survey, which covers a sample of more than 400 charities of all sizes, 64 per cent have experienced a real decrease in income since January 1991. More than half the charities - and 63 per cent of bigger ones  -said the recession had affected demand for their services, in 90 per cent of cases by increasing demand. Higher unemployment, debt problems and local-authority cuts were cited as the main reasons for extra pressure on charities. Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the foundation, said the survey showed that social service charities had been the biggest losers in terms of donations from the public. More than 70 per cent had reported a real decrease in individual donations since 1991. He said decisions in the Budget to impose value added tax on fuel bills and reduce the value of tax credits would add to pressures on many charities. 'The voluntary sector is coming under massive strain,' he added. Mr Simon Hebditch, acting director of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said the survey revealed a 'glaring need for new sources of funding to be made available to help charities that support some of the most deprived sections of our community.' Ms Christine Carling, director of the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service, said it confirmed the worst fears of local voluntary organisations. 'The demands and expectations for them to deliver services is increasing while the funding available is decreasing.' The survey shows that one in seven charities has cut services. One in eight is charging for services that were previously free and a similar number have made staff redundant. One fifth said they were cancelling or deferring capital expenditure. Charity managers told the survey that - apart from providing more money - local authorities could help by paying fees on time and simplifying funding applications, while the government should do more to publicise the work of the voluntary sector.</p>

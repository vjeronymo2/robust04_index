The leaders of the "Russian All-National Union," the  National  Salvation Front, the Russian Communist Workers Party, and  "Working Moscow," had coordinated their plans in terms of the  time and place of mass actions of "protest against the 21  September-4 October 1993 coup d'etat." The demonstrations were  meant to be timed to coincide with the opening of the State  Duma, starting Sunday with a rally on Free Russia Square outside  the White House. Then on Tuesday and Wednesday the plan was to  picket the approaches to the Kremlin, conduct a mass rally on  Lubyanka Square in the evening, and organize a procession of  thousands through the city's main streets.    As was announced 5 January at a City Hall meeting with  representatives of the action's organizers, the Moscow  government has made an area near the Russian White House  available for a rally of up to 1,000 participants on 9 January.  A mass rally cannot possibly be held 11 January on Lubyanka  Square because of the inevitable disruptions and interruptions  in the work of city transportation during the rush hour.  "Sakharovskaya Ploshchadka" (No. 1) at Luzhniki is being made  available instead.    There will be no pickets outside the Kremlin or large  processions along streets in downtown Moscow. Instead, 100  pickets may appear at the high-rise State Duma building on Novyy  Arbat between 0900 and 1900 on 12 January.</p>

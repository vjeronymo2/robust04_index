			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE ACTS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING;  </P> <P> APARTMENTS: CITY COUNCIL CHOOSES THREE POSSIBLE SITES FROM A LIST OF 10. THERE  WOULD BE 200 UNITS BUILT, HALF FOR LOW-INCOME TENANTS.  </P> <P> Joining a number of communities that use nonprofit housing corporations to meet  affordable housing quotas mandated by state law, the City Council has chosen  three possible sites to build a development of 100 apartments for low-income  tenants.  </P> <P> Because candidates to live in affordable housing are defined by state law as  people earning less than 80% of the county median income -- it currently is  $47,000 per year -- Irvine's project would include households that earn between  $23,000 and $40,000 per year, in addition to poverty-level families earning  $14,000 or less annually.  </P> <P> "In affluent Orange County, low-cost housing is really higher," said Planning  Commission Chairwoman Mary Ann Gaido, president of the Irvine Community Housing  Corp., the city's new nonprofit housing firm. "We're trying to get people into  housing that might otherwise be out of their reach."  </P> <P> The housing corporation is proposing to erect its first apartment project in a  partnership with Bridge Inc., a San Francisco-based, nonprofit firm that has  developed 3,500 affordable homes in Northern California.  </P> <P> Plans call for construction of 200 apartments, 50% of which would have rents  skewed for lower incomes. The rest would be rented at market rates, Gaido said.  </P> <P> The council's selection of three housing areas, from a list of 10 Irvine  Co.-owned sites, enables Bridge representatives to seek permission from Bridge  directors for what would be the company's first Southern California project. If  the plan is approved, Bridge would submit a financial proposal to the council,  at which time the top three sites would be narrowed to one, City Manager Paul  O. Brady Jr. said.  </P> <P> The three sites selected Tuesday are a 15-acre parcel at the corner of Harvard  Avenue and San Leon Drive, across from City Hall; a 24-acre parcel south of  Harvard Park and near railroad tracks along Harvard Avenue; and a one-acre  parcel near the Home and Garden Center at the intersection of Culver and Irvine  Center drives.  </P> <P> "This is for our children, the people who teach our children, the workers who  are here, and the ones to come," Councilwoman Paula Werner said.  </P> <P> If the first project proves successful, the two sites not chosen could later be  used to house affordable complexes, Brady said. The city already has $500,000  in federal community block grant funds to be used for the purchase of  affordable home sites, said senior planner Maya Dunne.  </P> <P> Since offering a list of possible project sites last month, Irvine Co.  officials have not said whether they would donate the land or sell it at a  reduced rate to the nonprofit builders.  </P> <P> But company officials have been enthusiastic in their support of the program  because they can contract with the lower-cost, nonprofit firms to meet  affordable housing quotas required of the city's private developers. In August,  those quotas were upped to include 25% of all residential projects constructed  after October, 1989. Since 1974, the city's affordable housing requirements  have provided 3,000 units scattered throughout the city's market-rate projects,  Gaido said.  </P> <P> "Nonprofit (housing firms) can get profits and tax breaks that the private  sector can't," said Irvine Co. Vice Chairman Raymond Watson, who serves with  Werner on the committee that recommended the formation of Irvine Community  Housing Corp.  </P></p>

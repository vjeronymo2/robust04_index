			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] According to Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai  Phanitchaphak, any trade retaliation against Japan by the United  States in accordance with its Article 301 is not expected to  affect Thai products, with the exception of communications and  electrical products and their spare parts, which are exported to  Japan for reexport to the United States. Suphachai said the  declared U.S. intention to use Article 301 against Japan is  probably merely a threat. He is confident that eventually Japan  and the United States will be able to settle their trade  differences. At present, several countries disagree with the  planned use of Article 301.    [Begin recording] [Suphachai] Personally, I disagree. I  feel that since the GATT has reached an agreement and set up a  new international trade organization, the use of unilateral  retaliation per Article 301 should be illegal. The GATT members  should rise up to protest this matter. The parts on which the  United States and Japan could not reach an agreement should be  mediated by the GATT.    [Unidentified correspondent] There is a possibility that the  United States may not seriously apply Article 301 against Japan.  Is this correct?    [Suphachai] The United States has made a declaration. In  the past, it did not carry out its declaration against, I think,  either Europe or France once the deadline arrived. I think it  amounts to giving the other party time to think about the  consequences before taking an action. Most of the time, Article  301 is used as a threat. Even if it is merely a threat, we  disagree with its use. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

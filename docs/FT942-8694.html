			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Observer: Evergreen Angus They had to switch the lights out at the Grosvenor House hotel on Tuesday before Sir Michael Angus, the outgoing president of the CBI, and his fellow guests got the message that the party was over. Not that Sir Michael is going to be out of the limelight for long. He's about to add the Boots chairmanship to his collection of jobs at British Airways, Whitbread and NatWest. He's also just been given a super opportunity to shake up Whitehall by being the first outsider appointed to Sir Robin Butler's senior appointments selection committee, the employment exchange for Britain's top mandarins. Until now, membership has been confined to permanent secretaries who, unsurprisingly, have tended to appoint clones of themselves. Professional businessmen, like Derek Lewis, the ex-boss of Granada, have proved they can run executive agencies successfully. So why not let a business type try to run a Whitehall department like education or agriculture? Over to you, Sir Michael.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / A first shot in the parade ground: The creation of a Russian army poses difficult challenges for the CIS Russia is again to have an army. Leaving aside this century's Soviet interruption, it will lay claim to a tradition reckoned in military and patriotic circles as glorious, with centuries of imperial expansion and victories across much of Europe emblazoned on its standards. Through its army Russia was made into a vast multinational territory (the consequences of which are still returning to haunt the former imperialists): because of the army's defeats and virtual disintegration against the Germans in the first world war, the Bolsheviks seized and held power. Little that is glorious from the past remains today, and the future holds (it is to be hoped) few glorious prospects. The Soviet army - already de facto a Russian army, as Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the Russian deputy prime minister, noted yesterday, - is clearing out of the Caucasus under fire, leaving two wars behind it. It is still trooping back from eastern Europe, is soon due to leave the Baltics, and is in danger of being dragged into a further war in Moldova. This is in part the motivation for the creation of a Russian military: to haul out Russian soldiers from areas of conflict over which their country can exercise no influence short of a massive intervention, which it will not undertake. The decree signed yesterday by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president on return from his holiday on the Black Sea has the virtue of bringing some clarity into the tangled military affairs of the Soviet Union, and hopefully begins a process of definition of military policy. However, it leaves many questions unanswered. On the credit side, the formation of a Ministry of Defence with Mr Yeltsin at its head (his third job after those of president and prime minister) gives the Russian military a country to which to belong: the fiction of being an army for the Commonwealth of Independent States, when the CIS is clearly incapable of doing anything other than falling apart, was wearing thin. Further, by putting himself at its head, Mr Yeltsin has established a civilian command of the military. It was stressed yesterday that this was temporary, and the longer-term dispute over civilian or military control of the army is only postponed. Certainly, the main civilian contender for the post, Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy head of the USA Canada Institute, a Moscow think tank, still believes that his candidature remains active. He has gathered a team reckoned as impressive, including General Alexander Vladimirov, thought to be one of the foremost military strategists. But in the transitional period under presidential command, it is a good idea that the head of state supervises the difficult process of creation because of his popularity and authority. Finally, the Russian parliament will at last have a say in military matters, since the draft law setting up the defence ministry will soon come before the Russian deputies. The deputies have complained with increasing bitterness that while they pay the army's bills, they have no say in military dispositions. Now they can exercise their right of speech. Yet, there has been no official word on the size of the force - though Colonel Alexei Tsaryov, head of the defence sub-committee of the Russian parliament, said recently that he thought 1.5m would be adequate. Will it be professional? Probably, though not immediately: Colonel Tsaryov's estimate was that it would take several years. The timing of the announcement predates the meeting, in Kiev on Friday, of the CIS heads of state, at which the issue of the division of military forces and hardware will again be on the agenda. This is a bitter matter, especially as regards the Black Sea fleet - part of the former Soviet navy, but based largely in Ukrainian ports. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander-in-chief of the CIS armed forces, said in a TV interview yesterday that the fleet should stay under CIS command: while the Ukrainian government continues to insist that a sizeable part, perhaps as much as a third, be assigned to Ukraine. It is not just Russia and the Ukraine which are at odds. Russia's relationship with the CIS is confused, and the announcement yesterday did not make it much clearer. Mr Shakhrai insisted that the creation of the defence ministry did not mean Russia was withdrawing from the CIS military structure: but if Russia is to form its own army, then it could reduce the CIS command to a formal organisation, with no effective command over anyone. Can Russia, and the other states which wish to retain some form of unified command, develop a Nato-type structure? So far they have not shown that they can. One of the few, so-far unchallenged, assumptions of post-Soviet military life is that Russia will, over the next two years, inherit all the the Soviet strategic nuclear weapons. In the absence of a doctrine, however, there is as yet no agreement about whom the nuclear shield protects, and at whom the missiles are aimed. Further, the announcement comes as a new dispute arises between Russia and Ukraine over tactical weapons. Ukraine refuses to send any more back to Russia because it fears 'instability' in the latter republic. The stated aim of the Yeltsin government is to create a 'normal' democratic republic from the ruins of the union: within that, to develop a military policy capable of defence but without aggressive designs on any other state or people. Russian, and Soviet, history is not replete with periods in which such intentions were carried through: now it might be possible, but only with vast changes, most of all in the psychology of a people more comprehensively militarised than any other on earth.</p>

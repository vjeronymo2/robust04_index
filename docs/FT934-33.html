			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Two local authorities plan to tap sterling sector Two UK local authorities are planning to tap the sterling bond market in January, marking the first appearance by such borrowers in the domestic bond market in over a decade. The local authorities of Leicester and Salford hope to raise between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m each from UK institutional and wealthy retail investors next month, provided market conditions are suitable. Both local authorities are expected to issue 25-year bonds, tapping the long end of the sterling bond market and taking advantage of low interest rates. UBS has won the mandate for both issues, which will be set up with a trustee arrangement to look after the interests of investors. The issues would be partly-paid. Although pricing the deals may prove difficult, given the absence of similar issues to set a market standard, they are expected to have identical terms and conditions. Neither Leicester nor Salford has a credit rating. Until recently, there were uncertainties about the ability of the local authorities to issue bonds. However, the Department of the Environment and the Treasury clarified the situation with the issue of a general consent on December 15. This permits such issues to take place. Local authorities are not allowed to issue Eurobonds at present, and can only issue securities to UK investors, not foreigners. However, the Department of the Environment, the Treasury, and the local authorities are considering a review of the situation. In recent years, the local authorities have obtained funding from the Public Works Loan Board, the government agency. However, they have a tarnished reputation with the banks, which were left facing loses of more than Pounds 560m when the House of Lords ruled that local authorities were not empowered to enter into swap agreements.</p>

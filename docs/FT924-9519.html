			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Accountancy Column: Absent figures that add up to an incomplete picture - The case for the disclosure of discretionary investment A BLOW was dealt to the health of the UK economy last week with the latest financial reporting standard launched by the Accounting Standards Board. The decision to drop its proposal for the disclosure of discretionary investment will divert attention from the importance of long-term financial measures for corporate prospects. For over two decades the accountancy profession has been continually hounded by City commentators for the lack of reliability in UK financial reporting. In times of recession, it becomes an even greater focus of attention as large numbers of companies fail after reporting seemingly healthy profits. That suggests the need for reform. Those who simply argue for greater skill among readers of accounts in interpreting existing financial information take a defensive position used over more than 20 years by the accountancy profession and provide little by way of solutions. It must be questioned whether in today's globalised, fast-moving and risk-infested business environment 'the figures speak for themselves'. While greater knowledge and understanding of accountancy can undoubtedly be useful, more fundamental questions need to be asked. Most important is: what is the purpose of accounting? On the one hand, accounting may be viewed as a process of reporting on the 'stewardship' role of management. This can be adequately accomplished by the pretty basic reporting of past financial transactions, most frequently expressed in terms of the 'historical' monetary exchange which occurred at the time of the transactions. Enshrined in law, this approach has the so-called virtues of verifiability and objectivity. But only a nodding acquaintance with accounting reveals that this supposedly objective reporting process is shot through with highly subjective estimates and expressions of opinion. On the other hand, accounting may be viewed as a much more sophisticated process of providing information for decision-making. This requires an altogether more dynamic type of information. Nowadays, most authoritative commentators, both from business and commerce and from academia, recognise the interest in and right to corporate information of a much wider group of parties than merely the owners or shareholders of a company. This wider group - the stakeholders - embraces creditors, customers, employees, the government and society at large. Where stakeholders in a company have an intimate knowledge of the internal workings of the company, it can be argued that they have no need for sophisticated accounting information to be made publicly available. The information necessary to guide these stakeholders can be obtained elsewhere. That is certainly the case in a number of countries. In Germany - where there are less than one-fifth the number of listed companies than in the UK  -the various stakeholders generally have representation at board level and have access to information well beyond that contained in the published accounts. It is therefore not surprising that published financial reports in Germany fulfil only the basic stewardship reporting function, which is reflected in their format and contents. 'Decision usefulness' is not a primary objective. In the UK a different accounting tradition has developed. The number of listed companies is far greater and the information needs of users, who tend not to be party to the internal workings of the company, are far more extensive. As a result, there is a much greater need for annual reports to provide users with relevant and reliable information to guide them in their decision-making. Accounts have decision usefulness as a primary goal. But if UK published financial statements must attempt both to satisfy accounting for stewardship and to supply information to help decision-making, what is being done to provide stakeholders with reliable and relevant information? First, there is the degree to which 'comparability' between different companies' accounts has been improved, and the narrowing of areas of difference and choice in accounting treatments, which will hopefully reduce the opportunity for 'creative accounting'. In recent years, the accounting profession has made considerable progress on this issue with the formation of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and associated bodies - though not without considerable external application of the whip and spur. The framework for setting accounting standards is now much tighter and seems to be operating with much more effective teeth than the regime it replaced. Second, there is the issue of the provision to users of information about long-term, sustainable performance. Analysts and market commentators are currently viewed as being too preoccupied with quick fix, short-term measures. Given the apparent (and widely acknowledged) impossibility of accountants ever being able to provide a reliable, one-measure figure for earnings, it does seem rather bizarre that analysts and others should attach so much importance to it. To be fair, this is an attitude with which business has seemed at times all too ready to conspire. What the wider stakeholder needs is additional information on activities that will lead to long-term sustainable performance rather than short-term measures. These include research and development, advertising and other marketing development, personnel development and Total Quality issues. These are activities which have traditionally been written off by companies, yet which are clearly investments for future health, as opposed to the essentially historical financial information which is currently predominant in accounts. The need for stakeholders to be able to scrutinise these items of expenditure is sufficiently important to overrule companies' resistance to disclose such information. Several recent research studies have demonstrated a link between some of these issues and sustainable long-term financial performance. Work carried out at the Bradford University Management Centre has shown a strong correlation between use of Total Quality Management (TQM) techniques and significantly better than industry-average financial performance. The study showed that 29 companies with TQM programmes were well above the industry norm over five years for profitability, return on capital employed and earnings. Quantification and disclosure of these expenses was one of the features of the first Financial Reporting Exposure Draft (FRED 1) published by the ASB, which it called 'discretionary revenue investments'. Unfortunately, the ASB dropped these proposals in the face of criticism by industry and little public support, arguably so it could help build support in its campaign to abolish the much-abused extraordinary item, which was perceived as a more important concern. Accountancy is a conservative profession and is notoriously slow to adopt new attitudes and practices. Under the present system, companies which invest in anything other than tangible fixed assets in order to achieve long-term, sustainable performance are to a large extent penalised in the short-term. We believe this will continue to be the case until sufficient attention is given to the identification, measurement and disclosure of these highly significant and potentially desirable investments by business. The present system can only act to the detriment of the long-term health of our economy.

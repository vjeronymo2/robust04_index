			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Germany's transport minister steps down THE EMBATTLED German political establishment was thrown further into disarray yesterday with the enforced resignation of Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister and most senior east German left in the cabinet of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Coming only three days after the resignation of Mr Bjorn Engholm, the leader of the opposition Social Democrats, the sacking - in all but name - of Mr Krause for a series of petty political blunders seems certain to undermine further the good standing of the entire political class. It also seems likely to delay the whole process of railway reform and eventual rail privatisation being debated in the German parliament. Mr Krause was forced to quit by Chancellor Kohl after revelations that he had claimed public funds for moving his home from Berlin to a smart new villa on the Baltic coast, after he was appointed a minister in the Bonn coalition. Mr Kohl, who was reported to have exploded with fury when he confronted Mr Krause over the latest mini-scandal on Wednesday, has moved with extraordinary speed to stop the rot. He immediately announced the appointment of Mr Matthias Wissman, the minister for research, to take over as transport minister, and Mr Paul Kruger, a little-known eastern member of the Bundestag, to succeed him as research minister. No fewer than seven cabinet ministers have now resigned abruptly from the German government since the last elections in December 1990. None of the so-called scandals has been substantial, but all have served to fuel a feeling of public disenchantment with the country's leading politicians. On Monday Mr Engholm, the SPD leader and premier of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, resigned all his public positions after admitting that he misled a parliamentary inquiry five years ago. In the southern state of Bavaria, the premier, Mr Max Streibl, is under fierce attack for accepting free holidays from a business friend. Leader of the Christian Democrats in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Mr Krause has proved to be accident-prone since he joined the Bonn government.</p>

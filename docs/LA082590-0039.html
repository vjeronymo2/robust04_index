			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . . : DAVID: A SHAKESPEAREAN 'AT WORK'  </P> <P> Keith David doesn't seem like the kind of actor who gets nervous before a big  debut. In fact, when he discusses his most recent film roles -- in "Men at  Work," which premiered Friday, and in the upcoming "Screwface" -- he exudes the  steady confidence one might expect from a Julliard-trained actor who stands  six-foot-two.  </P> <P> He looks like a guy who has never had the butterflies in his life.  </P> <P> Well, not unless you count this thing he has coming up in September. Talk about  his impending marriage, and David's got a case of the flutters.  </P> <P> "This is the most exciting thing that's happened to me," he says, with just a  touch of nerves. "Being in a good relationship does wonders for your life. My  fiancee and I began to date in the summer of '89, and I swear, since that time,  life has been much better."  </P> <P> Not that David's life sounds like it's ever been bad. An award-winning  Shakespearean actor, he's enjoyed a string of enviable roles both on and off  Broadway, including Macbeth, Othello, Oberon and Aaron the Moor. His film work  includes co-starring roles in "Platoon," "Bird" and "Always."  </P> <P> David believes he -- like all black actors -- has a responsibility to choose  his roles carefully. "Those roles that get offered to us only perpetuate the  'white majority' understanding of who we are," he says -- meaning he shies away  from pimp and drug-dealer parts. "If we had the opportunity to be more diverse  in the roles we choose, then those stereotypical roles would become less  stereotypical," he says.  </P> <P> "There are all kinds of mixtures in the world. I look forward to the time when  we can acknowledge our differences -- but celebrate our similarities." LAUREN  LIPTON  </P></p>

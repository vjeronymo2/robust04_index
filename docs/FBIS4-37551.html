			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An unprecedented funeral ceremony was held in  the holy city of Mashhad today for the martyrs of the Hoseyn's  Ashura day incident inside the holy shrine of Imam Reza, amid  the participation of the masses. [crowd chants "Death to the  monafeqin," "Death to America," and "These are the evidences of  the U.S. crime"]    The coffins were carried shoulder high by the people of  Mashhad. The streets leading to the holy shrine were packed with  masses of mourners, who, shedding tears, were offering  condolences to Imam Reza for the desecration of his holy  sanctuary. The city of Mashhad observed a holiday in solidarity  to enable the people to attend the funeral ceremony for the 24  martyrs of the heinous crime of the monafeqin [Mojahedin-e  Khalq].    From the early hours of the morning masses of mourners moved  to the streets leading to the holy shrine.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by George Bashir: "Resettlement Is Knocking on </F> Lebanon's Door and Christopher Ignores Beirut in His Tours"]    [Text] The possibly that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher will include Beirut in his tour remains a very weak  one. Past experiences do not encourage the belief that  Christopher will drop from his calculations the factors that  made him fail to visit Beirut in his former tours, particularly  as the peace negotiations between the Arabs and Israel -- which  are expected to be held later this month -- are regarded as  important and will lead to results that reflect the ambitions of  the Madrid Conference co-sponsors, especially the United States.    Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz took a negative  position in the past that reflected the official and popular  Lebanese resentment of U.S. Secretary of State James Baker's  disregard for Lebanon and the Lebanese authorities during his  shuttle trips in the region. Buwayz refused to meet the U.S.  secretary of state anywhere other than Beirut. The U.S.  official was consequently compelled to come to Lebanon and to  meet with the Lebanese regime's high officials in Zahlah,  al-Biqa'.    Today, as Secretary Christopher prepares for a new tour of  the region, Lebanon needs another honorable stand similar to the  previous one. It should refuse to go to the Washington meeting  to be held this or next month if Secretary Christopher's tour  does not include Beirut like the other Arab capitals. Lebanon's  presence in the Washington meeting is fundamental. The Lebanese  resistance operations against the Israeli presence in the south  and from there against Israeli territories are upsetting and  worrying to the Israelis. The peace and security of south  Lebanon is as important as the peace and security of the  Galilee. Why does Lebanon not take a stand this time and refuse  to participate in the next round of peace negotiations in  Washington if the U.S. does not treat Lebanon like it does the  other Arab countries taking part in these negotiations? Lebanon  has a just and reasonable case.    The exchange of views between senior Lebanese and U.S.  officials, especially Secretary Christopher in telephone  conversations facilitates the negotiating task and the exchange  of viewpoints between the two sides. But, in the Lebanese  people's view, this is not enough, because these contacts only  enable the U.S. side to avoid any reproach every time the U.S.  secretary of state bypasses the Lebanese capital on his tours.    Some people who are pessimistic about the negotiations in  their pre-final stages are saying that the resettlement is  imminent. Lebanese and Arab officials are aware of that. The  Americans are aware of it too. How then will they make Lebanon  drink the cup of resettlement even though it has already  rejected this principle of resettlement? All the national  parties here agree among themselves on the need to stand united  against any plan that will force Lebanon to accept the  resettlement of part of the Palestinians on its territories.  Lebanon's economic, social, and demographic conditions cannot  tolerate the imposition of half a million new citizens while the  resources and geographical areas of the other Arab countries,  especially those who expelled the Palestinians from their  territories after the Gulf war, are greater than Lebanon's  resources and its small geographic size.    Let us take a new, honorable stand and see what the U.S.  position will be, especially as Lebanon only wants its fair  share.</p>

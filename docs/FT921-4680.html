			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Lime Street directors had Pounds 400,000 in bonuses DIRECTORS of Lime Street Underwriting Agencies, the Lloyd's members' agency which went into liquidation yesterday, paid themselves Pounds 400,000 in bonuses in June. Heavy losses have been incurred by Names recruited to Lime Street, who were placed in some of the syndicates with the greatest losses in recent years, such as Gooda Walker 387, for which 1989 losses are now estimated at seven times the assets pledged by Names - the individuals whose assets underwrite insurance business at Lloyd's. Meanwhile, the principal route used by MPs to make public allegations about problems at the Lloyd's insurance market appears to have been blocked. Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, said he had been told by parliamentary authorities that the Speaker would accept no further Lloyd's-related motions in the current parliament. Details of the Lime Street payments came at a creditors' meeting yesterday, after a decision by the directors to put the company into creditors' voluntary liquidation with net current liabilities of Pounds 476,000. The bonuses were shown in unaudited accounts for the 19 months to February 1992. Bonuses in the previous three years had ranged from Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 55,000. After board approval last June Mr Patrick Corbett was awarded Pounds 150,000, Mr Richard Gethin-Jones and Mr Robin Kingsley Pounds 100,000 each and Mr Robert Hallum Pounds 50,000. None was willing to say whether that money would be returned. Mr Ian Bond, a partner with Cork Gully and one of the liquidators, told the meeting that Names had given notification by last Thursday of claims totalling Pounds 21m. Mr Robin Kingsley, founder of Lime Street and a series of associated companies, came under repeated questioning from disgruntled Names yesterday. They demanded to know why they were so heavily represented on loss-making syndicates such as 387. Mr Kingsley said he placed Names on 387 because it had performed better than other syndicates on average in the past and gave a spread of risk across Lloyd's. 'I am absolutely mortified by what happened. I could not be more sorry,' he said. Mr Hain, whose motion urging an inquiry into the Lime Street agency was printed in Thursday's order paper, said he was seeking an interview with the Speaker - Mr Bernard Weatherill  - to discuss the apparent blocking of motions on Lloyd's. The Speaker has already served warning that he would not tolerate the use of early day motions - which enable allegations to be published under the protection of parliamentary privilege - to mount concerted campaigns. More than 1,500 Names facing losses of more than Pounds 150m on Feltrim syndicates 540 and 847 in the 1989 underwriting year will not have to meet cash calls which had been scheduled for April 30. The syndicate's managers confirmed yesterday that the calls had been cancelled. Agreement is close in the long-running Outhwaite case. Eighty-one Lloyd's agents yesterday accepted the terms of a Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement with about 1,000 Outhwaite Names who were members of Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in the 1982 year. The Names ratified the settlement on Wednesday.</p>

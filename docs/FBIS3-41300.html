The following is a report  by Mario Espinoza, who will tell us about this and other issues  such as the bid for the Cotapata-Santa Barbara road construction  project and the government budget.    [Mario Espinoza] The testimony of drug trafficker Meco  Dominguez, which was reported by the Fides news agency and  carried by newspapers in La Paz and nationwide, has caused a  true political earthquake.    The MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] has come out to  defend its party members and former President Paz Zamora by  stating that [former Interior Minister] Guillermo Capobianco has  called a news conference this morning in Santa Cruz and is  willing to subject himself to any investigation.    At any rate, we are facing a unique situation because the  drug trafficker has caused a political earthquake by slandering  respectable institutions such as the Bank of Santa Cruz.    Moreover, MIR President Oscar Eid Franco has denied  Dominguez' charges. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified anchorwoman] As was reported by Mario  Espinoza,  drug trafficker Meco Dominguez has made charges against the  private banking industry and the Armed Forces. A Fides news  agency report reads, text, that for the first time a Bolivian  bank has been charged in alleged involvement in money laundering  activities.    The report adds that the bank, which has connections with  U.S. and Panamanian banks, obtained the funds from the Colombian  and Bolivian drug cartels.    Moreover, according to what the controversial Meco Dominguez  told fiscal and police officials, the Monchego regiment has  become a cocaine manufacturing center.    Regarding the alleged money laundering activities conducted  by the Bank of Santa Cruz, Meco Dominguez alleges he held a  meeting with bank officials in 1990. He added that in 1989,  through Juan Carlos Pereira Paz, bank transactions were  conducted with this gentleman for the cashing of six checks for  $50,000 each for the Cali cartel.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: CKD faces closures without cash injection CKD, one of the Czech Republic's biggest companies, needed an injection of Kcs1.3m (Dollars 45m) in capital if it was to avoid closing several subsidiaries with the loss of 5,000 jobs, Mr Jan Havelka, the general director, said yesterday. The company, which makes railway engines, trams, diesel generators for power plants,; produces steel, electrical engineering equipment and motor parts, has seen the collapse of its main markets in the former Comecon trade bloc. The company is being privatised, but plans for a joint venture to make transport equipment with ADG of Germany and Secheron of France with investments of DM200m (Dollars 126.5m) will have to be abandoned if CKD is not provided with the necessary finance.</p>

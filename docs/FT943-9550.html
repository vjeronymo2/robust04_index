			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease on disappointing auction Prices of US government securities eased at the long end of the maturity range yesterday after the opening leg of the Treasury's Dollars 40bn quarterly refunding round met with only moderate demand. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/32 at 84 9/16 , yielding 7.566 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.209 per cent. Trading was subdued and prices mostly weaker throughout the morning session, with few participants willing to get involved ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes, the first part of this quarter's refunding round. Although traders predicted solid interest in the new issue, the auction proved disappointing. The three-year notes were offered at an average yield of 6.61 per cent, toward the high end of expectations and indicative of only moderate demand from investors for the issue. Bearish sentiment gripped European government bond markets yesterday amid growing worries that the strong economic recovery in Germany would discourage the Bundesbank from cutting interest rates further. Yields on 10-year bunds touched 7 per cent, up from 6.90 per cent on Monday, while in Italy, 10-year yields rose to 11 per cent from 10.60 per cent. 'Growth expectations are being revised upwards, which is causing firms to adopt a more bearish stance towards bond markets,' said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. The view that Germany was well behind schedule with its fundraising - Mr Callow estimates that DM120bn of public-sector borrowing has to be met before the year-end - was a further worry, especially since government bond auctions across Europe had not gone well recently. 'The market is becoming fairly paranoid about issuance in Germany,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G. Warburg, adding that this problem was compounded by the current lack of activity in the cash market. Yesterday, the Bundesbank said the Treuhandanstalt privatisation agency would issue either new five-year notes or an additional tranche of its existing five-year paper next week. Dealers expect the auction to raise between DM4bn and DM5bn. On Liffe, the September bund future fell below the support level of 93.00 to 92.68 in the late afternoon, down 0.40 on the day, in volume of 119,000 lots, double Monday's volume. UK gilts fell in line with bunds, with the September long gilt future losing  27/32 to 101 13/16 in volume of 55,000 lots. The French bond market was also under pressure, with 10-year yields rising by 12 basis points to 7.50 per cent. Weakness in the French franc raised fears that the government would not be able to persist with its policy of pegging its interest rates to those of Germany.</p>

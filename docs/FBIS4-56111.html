			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman </F> Simona Miculescu by an unidentified correspondent on 25 May --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] We have phoned you because we  would like to know the opinion of the Romanian Foreign Ministry  on the events in the Crimea.    [Miculescu] Good evening. Certainly I am going to answer  you with greatest pleasure, as I do every time for the Romanian  Radio Station. I could say that the Romanian side is following  the evolution of situation in Ukraine with great attention. In  connection with the recent events in Crimea, events that, as a  matter of fact, are the subject of much information issued in  the Romanian and foreign press, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs believes that this represents an internal problem of  Ukraine, because Crimea is part and parcel of this neighboring  country of Romania.    Likewise, I would like to mention that we assess the careful  attitude adopted by the authorities of the Russian Federation on  this issue as a positive sign. I would like to conclude by  expressing hope that this situation will be solved through  political means and it is our belief that the consolidation of  independence and stability in Ukraine is very important for the  entire region and Europe in general.    [Correspondent] Thus, if the situation is settled through  political means, in view of this settlement, what are the  actions planned by the Romanian diplomacy to intensify relations  with Ukraine, a country that is our neighbor?    [Miculescu] Certainly we hope that this political settlement  will come as soon as possible, and in practical terms, as you  well know, obviously we will work for the development and  consolidation of bilateral relations with this neighboring  country and we will amplify political dialogue at all levels.  However, at the appropriate time, we are going to inform you  about all details and I hope we will be able to give you those  details as soon as possible.    [Correspondent] In fact we wanted to find out whether there  is any immediate action on the diplomatic agenda of the Romanian  foreign minister in connection with Ukraine.    [Miculescu] There are no immediate plans, but we will inform  you at the appropriate time, as we do every time.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much for this interview.    [Miculescu] It was my great pleasure.</p>

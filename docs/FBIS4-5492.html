			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata denied suggestions Tuesday that the ruling coalition is on  the brink of collapse over choosing a successor to outgoing  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    Hata, who is also a leader of Shinseito, one of the ruling  parties, told a press conference the coalition has not broken up  because meetings of the senior executives of the parties are  still being held. "It's true that various emotions are  entangled," Hata said. "But if we go back to the starting point  of why we established the coalition, I think we can restore it."    He added that the coalition has solved various difficult  problems since it came to power eight months ago.    The seven-party coalition is at odds over at what level to  decide on a candidate to replace Hosokawa. The Social  Democratic Party (SDP) called for a meeting of all the coalition  party heads, but Shinseito, Komeito and the Japan New Party  rejected the call.    Hata said Shinseito has already voiced its opinion in the  executives' meeting that a meeting of the top leaders should be  left to the last in deciding the succession issue. He suggested  a meeting of executives and top leaders of the coalition  together.</p>

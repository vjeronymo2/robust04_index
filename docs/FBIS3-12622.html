The party said that his family does  not know where he is being held.    A statement issued by the party said that Sayhat, an Esfahan  University professor, is a well-known doctor who "saved the  lives of thousands of Iranian soldiers under enemy fire" during  the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1988). The party urged "all Iranians  inside and outside the country to raise their voice against  repressive actions...and to demand the immediate release of this  courageous son of Iran."    It is known that the National Party, led by Daryush Furuhar  (64), is one of the oldest secular political parties in Iran.  It opposed the former regime and is now opposed to the current  Islamic regime. In a recent statement Furuhar urged clerics to  "quietly hand over power" to national forces.    A prominent female member of the party named Homa Darabi  (51), who was a physician and professor at Tehran University,  committed suicide on 21 February in protest at the conditions of  Iranian women. Hundreds of people took part in her funeral  ceremonies at a well-known mosque in Tehran.</p>

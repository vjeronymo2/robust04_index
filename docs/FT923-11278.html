			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The lowdown on low-cost share deals SEVERAL months ago, a Weekend FT reader wrote in lauding the cheap dealing service offered by a FT-SE 100 company to deal in the company's shares. 'It is simple, cheap and efficient. I am now wondering whether there are any other schemes of a similar nature available,' he wrote. Most private investors spread their risk through a large number of holdings in different companies and will hold a variety of stock in a general Personal Equity Plan. But there will be times when the investor may want to deal in one or a few blue chip companies, or to increase his Pep holdings through a single company Pep. Many quoted companies have arrangements with stockbrokers and personal equity plan managers to provide investors with a reduced rate service for sharedealing. Some have a similar arrangement with a Pep plan manager for opening either a single company Pep with a maximum holding of Pounds 3,000 in any one tax year, or a Pounds 6,000 general Pep, or both. Companies such as Hoare Govett, NatWest Stockbrokers and Cazenove have led the way in offering a low cost share dealing service for selected quoted companies. The table below shows companies in the FT-SE 100 which responded to our request for details of available schemes. Some companies, including British Steel, Lasmo, Bass, Pearson and Midland Bank, do not have arrangements for a cheap sharedealing scheme or corporate personal equity plan at the moment and have not been included in the table. The charges are very competitive compared with execution-only brokers, many of which charge a minimum of Pounds 10 for dealing. Similarly, the Pep charges also represent good value compared with the industry norm of 5 per cent initial charges, annual charges of about 0.75 per cent to 1.5 per cent and brokerage of around 1.65 per cent. Many companies pay or subsidise the initial charge or the annual fee themselves, which leads to a reduction in charges. However, these are execution-only schemes with no investment advice available. The structure of the service can vary between companies - there may be a minimum value of shares that can be bought or sold. The brokerage for General Accident, for example, requires deals to be a minimum of Pounds 500. The same can be true for Peps - the minimum level of shareholding in the General Accident Pep is Pounds 1,000, and it is Pounds 1,500 for Reuters. VAT is payable on most charges apart from the broker's commission.</p>

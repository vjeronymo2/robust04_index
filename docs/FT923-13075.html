			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Manual workers press for new deal BRITAIN'S 900,000 local authority manual workers, the poor cousins of the public sector, are seeking a new deal from their employers as a quid pro quo for providing services of the highest quality. The two general unions, the TGWU and GMB, who yesterday lodged a joint claim for Thursday's annual pay negotiations, implicitly recognise that the manual workers are not going to improve their relative pay position. The claim thus concentrates on non-pay issues such as harmonisation between blue and white collar, an equality audit to root out discrimination, and the claim for five days' training a year. The two unions also propose 'single-table bargaining' - an idea which has also been floated by the employers so has a good chance of being implemented. In a joint statement the two unions said: 'The 'them and us' culture in local government has held manual workers back and not served the community well.' The manual workers have also asked for a substantial pay rise but are unlikely to win more than 4 per cent. White-collar workers have settled for 4 to 4.4 per cent. The electricians section of the AEEU engineering and electrical union will have to reduce its full-time staff of 350 by between 35 and 50 to save Pounds 1.3m a year. The savings are required by a continuing reduction in members, by the ending of a pension 'holiday' and by the probable requirement of TUC affiliation fees.</p>

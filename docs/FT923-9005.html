			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Why British banks are singing the blues: Dismal first-half results from the four big clearers have raised doubts over the industry's long-term health This is the wrong decade to be a British bank clerk, just as the 1980s were not happy years for steel workers. The banking industry is not merely in the grip of a recession, though its effects - in the form of unprecedented levels of bad debts - have been severe. The long-term outlook is also bleak. That was the message delivered over the past week by the chairmen of the UK's big four clearing banks - Barclays, National Westminster, Lloyds and Midland - all of which have announced their first-half results. Since the recession began two years ago, the four have set more records than the British Olympic team. But these records have been the source of little pride. Never before have the banks lost so much money from lending. Barclays' bad debt charge of Pounds 1.07bn was the largest, in part because of the bank's excessive lending to a handful of big property companies - including Mountleigh, Olympia &amp; York, Speyhawk and Heron - when the property market was approaching its peak at the end of the 1980s. As a result, Barclays yesterday disclosed that it had made a Pounds 30m loss after tax in the first half. It was only the second time in Barclays' 300-year history that it disclosed a loss and the first time that such a loss stemmed from problems in its core UK operation. The long-term prospects for growth, once the recession ends, are also poor. Sir John Quinton, Barclays chairman, is doubtful that the economy will start to recover for a year or two. Even when the recession ends, he believes that 'it will be difficult to return to the levels of profit enjoyed in the late 1980s'. Some bankers and industry observers are even more pessimistic. They fear that the severity of the recession could force the banking industry close to insolvency. The thesis is that the banks have an excessive exposure to the property market through direct lending and through commercial loans backed by property collateral. Unless interest rates are cut sharply, property prices may continue to fall, leaving the banks bereft of security for their loans. So if customers continue to have difficulty making loan payments, the banks could be hit by a second great wave of loan losses - and this wave could be the killer. That, at least, is the apocalyptic scenario. However, such pessimism is probably unwarranted. The Bank of England, responsible for monitoring banks' health, is convinced that they are strong enough to weather further knocks, a view shared by the banks. The latest results nevertheless give credence to a modified version of the gloomy thesis, which would run as follows: banks will survive the current shocks, but an extended period of contraction in the industry has begun. All the banks expect loan losses to continue at high levels, but their balance sheets are probably robust enough to withstand the pressure. Despite suffering unprecedented levels of bad debts over the past two years, all four of the clearers continue to have strong balance sheets by international standards. Indeed, there has been an improvement over the past year in the banks' ratios of capital to assets - the main measure of balance sheet strength - except in the case of NatWest, whose ratio has held constant. There are two reasons why ratios have not been impaired. First, operating profits, excluding bad debt charges, have held up well; for NatWest and Barclays they have risen sharply. Second, there has been a reduction in lending and thus in the asset side of the ratio. Operating profits have improved for three reasons: Banks have been cutting costs, mainly by shedding staff. Around 30,000 jobs were lost in the UK banking industry last year. In the first six months of the current year, more than 10,000 jobs have gone from the four's domestic operations. Most banks have been increasing their non-interest income sharply. They have been pushing up the tariffs for consumers and businesses by considerably more than the rate of inflation, a process euphemistically described by one banker as 'realistic pricing'. Only Midland, for some years the weakest of the four and recently pre-occupied by the stormy preparations for its marriage to Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, failed to derive any significant benefit from this source. Banks have widened the margin between what they pay to depositors and what they earn on loans. Yet despite this widening, interest income has been under pressure. In part this is because the banks have suffered a sharp rise in non-performing loans which pay no interest. Perhaps the most important trend in the latest results is the reduction in the volume of loans outstanding on the banks' books. This has had one beneficial effect. It has meant that gross assets have fallen, thereby improving the ratio of capital to assets. But if banks have been lending less, the opportunities for earning interest have also lessened. Some of this reduction in lending has been the banks' own choice. They have eschewed low-yielding loans and have become more averse to risk - a belated response to their imprudent lending of the past decade. Bank customers, both companies and individuals, have also been keen to reduce their borrowings. It is the reluctance by customers to borrow which gives grounds for pessimism about banks' long-term prospects. Mr Terry Smith, head of research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the broker, says the demand for loans is likely to remain very low, even when the economy recovers. The banks generally agree. At the same time, banks are also likely to find it increasingly difficult to increase their tariffs by more than the rate of inflation. Competition from other financial institutions should put a brake on these rises. However, if the rises continued, the government could ask UK competition authorities to intervene. So if banks are going to be able to push up profits significantly, they would have to continue cutting costs and improving productivity. Since staff costs account for the bulk of overhead, this means making more employees redundant. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, says: 'We are going to go through what manufacturing industry went through a decade ago.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK BANKS: BLEAK OUTLOOK  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Lloyds      NatWest    Barclays     Midland  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax profit pounds m   331  369    101   211   51    378   (71)  89 Group capital ratio %     9.2  10.2   9.6   9.6   8.6   8.9   9.7  9.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Half-year results for 1991 and 1992.

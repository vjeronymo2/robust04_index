			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Arts: Canterbury Tales - Theatre In the true Chaucer tradition, Michael Bogdanov's version of The Canterbury Tales is full of good clean dirty jokes. There is bawdy all over the place: some of it comes from the original, some of it has been added, but none of it is likely to offend. This is pantomime in the spring. True, Bogdanov has gone for the more licentious tales. There is very little chivalry or courtly love. The knight does not get much of a look in. Yet this is as it should be, for the pilgrims as a whole were a bawdy lot with, incidentally, a good deal of sexual equality. Bogdanov has also changed the framework. Instead of a prologue introducing the characters, there is a vicar hosting a competition for which tale can be best acted. The pretext is supposed to be the 650th anniversary of Chaucer's birth, but since the Bogdanov version has been around for some years and even the year of the birth (circa 1340) is uncertain, that is a detail. There is a very jolly vicar played by Nicholas Lumley. He resists the temptation to be over-camp: rightly, because there are plenty of escapades going on around him without an extra dimension. But he rigs the competition by trying to exclude The Miller's Tale on the grounds that it is not suitable for family viewing. Yet there are limits to how the rigging can go. Wonderfully played by Brian Glover, who began his career as a professional wrestler, the miller is there in the audience even before the piece begins. He is up on stage telling blue jokes (some of them very funny, like the one about the normal, dyslexic and nymphomaniac hens) whenever the vicar turns his back. In short, the miller has the audience in his hands and, of course, his tale is told in the end by popular demand. The doggerel in which the tales are related palls occasionally, but there is always the competition - and the splendid vicar - to return to. Audience participation abounds; if anything it is underdone - a Richmond audience, so close to Twickenham, would have liked a longer go at joining in Swing low, sweet chariot. Richmond Theatre until Saturday. Marlowe Theatre, Canterbury from April 11.</p>

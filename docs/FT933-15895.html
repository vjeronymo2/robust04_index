			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Mini-budget wins vote of confidence in Italy THE government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi last night won by a large majority a vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies endorsing the L12,500bn (Pounds 5.4bn) mini-budget unveiled on May 21, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Of the 522 deputies present, 311 voted for the government, 98 abstained and 113 voted against. This was the first time since taking office last May that the former governor of the Bank of Italy has sought a vote of confidence. He received the backing of the four partners in the coalition formally supporting his largely technocratic government. But in addition to the Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, he won support from the Republicans and Mr Marco Panella's Radicals. Mr Ciampi, in Tokyo for the G7 summit, resorted to a vote to prevent approval of the mini-budget from dragging on and thus interfering with preparation of next year's budget. There were still some 130 amendments pending, mainly tabled by the two most vociferous opposition groups: the Lombard League and Reconstructed Communism.</p>

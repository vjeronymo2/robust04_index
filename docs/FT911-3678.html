			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Menem's fiscal policy attacked ARGENTINA'S Catholic bishops have attacked the 'unjust' economic policies of President Carlos Menem, blaming them for creating an ever-wider gap between rich and poor. In a strongly worded note issued over the weekend, the bishop's also condemned widespread corruption which 'is destroying us as a people and as a society.' The note, issued at the end of the annual bishops' conference, is the second time in as many months that the powerful Catholic church has taken issue with Mr Menem. Last month they warned that 'generalised corruption' was undermining support for the government. The traditionalist hierarchy's latest broadside is significant because in the past it firmly supported conservative, often military, governments. Mr Menem, although nominally a Peronist, has adopted pro-business and free market policies.</p>

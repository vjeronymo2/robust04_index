			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT WORK;  </P> <P> SHELTER'S MOST PRESSING NEEDS  </P> <P> Beverly Perez became administrator of the Halcyon/Anaheim Interfaith Shelter  just a few months ago, but already she has seen people become self-supporting  after leaving the shelter with a nest egg and a sense of direction.  </P> <P> Her biggest worry is how to meet the needs of the homeless when the nonprofit  shelter, which depends on private donations and city grants, is constantly  threatened with cash flow problems.  </P> <P> Donations usually increase near the holidays, when toys for the children are  always plentiful, she says. But the needs continue after the holiday spirit  wanes, she stresses. Among the shelter's most pressing needs are:  </P> <P> * Entertainers to provide holiday programs for the children.  </P> <P> * Children's clothing and shoes.  </P> <P> * Furniture and food.  </P> <P> * Volunteers to tutor children in English and math.  </P> <P> * Donations of money or labor to renovate the apartment building, which has  severe plumbing and roofing problems.  </P> <P> To find out how you can help, call Perez at (714) 774-8502. SHERRY ANGEL  </P></p>

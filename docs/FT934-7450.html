			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Increased premiums aid Willis Corroon HIGHER PREMIUM rates and the strength of the dollar helped Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, increase pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 70.1m for first nine months of 1993, against Pounds 60.9m. Profits in the third quarter, excluding discontinued underwriting operations in the UK, rose by 31 per cent to Pounds 8.9m. Turnover for the nine months increased to Pounds 536.4m (Pounds 472.4m) including Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 15.9m) from discontinued operations. Earnings per share were 10.4p (9.9p) a fourth interim dividend of 1.65p is declared for a total of 6.6p (13.2p). Reflecting higher rates in the reinsurance market and in UK direct insurance business, brokerage and fee revenue grew by 3.5 per cent in underlying terms. Willis warned, however, that 'in the US market most premium rates, other than those for highly exposed property risks, are still depressed by competition'. Foreign exchange rate movements and in particular the strength of the dollar contributed Pounds 6.1m to profits, offseting a fall in investment income to Pounds 39.9m (Pounds 41.9m).</p>

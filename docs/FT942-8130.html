			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Gardening (The Chelsea Flower Show): Marquee of marvels Old-timers know it, but if this is your first visit to Chelsea and especially if you are a non-gardener, the following are the marvels of the Great Marquee. Miss these bravura displays and I am tempted to say you have missed the heart of the world's greatest flower show. Every year, the celebrated Woodford Brothers of Stratford-upon-Avon arrange a glorious symphony of lupins. Warmenhoven's bowls of enormous tulips always hold me spellbound, as do Brenda Hyatt's extraordinary auriculas. Equally unmissable are Blackmore &amp; Langdon's begonias and delphiniums and S &amp; N Brackley's sweet peas. For floral perfection, look to the fuchsia displays (Potash Nursery and Roualeyn Nursery). Indoor gardeners are always well served at Chelsea - year after year, Dibleys' stand has inspired people with a passion for streptocarpus, one of the most charming and easiest of flowering house-plants. Pleiones always look tempting on Butterfields Nursery's stand. Tropical Rain Forest's display of bromeliads or 'air plants' can be relied upon to fascinate. Serious plant hunters must look for two specialist shrub and tree nurseries. Mallet Court Nursery's owner is something of a plant-collector. He displays rarities such as Tapiscia sinensis (an anagram of pistacia), raised from seed sent from China, Pterocarya insignis, and exotic oaks grown from seed collected in the mountains of Mexico. Acer enthusiasts should inspect Millicient, a jazzy variety of Acer morrisonense Hayata. Bluebell Nurseries of Swadlincote in Derbyshire is another connoisseurs' nursery, and it boasts Sinocalycanthus chinensis, a shrub with white flowers in June. It also exhibits Caragana jubata, described as a strange, shaggy Mongolian affair, and Senecio gnapholodes, a prostrate willow-like plant from Crete. Several delphiniums make their debut, among them Albert Sheppard from perennial specialists Rougham Hall, and salmon-pink Princess Caroline from Burncoose. A Dutch creation, it achieves the long looked-for goal of a tall-growing red delphinium which can be grown out of doors. Variegation is an easy way to stand out in a crowd. This year Bressingham Gardens is launching Polemonium Brise d'Anjou, discovered in France. I also look forward to their new verbena Homestead Purple. Even more eagerly anticipated are the year's new clematis exhibited by Valley Clematis, which always makes a lovely show. Lady in Red sounds intriguing if alarming, with its orangey-red flowers. There are five new varieties from the US and Guernsey. Arctic Queen sounds like a winner if it is true that here is a double white which really is double and floriferous for the whole season. Gardeners can rely on unearthing something to their advantage in the educational section. If there is something nasty in the lawn, the Institute of Groundsmanship will analyse specimens. This year the University of Reading addresses itself to the compelling problem of pest control. And at the Plantlife stand you can do your bit for the environment by joining the Great Hedge Scheme. This year's show gardens more than ever are linked to charities. Watch out for the gardens for the blind, for allergy sufferers, for people with learning disabilities, families with sick children, and even a holistic garden for the terminally ill.</p>

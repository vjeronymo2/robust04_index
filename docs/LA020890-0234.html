			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ARMY RETRIEVES 14 COMBAT MEDALS;  </P> <P> PANAMA INVASION: EMBARRASSED MILITARY SAYS BADGES WERE MISTAKENLY GIVEN TO  NON-INFANTRY WOUNDED GIS.  </P> <P> The Army, in an embarrassing admission, is taking back Combat Infantryman  Badges from 14 wounded soldiers who were mistakenly granted the coveted awards  within days of their involvement in the Panama invasion.  </P> <P> Some of the awards were incorrectly bestowed because the wounded men were still  under sedation when the medals were pinned to their pillows and could not be  quizzed about their duties during the incursion, according to Army spokesman  Maj. Joe Padilla.  </P> <P> Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army chief of staff, awarded the medals during a widely  publicized visit to two military hospitals in San Antonio, Tex., on Dec. 22.  </P> <P> The chief of staff awarded 186 medals -- such as Combat Infantryman Badges and  Purple Hearts -- during his time at the hospitals, Padilla said.  </P> <P> "There were 14 non-infantry soldiers awarded the CIB in Operation Just Cause.  However, the awards have since been withdrawn and the affected soldiers  notified," Padilla said.  </P> <P> Although the awards apparently were given with some haste and without the usual  review, the spokesman said the decision was not made to grant the medals just  for publicity's sake.  </P> <P> "This was not a photo op for Gen. Vuono," Padilla said. "This was an honest  mistake."  </P> <P> "It was thought to be an opportunity for the men to be decorated by the chief  of staff of the Army. . . . It was an effort to distinguish those soldiers  thought to be deserving, and allow those who were wounded to wake up with the  award on their pillow," Padilla said.  </P> <P> A pool of reporters was permitted to accompany Vuono to Wilford Hall Medical  Center for the presentation of medals to just three soldiers. The general also  visited nearby Brooke Army Medical Center.  </P> <P> The badges had been granted to men who were military policemen, artillery  soldiers, communications specialists, truck drivers and specialists in  psychological operations, not infantrymen, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Combat Infantryman Badge is granted only to officers or enlisted personnel  with specific infantry specialties who have "satisfactorily performed their  duty" in an infantry unit while it has engaged in combat, Padilla said.  </P> <P> A formal review of the CIB awards found 14 were incorrectly given to soldiers  who were not infantrymen or did not have infantry specialties, Padilla said.  </P></p>

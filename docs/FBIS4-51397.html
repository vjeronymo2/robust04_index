			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Yesterday, Tianjin Municipality held a  mobilization meeting on grafting, readjustment, and  transformation of state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises, calling on state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises across the municipality to take actions immediately,  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the second session  of the sixth municipal party committee and of the municipal  economic work conference, seize the opportunity, accelerate  development, realize the fighting objective of generally  conducting grafting, readjustment, and transformation in all  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and contribute  to invigorating Tianjin's economy.    Municipal leading comrades Zhang Lichang, Li Shenglin, Li  Huifen, and Zhang Haosheng, responsible comrades of relevant  committees, offices, and bureaus, and party and administrative  top leaders of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises  attended the meeting.    Zhang Lichang gave an important speech at the meeting. He  said: Tianjin's development of situation is very encouraging.  During the first quarter of this year, the achievements in  several major economic norms were the best during recent years.  The four major fighting objectives of "3-5-8-10" proposed by  the municipal party committee and the municipal government are  greatly supported by the broad masses of people, and the popular  morale is greatly boosted. Using a period of eight years to  generally conduct grafting, readjustment, and transformation in  state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises is the key to  invigorating the existing number of enterprises of this  category, the basis, and the requirement for realizing other  fighting objectives. Practice showed that it is not realistic  to adopt the attitude of "waiting for, relying on, and asking  for help" in the course of changing the backward outlook of  enterprises and that we must emancipate ourselves. It is  necessary to fully mobilize the masses to "show their special  talents." At present, we are facing a very favorable  international and domestic macro environment. As long as the  upper and lower levels across the municipality seek unity of  thinking, strengthen confidence, work on their own initiative,  take voluntary actions, develop cooperation at home, conduct  grafting externally, and try by all possible means to use  domestic and foreign funds, all difficulties will be resolved,  old enterprises will be rejuvenated, and Tianjin will have great  hope.    Li Huifen addressed the meeting. He said: Since the  beginning of this year, with the spirit of never delaying the  work of one day, the municipal relevant departments have  conducted lots of investigations to know the real situation and  to determine the enterprise category, size, and planning work.  In line with the actual municipal situation, at present, we  have designated 748 enterprises as the municipality's  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, of which three  are exceptionally large enterprises, 138 are large enterprises,  and 607 are medium-sized enterprises. At present, relevant  departments have formulated plans for enterprise grafting,  readjustment, and transformation. These plans have defined a  high starting point, clear ideas, and explicit objectives, and  placed the resting point on raising economic efficiency,  cultivating new economic growing points, and laying a good  foundation for the next step of work.    Li Huifen set forth demands on successfully conducting  grafting, readjustment, and transformation in state-owned large  and medium- sized enterprises. She said: It is necessary to  fully understand the major significance in successfully  conducting enterprise grafting, readjustment, and transformation  work. The four major fighting objectives of "3-5-8-10" is an  important policy decision of the municipal party committee and  government for invigorating Tianjin's economy. Of this, using  eight years or so to generally conduct grafting, readjustment,  and transformation in state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises is the basis and requirement of these four  objectives and where the key to realizing the four objectives  lies. Without the sustained and steady development of the  industrial economy, it is impossible to quadruple the GNP of the  whole municipality three years ahead of schedule; it is also  difficult to renovate dangerous and shabby houses if enterprises  have difficulties and workers have no money to do it; and in  building coastal new areas, it is necessary to have stable  social environment and economic conditions. Judging from  Tianjin's present situation of state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises, owing to some historical reasons, some  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the  municipality have not been transformed for a long time, and the  phenomenon of outdated enterprises and obsolete equipment is  very serious. Among the state-owned large and medium- sized  enterprises, there are some money-losing enterprises. The  fundamental way out to end the situation of low level,  unmarketable products, and low efficiency in these enterprises  is to accelerate enterprise grafting, readjustment, and  transformation, update and upgrade products, and urge  enterprises to end deficits, increase profits, and raise  economic efficiency.

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Ukraine's government adopts a reform plan THE Ukrainian cabinet yesterday approved a tough economic reform programme which seeks to steer Ukraine towards a market economy over the next year. The plan, supported by both the conservative and progressive wings of the government, suggests that the Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, has succeeded in converting his government to reform. The programme includes a stabilisation policy to reduce the budget deficit from 36 per cent of gross domestic product to 6 per cent. It also aims to bring inflation down to 3 or 4 per cent a month by the end of 1993. To do that the government has pledged to cut social welfare payments and subsidies to the state sector. The plan also calls for comprehensive structural reform including rapid privatisation of small-scale enterprises and the transformation of large state concerns into joint stock companies. The programme is likely to further anger Ukraine's ex- communist dominated parliament. The hardline parliament has already called for the repeal of government decrees liberalising prices, privatising land and capping wages at state enterprises. Survey, Page 29</p>

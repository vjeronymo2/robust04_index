			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / UK Company News: The mother of kitchen sink dramas - The row brewing over continuing losses at Pentos A group of former senior managers at Pentos, the specialist retailer, have accused Mr Bill McGrath, the new chief executive, of making things worse at the lossmaking company with mistaken strategies and trading policies. The managers were stung into comment by the worse than expected half-year results, announced earlier this month, which showed pre-tax losses of Pounds 36m, including a further Pounds 10.5m of charges. None of the managers would speak attributably, but they expressed concern that the future of Pentos might be in doubt unless current policies were changed. One of the factors worrying them most was that there should be further charges. Last year's losses of Pounds 70m had included large provisions. In his recent book 'Against My Better Judgment', Mr Terry Maher, the ousted chairman of Pentos, claimed that a small profit envisaged at the September board meeting had been turned into the Pounds 70m loss by 'the mother and father of 'kitchen sink' jobs' in terms of taking provisions. One former manager said the total provisions had been so large that 'my grandchild could now run Pentos at a profit'. The complaints included that destocking at Dillons, the booksellers, had been too extreme; price-cutting at Rymans, the stationers, had been too vigorous; the group was planning to spend too much on a new centralised computer system; and it was not listening to staff who knew how to run the business. 'It's got far worse because of what's been done, not what Terry (Maher) did,' said one. However, another dismissed manager said he thought the former management team at Pentos bore much greater responsibility for the company's problems than anything Mr McGrath was responsible for. Mr McGrath, who once ran Wickes, the DIY chain, made it clear he was irritated at having to defend himself against anonymous former 'disaffected management'. But he then went through the state of Pentos, which he believes would not have survived without the Pounds 45m rights issue which became available in May. 'The business had bank debts of over Pounds 90m and owed suppliers nearly Pounds 55m, and this is a company with a turnover of Pounds 245m. I think that might put into perspective how the business had been managed up until then,' said Mr McGrath. The new provisions, he said, ranged from rent so far behind that it was paid at the end of the year rather than the beginning, uncertainty over how many gift vouchers had been issued or redeemed, unmatched invoices and overdue personal debts on books. 'The first write-offs were not the kitchen sink. This was cleaning up what had been a badly run administrative process. We are now improving our market share,' Mr McGrath said. At Dillons, he found that for 40 per cent of the stock, not a single title had been sold in six months. The company still stocks 200,000 titles - but these were books people wanted to buy, he added. 'We have sales parity with last year, with stocks a third lower,' he added. Efforts have also been made to improve relationships with suppliers. Some small publishers had in the past not been paid for up to nine months. Mr McGrath said that when he looked into the direct mail order book business he found teenage staff on the first floor of the company's Kensington store sorting out cheques lined up on the carpet. The company has now produced separate catalogues for Dillons and Hatchards, and the business is handled by a third party supplier. Mr McGrath believes that Rymans was 'way out of line on price', a perception backed up by market research. Rymans was now selling at a 5 to 7 per cent premium to out-of-town operators, a fair difference for convenience, he said. Athena was trying to sell picture frames at prices 40 per cent above anything comparable. 'We are now selling picture frames 60 per cent cheaper than a year ago with a margin that is better.' Mr McGrath said Pentos was trading within its bank borrowing limit of Pounds 69m. The company had reached its annual peak at Pounds 63m to Pounds 64m, and Mr McGrath was feeling positive about the Christmas period. 'We are through the worst. We have addressed the fundamentals, cleared out the stables,' said Mr McGrath, who accepts that the previous management had never acted with anything other than the best of intentions. The centralised computer system is also going ahead, under the eye of an internal committee - chaired by Mr Tony Maher, son of the former chairman.</p>

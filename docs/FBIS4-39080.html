			<p>BFN     [Text] Tiraspol BASAPRESS, 3/6/1994 -- The Dniester  Republic's delegation will not disregard the referendum which  expresses the independence of the Dniester Republic's people and  its right to individual statehood, stated today to Tiraspol  Radio Ana Volkova, former member of the Dniester delegation  attending the negotiations on granting a special juridical  status to the eastern districts. Nicolae Andronic, Moldovan  deputy speaker of parliament, stated to Tiraspol Radio on 31 May  that the Tiraspol leaders are to be blamed for jeopardizing the  settlement of the Dniester conflict. Concerning these  statements, Volkova mentioned that the Moldovan Parliament's  statements contain "inaccuracies or even distortions of events."  Volkova said that Andronic's statements are unfounded. She  mentioned that it was the Tiraspol representatives who proposed  a plan for a confederation in Moldova. Volkova said that if  Chisinau had accepted that plan, the Dniester conflict would  have been solved long ago. Volkova added that it was the  Moldovan delegation who left the negotiations "arguing that the  commission's members were on vacation or that the parliament was  dissolved."</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / NZ split over 'dry' minister MR JIM Anderton, leader of New Zealand's Alliance party, which holds the balance of power in the new parliament, cannot work with Finance Minister Ruth Richardson, he said yesterday, Terry Hall writes from Wellington. Ms Richardson was regarded as a leading 'dry' in cabinet, and has been largely blamed by opposition parties for helping push through sweeping reforms in social welfare, health and other areas. 'Ruth is all for pushing on while the country wants to take its foot off the accelerator,' Mr Anderton said. The prime minister has refused to comment on the likely shape of the new cabinet, to be formed after 200,000 special votes are counted next week.</p>

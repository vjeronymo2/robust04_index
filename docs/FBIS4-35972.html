			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After taking part in the funeral of the martyrs  of the Israeli raid at Rawdat al-Shahidayn Mosque at 1100 today,  Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah stressed that the  confrontation with the enemy will continue until the land is  liberated. He called for withdrawing from negotiations with the  enemy and for not relying on the UN Security Council. He called  for making the resistance a general national plan. He said that  the resistance is the rock on which the occupation will founder  and the homeland will be unified. He declared that the  resistance has been born anew with the fall of the martyrs  yesterday. He stressed that any peace given to the killers of  prophets and people and the usurpers of land and sanctities is a  disgrace no matter what the justifications and circumstances.

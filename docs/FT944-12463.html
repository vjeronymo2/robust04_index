			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Ambroveneto up 9.7% more on bid talk Yesterday's downswing in US sentiment, weighing upon the New York morning, was manifest in the European afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN continued to feature bid activity and speculation in banks, while the strength of Fiat also contributed to a 11.22 or 1.8 per cent rise in the Comit index to 635.43. Traders commented that volume held up surprisingly well at around the recent depressed daily average of L500bn with banks closed by a strike for much of the day and ahead of today's public holiday. Ambroveneto, rumoured as a bid target, advanced a further L462 or 9.7 per cent to L5,236, taking its surge over the last three sessions to 34 per cent. BCI, thought to be a possible suitor, gained L94 or 2.7 per cent at L3,556. Credito Romagnolo picked up L71 to L16,949, off a high of L17,400, but still short of the L19,000 price offered by Credito Italiano. Credito rose L35 or 2.2 per cent to L1,640. Fiat put in a solid performance, climbing L59 to L6,283 on renewed buying by Italian funds. Ferruzzi added L60 or 4.9 per cent at L1,293, with investors who had sold the stock at higher prices said to be returning as buyers. FRANKFURT offered apparent gains on the session, but these mostly reflected last Friday afternoon, when a higher dollar, rising bond prices and an ebullient Wall Street made their mark in Europe; yesterday the Dax index closed the official session at 2,071.63, up 31.31, of which 27.12 points were gained on Friday. Later indications were more subdued. The Ibis indicated Dax ended 3.28 lower at 2,061.58, with individual features few and far between. Turnover rose from DM5.4bn to DM5.6bn. However, Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf produced his monthly review of the Dax and its constituents, which included a couple of hopeful pointers in yesterday's uncertain times: first, while there were some almost superstitious worries about the month of October, the Dax did better than many expected last month, with a 3 per cent gain against a 9.1 per cent fall in September; and second, the presence of three banks, Deutsche, Bayernverein and Bayernhypo, in the top five Dax performers in October could suggest that the bond market is over the worst - although Mr Frahm was cautious about this, with US elections coming up. ZURICH put in another firm performance, with dollar sensitive issues leading the way, and the SMI index finished 16.0 ahead at 2,506.5 but off a day's high of 2,521.6. Among the dollar earners, Roche certificates gained SFr125 at SFr5,585. Surveillance surged SFr120 or 7.1 per cent to SFr1,820 while Holderbank and Nestle each improved SFr20 to SFr969 and SFr1,174 respectively. In the banking sector, UBS bearers fell SFr23 to SFr1,177 as investors continued to switch out of the stock ahead of the extraordinary shareholders meeting on November 22. The bank's statement that unfavourable market conditions would cause this year's earnings to fall short of the 1993 level came after the market closed. CS Holding, a beneficiary of switching out of UBS, gained SFr8 to SFr549. Among firm insurers, Zurich rose SFr10 to SFr1,145 and Winterthur added SFr4 to SFr638 francs ahead of Thursday's news conference. AMSTERDAM climbed as investors awaited third quarter results from a number of major Dutch companies later in the week. The AEX index gained 3.57 to 412.62, after 415.35. The market was also supported by strength in the dollar and in bonds, although there was a slight sell off when Wall Street opened down. Philips was among the day's gainers, up Fl 1.70 or 3.1 per cent to Fl 55.80 ahead of its third quarter results which are due on Thursday. The figures are expected to show that the electronics group is making substantial progress in its return to financial health. DSM, which opens the reporting season today, went against the trend, off Fl 1.80 to Fl 146.00 as profits were taken following strong gains in the past week. Analysts expected the chemicals group to return a profit of around Fl 102m, against a net loss of Fl 52m in the same 1993 period. Akzo Nobel, which reports tomorrow, moved ahead Fl 2.60 to Fl 212.90. MADRID managed to report a gain in spite of renewed bond market weakness. The general index rose 0.97 to 296.30 as the domestic December bond future fell 50 basis points to 86.75. Turnover was thin ahead of today's holiday, at Pta18.8bn. Repsol was the big blue chip winner with a rise of Pta50 to Pta4,005, off an intraday high of Pta4,070. The oil company is expected to release third quarter results soon. Constructions, weak last week, recovered with Cubiertas Pta120 higher at Pta8,050 and FCC up Pta150 at Pta12,600. In retailers, Cortefiel rose Pta120 to Pta4,480 on first half results which showed net profits up 7.6 per cent. STOCKHOLM enjoyed a broad rally led by the pharmaceutical group, Astra, and the engineer, Asea. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 13.2 to 1,485.0 with Astra A up SKr5.50 at SKr194.50 and Asea, which owns 50 per cent of the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, ABB Asea Brown Boveri, up SKr7 to SKr522 in a rebound after recent losses.

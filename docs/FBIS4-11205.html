			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 22 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Friday, the  Nicaraguan Government Ministry confirmed it has ordered the  arrest of U.S. citizen John Hull, a naturalized Costa Rican  citizen. Hull has several criminal charges pending in Costa  Rica and is believed to be in Nicaragua, although his  whereabouts are unknown.    Today, an official spokesman said the police began an  investigation to locate the 74-year old Hull, who is charged  with attacking anti-Sandinist guerrilla leader Eden Pastora in a  place called La Penca on the Nicaraguan border 10 years ago.  Hull, who is also accused of drug trafficking and supplying arms  to the former Nicaraguan contras, fled Costa Rica to the United  States several years ago, according to Costa Rican newspaper  sources.    Today, BARRICADA published a report that Hull arrived in  Nicaragua on 17 February through El Espino customs checkpoint on  the Honduran border and that he is currently living on a cattle  ranch near Juigalpa in the central Department of Chontales.    Even though police authorities have confirmed Hull's arrest  warrant, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman told ACAN-EFE  that the Costa Rican Government still has not requested  extradition of the American, who is now a naturalized Costa  Rican citizen. On Monday, Costa Rican President Rafael Angel  Calderon Fournier reported that his government sent a note to  the U.S. authorities requesting Hull's extradition.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A Brechtian Macbeth - The Schiller Theatre's visit THE SCHILLER Theater's version of Macbeth opened to a packed house at the Mermaid on Thursday and departs after today - a lamentably short stay for such a pyrotechnic performance. If you can't get in this evening, try to catch up with it in Berlin or wherever, for Die Tragodie des Macbeth, as it is called in full, really ought to have been given a run of several weeks at the National or the Barbican. Still, the Mermaid is not a bad place for it: a dilapidated, open stage that reminds one of the old Brecht shows in East Berlin. Forget about Schiller: this production has Brecht and the Berliner Ensemble written all over it. The director, Katharina Thalbach, grew up and trained under the Brecht influence. She moved to the Schiller Theater in West Berlin in 1976 to keep the flag flying, and how right she was. Perhaps only the West Germans have the resources to do Brecht in full style. The Brechtian approach relies heavily on stunning stage effects. In Macbeth, we see this most sharply with the witches. They are not only tarts and punks  -you would expect that from the German cabaret of the 1930s. They also suspend themselves acrobatically from a huge spider's web (made out of rope) strung on the roof. When they prepare themselves for the equivalent of the cauldron scene, all three of them simultaneously use a chamber pot and throw the contents against a wall which is already daubed with symbols of German anarchism and the graffito 'Fair is Foul and Foul is Fair'. When the blood flows in this Macbeth, it does not look like tomato sauce, but more like a substance from one of the German chemical companies. Some of the actors seem to be dripping living blood and sweat throughout. When Macbeth is finally, viciously stabbed, the spurt of blood form his mouth brings a horrified gasp from the audience. Yet the show is not all intense. Just before Macbeth is killed, his final battle with Macduff is played as a parody - two men shielding themselves with dustbin lids and whacking each other with sticks. Some of the interpretations have been seen in previous English productions. For example, when Duncan arrives to stay with Macbeths, he makes a direct pass at the lady and expects to have her: the diversion is that she has other things on her mind. The banqueting scene, too, has elements that could come in an English performance. Lady Macbeth lays the huge white table cloth herself. When Macbeth is disturbed by the recurrent appearances of Banquo, he wraps himself up in it as if it were a sheet and lies down on the table with his wife. The brilliance of the scene is to have such a large table, but only dinner for four (five, including Banquo). The Germans again have great fun with differences between England and Scotland. In Scotland, it appears, the men really don't wear pants under their kilts. In England, by contrast, the men are effeminate. They listen to madrigals, cleverly taken from other bits of Shakespeare, and drink tea. One or two points are perverse and must be put down to the Brechtian, Marxist influence. Duncan is presented as an unattractive figure simply because he is a king, and Macbeth turns ridiculously obese and gross once he has assumed the crown. Not only does that destroy some of the Shakespearean drama; it means that this Macbeth is a play without feeling and the development of character. That's Brecht: all symbols and no individuals. In the end, however, there's much more to this version than Brecht. There is a marvellous moment at the start when a movie-star looking Lady Macbeth calls out of a window for her husband. At first she says his name in a dominant way, then in a strain of despair as if she knows that she has lost him as a result of her own ambition. That is is the story of Lady Macbeth. Some of the most dramatic verse (like 'tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow') is faithfully kept and comes out beautifully in German. So does Macduff's reaction on hearing of the murder of his wife and children. What you get overall is a different mix from (say) an RSC production. There must be some way of having productions like this in London more often.</p>

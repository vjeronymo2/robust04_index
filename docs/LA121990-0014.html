			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON LEADERSHIP;  </P> <P> WE'RE NOT SEEING MASTER STROKES;  </P> <P> POLITICIANS ACT MOST OFTEN BY SPASM OR WHIM, WITH NO MORE THOUGHT THAN A  MOTORIST FIGHTING HIS WAY HOME ON THE FREEWAY.  </P> <P> I think it was Gladstone who described his duties as prime minister of Britain  as that of the guy on a raft in a rapids, using a pole to keep the raft from  smashing into the rocks. That is probably history's most honest rendering of  how government actually functions.  </P> <P> Consider the metaphor: The ship of state is referred to as a raft -- the most  unmanageable of watercraft. The person in command does not use a rudder, which  is how you steer a ship. He uses a pole to fend off rocks -- he is reactive  rather than pro-active, trying to avoid disaster rather than trying to steer a  proper course. And the raft is being carried down a rapids -- he has no idea  where he is going but is being swept along by forces he cannot control.  </P> <P> There are two great fictions about life that people in government and, worse,  in the media, treat as gospel. The first is that people in high-government  offices all over the world know what they are doing. The second is that  government officials in crises make brilliant tactical moves.  </P> <P> The Persian Gulf crisis offers itself as an object lesson in how history works  before historians get their chance to change it.  </P> <P> On Aug. 2, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. One may reasonably assume that he  took this action in anticipation of doubling his country's net financial worth  at minimum cost. Earlier discussions with the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad,  unfortunately, reinforced that view. Perhaps he had plans for a further sojourn  south into Saudi Arabia, perhaps not. At the least, he anticipated that he  would be able to dominate Saudi Arabia politically through the overt threat of  military force on its borders, allowing him to maximize the economic benefit of  his oil wealth through market control. If successful, it would have been called  a master stroke.  </P> <P> But there aren't many master strokes in human history. This same Saddam Hussein  10 years ago launched a war of aggression into Iran in hope of achieving a  quick, cheap victory, and that war mutated into an eight-year nightmare --  World War I fought with some of World War III's weapons -- that took the lives  of more than a million people. And after invading Kuwait, Hussein gave back  what little he had gained at the cost of between 2% and 3% of his total  population; this action -- called by some a brilliant maneuver -- was  undertaken to secure his northeastern frontier against a country that would  still probably like to see his head on a pike. Any reasonable analysis will  suggest that the move was one of desperation rather than brilliance.  </P> <P> Hussein's subsequent moves have shown little greater perception. Taking unto  himself thousands of hostages, he tried to give them back in dribs and drabs to  any official or amateur agent who bothered purchasing air fare to Baghdad. He  failed to consider the logic of his own action, and either got carried away and  decided to give them all back, or decided that there was no further use in  holding them. That is, after enraging people all over the world through  kidnaping, he is seeking to garner favor by admitting his crime and returning  his victims. It would have made far more sense not to have taken them, or  having done so, to hold onto them.  </P> <P> One of the reasons given for releasing the hostages is the most laughable of  all: that Hussein was encouraged by resistance among Americans and within  Congress to the President's action. One might speculate that Hussein's  ambassador in Washington -- yet another perceptive individual -- failed to tell  his boss that the President's drop in approval polls more probably reflected  the same waffling on budget matters that hurt Republican congressional  candidates (people do not compartmentalize their views on a person's  competence) and that the drop was already reversing itself anyway. And Congress  will do what it always does in a time of crisis -- that is, it looks concerned  while taking no substantive action, like every other committee in the civilized  world.  </P> <P> Despite all this, we are inundated by news stories -- and their most dreaded  companions, "news analysis" columns -- telling us of the cleverness of  Hussein's political and psychological maneuvering. Those pieces are often  written by the very commentators who warned for two generations of the  political demise of NATO and the brilliant psychological campaigns of the  Warsaw Pact (that is, preventing us from deploying theater nuclear forces),  which, by the way, no longer exists, though the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization is as strong as ever.  </P> <P> On the American side, while it is true that President Bush has done  extraordinarily well in organizing world reaction against Hussein, it probably  helped that geopolitical conflict between the United States and the Soviet  Union has ended. As a result, there was no one else around to stoke up  opposition, and with only one banner to march behind, the world marched with  Bush more or less by default.  </P> <P> Similarly, our buildup of forces, impressive as it has been, has at all times  been fully regulated by objective forces. The U.S. Merchant Marine is so  depleted that we could not have deployed our heavy forces -- you can't fly  tanks from place to place very efficiently -- any faster regardless of the  situation. We came within a whisker of chartering at least one Russian ship to  help speed our deployment, which one might also call a sign of some  desperation.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, we have the comedy of manners taking place on Capitol Hill. One U.S.  senator lambasts the secretary of state for not having any decent alternatives  to the use of force, but on being asked for one, admits that he doesn't have a  clue. Another senator criticizes the secretary of defense for getting our  troops a little too ready for action, then admits that he once told the  secretary that getting our troops ready to win was his only job. An overweening  consistency, as Emerson liked to say, is the hobgoblin of little minds. One  wonders if the quote might not have been flubbed by his editor.  </P> <P> In fairness to Congress, one need only look at history. Horace Greeley who,  during the 1860 election campaign, was a firebrand for emancipation at any  price, immediately after the election of Lincoln decided that letting the  Southern states go in peace, while retaining their "peculiar institution," was  not so bad an idea after all.  </P> <P> As I said earlier, this is a most interesting case study of what actually  happens before historians get a chance to change it all.  </P> <P> The continuing theme is reasonably clear, however. People are all the same.  While still in the insurance business, I developed Clancy's Law of Accidents:  The only difference between a wise man and a fool is that a wise man makes much  more serious mistakes. Privates don't lose battles; generals do, and you have  to be smart to become a general. You must also be smart to be a physician, but  they kill patients all the time. It's merely human nature. Everyone makes  mistakes. One's title or office does not make one immune. The problem is that a  lot of people with titles and offices act as though they are immune, and the  media contribute to this fiction.  </P> <P> People in all fields of life fail to think their actions through. They begin to  do something about an immediate tactical problem but without examining the  downstream consequences of their action. Hitler invaded Poland thinking that  England and France would not honor their recent guarantee to the Poles. Johnson  put troops in Vietnam without examining their mission. Reagan put Marines in  Beirut without wondering what they would do there or when they might leave. The  Russians tried for years to outstrip Western military spending without noticing  that they vitiated their own economy in the process. The phenomenon is not  merely international, of course. Domestically, we installed a welfare system  that wrecked poor families and were surprised at the crime that resulted; we  started federal student loans and then watched college costs outstrip inflation  faster than a space-shuttle launch. And so forth. It would help if people  admitted mistakes, but those with titles and offices are never very keen on  that, are they -- and are the rest of us any more willing?  </P> <P> But the media -- and, later, historians with telescopic but selective hindsight  -- see purpose in random behavior and brilliance in befuddlement. Politicians  undertake actions most often by spasm or whim, perhaps with no more thought  than a motorist fighting his way home on the freeway, changing lanes to get a  few yards of progress, and in the process adding to the jam rather than letting  it sort itself out.  </P> <P> Doesn't anybody think? The cost of not thinking is often death and misery, and  if the media ever started pointing that out instead of imputing legitimacy to  every random remark of political figures, maybe we could save a life or two. At  the very least we might let people know what is actually going on.  </P></p>

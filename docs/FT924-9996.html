			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / OFT is promised pub checklist Bass, Allied-Lyons, Courage and Whitbread  - have undertaken to supply yearly details of the size and composition of their pub estates to the Office of Fair Trading. The information will enable the OFT to monitor compliance with the government's orders requiring the national brewers to dispose of 12,000 pubs, about a third of their estates, by last weekend. As a result of the orders, national brewers own 31.6 per cent of the country's pubs, compared with 43 per cent in 1986. The weakening of the brewers' grip  - initiated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the industry in 1989  - was intended to 'increase competition in brewing, wholesaling and retailing . . . reduce prices and widen consumer choice'. A report is expected from the OFT next year on the extent to which those aims have been achieved. The results, so far, have fallen well short of the targets. The disposal of the national brewers' pubs has opened the retail market to many new, independent pub companies and enabled the regional brewers to strengthen their pub estates. But the restructuring has cost the nationals an estimated Pounds 500m, and in the resulting turmoil many tenants have lost their livelihoods and up to 2,000 pubs have closed. The dispersal of pub ownership has been matched by increased consolidation of beer production. Several companies have quit brewing to concentrate on their more profitable retailing operations. Grand Metropolitan sold its breweries to Courage; Boddington, Devenish, and Greenalls closed their regional breweries. In 1989, the six largest brewers controlled 77 per cent of production; when the proposed merger of Allied's brewing operations with those of Carlsberg is completed, 82 per cent of production will be in the hands of five companies. Competition between national brewers to supply the enlarged 'free' market has increased; but each has maintained beer supplies to most of the pubs it has sold or leased by negotiating long-term contracts with the new owners. Consumer choice has been only marginally improved. Bar prices, far from falling, have increased by 17 per cent above inflation during the past three years.</p>

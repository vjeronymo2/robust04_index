			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Tough time making a level playing field: Richard Waters on moves to put the world's financial centres on an even footing INTERNATIONAL agreements between financial regulators are seldom what they appear. Ostensibly devised to ensure the integrity of international markets or reinforce the financial system against unexpected shocks, they are often the result of a quite different motivation: the desire by heavily-regulated nations to prevent companies in lightly-regulated ones from gaining an advantage in international markets. Last week's proposals from the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision on the market risks run by banks fit the usual pattern. Laying down common minimum capital levels for banks which trade equities, debt and foreign exchange, as well as the derivatives which have grown up around these core markets, has obvious prudential attractions. However, the move springs at least as much from a drive to put the world's main financial centres on an equal footing. Securities firms in London in particular have long enjoyed a lighter capital regime than elsewhere. The Basle Committee's last attempt at international harmonisation - the 1988 accord which established an 8 per cent minimum capital level to back credit risks - was motivated by similar concerns. By forcing Japanese banks in particular to back their loans with more capital, the accord helped more heavily capitalised banks to maintain their position in international banking markets. Establishing the same 'level playing field' in other financial markets is proving more difficult. The Basle Committee had hoped to reach a common agreement on market risk with the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), which represents securities regulators. This would have led to a common framework for commercial banks as well as investment banks and securities houses. That plan foundered last year when Mr Richard Breeden, outgoing head of the US's Securities and Exchange Commission, vetoed the proposals on the grounds that they were too lax. Making the playing field more uneven is a European Community directive on capital adequacy for both banks and securities firms, agreed last year. The result is a mess: securities firms outside the EC will not have to adhere to any international guidelines, while banks inside it will have to meet two different sets of rules for measuring market risk. In at least two respects, the Basle rules have been pitched at a more stringent level than the EC's directive. Foreign exchange risks - against which banks previously have not had to provide any capital at all - will eat up more capital. Also, the 'specific risk' in equities (the risk that a particular stock will fall in relation to the market, as distinct from the general market risk that all prices will fall) will need 4 per cent capital backing, rather than the 2 per cent required by the EC. The complex rules apply different risk-measurement systems to debt, equities and foreign exchange. They also recognise different methods of measuring risk for the same instruments, particularly when it comes to derivatives: banks which have invested in sophisticated risk-management systems will be able to use these in determining the risk they report for regulatory purposes, provided they are approved by national regulators. However, Mr Gerald Corrigan, chairman of the New York Fed and of the Basle Committee, concedes: 'No regime is capable of capturing all of the activities and trading strategies that individual institutions use.' The treatment of even relatively familiar practices could arouse opposition. For instance, banks involved in stock index arbitrage - which involves taking opposite positions in a stock index future and the underlying stocks  -are allowed a concessionary 2 per cent capital weighting on each leg of the transaction, adding up to 4 per cent overall, even though an effective arbitrage trade can leave a bank with no market risk. It is the treatment of strategies like these, and the many situations in which banks use positions in different financial markets partially to offset one another, that will determine just how hard the Basle rules bite. Meanwhile, banking regulators are holding out the hope of renewed agreement with securities regulators before the Basle rules come into force, which will not be until 1997 at the earliest. The European directive provides for a review of EC law after three years. However, the prospect of revising the rules to conform with tougher requirements from Basle fills securities regulators with horror. 'We certainly don't want to have to re-open the directive,' one said. Whatever agreement is reached, the playing field will continue to look uneven. Banks will have to put up capital to reflect the effect that changes in interest rates will have on their holdings of debt securities, but will not have to take similar steps to guard against interest rate risks in their normal banking operations. This could help to reverse the bias in regulation in recent years that has encouraged the securitisation of bank assets. Instead, the Basle Committee last week published a paper proposing a common method for measuring a bank's overall interest-rate risk. While the latest Basle proposals may have wide-ranging and as yet unpredictable effects on banks' activities in the financial markets, they seem unlikely to have as profound an effect as the 1988 capital accord. That agreement helped to stem the growth of credit markets as banks sought to strengthen their capital bases. A similar damping of activity is unlikely. However, the proposals could change the way banks trade for their own account. As Mr Corrigan says: 'I would hope they would work in the direction of encouraging more conservative trading strategies and appr- oaches as they pertain to banks' proprietary trading activities.'

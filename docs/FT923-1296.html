			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Bleak prospect for rural employment MORE THAN 150,000 rural jobs may be lost in the 1990s as a result of a contraction in agriculture and industries that depend on farming, the Rural Development Commission said yesterday. The commission, which promotes rural development, says in its annual report that the 'peace dividend' resulting from a contraction of defence resources will also lead to job losses, especially in East Anglia - where nearly 2 per cent of the population is US forces personnel and families - and the south-west of England. It says an estimated 14,000 families are homeless in rural areas and homelessness is growing faster than in towns. Rural services and facilities are under continued pressure, with a number of village halls threatened by the cost of complying with new hygiene and safety regulations. Lord Shuttleworth, the commission chairman, says in his annual review that the nature of the changes taking place in the countryside are still insufficiently recognised. The countryside cannot be maintained by denying change or ignoring the needs of country people, he adds. The report says employment in small business grew faster in remoter rural areas between 1988 and 1991 than anywhere else in England but the recession means many businesses are now struggling for survival. The commission plans to expand its social programmes by more than 20 per cent over the next three years. It will provide funds to create land banks to speed the supply of inexpensive housing, give grants to help village halls meet the costs of new health legislation, and help national charities extend their services into rural areas. It is working on its Countryside Employment Programme to help to create new businesses and jobs in three pilot areas suffering badly from job losses. The commission has also expanded a programme to convert redundant farm buildings. RDC, 141 Castle Street, Salisbury, Wiltshire, SP1 3TP. Tel. 0722 336255. Pounds 13.50.</p>

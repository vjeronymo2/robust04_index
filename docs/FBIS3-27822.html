When Seoul was liberated by the People's Army in the period  of the fatherland liberation war, Chong, a middle school  student, joined the People's Army in September 1950 and fought  bravely before being called to the military band of the Supreme  Command.    He became a composer after graduating from a university.  Over the last 20 odd years he has composed the welcome music (a  band music) for major political functions, and hundreds of  pieces of band music, light music and instrumental concert.    Upon receiving the sixtieth birthday table and order of the  National Flag First Class amid the blessings of his  comrades-in-arms Friday, Chong Tu-myong said: "I feel the urge  to go to the South with this table and loudly tell my parents,  brothers and sisters and South Korean people that this is a  clear token of the noble love and politics of trust of our dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il for the revolutionary soldiers."</p>

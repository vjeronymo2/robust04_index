			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / US N-waste clean-up under attack The US department of energy's programme for cleaning up nuclear waste sites is extremely expensive and often ineffective, because of its failure to adopt new technologies, according to a General Accounting Office report. The congressional auditor's review of use of innovative technology in nuclear waste operations notes that, although the department has received Dollars 23bn (Pounds 14.9bn) for environmental management since 1989, 'little clean-up has resulted'. The result has been that, during the last five years, only about 10 per cent of the department's contaminated sites have been cleaned or closed, the GAO observed. During the past 40 years, more than 1bn cubic feet of hazardous and radioactive waste at weapons' plants has been disposed of. Many of the containers housing that waste are now unsafe. 'As a result of earlier disposal practices, soil and groundwater contamination is now widespread,' it said. The GAO said that more than 5,700 individual contaminated areas have been identified on department lands. 'Even where new technology has been successfully demonstrated, agency officials are reluctant to try new approaches, tending instead to choose conventional techniques to clean up their facilities,' the report says. Resistance to innovative techniques is due in part to the department's reliance on 'on-site contractors who may favour particular technologies on the basis of their own experiences and investments', and local governments which 'view faster clean-up as a threat to local economies' and see little incentive to adopt more efficient methods. The GAO stresses that developing less costly and more effective technologies may be the only way the US can afford the cleansings, which the department recently estimated would cost Dollars 300bn in the next 30 years. The department, which requested the review in January 1993, said yesterday it was taking steps to encourage technological innovation. 'This is a problem we've known about for some time and, over the last two years, we have been trying to come up with ways of utilising new technologies,' said Mr Gerald Boyd, director of the Office of Special Projects in technology development. However, the GAO pointed out that one of the other reasons for the tendency to use conventional techniques was 'the co-ordination flaws in the department's clean-up program. Individual offices have not worked together. . . to overcome the resistance to using improved technology'.</p>

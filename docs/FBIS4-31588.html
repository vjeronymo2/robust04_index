			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikola Sainovic, Federal Republic of </F> Yugoslavia deputy prime minister, by Dusko Petrovic; place and  date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Studio announcer] The decreasing of public  expenditure and primarily the decreasing of the deficit in the  federal and republican budgets is an extremely important task.  The further successful realization of the program of monetary  reconstruction and the country's economic recovery greatly  depends on it. It is well-known that the Serbian Government has  already undertaken concrete measures and activities in order to  further decrease the deficit in the republic's coffers and to  ensure that it is reimbursed only from real sources. What the  Federal Government plans to do in this respect is the question  that DNEVNIK put to Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic.    [Sainovic] We knew from the start that this was going to be  a difficult and very responsible task, but we planned in the  program to accomplish within six months something that this  state could not accomplish for years and that is to annul the  budget deficit. The results accomplished so far prove that this  task can be accomplished. The National Bank has already lent  both the republican and federal budgets less than was planned in  the program, and as things stand now, I am convinced that we are  going to accomplish this task regardless of all the difficulties  that accompany it.    In the same way that the economy -- in conditions of a real  economy -- is expected to produce, market, and live only on the  results of its work, the federation and the republics must get  along on the funds available, and we are going to accomplish  this.    [Petrovic] This assumes the ongoing financing of the federal  state and the federal units from real sources. Will the federal  state in July or August perhaps convert to borrowing money on  the money market and other sources?    [Sainovic] The basic thing is that in the second half of the  year, we are going to convert to financing only from real  sources, and the state should ideally finance itself from its  primary sources. Since it is not possible to decrease the  deficit solely by saving -- all the existing consumers cutting  expenses, monitoring every penny, and so forth -- the Federal  Government will initiate the implementation of a concept of  reorganization of the federal administration, which will be a  program that we have never had so far, not since the founding of  this federal state.    [Petrovic] Deputy Prime Minister, we can soon expect to see  a more efficient and modern federal state, more appropriate to  the conditions we are living under, the needs of the economy and  the citizens?    [Sainovic] On the basis of the concept that has been  prepared, we are going to implement such a reorganization of the  federal administration that it will be possible to precisely  pinpoint the responsibility of each ministry or an individual  part of it; there will be no great number of organizational  units in which responsibility and efficiency will be lost; there  will be fewer employees, the entire administration will fit into  one building -- the palace of the Federal Executive Council, and  I am convinced that this will represent the federal  administration's significant contribution to the program's  realization.    [Petrovic] Thank you very much.    [Sainovic] Thank you.</p>

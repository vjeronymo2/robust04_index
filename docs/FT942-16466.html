			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Books: TV favourite switches character THE HIPPOPOTAMUS by Stephen Fry Hutchinson, Pounds 14.99, 259 pages If it is true that a bad book makes a good film, then Stephen Fry ought to get on to his old chum Kenneth Branagh immediately. Do not close Renaissance Films yet - this one is a winner. On the other hand, if a pyrotechnic display of obscenity is an acceptable substitute for plot; if caricature is preferred to character; if meretriciousness is valued above intelligence - then Fry has written a major novel. As his central character, Ted Wallace, failed poet, pen-for-hire womaniser, might say: 'So what old love? The scrumptious PR girlies will do a number, whizz it up the bestseller list and make another packet for yours truly to squander on all sorts of nasty.' Part of the problem with this novel is that Stephen Fry the public persona - a mixture of superbrain and guttersnipe, a phonetic veneer highlighting a semantic leer - cannot be separated from 'Ted Wallace'. The two are indistinguishable, even though Wallace is an avowed heterosexual while Fry has different tastes, in particular, it seems, celibacy. If it were not by Fry - justifiably popular for his television performances - then this novel would - equally justifiably  - languish unloved and unread. Unfortunately, Fry's TV persona does not work when transferred to 'Ted Wallace', who has a knack for sophisticated swearing but not much else. Ultimately, absurdly, Fry asks us to accept Wallace as representative of some kind of transcendent but unfocused insight into humanity's frailties. But by then Wallace is just a cartoon who spouts clever crudities over the crudites. When the other characters talk they all are indistinguishable. In other words, Stephen Fry, on the evidence of this book, is very good at delineating Stephen Fry but either weak or careless when it comes to interesting us in his other characters. The game is given away by the use of Fry's photograph on the outside of the book's jacket, not just on the flyleaf; what is being sold is not so much a novel as a written vehicle for the promotion of Stephen Fry. Of course there are witty lines and some moments of farce which would translate well onto the big or small screens, where it will no doubt end up very soon, with Fry playing Wallace to perfection. 'Civilisation, after all, is not an attitude of mind, it is an attribute of wealth.' But the smart-alec aphorisms sound like they have been absorbed from elsewhere by Fry's prodigious memory, dusted off and trotted out in a self-conscious fashion. Fry may have been aiming at a contemporary Vile Bodies. But in spite of the scattered references to a decrepit contemporary London literary scene, inoffensively expunged of any real personalities or places, the novel lacks satirical depth. What we have is a relentlessly flourished clever-coarseness masquerading as humour. In the age of Zit, Viz, Spit and all the rest, this is a class act. Fry is a very bright man, indeed. If only he could distance himself sufficiently from his screen image, he might still write a lasting book.</p>

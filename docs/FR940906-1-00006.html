			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;ANE&hyph;08, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 19, 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 93&hyph;23&hyph;09, Amendment 39&hyph;8745 (58 FR 63061, November 30, 1993), applicable to Turbomeca Arriel 1 series turboshaft engines, to require repetitive checks for engine rubbing noise during gas generator shutdown, and for free rotation of the gas generator by rotating the compressor manually after the last flight of the day. That action was prompted by a report of a Turbomeca Arriel 1B engine failure, which resulted in the crash of an Aerospatiale AS350B helicopter. That condition, if not corrected, could result in engine failure due to rubbing of the 2nd stage turbine disk on the 2nd stage turbine nozzle guide vane, which could result in complete engine failure and damage to the aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a significant number of comments from operators of the affected engines indicating that the performance of the checks required by this AD are within the capabilities of the pilot. The FAA has also determined that instructions contained in the AD are adequate for performance of required actions, and the Turbomeca Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72 292 0181 need not be incorporated by reference. Other comments indicated that the interval specified in the existing AD, ``after the last flight of the day,'' is not consistent with operating and maintenance schedules for operators who typically operate ``around the clock'' on a 24 hours per day basis, such as medevac or police operators. In response to these comments, a ``daily'' interval has been specified for this check. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, operators reported difficulty in listening for rubbing noises during engine shutdown, and that this check could be accomplished during engine motoring. The FAA has also determined that the check for free rotation must be accomplished on a cold engine due to the variation of rotating component clearances with engine temperature. Finally, the manufacturer has completed testing and analysis, and has accumulated sufficient field experience to substantiate the design of the improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane. This AD would require installation of modification TU 202, which incorporates an improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane manufactured from a new material that is more resistant to fatigue cracking, at the next engine overhaul after the effective date of this AD, but not later than December 31, 1999, as terminating action for the repetitive checks. This calendar end-date is based upon parts availability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Turbomeca has issued SB No. 292 72 0150, dated April 10, 1992, that specifies installing an improved design 2nd stage nozzle guide vane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This engine model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement in effect at the time of type certification. The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;23&hyph;09 to continue to require repetitive checks for engine rubbing noise during gas generator shutdown, and for free rotation of the gas generator by rotating the compressor manually at a daily interval until installation of the improved 2nd stage nozzle guide vane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Food and Drink: FT duo wins food award IN THE 1992 Glenfiddich Awards, made to those who have helped raise the standards and enjoyment of what we eat and drink, the Weekend FT food and wine page had three of its writers shortlisted. Jancis Robinson was nominated for drink writer of the year, Nicholas Lander for restaurant writer (they are pictured below) and Philippa Davenport for cookery writer. Our husband and wife team, Jancis Robinson and Nicholas Lander, won the third category for which they were entered when their television series Matters of Taste (C4) was voted television programme of the year. The food book of the year was awarded to Elisabeth Luard for The Flavours of Andalucia (Collins &amp; Brown Pounds 14.99) and the overall trophy to Claudia Roden. Roden has written extensively on the cooking of her native Middle East and her book on Coffee (Penguin, Pounds 4.99) remains one of the most enjoyable on that subject.</p>

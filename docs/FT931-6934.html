			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Top two at Showa Shell to quit over losses THE president and chairman of Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refiner and distributor 50 per cent owned by Royal Dutch/Shell, are resigning to take responsibility for Y125bn (Dollars 1.07bn) of so far unrealised foreign exchange futures losses which the company revealed last weekend Mr Takeshi Henmi, president, and Mr Kiyoshi Takahashi, chairman, will step down after steps have been taken to ensure that the foreign exchange losses will be covered, the company announced yesterday. Mr Henmi will also be resigning his post as vice-chairman of the Petroleum Association of Japan. The Shell group has already said it will send Mr Neil Gaskell, head of investments, to the board of the Japanese company. Currently, Shell has one representative on Showa Shell's board. Shell, which made a provision of Pounds 131m (Dollars 183m) to cover the currency losses in the fourth quarter, announced yesterday it would make a further provision of Pounds 65m in the first quarter. Mr John Jennings, Shell group managing director, said the currency speculation was a 'gross contravention of the company's internal procedures and practices.' He said the company was reviewing whether to tighten up its rules that govern the activities of associate companies. Shell is also looking at further disciplinary measures at Showa Shell. One executive in the treasury division has also resigned and another has been moved to another part of the company, while the manager in charge of treasury operations has been dismissed. Executives and auditors will also surrender their bonuses. Showa Shell Sekiyu expects to incur losses of Y125bn on dollar futures trading conducted by a small group in the company's finance department. The group speculated in 1989 that the dollar would rise and continued to roll over futures contracts over four years, in breach of company rules. The company said yesterday it planned to cover the losses by selling assets, mainly stocks, and by making a charge against profits. For 1993, it expects to cover Y70bn of losses through asset sales of Y50bn and an extraordinary charge of Y20bn. Showa Shell has already moved to limit the losses by capping the exchange rate at which it will buy dollar futures, it said. Over a period of about four years, the group in the treasury department took contracts to buy the dollar at a future date at an average rate of Y145. During that time, however, the dollar fell to about Y125 on average, and Showa Shell's losses snowballed. Depending on moves in the currency market the losses could be as high as Y160bn. The futures trading continued unknown to top management as the group postponed settlement of their contracts so that, while the losses multiplied, nothing appeared in the company's accounts. Japanese accounting rules do not require the disclosure of losses unless they are actually realised. Yesterday, the company also announced a 12 per cent drop in profits for the year to December 31. Pre-tax profits fell to Y38.03bn from Y43.39bn the year before. Sales slipped 3 per cent to Y1,565bn from Y1,617bn. The Showa Shell figures did not include a provision for the foreign exchange futures losses. Showa Shell said that the main reason behind the fall in profits was the slide in oil prices in Japan coupled with a rise in costs, mainly relating to transport. Although oil prices fell, the volume of sales increased and this added significantly to domestic costs, the company said.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS QUIETLY APPROVE PRAGUE SHAKE-UP;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: EASTERN EUROPE HAS CHANGED SO MUCH THAT CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S REFORMS ARE  SEEN AS ALMOST ROUTINE.  </P> <P> Twenty-one years ago, the Soviet Union sent its troops into Czechoslovakia to  install an orthodox Communist leadership in place of the liberal reformers and  their "Prague Spring." The gains of socialism, Moscow declared, would always be  defended everywhere.  </P> <P> When that Soviet-installed leadership was swept from office over the weekend,  still clinging to communism's old and rigid doctrines, the Soviet Union reacted  with quiet approval.  </P> <P> Not only had the Prague leadership lost popular support, Moscow said, perhaps  it had even been illegitimate from the beginning. And nothing was said about  defending socialism.  </P> <P> Soviet television's main nightly news program, "Vremya," on Saturday showed the  huge crowds in the streets of Prague cheering the ouster of the old Communist  Party leadership. The Soviet correspondent explained in friendly, approving  tones their hope that Czechoslovakia now is about to embark on a course of  fundamental reform.  </P> <P> In its initial reports, the Soviet media treated the developments with sympathy  -- but as almost routine. A senior editor at the Tass news agency remarked that  after similar events in Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and Poland, the changes  in Czechoslovakia were, as he put it, "to be expected."  </P> <P> So much has changed, first in the Soviet Union and more recently in much of  Eastern Europe, that Moscow had actually grown impatient for Czechoslovakia and  the other East European laggards to catch up -- to adopt the new policies of  political openness, economic reform and democratization that are now  transforming the other East Bloc countries.  </P> <P> "Society as never before needs a reasonable dialogue," the Soviet Communist  Party newspaper Pravda said in a commentary from Prague before the leadership's  resignation. "It is very important that each side can express its point of view  and listen to the other."  </P> <P> But Czechoslovakia, of course, differs significantly from the other East  European countries, for it had begun its own reforms in 1968 -- only to see  them crushed by the tanks of the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.  </P> <P> Much like the measures now promoted by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,  the Prague Spring reforms were meant to give socialism "a human face" -- in the  words of former Czechoslovak party leader Alexander Dubcek -- by opening the  political system to broader participation, by developing a mixed economy and by  easing the country out of the East-West confrontation.  </P> <P> Appraising the August, 1968, intervention under the late Leonid I. Brezhnev,  prominent Soviet writer Daniil Granin wrote in the current issue of the  avant-garde newspaper Moscow News that much time was lost here, as well as  elsewhere in Eastern Europe, in reforming socialism as a result of the crushing  of the Prague Spring.  </P> <P> "The dream of perestroika belongs to you," Granin wrote, addressing his friends  in Czechoslovakia. "Your economic ideas, democratization and glasnost -- that  was all begun by the Prague Spring.  </P> <P> "And if the Brezhnev clique had not smothered your perestroika, how much easier  it would be for us now."  </P> <P> The past 20 years "show us exactly what could happen if perestroika is  defeated," Granin continued. "A swathe of vengeance swept aside the flower of  the nation and snuffed out the energy, the thought and the enthusiasm of not  just the intelligentsia.  </P> <P> "How many lives have been wrecked and people destroyed, and how much  disillusion, bitterness and spite have built up over these years for your own  dogmatic Stalinists who triumphed then -- and for us, their protectors?"  </P> <P> The Soviet Union had been gently pushing Czechoslovakia for several months  toward fundamental reforms, just as it had East Germany and Bulgaria.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, commenting last week on the latest developments in Eastern Europe,  told journalists that leaders in the region had misjudged events in the past  and that rapid change is needed now "to make up for lost time."  </P> <P> The Prague leadership was publicly nudged a week ago when Vadim A. Medvedev,  the ideology chief of the Soviet Communist Party, told his Czechoslovak  counterpart that the events of 1968 needed to be "reassessed," and the  Czechoslovak party newspaper Rude Pravo published this in an article from  Moscow.  </P> <P> The intention was to "tell our comrades in Czechoslovakia that we would not  stand in the way of reforms and that we in fact encouraged them to take an  honest look at their current situation and at history," a Soviet foreign  affairs analyst said.  </P> <P> "What that really told everyone was that we would not intervene, that 1968 had  been a mistake that they should now correct, and that we favored this very  course of action."  </P> <P> Moscow's attitude has evolved over the past six months as developments have  raced ahead of policy throughout Eastern Europe. Even last week, "Vremya" was  describing the demonstrators in Prague as "anti-socialist" and the street  politics there as threatening the country's stability. On Saturday, Tass  correspondents in Prague used as a counterpoint in their story on the  leadership changes all the problems that faced opposition groups in agreeing on  their goals and strategy.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union's willingness to cooperate on a continuing basis with the new  leaders now taking office in Eastern Europe was praised here Saturday by  Poland's non-Communist prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who completed two  days of talks with Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.  </P> <P> "We have reached mutual understanding," Mazowiecki said. "This is an important  factor, the most important objective of this meeting. And this was an unusual,  even extraordinary visit."  </P> <P> Mazowiecki said that he had reaffirmed the intention of his government, a  coalition in which the Solidarity labor movement and its allies are  predominant, to improve and strengthen Poland's ties with the Soviet Union even  as it transforms its political and economic system.  </P> <P> Good relations with the Soviet Union help to promote stability in Europe and  thus to preserve peace on the Continent, Mazowiecki said.  </P> <P> "These relations are of great importance to us . . . (and), under the new  conditions prevailing today, we can create a wider public consensus or support  for them," he said.  </P></p>

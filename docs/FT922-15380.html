			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Japan Judging by the failure of Monday's package of measures to reassure the equity market, Japan's politicians and central bankers are singularly unruffled by the domestic economy. They will have only themselves to blame if the measures fail to avert a financial crisis. The  3/4 point cut in the official discount rate, which came as expected last night, might yet provide small reassurance for equities, particularly if the new financial year gets off to a positive start today. But sentiment suggests investors are unlikely to rush in while the outlook for the economy is so uncertain. By delaying the rate cut for so long, the authorities left themselves in an uncomfortable position. If companies do not resume borrowing and spending soon, the economy will grow only slightly this year and could conceivably slip into recession. With Dollars 114bn of corporate equity-linked debt due for repayment or refinancing by the end of next year, it is tantalisingly unclear whether lower rates and talk of easier regulations in the corporate bond market will have the desired effect on companies' confidence. The interest burden of new debt issuance would scarcely help earnings to recover, while higher yields on corporate bonds might attract money away from equities. There is little scope for further rate cuts. That leaves the option of a second attempt at a fiscal stimulus, but that is an unreliable tool as yesterday's market response appeared to indicate.</p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Money Markets: Sharp rate rises INTEREST RATES in European money markets rose sharply yesterday after the weekend devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo triggered serious tensions in world currency markets, writes James Blitz. Several central banks were forced to raise interest rates and tighten liquidity in their domestic money markets because of speculative attacks on their currencies. The Irish central bank raised the overnight rate on the punt to over 30 per cent to protect the currency. In Denmark, the overnight rate for the krona was quoted as high as 50 per cent, as the Danish currency fell close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark. The Bank of Spain also raised its key money rate by 0.75 basis points to 13.75 per cent after a 6 per cent devaluation failed to stop a new run on the Spanish peseta. Outside the ERM, the Bank of Finland set its money market tender rate at 11.35 per cent from 10.88 per cent. As far as the future of the ERM is concerned, the most serious changes may have taken place in French markets, where cash and futures prices reflected the higher premium that dealers now demand for holding francs. Given France's strong economic fundamentals, the franc should not be a candidate for devaluation. However, dealers believe that if the Danish krona is forced to devalue, there will be a renewed speculative attack on the franc. Yesterday, the December franc contract fell 40 basis points to a low of 90.26, and later closed at 90.27. The March contract fell 27 basis points to a low of 91.50 and later closed at 91.54. Three month money firmed sharply. A week ago it was being quoted at 9 1/2 per cent, but stood yesterday at 10 1/16 per cent. The overnight rate was quoted at around 10 per cent, having been at 9 3/8 per cent a week before. By contrast, German money market rates softened on speculation that the Bundesbank will ease policy to stall the currency crisis. The December Euromark contract rose 4 basis points to a high of 91.47, but later eased back to 91.38. At this level, it prices in a 26 basis point reduction in 3-month money before the end of the year. The prospect of Bundesbank intervention to support ailing currencies left call money relatively cheap at 8.75 per cent.</p>

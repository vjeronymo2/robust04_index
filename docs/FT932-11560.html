			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / IG Metall begins strike: Talks today raise hopes of a settlement in wage dispute IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, is braced today to step up its strike action in eastern Germany, which began with stoppages at factories and steel plants in two states yesterday. But in a hopeful sign last night employers and union officials in the state of Saxony agreed to hold negotiations this morning to try to resolve the dispute. They agreed to this after a four-hour preliminary meeting that also involved Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the state's premier. The strike, the first officially held in eastern Germany since 1933, is over union demands that employers reinstate a cancelled contract aimed at equalising wages in eastern and western Germany by next year. The stoppage yesterday affected five steel plants in Berlin-Brandenburg and 19 metal and engineering sectors in Saxony, as well as the state's four steel plants. In all, more than 14,000 workers came out in support of IG Metall, but with less enthusiasm than expected by the union which is dominated by westerners in eastern Germany. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of IG Metall, told workers in Dresden: 'We didn't want to strike. We were forced into it by the employers. But we will strike as long as is necessary and we will win.' Before Mr Biedenkopf's latest mediation attempt, Mr Steinkuhler warned that the five eastern German states would be engulfed in an indefinite strike unless the employers returned to the negotiating table and gave the metal and engineering sectors a 26 per cent pay increase this year, and the steel sector a 21 per cent rise. These claims were part of the original wage contract, signed between IG Metall and the employers and eastern German managers in March 1991. But the collapse of the east European and Soviet markets, combined with recession in western Germany, forced employers to cancel the contract. They have since recommended pay increases of about 9 per cent. Both Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, yesterday said they would not reinstate the contract. 'We simply cannot afford it,' steel employers said, adding that much of the sector was already heavily subsidised and saddled with large debts. IG Metall claims east Germany should not be turned into a low-wage economy, even if that makes the region competitive in the long term. Its strategy now is to increase the number of plants affected by strikes. More than 50 enterprises have been selected in the metal and engineering sectors in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Saxony and steel plants in the five states.</p>

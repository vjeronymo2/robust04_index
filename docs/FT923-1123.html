			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Battle to save the French franc THE Bank of France and the German Bundesbank intervened heavily on the foreign exchanges yesterday to support the French franc, after the currency threatened to move close to its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz. The 13-year old ERM was founded on the linkage of the French franc and the D-Mark, and the future of the system now depends on whether a devaluation of the franc, which France would find humiliating, can be avoided. The French central bank raised its key money market lending rate by 2.5 per cent yesterday and then intervened continuously in the foreign exchange markets. Several analysts suggested last night that France's foreign exchange reserves were exhausted, but there was no official indication of this. The Bundesbank intervened to support a currency within its margins for the first time since the ERM was founded. There were suggestions that Germany has spent DM30bn in support of the franc this week, on top of the DM60bn spent to shore up sterling and the lira. Overnight rates in the German money market were at 0.5 per cent, down from 6 per cent on Tuesday, reflecting the colossal quantity of D-Marks in the financial system. By last night, the battle between the markets and the central banks seemed evenly matched, with the French currency finishing at FFr3.4120 to the D-Mark, against a lower limit of FFr3.4305. Can the franc hold? France's economy is sound and, far from being a devaluation candidate, there is a case for saying it should be revalued. If necessary, France could play what one analyst called 'dirty tricks' to aid the currency. It could temporarily suspend the five to 10-day lending window in the French money market, as it did for 20 minutes last Friday. Alternatively, it could reintroduce capital controls, as Spain did yesterday, to make franc trading less liquid. However, there were signs yesterday of a fundamental flow out of the French currency by investment funds with huge currency holdings. One London based economist said his bank had seen a German pension fund sell French francs in large quantities. The peseta rocketed against the D-Mark after Spain announced reimposition of capital controls. It opened at Pta71.91 per D-Mark, closed in London at Pta67.64 and moved from the bottom of the EMS grid to the top. Dealers said the peseta market was now illiquid. Spot exchange was still possible, but currency swaps were very difficult to execute. The Irish punt remained under intense pressure, ending at DM2.6240, not far above its floor of DM2.6190. The Portuguese escudo finished weakly at Esc88.75 per D-Mark, compared to its floor of Esc92.33.</p>

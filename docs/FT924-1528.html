			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: ANZ Bank predicts profitability AUSTRALIA and New Zealand Banking Group expects a reasonable profit recovery in the current year after posting a loss of ADollars 579m (USDollars 399m) for the year ended September, Reuter reports from Melbourne. 'We expect a reasonable profit recovery in the current year and progressive improvement in ANZ's performance over the next two to three years,' the bank said. 'The principal factor in the return to profitability will be a major reduction in the provisioning charge from the abnormally levels of recent years,' it added in its annual report. The bank charged ADollars 1.6bn towards bad and doubtful debts in 1991-92.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Services planned for motorway link A start on a service area for the M1-A1 link is the latest project to be carried out by TARMAC in building the new route to the east coast. BP Oil UK has awarded the contract, worth Pounds 600,000, for the infrastructure of the first service area at Brampton Hut roundabout, at Huntingdon, in Cambridgeshire. The contract provides for an access road and roundabouts with associated earthworks, drainage, lighting and a rising main for the service area. The new dual carriageway will run for 45 miles from the M1 at Catthorpe, in Northamptonshire, to the A1 at Huntingdon. The four-year programme of work on the link road has involved the construction of nine interchanges.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gamarshakh Dzhavadov and Rauf Guseynov: "Is </F> There To Be Any State Concept of an Ethnic Policy?"]    [Text] The representatives of 115 ethnic groups reside in  Azerbaijan, along with the Azerbaijani, who are the most  numerous people, both in their historic homeland and throughout  the Caucasus, and the second in the world with respect to the  number of Turkish-speaking people. The referendum of 29 December  1991 has the force of a legal act, legally securing the cohesion  and equality of all citizens of the Azerbaijani State, as a  unified nation. Azerbaijani citizens and Turko-Akhyskhi  (Meskheten citizens), Russians and Udi, Ukrainians and  Assyrians, Belarusians and Talyshi, Budukhi and Tati, Khinalugi  and Kurds, Krizi and Lezgini, Avari and Jews, Ingili and  Tsakhuri and others -- all have equal rights in the land of  Azerbaijan and of their own will have shown the world that they  regard this country, with which their past, present and future,  and all their thoughts are related, as their own common native  land.    History and the present day, however, attest to the fact  that  such harmonious agreement in the life of the multi-ethnic people  of Azerbaijan is not to everyone's liking. Over the past few  decades, destructive forces, both within and from without, have  repeatedly tried and continue to try to sow dissension among  Azerbaijan's ethnic groups, particularly to incite them against  the Azerbaijani. They have partially succeeded in their  attempts: one of the terrible consequences was the Karabakh  problem and the never-ending chain of military-political,  ethno-confessional and socio-economic collisions of domestic and  foreign order connected with it. The most monstrous result is  the genocide of Azerbaijani citizens and the many years of  undeclared war between Armenia and the people of Azerbaijan. The  main goal is to annihilate the Azerbaijani ethnic group and  seize its lands, and to provoke small ethnic groups into leaving  the structure of the Azerbaijani Republic. That is why we  qualify the Karabakh problem thrust on Azerbaijan as part of an  international conspiracy, aimed against the Islam and Turkish  world and at escalation of ethnic conflicts and regional wars.  The point is that Azerbaijan occupies a convenient strategic  region in the Caucasus, rich in natural resources and raw  material, and has a modern industrial and transport  infrastructure. Realization of the plans is therefore related to  the intention of creating in Azerbaijan other "Karabakhs," in  which anti-Azerbaijan forces have also succeeded: some of the  leaders of certain ethnic groups in Azerbaijan, heated up  because of the military cordon, are demanding "independence" and  "reunification" with their fellow countrymen.    One of the effective responses to these attempts was the  presidential edict of 16 September 1992 "On Protecting the  Rights and Freedoms and on State Support of the Development of  the Language and Culture of Ethnic Minorities, Small Numbers of  People and Ethnic Groups Residing in the Azerbaijani Republic."  An important help in putting it into effect is, in addition to  the activity of official structures, the activity of cultural  societies of Slavs and Udi, Russian and Tati, Lezgini and  Talyshi, Kurds and Jews, and also of the National Academy of  Sciences of the multi-specialty Institute of Ethnic Relations.  Within the framework of the institute, a special department is  at work to study small ethnic groups, and is designed to help  solve the group of problems, in conjunction with analogous  departments in the institutes of Literature, Linguistics,  Pedagogy and Teacher Improvement, and with cultural centers and  societies. At the same time, success in the sphere of an ethnic  policy in many ways depends on how fully we succeed in getting  the indisputable truth to each representative of the small  ethnic groups: if there is discrimination against any of them,  this means a similar fate, in no lesser degree, has been readied  for the Azerbaijani themselves.    Let us recall the years of Stalinist repressions and the  totalitarian system, when Azerbaijani citizens and other  Turkish-speaking peoples of the USSR were subjected to  persecution on the widest scale. It was these people who were  deprived of their alphabets and the better part of the  intelligentsia, their territory and cultural monuments. Even in  our times one can mention definite discrimination against  Azerbaijani citizens, but now it is within the limits of their  own state. These are the attempts of certain Azerbaijanophiles,  together with the state officials from the ruling NFA [People's  Front of Azerbaijan], to link the history and culture of  Azerbaijan with the Turkish world from the beginning. Among  these can be included the striving of others to see the sources  of everything Azerbaijani stemming from the time that Islam  appeared. Still others tried to link Azerbaijani citizens to  everything Iranian. Directly connected to these false ideas, it  seems to us, is the renaming of the Azerbaijani language in  Turkish (a law of December 1992), even though not one of the  peoples speaking the languages of the Turkic family hit upon  this. The Uzbek speak Uzbek, Khakassia -- Khakassian, Yakut --  Yakut, Chuvashia -- Chuvashian. The list can go on. As a result,  there is an imminent threat of ethnic and linguistic conflicts,  leading to open confrontation on the part of the small ethnic  groups. The linguistic policy is one of the most important  aspects of ethnic relations, and language can become a catalyst  and detonator of an interethnic collision, which is being  observed even now in the Azerbaijani Republic. This is one of  the reasons why the small ethnic groups of Azerbaijan  "remembered" that each of them also speak in their own language,  about their own "historical past."    In a word, the situation has grown complicated, and is  fraught with the danger that the Azerbaijani Republic will  explode from within. There is, however, a possibility of  avoiding cataclysms in the ethnic sphere. For this we must use  the existing world experience and historical past, and draw  specialists in various fields and an intelligent part of the  leaders of the cultural societies of small ethnic groups into  creating a state conceptual program of ethnic policy.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Further realignment in Midlands - McKechnie's Pounds 28m takeover of Linread continues consolidation process McKechnie, the plastics and metal components group, yesterday made an agreed offer worth Pounds 27.8m for Linread, the fasteners and precision components manufacturer, in a move which marks further realignment in Midlands industry. Although neither company touches the emotional chords of the Midlands in the fashion of Rover, the carmaker, their merger continues a process of consolidation among manufacturing companies. The pressures for consolidation have been particularly acute in the automotive components sector. 'The process has been going along for the last five years and accelerating for the last year or so,' commented Mr Chris Tillett, chief economist at Cooper &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, in Birmingham. The vehicle assemblers have both reduced the number of their component suppliers and sought to enter new relations with those which remain. Now the suppliers are expected to play a larger design and research role; they are expected continually to reduce prices and they face progressively higher quality demands. This is not a game which the small can easily play. 'Linread is not large enough to compete on the European market and the PSM (a McKechnie subsidiary) range needs to be broadened,' said Mr Michael Ost, McKechnie's chief executive. Indeed, it was the cosy fit of the two companies which McKechnie stressed yesterday. 'Linread's range of engineering bolts and fasteners are complementary to the PSM range and there is a large customer base in the automotive industry,' Mr Ost said. The other side of this, as Mr Martin Booth, chief economist at the West Midlands Enterprise Board, suggested, is that McKechnie is 'taking out a competitor to gather expertise from it and consolidate its own position'. Midlands manufacturers in any case have been forced to see their role as increasingly international. The vagaries of the UK economy is simply too fragile a base. So the search has been for greater strength. Linread, its 1980s growth hampered by stock losses in the early 1990s and only now recovering its financial and manufacturing poise, has been a tiny force. 'We were somewhat constrained by size,' said Mr Peter Harrison, managing director. 'With McKechnie, Linread's fortunes should be able to develop that much faster.' The pressures on suppliers in the automotive and aerospace industries and the growing need to view the future in international terms has created a harsher environment in a region where the bedrock of business has been the family company. McKechnie long since moved away from that status to become a medium-sized group with, locally, a solid but low key reputation: reliable but not exciting, nor, indeed, excitable. Linread, on the other hand, still looks like a family business which happens to have a market quotation. The Lynall and Tahany families own 22 per cent of the equity, while institutions with more than 3 per cent each hold another 40 per cent. The need to persuade the families to sell, coupled with the tightly held equity help to explain the heavy premium above the market price which McKechnie is paying for Linread. Another factor is the McKechnie belief that Linread's recovery is taking place much faster than the market has realised. Mr Ost assured shareholders: 'We believe there will be no earnings dilution in the first full year of ownership.' The terms are 17 new McKechnie shares for every 36 Linread. This values Linread at 228p, which is not only 49 per cent more than their closing price on Tuesday but also marks a substantial uplift on their lowest price this year of 95p. Yesterday Linread shares moved up 63p to 216p, while McKechnie shares dipped 14p to 473p.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Arts: Breda hosts the art of youth - The European biennale show, 'Germinations' Germinations, a European biennale for young artists, was set up in the early 1980s under the aegis of the Office Franco-Allemande pour la jeunesse. The UK joined in almost at once, followed by the Netherlands, and so it has continued to grow until in this, its eighth recurrence, some 15 countries are taking part. Such growth speaks not just of a practical success, but of a wider recognition of the cultural and educational opportunity that Germinations represents. The arguments make themselves: the focus upon youth and education; pan-european co-operation extending across the community into the former communist bloc; all the cultural opportunities that follow, of mutual experience and exchange. Yet what the European Commission giveth, the European Commission taketh away, and this time, late in the day, the funding was withdrawn. To criticise this Breda Germinations for the absence of those workshop programmes, whereby participating artists from different countries would have been given the chance to work abroad together at selected centres in the months before the actual exhibition, is therefore no criticism of Germinations itself. The point was acknowledged by the administration, and confirmed by the artists, who certainly felt deprived. The immediate reinstatement of these workshops is already the declared priority for Germinations 9. Where the money will come from, however - the Commission; the national funding bodies; private sponsorship? - is unclear. The pity is that the sums are still comparatively small. Has Germinations itself become too big? Sixty-four artists are represented, a handful from each country which inevitably blurs what might be national characteristics into individual quirks and interests. With funding secure, would a more frequent programme be better, allowing a reduced and rolling permutation of the member nations rather than all aboard, every time? Perhaps. The work itself is what is to be expected of any recent student generation, an avant-garde orthodoxy in both range of practice and content. There is enough here of the beautiful, intriguing and well-made to remain encouraged. It is only the narrowness of the range of preoccupation, the stultifying assumption that art must be idea-led rather than more intuitively responsive to the world, that is so sad. Here, then, are some film and video, some print, installations, both conceptual and theatrical, and a lot of well-made abstract sculpture. There is also some painting on canvas, almost all of it abstract and some of it very good. Such is the currency of art schools, not just in the UK but across Europe. But for anything direct and competent in its relation to nature, most of all to the figure, we look in vain. What little there is of figurative representation is embarrassingly inept. That said, however, I would also say that the British contingent of eight artists was as strong as any, ranging from painting, through sculpture, to conceptual installation. Two of the painters were outstanding - Lynn Flavell with her elegantly abstracted pattern-fields derived from piles of fruit; and Sophie Benson, whose large, delicately worked and spatially ambiguous drawings deservedly won her the special bursary. The sculptor too, Naomi Dines, had made some quite extraordinary things. She is obsessed by tack and tackle of all kinds, as might be found on boats or horses, or in the surgery  -odd splints, supports, restraints, all beautifully made in leather and hung with an off-hand deliberation upon the wall. Of the rest I liked the sinister chair-figures of Klara Klose (Czech), Catherine Harang's metal structures (France), Petra Ondreickova's painted relief perspective (Czech) and Katarina Diacomi's prawn-like wire creatures, dancing on springs. Barbara Kowalczyk (Poland), with her parcels of pigment on shelves and window-sills, won the Boudaille Prize as best artist in the show. Germinations 8: the St Joost Academy and the De Beyerd Contemporary Art Centre, Breda, The Netherlands, until December 4. Supported by the Commission of the European Community, Brussels, and by individual national organisations.</p>

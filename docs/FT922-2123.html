			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Solicitors seek cash for training THE SOLICITORS' profession is in danger of becoming limited to those with private means, the Law Society warned yesterday. In a letter to Mr John Patten, education secretary, society president Mr Philip Ely said the collapse of the discretionary grant system for students on the profession's finals course amounted to a 'pre-qualification means test'. The College of Law said the proportion of its income from fees paid by English and Welsh local education authorities had halved in two years. Urging Mr Patten to require authorities to provide grants, Mr Ely said trainees were further disadvantaged in that professional-qualification courses have been excluded from new arrangements for tax relief on vocational training.</p>

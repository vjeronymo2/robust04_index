			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Smallest companies outperform the rest The very smallest companies are continuing to outperform all other sectors so far this year, according to Hoare Govett's new smaller company index. Over the first three quarters of 1994, the HG 1000 index produced a return of 4.4 per cent, or 6.7 per cent for the version excluding investment trusts, compared with negative returns of between 0.7 and 8.5 per cent for the FT-SE 100, 350, All-share, Mid 250 and Smallcap. The HG 1000 index, which was launched officially in August but has been calculated since the start of 1993, covers the bottom 2 per cent by market capitalisation of the UK equity market, excluding investment trusts. When investment trusts within the same market capitalisation limits are included, the trust has 1,000 constituents. The largest companies in the index have market capitalisations of just over Pounds 50m; the smallest are under Pounds 1m, and more than half are valued at less than Pounds 15m, though in value terms, half the index is accounted for by companies capitalised at Pounds 30m or more. During 1993, the HG 1000 index produced returns of 60.8 per cent (60.4 per cent excluding investment trusts), compared with returns of less than 30 per cent for the FT-SE 100, 350 and All-Share. Hoare Govett's main smaller companies index, the HGSC which covers the bottom 10 per cent of the market, returned 44 per cent. When the index was back-calculated to 1955, its average annual total return was 21.1 per cent a year, against 14.5 per cent for the All-share and 18.7 per cent for the HGSC. A report on the index says it acts as a complement to the FT-SE-A All-Share index: 99 per cent of the All-Share's constituents are too large to be included in the HG 1000. However, the report's authors acknowledge that liquidity can be a problem at this end of the market.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT HITS UNIVERSITY EXPANSION;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: COMMISSION STRONGLY CRITICIZES CAMPUS CONSTRUCTION PLANS OF UC AND  CAL STATE SYSTEMS, SAYING THEY ARE BASED ON OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ENROLLMENT  PROJECTIONS.  </P> <P> A new study strongly criticizes $2-billion worth of expansion proposals from  California's two university systems, saying that only two of as many as nine  new campuses being sought seem necessary. The report, however, does support  possible construction of as many as 22 additional two-year community colleges.  </P> <P> Prepared by staff members of the California Postsecondary Education Commission  (CPEC), the report asserts that University of California and the California  State University growth plans are based on unreasonably high enrollment  projections for minority and graduate students.  </P> <P> It says that the UC system should build only one additional campus, not as many  as the three proposed, and that the Cal State system should proceed with its  new San Marcos campus but halt plans for five others.  </P> <P> Much of the pressure on UC's undergraduate growth can be handled by more than  tripling the size of UC Riverside and by encouraging more students to attend  independent institutions with larger state-financed scholarships, CPEC staff  members suggested.  </P> <P> In addition, they described as "worthy" but unrealistic UC's desire to sharply  increase the number of graduate students so that all nine of its current  campuses become "world-renowned research institutions."  </P> <P> The Cal State system is criticized in the report for assuming that Latinos and  blacks will vastly improve their now low college attendance rate over the next  15 years to match that of Anglos.  </P> <P> "This expectation is obviously a laudable policy goal . . . yet it may not be  reasonable for capital outlay planning," the CPEC study says. The Cal State  system projects that within 15 years it will have 466,000 students, about  190,000 more than now but 105,400 more than CPEC estimates.  </P> <P> If the educational achievements of Latinos and blacks do improve dramatically,  the trend will first be noticed in junior high and high schools, allowing time  to plan new Cal State schools, CPEC analyst Kirk Knutsen said at an advance  press briefing Friday.  </P> <P> "Why make irreversible decisions now when you don't have to?" he asked.  Meanwhile, Knutsen added, expanding the existing Cal State campuses and  building one at San Marcos will suffice.  </P> <P> On the other hand, adding as many as 22 community colleges to the existing 107  two-year schools appears reasonable to accommodate an expected increase in  students from 1.33 million to 1.8 million, according to the CPEC staff. Such  construction would cost about $2.3 billion, and much study is needed on site  selection and financing, the report says.  </P> <P> The 48-page document, entitled "Higher Education at the Crossroads: Planning  for the 21st Century," was written in the shadow of tough financial realities.  It presumes that the state faces enormous problems paying for anything more  than modest expansions in higher education, even if voters approve the proposed  constitutional amendment to adjust the so-called Gann spending limit.  </P> <P> The draft report will be formally presented tomorrow to the commission, which  advises the Legislature on higher education matters. The commission is expected  to vote on a final version next month. CPEC staffers said they do not expect  much change over the month, even though officials from both UC and Cal State  disagree with parts of the report.  </P> <P> John Smart, Cal State's vice chancellor for university affairs, said he was  "rather perplexed" by the study's seeming pessimism on projected increases in  Latino and black enrollment.  </P> <P> "We disagree that we are being over-optimistic. We think it's a goal that is  quite attainable," Smart said in a telephone interview, adding that he thought  that CPEC was using outdated statistics.  </P> <P> Cal State San Marcos is now under construction in northern San Diego County and  is expected to be finished in about two years. It will be the 20th campus in  the Cal State system.  </P> <P> The CPEC report urges Cal State administrators to cease buying other properties  after they acquire land in Ventura County for a satellite education center.  However, Smart said it would be economically foolish to postpone buying other  land.  </P> <P> UC is not challenging the report's contention that only one more UC campus is  needed, acknowledging that the system's leaders have not committed themselves  to the three they claim may be needed to accommodate enrollment growth. UC is  now studying possible sites for one additional campus.  </P> <P> However, UC will argue that the report errs in saying that large expansions in  graduate programs are unrealistic, UC spokesman Ronald Kolb said in a telephone  interview. In addition, UC President David P. Gardner believes that the  Riverside campus should grow in 15 years from its current 6,000 students to  about 12,000, not to the 20,000 recommended by the CPEC report.  </P> <P> "Growth of that magnitude in that short a period of time would negatively  impact on program quality and quality of life on campus," Kolb said.  </P> <P> CPEC's executive director Kenneth B. O'Brien said that his staff's report  focuses on UC Riverside expansion because of political resistance to much  campus growth in other UC communities such as Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and  Berkeley.  </P> <P> The report urges that state grants for students at independent colleges be  hiked from the current maximum of $5,250 a year to the $6,500 allowable by law  now. The CPEC staff thinks that such a change would shift about 6,000 students  who might otherwise attend UC for its relatively low cost to such independent  schools as USC, the University of Redlands or Loyola Marymount University.  Excluding room and board, tuition and fees at, for example, USC total $13,446  this year, compared to about $1,700 at a UC campus.  </P></p>

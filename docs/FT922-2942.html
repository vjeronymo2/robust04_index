			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Mayhew forces pace on talks with Dublin SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, moved last night to force the pace in talks taking place on the province's political future. He proposed making a first step next week towards bringing the Irish government into the negotiations. After discussion in Belfast until late last night with local politicians, Sir Patrick called for a meeting next week to start drawing up an agenda for the second 'strand' of the talks, on relations between Northern Ireland and the republic. These discussions would mean a historic meeting between unionists and the Irish government. His announcement appeared to be an attempt to sidestep the row between nationalist and unionist leaders over the timing of the republic's entry that has stalled progress in the seven-week old talks. Sir Patrick said he was not proposing a formal start to strand two, and work will continue on strand one - devolution in the province - from which the republic is excluded. Besides the Irish and the British governments, unionist and nationalist leaders will be invited to next week's meeting. The independent chairman will be Sir Ninian Stephen, former governor-general of Australia. Sir Patrick also announced that work would begin on strand three about a possible replacement to the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement.</p>

We had the courage to try to put forward ideas that  are not very popular today and that are not winners -- that is  to say, the idea of a federal Europe is not something that  excites people. The idea that the problem of immigration is not  one to be tackled by repression is not a very popular thing  either. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

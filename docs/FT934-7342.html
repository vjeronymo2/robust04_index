			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Nissan to cut vehicle output NISSAN, Japan's second biggest carmaker, plans to close four of its Japanese factories for two days next month in an attempt to trim output and cut costs, it said yesterday, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. The decision reflects the severity of Japan's economic slowdown and its impact on the car industry. Nissan has already announced plans to close one of its main factories on the outskirts of Tokyo. The move will affect about 15,000 employees, to be given extra days off with 90 per cent pay, to be funded partly from government employment adjustment subsidies. The closures, which will cut output by about 4,000 vehicles, follow a similar move this month affecting over 2,000 workers. The company's domestic production declined by 13 per cent in the first half of the fiscal year. The decision also reflects the downturn in the European market, where exports have fallen 47 per cent. Nissan has already revised its production forecast by 12 per cent to 1.8m units.</p>

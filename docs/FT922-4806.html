			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: De La Rue De La Rue shares have outpaced the market by 140 per cent over the past two years, a performance which owes more to growing faith in the management than to any fundamental shift in the outlook for its businesses. The question after yesterday's 29 per cent rise in full year profits is whether other stocks with a greater UK bias and better recovery potential will make more attractive investments over the next 12 months. It is true that the prospects for security printing are scarcely commensurate with the number of column inches devoted to the fledgling Estonian currency. Eastern Europe offers one of those once-in-a-generation opportunities to boost the bank note order book: but it remains a relatively unexciting if cash generative activity with average volume growth of 4 per cent a year. Complementing that steady annuity income, though, is the more interesting payment systems side recently strengthened by the Swedish acquisition, Inter Innovation. The process of integration mean that Inter's first year contribution will not be visible, so investors will have to take the company's word that the rights issue promise to avoid earnings dilution still holds good. Price pressure from Japanese competitors at De La Rue Giori and tough trading conditions in Nigeria may cause some current year forecasts to be shaved. But while there were inevitably a few profit takers yesterday, the shares look worth supporting in the long run on a forward multiple of 17.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoff Meade, PRESS ASSOCIATION, in Brussels] </F>   [Text] The head of NATO held out the "hand of friendship"  to Russia today, but warned the Western Allies to maintain their  guard against old and new aggressors.    Manfred Woerner, opening a summit in Brussels which will  determine the future shape of European defence strategy, said  the vital objective was "to build a new comprehensive  Euro-Atlantic architecture of security with, and not without or  against, Russia."    The NATO's secretary-general said NATO alone could guarantee  security to its member nations "because it is the only  functioning collective defence organisation on the globe."    It was the "key element" of stability in a world hit by  instability, crises and conflicts. No new security order in  Europe was conceivable without NATO, insisted Mr. Woerner.    But he warned that NATO could "wither away" without a clear  sense of purpose and that it could be threatened by stagnation  and even erosion.    "Our Alliance needs continuous investment, not only of  resources and manpower, but even more so of political energy and  the determination on both sides of the Atlantic to use it as the  main forum of consultation and the most effective instrument of  our security and defence."    Mr. Woerner applauded U.S. President Bill Clinton's  "Partnership for Peace" initiative as the way to extend defence  cooperation and stabilise the whole of Europe.    "We will allow no one and nothing to manoeuvre our Alliance  into a false alternative; to have to choose between Russia and  the other cooperation partners."    He said the message to the new democracies in central and  eastern Europe was: "We shall not leave you alone. We care  about your security which is of direct and material concern to  us."    But Mr. Woerner gave no clue as to a timetable for opening  NATO's doors to new members. He said that when NATO membership  was extended to new countries it would be to help stabilise  Europe and not to divide it again.    He emphasised that a significant level of U.S. forces  permanently based in Europe -- pledged last night by Mr. Clinton  -- would remain "an indispensable component" of the security  strategy.    Mr. Woerner said that Alliance structures had to be  developed  for more flexible security and warned: "More flexible  structures will serve our purpose only if we maintain an  adequate level of well trained and well equipped armed forces  backed up by adequate resources. The fewer the means at our  disposal, the fewer our options."    He told the summit that NATO had to prepare for new security  risks, particularly arising from the proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction. "Nonproliferation is our priority, but it may  not suffice. We have to look also at the appropriate means of  protection."</p>

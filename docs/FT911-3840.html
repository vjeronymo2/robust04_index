'We have been in negotiations for some time and they are now at an advanced stage,' directors said. Once the negotiations are completed, the group plans to announce both results for the year to October 31 and details of the proposed capital investment in the group. The shares were suspended at 83p. In the half-year to April 30, Arncliffe suffered an 83 per cent plunge in profits to Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 868,000). Profits were hurt by a sharply higher interest charge of Pounds 1.09m (Pounds 593,000). The group said at the time that it was working to reduce borrowings as quickly as possible. Turnover dropped 18 per cent to Pounds 7.52m (Pounds 9.18m) and the interim dividend was passed (2.25p). Earnings per share were 1.94p (11.28p).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Tomashevskaya: "Will Space Yield </F> Dividends?"]    [Text] Space research in Belarus is under the direction of  the Technical Cybernetics Institute, Belarus Academy of  Sciences. At first glance at the interior of the institute you  feel a slight disenchantment: the old walls and the decrepit  furniture have nothing in common with those nickel-plated, shiny  Hollywood surroundings which you involuntarily visualize when  the word "space" is mentioned. However, one should not be  surprised by the fact that heroic figures in spacesuits are not  strolling along the corridors of the institute in spacesuits,  but by the fact that Belarus space has received state funding at  all. This happened this autumn. The first funds, allocated by  the Belarus government for four months of research, by space  standards was modest: 350 million rubles.    Boris Beregov, the deputy director of the institute,  chairman  of the republic Space Council, had few hopes for that. This, to  be sure, has not been reflected in that uncommon stubbornness  with which he has confronted all possible government agencies,  striving to obtain support for the ill-understood, costly and  little-profitable program. Under the conditions prevailing in  impoverished Belarus Boris Beregov achieved the most significant  miracle.    Despite the existence of a republic council, for the time  being there is neither a centralized leadership nor a uniform  clear-cut program for the several institutes, enterprises and  laboratories working in this field. They all, independently of  one another, are engaged in development work, approximately half  of which is for the needs of the republic and half for  participation in the CIS intergovernmental program for  investigation and use of space.    The Soviet Union and Europe have carried out parallel  military development work which later, also in a parallel  fashion, has experienced conversion. As a result, in some  respects our level was higher, in other respects that of the  West was, but neither Europe nor America in the immediate future  will become our clients.    With respect to third countries, they (such as the recently  arriving Indians) have already expressed their interest in  Belarus research. However, as Beregov acknowledges, this is  inadequate for the sale of our developed products -- it is  necessary to broaden and somehow further improve our products.    The production relationships of the countries of the former  USSR, which are linked to ours, is a different matter. They have  proposed the purchase of systems developed in Belarus, which are  inexpensive in comparison with European products. In addition,  the specialists who are installing, repairing and adjusting  equipment are readily available. We, in turn, are interested in  the former Soviet republics for the very same reasons. Around  Beregov's desk, as in the good old days, there is a gathering of  Russian, Ukrainian, Baltic, Uzbek, Turkmen and Tajik specialists.    Belarus scientists are participating in the work of the CIS  Intergovernmental Space Council. Its activity is organized on  the principle of the European Space Agency. All the countries  participating in one project or another are contributing  resources to it proportional to their gross national product.  But money is not being directed to some abstract treasury, but  to research in one's own territory. For example, funding was  recently obtained for the work of the Institute of Heat and Mass  Exchange of the Belarus Academy of Sciences for study of the  thermal insulation of satellites and spaceships. Providing the  Russian agency with their results, our specialists receive  information on the research carried out in other countries which  are members of the agency. Now there is partial funding for work  on developing the MK-94 multiband camera for satellites of the  Resurs system and payment is being received for work on  developing special apparatus for studying the ozone layer.    And nevertheless, what reason does Belarus, with its  poverty,  have for spending money on space? After all, government  expenditures on space research are not paying for themselves in  any, even superhighly developed country of the world.    "In actuality, such research seems suspicious to all who  recognize only direct profit," says B. Beregov. "They do not  understand that by not sensing the Earth's surface more is lost  than is saved in the funding of this work. When in the spring  the Pripyat has overflowed and the Polesye has been inundated,  the only thing which we could do, insofar as I know, was to go  out into the disaster regions and estimate the inflicted losses.  But if we had organized a systematic procedure for the  collection of information from special radar satellites it would  be possible to trace in advance how the water is spreading and  accordingly, make predictions. Proceeding on the basis of this  information, the government would take measures knowing  precisely what had to be done: construct dams or dig trenches,  relocate or not relocate the people."    Using satellites it is possible to predict the weather and  crop yields, find minerals and evaluate ecological conditions.  Incidentally, the sole space research in Belarus in which the  entire world is interested is probably related to the  consequences of Chernobyl. Having survived the accident, we  became a unique region where it is possible to monitor the  fission of radionuclides, their propagation and their effect on  the environment.    "With what is space science in Belarus now occupied?"    "We have developed special system for processing the  information received in sensing the Earth. After all, it is  insufficient simply to have photographs in our hands. In order  to assess the content of an image it is necessary to use special  mathematical methods. We are buying equipment and developing  mathematical methods and technologies for the processing of  images and are adapting equipment for solving definite problems.  We are doing all this by order either of organizations in  Belarus or those countries which are interested in such work."</p>

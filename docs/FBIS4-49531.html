			<p>BFN     [Text] Gothenburg, Sweden, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Lars-Ake  Skager, mayor of Gothenburg, and Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  (CPPCC) on Friday [6 May] spoke highly of the friendship and  cooperation between Shanghai and the Swedish city.    They made their remarks at a banquet hosted in Gothenburg by  the local mayor in honor of Li and attended by his entourage and  senior local figures from the political and business fields.    Skager pointed out that Sweden and China had been conducting  trade and economic exchange for many centuries and that the  friendship between them had a long history.    Gothenburg was an important meeting point in their business  activities and had established sisterly ties with Shanghai, the  biggest city and an economic center of China, said the mayor.    He added that as a result, cooperation between the two  cities  in various fields had developed quickly.    In his turn, Li commented that as early as 250 years ago, a  Swedish cargo ship had set sail from Gothenburg for the first  voyage to China and that later from Gothenburg Chinese goods had  been delivered to other parts of Sweden.    Currently, based on its high level of technical development,  Gothenburg was making fresh advances in its cooperation with  China in trade and the economy, said the CPPCC leader.    Before the banquet, the mayor briefed Li on the joint  efforts  being made by the two cities in environmental protection and Li  expressed his appreciation for their increasing cooperation in  various fields.</p>

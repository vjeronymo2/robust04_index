			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POMONA OFFICERS FILE SUIT IN POLICE, COUNCIL DISPUTE  </P> <P> The antipathy between police officers and the City Council has grown after the  filing of a suit by two officers against one councilman, an attempt by another  councilman to cut the Police Department's community relations budget and a  statement by a councilwoman that the city is suffering from poor police  protection.  </P> <P> Raul Camargo, president of the Pomona Police Officers Assn., and Sgt. Gary  Elofson sued Tuesday in federal court against Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant  and the city over Bryant's public release of personal information that they  contend is confidential.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Councilman Tomas Ursua proposed this week that the police community  relations budget be cut by $100,000 to finance a city public information  program. The council approved the proposal in concept, but acting City  Administrator Tom Fee said he would try to find other money to avoid cutting  the police budget.  </P> <P> And defending last month's decision to fire Police Chief Richard M. Tefank,  Councilwoman Nell Soto said a recent gathering of 70 to 80 people in Pomona to  discuss the community's problems produced a unanimous conclusion that the city  is suffering from "a lack of police protection."  </P> <P> She said the concern about police service justifies the council's efforts to  shake up the Police Department: "It's important for people to know that the  action we took was not taken with a capricious or whimsical attitude but was  very well thought-out. "  </P> <P> Soto said she does not mean "to indict all the officers. I know some are  dedicated and doing good . . . There are some officers out there that really do  deserve to get the cooperation of the City Council, (but) there are some that I  believe need to go."  </P> <P> When Tefank was fired Oct. 17, council members directed most of their criticism  at mid-rank officers under Tefank, saying their management style was destroying  police morale. Mayor Donna Smith, who opposed the firing, said the chief lost  his job after he refused to dismiss seven officers who were on a "hit list."  </P> <P> Bryant, while denying there was a hit list, has said he would like to see the  dismissal of at least two officers -- Camargo and Elofson.  </P> <P> After the Pomona Police Officers Assn. endorsed an effort to recall Bryant, the  councilman denounced the group's president, Camargo, as "a psychiatric case"  and said Camargo had seen a police psychiatrist 48 times since March 30, 1987,  at a cost to the city of $20,450. Bryant's remarks were at a televised council  meeting Oct. 30.  </P> <P> Bryant provided additional details of Camargo's case and also alleged that  Camargo and a police sergeant "are presently under investigation by the Police  Department internal affairs department for lewd conduct."  </P> <P> He said the information about psychiatric visits came from a city report on  worker's compensation claims, which he believes to be a public document.  </P> <P> Bryant said he knew about the sexual harassment and lewd conduct investigation  because the woman who made the allegation, a former police crime analyst,  complained to him first. Bryant said he and other city officials began an  investigation.  </P> <P> In their suit in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Camargo and Elofson said the  allegations have not resulted in any disciplinary actions against them,  although an internal investigation is continuing.  </P> <P> Elofson, who says he has been under fire from Bryant for years because he once  arrested the councilman on a drunk driving charge that later was dropped, said  Pomona police officers are fearful for their jobs because a few disgruntled  employees constantly feed information to the councilman.  </P> <P> Several police officers attended this week's council meeting wearing badges  endorsing the recall of Bryant. Among them was Sgt. Ralph Fry, who heads the  police community relations program.  </P> <P> Fry said Ursua's proposal to drastically reduce the community relations budget  is another attack on the Police Department.  </P> <P> Ursua said he began working on his proposal before much of the controversy over  the Police Department began, but he believes that most community relations work  should be performed outside the department. "I don't see why a police sergeant  was taken off the street and given this job," he said. "I would recommend the  Police Department shift this guy back to the streets."  </P> <P> Ursua's proposal calls for the hiring of a city community relations officer and  six part-time community ambassadors who would investigate complaints from  residents, distribute information and serve as liaisons between government and  the community. Ursua suggested the project be funded by taking $100,000 from  the Police Department's $270,000 community relations budget.  </P> <P> Smith opposed the plan, saying it would hurt many worthwhile police efforts,  such as drug education, parenting workshops, neighborhood watch and other crime  prevention programs. The council endorsed the plan in concept on a 3-1 vote,  with Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer absent.  </P></p>

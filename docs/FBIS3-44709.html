Over the last several decades, it has  successively invested several billion yuan in building,  renovating, and expanding a number of prison facilities,  enabling each inmate to occupy an average of more than 5 square  meters in cell floor space.    The food allowance of inmates across the country has  increased step by step, approaching the average living standards  of local residents. Despite the limited food allowance,  Shanghai prison prepares nutritious food for inmates and ensures  enough good food for them. Furthermore, prisons in various  localities have Muslim kitchens for Islamic inmates.    In China's prisons today, the inmates enjoy not only the  basic right of subsistence but also the right to education. The  reform- through-labor institutions educate inmates, with courses  ranging from literacy classes to junior middle school education.  To date, the reform-through-labor institutions across the  country have run more than 12,000 educational classes. Some  1.15 million inmates have graduated from those classes and  received diplomas. The institutions have also run job skill  training classes so that inmates can earn their own living after  leaving prison and return to society. So far, 810,000 inmates  have received job skill certificates.    A nationwide election for new leading bodies at county and  township levels was held in 1993. On 25 December, some 1,200  inmates in Wuhan city, Hubei, who have not been deprived of  political rights cast their votes according to the law during  those elections.

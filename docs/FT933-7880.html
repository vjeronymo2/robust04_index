			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Norway in talks to prevent US sanctions NORWAY will be holding a series of talks with US government officials through September in an effort to avoid US trade sanctions, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Earlier this month, Mr Ron Brown, US secretary of commerce, made an official recommendation that Norway's decision to resume hunting minke whales in defiance of the International Whaling Commission moratorium undermined the effectiveness of the IWC's conservation regime. Under a provision of US fishing law, called the Pelly amendment, such a step gives President Bill Clinton the authority to impose trade sanctions against the offending country, without limit to any amount or kind of product. Sanctions are expected to be aimed at US imports of Norwegian fishery products, valued at between Dollars 50 and Dollars 100m a year. Mr Clinton has to make a decision on sanctions against Norway by October 6, according to Norwegian officials. The IWC voted in May to continue the moratorium on all commercial whaling despite a recommendation by its scientific committee for a limited harvesting of the minke whale. Norway's whalers completed their hunt last month falling four short of a commercial quota of 160 minke whales set by the government. In autumn they will resume whaling for scientific purposes.</p>

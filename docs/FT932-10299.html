			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Pay rises 'below 3% for first time in 9 years' AVERAGE PAY increases have dropped below 3 per cent for the first time in nine years, with a quarter of settlements in the first three months of the year worth 1.8 per cent or less, according to figures released today by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research company. It says in a report that the number of pay freezes has yet to peak, with one in five employers among the latest batch to settle giving their workers no increase or deferring rises. In the three months to the end of March, settlements covering nearly 1m employees dipped to 2.9 per cent, compared with 4.5 per cent a year ago. This is the first time that the 3 per cent barrier has been breached since IRS pay databank figures on about 1,000 bargaining groups became available nine years ago. IRS predicts that when public-sector pay deals, backdated to April, are eventually included the level of increases will be pushed down even further. Most public-sector staff covered by pay review bodies will receive 1.5 per cent rises in line with the government's ceiling on public-sector pay. IRS says that the only public-sector group likely to put up any real resistance to the 1.5 per cent limit is the firefighters. Their increase is not due until November but the Fire Brigades Union has made clear that there is a risk of industrial action if local authority employers do not honour a pay formula which links firefighters' earnings to the top quarter of average male manual earnings. The union's annual conference in Bridlington, Humberside, this week is likely to discuss a strike ballot. In the National Health Service pay negotiations which should have been concluded in April are progressing slowly with different groups of workers involved in what IRS calls a 'slow bicycle race'. IRS says NHS unions are 'anxious to avoid reaching the stage of, say, ballotting on industrial action over the 1.5 per cent first'.

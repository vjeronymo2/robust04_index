			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Bombay suffers as violence hits the city - Political problems weigh on the equity markets Bombay has this week slowly limped back to commercial life, following the violence which hit the city after the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya. But it will take much longer to restore confidence in the nervous financial markets. Shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange, which was closed for three days after the mosque's demolition unleashed a nationwide wave of unrest, have fallen since trading resumed to 8.8 per cent below pre-crisis levels. Yesterday the exchange's index of 30 leading stocks dropped 102 points to 2,374.72, pushed down by news of the imposition of central government rule in three states. The stock exchange authorities have tried to slow the decline by tightening limits on trading volumes, but with little effect on sentiment. Brokers said yesterday that the uncertainty would persist until Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao restored political stability. Doubts about the future course of the economy are expected to cloud the financial outlook until the government announces the next phase of its economic reform programme in the budget due in February. Financial companies are also still suffering from the effect of the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.35bn) securities market scandal, which has depressed activity in almost all markets, including stocks. Mr Hemendra Kothari, chairman of DSP Financial and Investment Services, a leading broker, said: 'I personally feel the political situation will clear sooner rather than later, though how long it will take is anybody's guess.' Mr Kothari, a former stock exchange president, added that stocks could fall further as investors were waiting for the budget to get a correct picture of economic reforms, although mid-January might be a good time for bargain hunting. The crisis has severely dampened activity in the burgeoning market in primary issues. Hindustan Aluminium Company, a leading aluminium maker, last week postponed the pricing of a planned Dollars 100m euro-equity issue. Investment bankers in Bombay said the issue would probably now be postponed until after the budget is published on February 28. Other proposed issues, including Essar Gujarat, which is raising funds for a sponge iron plant, could also be delayed, they said. Indian brokers have also become wary of marketing local share issues for fear that the decline in share prices is squeezing investors' resources. Yet the market is not entirely dead: private individuals have, for example, flocked to buy stock in Wockhardt, a Bombay pharmaceutical maker. The political upheaval over Ayodhya will delay investments by foreign fund managers. Foreigners this autumn won permission to invest directly in India's equity market, albeit on strict conditions. But so far only eight out of 19 applicants have been approved. Many of the remaining 11 institutions are fund management groups linked to security broking companies, and have been held up by delays over deciding the terms of entry for foreign securities companies. One foreign banker in Delhi said that even before the Ayodhya crisis foreigners had been in no hurry to invest in India. Apart from the Ayodhya crisis and the financial scandal, foreigners are concerned about the relatively high valuation of Indian stocks. The top 30 shares trade on price/earnings multiples of about 32. As a result, Indian brokers believe that the country will see an inflow of portfolio investment funds of a bare Dollars 100m in the financial year to March, compared with an original unofficial target of Dollars 1bn. Similarly, Indian companies are now expected to raise only about Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m in Euro-equity issues, just over half the Dollars 1bn originally expected. Meanwhile, the stock exchange authorities are concerned that the political crisis may yet bring further trouble on the broking community by driving some broking firms into financial collapse. The industry, which enjoyed an unprecedented boom until April, has since seen prices and trading volumes fall sharply, causing financial problems at many small broking concerns.</p>

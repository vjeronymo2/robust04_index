			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The art of seduction  -Money spent on packaging can go a long way Seducing customers into buying your product and building a loyalty from that initial purchase are key marketing problems. Few steps are more important in that seduction than getting the packaging right. Ugly, old-fashioned presentation can ruin a brand or newly launched product; first impressions are critical. But packaging designers in particular are fast learning that in a recession they need to demonstrate the commercial, bottom-line value of their work; cosmetic skills alone are not enough. The traditional UK jam and marmalade market has been in steady long-term decline - down from 109,000 tonnes in 1984 to 89,500 tonnes in 1991. In the 1980s healthier, lower-sugar diets became fashionable, product innovation seemed limited, preserves manufacturers waged price wars, and own-label preserves took market share from brands. All that left little room for lavish promotional spending. The only growth niche seemed to be in low-sugar preserves, but consumers were turned off by unconventional tastes and textures. Chivers Hartley, a division of Premier Brands and a traditional name in preserves, decided to develop a low-sugar preserve range which also tasted good. It set about new product development in conjunction with a London design consultancy, The Design Bridge. Chivers developed a new cooking process with a much higher fruit content, emulating the taste and texture of higher-sugar jams and marmalades. But equally important was the development of a new packaging design. Chivers set itself the target of taking 5 per cent of the low-sugar market last year, the first full year of the new range, called Hartleys Extra Fruit; it took 7 per cent. According to Mike Whetter, Chivers Hartley's marketing manager, the packaging design was 'absolutely fundamental. If you get your design right you are well on the way to success. If you get it wrong, then you'll never succeed.' Perfecting the packaging design can also help make or break product relaunches. In February 1990 Chivers Hartley took a step into what was then a relatively new market, ready-made convenience desserts, with a range called Chivers Fruit Cup. The market has grown to a retail value now of some Pounds 19m annually. But the dominant green colour of the original packaging meant that retailers frequently placed the product - fruit in jelly - on shelves next to canned fruit. Consumers failed to be tempted, and the product reached only 60 per cent of all retail outlets. 'We found that the graphics of the pack were totally underselling the product and were not conveying what was inside the pot. The pack itself was not exciting them to pick it up and try it,' says Whetter. Chivers Hartley literally went back to the drawing board. Design Bridge worked out new colours, graphics and packaging, and the Fruit Cup range was relaunched earlier this year. Mike Whetter is confident that the range will increase its market share from the 5 per cent taken on relaunch to 8 per cent by the end of the year. The total cost of relaunching Fruit Cup, including design work, he puts at Pounds 120,000. 'New product launches like this are very difficult; marketing money here is sacred, we have to make every pound work hard for us. We have a total marketing spend of about Pounds 2m annually; about 3.5 per cent of turnover,' says Whetter. Packaging designers are increasingly being consulted at an early stage of new product development. The Design Bridge was called in by chocolate manufacturers Terry's of York, which in 1989 decided to produce a premium 'special treat' chocolate bar. Aimed at 25-44 year old women, the new bar was designed to capture qualities such as 'indulgence', 'richness' and 'uniqueness' in an already crowded market. The design brief was to develop packaging which would sell the bar as a luxurious treat; understated, yet appealing to women purchasers looking for more than a quick chocolate 'fix'. The new bar, called Moments, exceeded its first year sales targets by 47 per cent, with retail sales of Pounds 10m in 1991 - an achievement in a market where more than four out of five new product launches fail. Good packaging design helps sell more than food and snacks. Wickens Tutt Southgate, another London design agency, has worked on several accounts to re-vamp brands in equally competitive markets, such as paint aimed at do-it-yourself home owners. The leading UK brand name for specialist paint for metal is Hammerite, made by Hunting Specialised Products, based in Northumberland. Hammerite has a 77 per cent share of this market, but at the end of the 1980s it became concerned that its image was too 'professional' for some purchasers - particularly women - and decided to re-launch its brand, broadening its appeal without losing existing customer loyalty. According to Guy Falkenham, European marketing controller of Hunting, money used to obtain successful design is as important an ingredient of successful marketing as advertising spend. 'It is very expensive to sustain a television advertising campaign 12 months of the year; we spend in excess of Pounds 1m on a six week TV campaign,' he says. 'TV advertising has terrific influences on sales - we have seen 600 per cent increases for the period during and immediately after television advertising. That's very good, but you can only sustain it for so long.' So Hunting briefed Wickens Tutt Southgate to create packaging both more 'aesthetically pleasing and informative and with less of a macho image. We tried to cut through technical jargon and back-of-pack caveats,' says Falkenham. Hunting consolidated two brands - Hammerite and Smoothrite - into one single brand. The designers came up with a branding device, a shield, to symbolise strength, protection and durability. In Falkenham's view, good packaging design is vital but only one element in an overall sales promotion effort. Nevertheless, get it wrong and it can be costly: 'Your chances of success with a good design are quite limited, the consumer will only grasp one or two elements of the design of the pack.' But given the choice between Pounds 1m for six weeks of television advertising and Pounds 60,000 for design work on a brand launch, it must make sense to get the drawing board out before hiring the film crew.</p>

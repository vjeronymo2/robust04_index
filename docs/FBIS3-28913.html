			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with </F> Japanese and foreign correspondents at the Madison Hotel in  Washington -- live]    [Text] [Tachihara] I am Tachihara from the Political News  Department of JIJI NEWS AGENCY. Prime Minister, I would like to  ask two questions. The first concerns the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks which failed to hammer out an accord. I feel  moves will increase in the United States to take retaliatory  action against Japan. How will the Japanese Government respond  to those moves? Prime Minister, you said that awhile ago you had  breakfast with the President. Would you give the details of  what you and the President talked about during breakfast?    [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. As  for U.S. sanctions against Japan, I believe and strongly hope  that the United States will not take unilateral steps that run  counter to the rules of the General Agreement on Tariff and  Trade [GATT]. As I said awhile ago, I intend to make energetic  efforts to promote negotiations in areas in which the two  countries failed to reach an agreement following a period of  cooling off. This morning, I had breakfast with the President.  As I said awhile ago, the President and myself talked about the  Cuban and Latin American situations as well as issues in the  Asia-Pacific region. The President and myself spent much of  time looking around the White House. The President showed me a  room where President Lincoln signed documents as well as other  historical rooms.    [Tanabe] I am Tanabe from KYODO NEWS AGENCY. Prime  Minister, I would like to ask you two questions. My first  concerns the Japan- U.S. economic framework talks that ended  yesterday. The Clinton administration has persistently asked  Japan to establish numerical targets. Prime Minister, do you  think the Clinton administration's trade policy is tilting  toward managed trade? During the past six months of  negotiations, the United States has criticized the Japanese  bureaucracy. Prime Minister, do you think the U.S. criticism is  accurate?    [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. As I  said awhile ago, there has been substantial progress in  negotiations on procedures for individual areas. However, the  two countries failed to bridge their differences on the  relationship between objective criteria and numerical targets,  although they exchanged their views and asserted their  respective positions. The issue of objective criteria is one  aspect of the economic framework talks. My understanding is that  it will not have a harmful impact on overall Japan-U.S.  relations. I repeatedly told the President I cannot accept  numerical targets which could lead to managed trade. Japanese  negotiators have repeatedly asserted Japan cannot accept  numerical targets. The objective criteria which the United  States has proposed has been interpreted in various ways. I  told the President that objective criteria and numerical targets  are one in the same. During the talks, I also told the  President they are incompatible with the thinking of the  Hosokawa government, which is promoting deregulation as its  primary policy. I told the President that for this reason I  cannot agree with them.    As for your question about U.S. criticism against Japanese  bureaucrats, it is very hard for me to answer. Foreign nations  are liable to adopt such views. Although this question is  related to the first, officials in various ministries and  agencies have repeatedly maintained in the negotiations that the  government could not commit itself to resolving issues which are  out of the government's jurisdiction through measures like  managed trade. However, I think foreign nations may see Japan  as Japan Incorporated, and may have a certain prejudice against  Japan. During the current negotiations, I made some decisions  transcending the jurisdictions of various ministries and  agencies after having studied what sort of measures are  desirable for the national interests of Japan and the survival  of Japan within the international community.    [Domoto] I am Domoto from NHK. I would like to ask about  domestic affairs. You will have to tackle the Diet session  shortly after you return to Japan. What will be your most  important domestic agenda for the time being? Do you intend to  manage politics without reshuffling your cabinet, at least until  the ordinary Diet session ends? I would like you to answer  these two questions.    [Hosokawa] Needless to say, the most important issue in  domestic politics is to pass the draft budget as soon as  possible. I intend to do the utmost to tackle this issue. This  is the most important task for me for the time being. Moreover,  other important bills -- such as the Product Liability Bill --  have been submitted to the current Diet session for  consideration. In view of the present economic situation, the  most urgent task is to have the draft budget pass the Diet as  soon as possible. As for reshuffling the cabinet, I am not  thinking of it at this moment because until now I have devoted  myself to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, tax system reform,  political reform, and other issues.    [Jim] Prime Minister, I am Jim from the LOS ANGELES TIMES.  During your current visit to Washington, you stated the Japanese  Government would cooperate in imposing economic sanctions  against the DPRK over its suspected development of nuclear  weapons under the scope of Japanese law. Do you mean Japan is  considering economic sanctions? Could you tell us specifically  about what Japan is preparing to do? I think whether Japan will  stop remittances to North Korea is an issue.    [Hosokawa] From a viewpoint of settling the issue through  continuous discussions, Japan will continue to work with the  United States, the Republic of Korea, and China. If the  international community or the United Nations decides to take  measures against North Korea, then it is natural for Japan to  take responsible action. I cannot predict what sort of results  the talks between the IAEA and North Korea, which are to be held  at the end of February, will yield. As I said awhile ago, if  sanctions are imposed against North Korea, Japan will take  measures based on its responsibility under the scope of its laws.    A question was asked on the issue of remitting money to  North Korea. We do not know exactly how much they are sending  to North Korea. The human rights issue is also involved in  this. Therefore, we have to take these points into  consideration.    [Doya] I am Ayako Doya from THE JAPAN TIMES. Some U.S.  Government officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor, are of the opinion that sanctions should be imposed  against Japan should Japan refuse to accept numerical targets.  Others are saying we should not let the issue of numerical  targets damage Japan-U.S. relations. Roughly speaking, they are  divided into two groups. However, the President is the one who  is going to decide on this matter. You have spent many hours in  discussions with the President. Which side is the President  leaning towards, and how much of your explanations did the  President understand?    [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, I think Japan-U.S. relations  have entered a new era. In the past, both countries mutually  refrained from saying things which were really difficult to say.  By surmounting each situation, they cleared hurdles one by one.  As a result, Japan gave answers which could be interpreted in  different manners. Japan eventually viewed U.S. attempts as  outside pressure [gaiatsu]; through outside pressure, the United  States tried to get a compromise from Japan. I have a feeling  both countries have such an impression of each other. The  United States, Canada, and Europe candidly talk about matters  which are difficult to discuss. Earlier I called it mature  relations. I am of the opinion that Japan-U.S. relations should  also be that way. In this sense, I think my recent visit was a  very good one. You asked what President Clinton thinks of  sanctions. I feel he thinks the same way. As I earlier said, I  do not think sanctions will be immediately imposed against Japan.    [Unidentified correspondent] I have two questions. The  first is this. You have said that for awhile both countries  will have a period of cooling off. I understand reviews will be  made twice a year. Do you have a plan to visit the United  States before six months have passed to meet President Clinton  again? Another question is about the comprehensive economic  measures you recently announced. It seems the measures are ill  spoken of by some U.S. Government officials. Can you comment on  this?    [Hosokawa] As for the economic stimulus package, as you  said the United States did not favorably evaluate it. However,  when we look at the tax cuts specified in the package, the  amount of the reductions is considerably larger than those which  Japan carried out when former President Reagan was in office.  Moreover, my cabinet has laid out plans for promoting  discussions by the end of this year on drastic tax reform  measures. I asked the President to understand this. I also  stressed that major economic stimulus measures amounting to over  15 trillion yen will certainly have a favorable effect on our  efforts to establish and promote a domestic demand-oriented  economy. What was your first question?    [Correspondent] The next visit to the United States at an  earlier date.    [Hosokawa] So far I am not thinking about paying a visit to  the United States at an earlier date. But I want to discuss the  scheduling of the next visit with the secretariat, although I  have no idea how long a cooling off period we need.    [Komori] I am Komori with SANKEI SHIMBUN. You have stressed  several times that Japan-U.S. relations have entered the stage  of mature relations, like relations between the United States  and European nations. Taking a look at relations between the  United States and European nations, I find that although they  exchange sharp debates on economic issues, their relations are  solid because they share a very similar basic sense of values on  such matters as security, diplomacy, democracy, and human  rights. So they base their disputes over economic affairs on  their solid relations. In the case of relations between Japan  and the United States, I wonder if Japan and the United States  share a similar sense of values, particularly on security. Do  you still have confidence in maintaining basic bilateral  relations while the two countries are engaged in heated disputes  over economic issues?    [Hosokawa] I think we have to let our relations enter such  an era. Moreover, I feel such an atmosphere is being steadily  created through a series of talks between myself and President  Clinton -- including the summit talks yesterday as well as the  previous summit talks -- as well as ministerial and  working-level talks.    [Unidentified correspondent] I am with AP. As regards  objective criteria, the U.S. Government has said it will not  resume negotiations until Japan changes its position. In a  meeting held in the morning, Japan said it will not change its  position, thus showing a tough stance. If both sides establish  a cooling off period, is there any possibility Japan would  propose some kind of compromise, or do you think a compromise  should be proposed by the United States?    [Hosokawa] On the issues of government procurement or  insurance, for example, Japan and the United States are moving  closer to each other, and an agreement is within their reach.  The problem is objective criteria, and it runs counter to the  principle of our negotiations. Japan holds its basic stand that  one way or another it is necessary to avoid objective criteria  that goes against our efforts in promoting deregulations and  leads to managed trade. Japan will not change its position in  this regard. However, as I said earlier, since finishing  touches on negotiations on some individual trade sectors are  being put into place, I would like to find a clue to break the  deadlock after a cooling off period. This is what I feel now.  [At this point NHK concludes its live relay of the Hosokawa  news conference]</p>

This case raises many  questions which remain unanswered at a time when security  circles affirm that the defendants will soon be referred to the  State Security Court. Among the questions that remain  unanswered are: How many defendants are involved in the bombing  incidents? Do they belong to an organization that has programs  and objectives? What is this organization's link to Islamic  movements in Jordan? Does it have connections with outside  circles for financing and support? What are the objectives that  they are trying to achieve in Jordan? How did the security  forces manage to reach the perpetrators of those operations?  SHIHAN has managed to uncover and answer all of these and other  questions.    A security official told SHIHAN that the explosions at the  Rivoli and Salva theaters were not the first of their kind. The  bombings began at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah [refugee  camp] in 1988. The security official, who preferred to remain  anonymous, explained his viewpoint on the details of the  bombings. He said: The plan, which was drawn up by the 30  defendants, most of whom received training and lived in  Afghanistan, goes back to 1988. That is the year in which the  explosion at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah took place.  However, the repeated travel by their leaders to Afghanistan  and the Philippines, and the discovery of 'Muhammad's Army',  which carried out similar acts, prompted those individuals to  suspend their activities in Jordan.    The security official continues: Some of those who returned  from Afghanistan and who have been arrested are members of the  Islamic Action Front Party. However, the Front had nothing to  do with their acts. He indicated that this "organization", if  one can call it that, is composed of two groups: The first,  which is the smaller of the two, carried out the al-Yarmuk  Cinema bombing in 1988. The second, includes the leaders as  well as the first group. [as published].    The security official said that 'Abdallah Kamul  al-Hashayikah, who belongs to the Muslim Brothers, is the leader  of this organization, and that Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad is the  second man in the organization. The security official revealed  that this organization endeavors to promote the spirit of jihad  and raises the jihad slogan through the Islamic world. It seeks  to eliminate vileness and to strike at the dens of corruption.  He explained that it became clear from the investigation of the  defendants in the bombing operations that their motive was  opposition to what they termed as capitulation. They also  targeted theaters and liquor stores out of their belief that  they play a vile role and should be uprooted as a religious  duty. They believe there is no alternative to the use of force  by bombing operations.    The security official indicated that the bombing scheme was  not confined to the bombings at the Rivoli and Salva theaters.  An explosive charge was placed in a toffee box at the 'Akrush  stores in Safut [a village between Amman and al-Baq'ah refugee  camp], but failed to explode. A similar charge was placed at  the Zahran Cinema in Amman. He said that investigations  revealed that first class hotels in Amman were also a target.  Furthermore, the investigations revealed a plan to assassinate  political figures in the Jordanian and Palestinian peace  delegations. However, President Yasir 'Arafat's name was not  among them because they could not monitor his movements, but  they were following the movements of members of the Jordanian  and Palestinian delegations.    The security official revealed that the defendants  intensified their activities during the month of January this  year because the main financier of their operations and plans, a  Saudi citizen working with Usamah Bin Ladin, was planning to  visit Jordan. The official continued to identify the financiers  of the organization by saying that: Usamah Bin-Ladin is a  wealthy Saudi who lives outside Saudi Arabia and is known for  supporting extremist Islamic movements around the world. He was  a friend of the late 'Abdallah 'Azzam, the spiritual leader of  the Jordanian Afghans.    On the relationship between what took place in Jordan and  what is taking place in Egypt, the official said the defendants  had no links to the fundamentalist organizations that are  responsible for bombings in Egypt. However, some of the  defendants confessed to their admiration for what is happening  in Egypt and Algeria.    He said most defendants had confessed to the charges against  them, and that quantities of dynamite and raw materials used for  making homemade explosives, such as acetone peroxide, a highly  explosive material, in addition to a few pistols and machine  guns, were discovered at their homes. He did not rule out the  fact that other weapons may have been hidden because the arrest  of some defendants was expected after some of their colleagues  were arrested.    The security official suggested a link between this  organization, to which he did not give a name, and Muhammad's  Army. However, he said that there is an organizational  interconnection, but not organizational relations between the  two. He denied that any of the defendants in the bombings were  members of Muhammad's Army.    On how the organization and the defendants were uncovered,  the official said that the first link in the chain was defendant  'Id al-Jahhali, who was injured in the theater explosion. At  first, he was moved with the other injured people who were  inside the theater. However, the forensic experts had suspicions  about his injuries because he lost his two legs and a finger.  Thus, when his condition, described as critical, improved, he  was interrogated by security men. He admitted he had placed the  explosive charge in the theater. He said he waited for a while  before leaving to avoid suspicion, but got carried away watching  the movie and the charge exploded under his seat. The official  said al-Jahhalin admitted to the names of those who carried out  the bombings with him. They were led by Muhammad 'Ali  Abu-'Ayyad, who gave him the explosive charge and who supervised  all the bombing operations.    The security official concluded by affirming that the  judicial circles have started interrogating the defendants and  that a charge sheet will most likely be ready in 3 weeks. He  refused to reveal where the defendants are being detained. He  merely said that "they are being held in an officially  recognized prison."</p>

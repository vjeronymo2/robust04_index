			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS FALL SHORT AGAIN; RADER NOT DISCOURAGED;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FINLEY STARTS OUT STRONG AND JOYNER CONTINUES HIS HOT HITTING, BUT  THE DODGERS COME FROM BEHIND TO WIN FREEWAY SERIES OPENER, 5-4.  </P> <P> For Angel Manager Doug Rader, there was the consolation that his team was in  position to win Friday's game, just as it has been in position to win nearly  every one of the five consecutive games it has lost.  </P> <P> But while the Angels may be putting themselves into position to win, the  Dodgers are actually winning, as they did in a come-from-behind, 5-4 victory  before 47,555 at Anaheim Stadium in the opener of the Freeway Series.  </P> <P> "This was encouraging," said Dodger Manager Tommy Lasorda, whose team won for  the fourth time in five games and improved its exhibition record to 6-4. "We  hit the ball after the first few innings and we were able to put some runs on  the board and then stop them. . . . We've played a lot in spring training.  We've done a lot of hitting, a lot of running, everything. We're doing all  right."  </P> <P> Not that the Angels are doing everything wrong. Wally Joyner was three for five  with two runs batted in and has nine hits in his last 15 at-bats. After  Joyner's RBI single in the third, Chili Davis drove in the second run of the  inning with a sacrifice fly, and outfielder Dante Bichette hit a home run in  the fourth, his third of the spring.  </P> <P> "I know we've lost a bunch of games in a row and haven't won this week, but the  bottom line is that the people we're counting on to do the job for us this year  are doing it," said Rader, whose team is 6-8. "We've been in position to win  virtually every one of these ballgames and that's all you can ask."  </P> <P> Hubie Brooks' single in the seventh off Mike Smithson scored Juan Samuel with  the decisive run, capping a three-run rally.  </P> <P> Angel starter Chuck Finley was impressive in the early going, retiring the  first 10 batters he faced, most of them on ground balls. He worked his way out  of a jam in the fourth, after he issued back-to-back walks to Willie Randolph  and Brooks, but the Dodgers got to him for two runs in the fifth on RBI-singles  by Samuel and Randolph.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with Finley's arm strength," Rader said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers were pleased to be able to get to Finley at all, after the  left-hander's strong start.  </P> <P> "He was unhittable. He had good stuff," Brooks said. "He threw me one I never  came close to hitting. I don't know what happened (as Finley approached the  middle innings) but I know he had my number."  </P> <P> The numbers on Fernando Valenzuela were encouraging to the Dodgers. The veteran  left-hander pitched six innings, his longest outing of the spring, and gave up  four runs and seven hits. He walked three and struck out two.  </P> <P> "He pitched against a good offensive team and we're encouraged," catcher Mike  Scioscia said.  </P> <P> Lasorda was even more encouraged by the performance of Samuel, who was two for  four with an RBI in the fifth and a rally-sustaining stolen base in the  seventh.  </P> <P> "That guy is the catalyst of our offense," Lasorda said. "If he gets on base,  we'll score. He's a great base stealer. He gets on and steals a lot of bases.  We're going to cut down on his strikeouts and he's done it so far."  </P> <P> Smithson fed the Dodgers the fuel for their rally when he hit Jeff Hamilton  with his first pitch. Hamilton went to third on Alfredo Griffin's double and  scored on Samuel's roller up the middle. Griffin scored when second baseman  Johnny Ray slipped while fielding Willie Randolph's bunt.  </P> <P> "The biggest play was hitting the leadoff man. That's what got them going,"  said Smithson, who has had rocky outings his last two times out. "I could use a  little more time this spring. I've only thrown three innings, but that's no  excuse."  </P> <P> Freeway Series Notes  </P> <P> Angel pitcher Bob McClure has an inflamed left elbow and was told to rest for  several days. McClure was examined bu Dr. Ron Glousman of the Kerlan-Jobe  Clinic and will be re-examined Monday by Dr. Lewis Yocum, if necessary. McClure  was forced to leave Thursday's exhibition game against the San Diego Padres in  Palm Springs after complaining of tightness and pain in the elbow. He is being  treated with anti-inflammatory medication. . . . Neither McClure nor third  baseman Jack Howell (sprained left ankle) has been placed on the disabled list.  The initial report on Howell, who injured his ankle Wednesday, was that he  would be out seven to 10 days. However, he is hoping to play in Monday's season  opener. "I don't want to start if there's a chance of injuring it worse," said  Howell, who has stopped using crutches. "It's more important to be careful. On  other hand, if it's just a little bit sore, I can play with that." Rader was  pleased to hear of Howell's intentions. "I never contradict a man who says a  brave thing," Rader said. "I don't know if it's a practical thing or not, but I  think the world of him for saying it.". . . The Angels will announce their  final cuts Sunday morning. . . .Catcher John Orton was voted the Fred Haney  award as the Angels' outstanding spring training rookie. Orton is hitting .471  with two home runs and seven RBIs.  </P> <P> Rader said Donnie Hill "probably has got a little bit of an edge" over Rick  Schu for the starting third baseman's job. "He's a switch-hitter, for one  thing, and he's more than adequate at third base," Rader said. "I've seen him  play third base a number of games, especially when he was with Chicago. The  main thing is, he's a left-handed hitter against a right-handed pitcher  (Seattle's Brian Holman) on opening day."  </P></p>

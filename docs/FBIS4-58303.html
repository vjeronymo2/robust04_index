			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ya'el Ayalon -- recorded] </F>   [Text] [Ayalon] On the margins of his Syrian-Israeli  talks, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher spent some 90  minutes with Palestinian dignitaries this afternoon. The  meeting was attended by nine notables, including Faysal  al-Husayni, Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah, and Hanan 'Ashrawi.  It should be noted that the meeting at the U.S. Consulate in  Jerusalem was held at the request of the Palestinians. At the  end of the meeting, Faysal al-Husayni said that in it the  Palestinians raised their reservations with the Gaza and Jericho  agreement, two days before it is to be signed in Cairo.    [Al-Husayni, in English] We have two problems: One problem  concerning the implementation and the attitude of the Israeli  side on the ground, especially on the isolation of Jerusalem;  and we make it clear that if such a policy will going on, and if  it will not be stopped, it can be the element which can kill  such opportunity to sign for such opportunity to implementation  of any kind of agreements.    [Ayalon translates and continues] The Palestinians also fear  the practical implementation of the agreement by Israel on the  ground. It is impossible, al-Husayni argues, that Rabin and  'Arafat agree to decide on the size of the Jericho area, while  in practice, Israel has already started erecting a fence around  it.    [Al-Husayni, in English] We do not like the idea that they  are saying that the size of Jericho will be decided between  Rabin and 'Arafat, and then we are watching now that the  Israelis are already building and putting this borders. We do  not like it.    [Ayalon] The secretary listened to the reservations, but did  not comment. Earlier, Christopher met President 'Ezer Weizman,  but the two decided not to disclose the content of the meeting.</p>

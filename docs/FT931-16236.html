			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Asylum law is delayed PARLIAMENTARY approval of constitutional amendments to Germany's liberal asylum laws is expected to be postponed until next month because of concern among legal experts that they are incompatible with the European Community's Dublin and Schengen agreements. Those agreements, which have yet to be ratified by all EC member states, are aimed at regulating the status of refugees in any EC country. In essence, they state that the EC country which issues a visa to a refugee or would-be asylum seeker, is responsible for that person even if he or she enters another EC country in transit. However, amendments worked out last December between the ruling Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Free Democrats coalition government, and the opposition Social Democratic Party in response to the rise in right-wing violence against foreigners, might mean that Germany would not be able to participate in the Dublin and Schengen agreements. One main amendments to the asylum law, enshrined in Article 16 of the constitution, says Germany has the right to send back any person entering the country from a safe neighbouring third country, including Poland, the Czech republic and the Slovak republic. Over 70 per cent of asylum seekers arrive in Germany by land, some 10 per cent by airport.</p>

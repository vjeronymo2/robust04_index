			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alejandro Martinez Cuenca] </F>   [Text] The year 1993 is about to end. Taking a look  backward is always a good exercise. If we do so with an open and  constructive attitude, we may find out where the problems were  and where we can refocus our actions to help improve future  prospects.    Many international, political, economic, and social factors  were present in 1993. They all had an impact on the year now  ending, one of the worst of the last 14 years for Nicaragua.    The living conditions of large parts of society  deteriorated;  a considerable number of agricultural, industrial, commercial,  and service enterprises had to close their doors or are now on  the verge of bankruptcy. The unemployed population has continued  to grow; frustration levels have soared; there has been a surge  in crime; and the insecurity felt by citizens all over the  nation has increased.    Delays in the arrival of foreign aid and the strings  attached  to it have served as an economic disincentive and have had  psychological repercussions on important sectors of our national  life. In addition, the continuing infighting of Nicaragua's  political class has fostered a climate of constant anxiety.  Moreover, the rigid application of erratic and contradictory  economic policies has deteriorated still further the social  conditions of the majority of the population.  <H5>  Economics </H5>   Despite all this, particularly the erroneous economic  policies of the year that is ending, and thanks to the good luck  of abundant rainfalls all over Nicaragua, some encouraging  signals for agricultural prospects in 1994 have appeared.  Agriculture is the backbone of Nicaragua's economic and social  life.    There is no doubt that the transition process Nicaragua is  going through is complex and difficult. Inconsistency in the  application of economic instruments and a highly  compartmentalized view of economic, political, and social  processes, combined with the difficulties imposed by the  international context, meant that the economic recovery and  social stability goals for 1993 were not achieved.    The economy is still seen by government policymakers as part  of an accounting system, in which all the effort is concentrated  on making sure that the various accounts close out, without  thinking that the economy is more than simple addition and  subtraction. Economics involves social and productive relations  that must be taken into account, but 1993 was marked by a deep  recession that will produce a new decline in the GDP [gross  domestic product] of 0.7 percent and a further erosion of per  capita income.  <H5>  Policies and Undesired Effects </H5>   Unemployment and underemployment rose to over 50 percent of  the economically active population; a third of the nation's  households are living in extreme poverty.    Deregulation and privatization of the economy, intended to  reduce state intervention and shift more responsibility to the  private sector, have not helped to stimulate the economic and  productive process.    On the contrary, the state has been reduced, but its  regulatory capacity has not grown stronger; instead, this  process has created greater disruption in the production and  circulation of goods and services, with negative effects on the  population.    The existence of a certain overvaluation of the cordoba in  relation to the dollar, the high degree of indexing of the  economy, and the rapid tariff-lowering process were factors  which, rather than helping to develop markets, have distorted  markets. These policies have deepened the economic recession and  produced a greater concentration of income.    As production has continued to fall, the economy has grown  more vulnerable to the vagaries of foreign aid. Therefore,  uncertainty and difficulties related to the availability of  foreign resources may influence changes in economic policy;  these factors fed the inflationary spiral and people's  expectations.    The major policies of 1993 that shored up the stabilization  program produced undesired effects. Among those are:     -  a) Credit policy. Keeping interest rates high was a  stimulus to attract resources for the financial system, although  they do not support a real credit expansion that will promote  production. High interest rates combined with the loan  guarantees demanded by commercial banks have barred access to  credit for a large number of small producers.    -  b) Exchange  policy. The strong indexing of the economy has kept the exchange  rate from serving as a stimulus for export production.  Maintaining an overvalued exchange rate in the absence of other  complementary policies has slashed gross international reserves,  making economic stability even more vulnerable.   <H5>    The Rainy Season, a Positive Factor </H5>    -  c) Fiscal policy. The monetary policy of 1993, which  continued to impact on domestic demand, brought about a  reduction in real income, leading to a highly restrictive  spending policy. This had the effect of worsening the economy in  general, causing a deterioration in basic services and higher  unemployment.    -  d) Fixed investment, estimated at 13 percent of  the GDP, remained depressed. Public investment, which represents  about 60 percent of the total, was less strong than originally  projected because of problems with formulation, execution, and  follow-up, among others. Private investment experienced a very  slight and insufficient growth as if to compensate for cuts in  the originally programmed investment. This was due to a lack of  clear policies and signals to economic agents, combined with  political instability.    -  e) Despite the factors mentioned above  and the recessive character of the economy during 1993, the good  rainy season will permit an increase in agricultural production  in the 1993-94 season, which could generate moderate economic  growth next year.    A rapid economic recovery supported by new stimulus policies  that should be introduced in 1994 could allow us to turn the  1993 experience around and move to a position of hope and  greater optimism. Then we may be able to say that 1993 was the  year when we hit the bottom of the barrel, and now the only way  we can go is up, as we try not to sink still further in a search  for new "false bottoms."</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: US business lobbies over anti-dumping A coalition of 50 business organisations is lobbying Congress to modify what they term 24 'highly protectionist violations' of the Uruguay Round agreement contained in the Clinton Administration proposals to rewrite the anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. With US companies a target of such regimes in other countries, the concern is that any violation of the spirit of the pact will be copied by foreign governments. Clinton Administration officials insist that they have been faithful to the spirit as well as the language of the Round when they translated the agreement into implementing legislation. They are defending their view in both House and Senate committees where the legislation is being scrutinised. The coalition - which embraces the Pro Trade Group, the Computer and Communications Industry Association and other exporters - accuses the administration of 'chipping away at gains made in the Uruguay Round by slanting nearly every change to the statute in a manner that is beneficial to those who initiate dumping complaints.' Privately trade lawyers worry about some proposals which they say continue excessive and time-consuming procedural requirements. They say the changes increase the likelihood of guilty findings and artificially inflate the level of duties to be imposed. Although the new anti-dumping and countervailing duty codes require reforms, individual governments still have flexibility in their regulations. New provisions, for example, agreed at the Gatt would ease the burden on companies under investigation which often find it a burden to comply with requests for information and find themselves penalised with duties. Both importers and exporters are urging the Administration to closely monitor the compliance of foreign ant-dumping proceedings with the new Gatt rule. They want the US trade representative to prepare an annual report on all anti-dumping actions taken against US exports.</p>

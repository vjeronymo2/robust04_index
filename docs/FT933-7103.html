			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Arts: Past echoes of reality - William Packer catches the Gilman collection of photography / The Edinburgh Festival The Waking Dream is the one serious exhibition of visual art, of any sort, that this year the Edinburgh Festival acknowledges as part of itself. No matter that it comes fully fledged from the nest of the Metropolitan Museum of New York, and flies on to the Hermitage at St Petersburg for the winter: the Festival's engagement with the visual arts was ever thus - indifferent, opportunistic, conscience-free. And we, for our part, should simply be grateful that so many remarkable and wonderful images have been brought over for our delight. The collection is the creature of Howard Gilman, present chairman of the paper company founded by his grandfather, who has concentrated his interest on photography's first 100 years, that is to say from the moment of its first practical demonstration by William Fox Talbot in the late 1830s up to the eve of the second world war. As a period it would seem to fit well enough, a nice round number that embraces all the principal technical developments, notably the progressive miniaturisation of the equipment and the ever-increasing ease and flexibility of its handling. But perhaps such scope was, in the event, something of a snare and a delusion. The heart and substance of the show, and of the splendid book-cum-catalogue that goes with it, lie rather with the work of the first 60 or 70 years and its story of early experimentation, rapid maturity and sophistication and at last the conscious expressive potential achieved by the turn of the century. The 20th century is simply too rich a subject to warrant the afterthought allowed it here. Had the show ended at the first rather than the second war, the point would have been better made. The point, to be fair, is half-acknowledged in the title of the show, which is taken from Keats's 'Ode to a nightingale' and worth the full quotation: 'Was it a vision, or a waking dream?/ Fled is that music: - do I wake or sleep?' To catch the fleeting image on the wing, as picking notes out of the air, had always seemed quite beyond human reach. The note was played and was gone even as it was heard: and the thing seen? That too was gone or was changed even as it was seen, to be recalled only in its simulacrum. The excitement at seeing those first shadowy, ghost-like echoes of reality appearing on the page may only be imagined, but it was real enough. Even now we may catch something of it, if only the faintest hint, not as excitement at all but in the poignant frisson of recognition we feel as we look again at those gentlemen, so studiedly negligent in their stovepipe hats, those women sitting in dappled sunshine on the lawn, that broom still leaning against the door. It is the nicest irony that photography should have suffered ever since by the expectation raised at its very invention, that here was a mirror held up to nature. It was never, could never be, any such thing. The double-irony is that whenever it aspires, therefore, to the condition of art, its inherent and apparent realism is held against it, with affectation and self-indulgence summoned in aid. The truth of it is simple enough. Any fool can use a camera, or a pencil or brush for that matter. The camera is a tool available to the artist, with its peculiar virtues, limitations and disciplines to master and exploit. It is not its picking-up that makes him so but only the use he makes of it. What makes so many of these early images so potent in their effect upon the imagination is that whatever else they might have been thinking of, the photographers were primarily engrossed in the mastery of their medium. There is to their work a quality of definition and deliberation that can only be a function of the equipment to hand, and the opportunities it afforded. With everything ready and the pose set, even the landscape seems to hold its breath. Does it matter whether Lady Hawarden, using her daughters and nieces as her models at home in South Kensington, or Horatio Ross out stalking on his Scottish estates, thought of themselves as artists or mere amateur technicians? The images they produced are manifest works of art. The much smaller exhibition, Photographing Children, hung low on the wall for the benefit of its young audience, contrives to ask many of the same questions of the photographers' attitudes and intentions. Its subject is the child, as photographed from the Edinburgh urchins of Hill and Adamson in the 1840s, through the conventional studio portraiture of the later Victorians to Roger Mayne's Gorbals urchins of the 1940s and so on to the documentary and reportage, of such as Iain Stewart, Francine Dunkley, Owen Logan and John Charity, of today. The work throughout is wonderfully appealing, and yet it is a curious paradox that for all the technical advantages and freedoms enjoyed by the modern practitioners, their material seems less definitive and universal in its imagery, and more incidental, narrative and sentimental. Is it that just another exposure is, well, just another exposure? Is it that the taking of the photograph is now so easy that all effort and consideration is directed at the mis-en-scene? Or are we simply too close to them to say? Perhaps we are. And perhaps this present glossy professionalism in time will take on the qualities we find even in the vintage prints of the 1950s.

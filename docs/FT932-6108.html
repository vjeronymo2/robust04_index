			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Tales of honest corruption - As They Say in Europe MY OWN contacts with the seriously rich have been of a fringe nature. I have brushed up against those who have brushed up against the fringe members of that group which graces these pages. They are the people who have often become enormously wealthy in their own right but have also helped to enrich others. They are the honestly corrupt. There is a crucial point that has been missed in the reporting of current Italian scandals. Its most central characteristic is that Milan is Tangentopolis, or Kickback City. Milan is also the richest sub-region in the whole EC. Many will deduce that it is the city's wealth that has made it the centre of the corruption bringing Italy to its knees. A moment's reflection should dispel that illusion. Corruption bears little relationship to the availability of money; poor societies are more corrupt than rich. And in Italy there is the reality of Naples to offset the example of Milan. There is corruption a la milanese and there is the napolitano version. One works, the other does not. Some years ago Italy rewrote its national statistics to achieve the sorpasso, the overtaking of Britain to become No 5 in the world's GNP stakes. The justification was the uncounted value of the country's black economy. And corruption is part of that seamless black fabric. Honest corruption can ensure that industry grows without being hampered by pettifogging restrictions. Honest corruption means that a bribed official stays bribed and does not sell his services to another bidder. Honest corruption can ensure substantial savings on the cost of expensive law enforcement agencies designed to stamp it out. And it provides a means of permitting the super-rich to spread their wealth around a bit. There are two sentences I recall from fringe members, or at least spokesmen, of the group of which I write. The first was enunciated by a Swiss banker 20 years ago who told me: 'Nobody who has never been to prison can be a success.' At the time I was inspecting a Mediterranean property development which he had backed. It was before the flowering of the timeshare movement and was based on offering north European investors a free week a year in the development plus 'interest' on a fixed-term loan which was geared to the rental income generated. The bank helped individuals (subject to exchange control in their own countries) to obtain their money to invest in the project. A problem would arise when the loan matured. I wondered how it would be paid off or replaced. That was when the banker smiled and pointed out that the investor would be encouraged to maintain his stake because the alternative would mean his national authorities would be given details on how he had illicitly transferred the initial investment. The scheme helped both to unleash large sums of productive medium-term capital and to end the iniquities of exchange control. The other seminal phrase came at the end of an interview about the Latin American debt crisis I conducted in 1988 with a local central bank official. When I had turned off the tape recorder, I said: 'Now, come on, how much of the money was stolen?' 'Senor, the money that was stolen was invested better than the money that was invested.' We now have the evidence of the truth of that judgment: long-term gains were secured by ensuring that Latin American governments were not able to waste the money that had been so improvidently borrowed. The peoples of eastern Europe were saved by the men and women who became the modest super-rich of their societies during the long night of communism. These Ivan Boeskys of socialist arbitrage would leave Warsaw railway station with nothing but a few pairs of jeans, and return from a fortnight on the Trans-Siberian with caviar, samovars, and what appeared to be Chinese schnapps. These would be sold for dollars and the process would start again from a higher base. Free markets dealt these operators a savage blow. The young man who bought deutschemarks legally with his zloties for the first time could, for a few weeks, make a fortune driving to West Berlin and returning with half a ton of wurst two years past its sell-by date. But he was soon overtaken by improved consumer information and the spread of open markets. He found to his horror that those officials who had made his life so difficult in the past were becoming the new rich of the 'economies in transition.' The men who had constructed a ludicrous system which survived only thanks to those who bent the rules now became the lords of spontaneous privatisation. Today the nightclubs of eastern Europe are no longer populated by the enterprising youngsters who almost made their societies work. The paunchy middle-aged in dreadful suits, wrists laden with gold jewellery, have taken their place. They can afford apartments in Paris and London. They have made off with bits of state-owned factories which they once managed. As a Polish scientist told me: 'They do not even know how to use a knife and fork properly.' In the eyes of western experts these are the new 'honest corrupt' of the transition process. The test is - will they make the system work?

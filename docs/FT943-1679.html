			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / South Africa disappointed by credit rating South Africa has been given a BB rating by Ibca, the European credit rating agency, in the first formal investment risk assessment since April's elections. The announcement is disappointing for the government, which had been hoping for a BBB investment grade rating, but still puts it in the same category as countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Mr John Major, the first British Prime Minister to visit South Africa since 1960, nevertheless struck an upbeat note at the end of his three day visit, saying that he had been deeply impressed by the ability and determination of the coalition government, which took power after elections in April. 'The South African government is well aware of the need to create the right climate for the private sector and private enterprise. 'They see no ideological barriers to creating that,' he said. South Africa has been seeking an international credit rating since its April elections and has appointed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to represent it to the major agencies. The price of South African government bonds fell on disappointment among domestic investors that the country had been assigned a sub-investment grade rating. As prices fell, yields rose by 28 basis points to 16.49 per cent. 'There is little surprise outside of South Africa about the decision, but the feeling within the country was that it would get an investment grade rating,' said Mr Graham Bell, of Baring Securities in London. He added: 'However, this reaction is likely to be short-lived. Ibca is not as widely recognised as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the two major American agencies. 'Their ratings, expected next month, will provide more of a benchmark.' Although the country has borrowed money in the European markets without an official rating, the government is known be particularly keen to get access to the US market. If Moody's and S&amp;P give the same rating, this would preclude some major funds from buying South African bonds and force the country to pay a premium on any international issues it might make. In its June budget the government announced its intention to raise R1.8bn (Pounds 320m) from international capital markets in the current financial year. In its report the Ibca acknowledged South Africa benefited from good physical infrastructure, an advanced financial system, good managerial talent and relatively low foreign debt. However it warned that the economy's propensity to import remained high and said that exports remain overly dependent on primary commodities. Mr Christopher Huhne, Ibca Managing Director, said that although the rating may have been lower than government officials hoped, 'the overall tone of the report is optimistic. If the government can establish a credible fiscal track record over the next couple of years, the rating could well improve.' Mr Major, speaking in Johannesburg, said overseas investment was vital if South Africa was to generate the jobs needed to achieve economic prosperity and avoid social disruption. He urged British companies to add to the UK's Pounds 10bn investment in South Africa, which accounts for nearly half of all foreign investment. Economic liberalisation has been a key theme of Mr Major's three-day visit, during which he had talks with President Mandela, Deputy Presidents Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, and cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, and Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party. Mr Major said the South African government would face 'many difficult problems' and forecast 'setbacks as well as advances'. The key to confidence would be clear indications that the government was moving in the right direction. 'I think that if that is the case the South African government, although there will be difficulties, will have every chance of carrying its programme through,' he said.</p>

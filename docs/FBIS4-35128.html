			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sao Paulo correspondent Cristina Aby-Azar] </F>   [Text]Farm Sector Problems    The failure of the Uruguay Round of the GATT to achieve more  significant progress in the direction of an end to protectionism  and agricultural subsidies was largely the result of the  defensive position taken by the Europeans.    This was the opinion expressed by the director general of  foreign trade relations of the European Union Commission itself,  Hugo Paemen, who was in Sao Paulo yesterday to attend the "New  World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper. "All of us  share responsibility with respect to the situation in  agriculture today," he said.    What then-President of the U.S. Ronald Reagan called the  zero  option, which called for an end to all subsidies by the year  2000, proved to be an unrealistic goal and ultimately made  things more difficult by creating a lot of antagonism, according  to Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, who also took part in the  seminar.    Paemen believes, however, that negotiations will be easier  from now on. "Now we have a clearer legal structure," he said.  Furthermore, the diplomat emphasized the way the implementation  of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) had  been accelerated throughout the Uruguay Round and how various  countries that had been left on the sidelines of the  international trade system had finally been integrated into it.    The goal of reducing farm sector subsidies, according to  Paemen, will now be achieved naturally. More than 40 percent of  the rural population of the European Union is over the age of  60, which means that within a few more years these people will  leave the labor market and start coming under the protection of  the social security system. This means governments will be able  to stop using production incentives to guarantee the income  levels of that population group.    To Pedro de Camargo Neto, president of the Brazilian Rural  Association (SRB), Brazilian farmers have little to be  enthusiastic about. He says an illusion was created that great  changes were about to occur, but it did not prove true.    Throughout the entire Uruguay Round, Brazil was the country  most often targeted in complaints to the GATT about unfair trade  practices. "When we tried to levy compensatory duties on imports  of European milk powder we could not. They argued that we had  not followed the right procedure," he said. Brazil failed in its  attempt to prove that European milk was subsidized, and the  issued ended up in arbitration.    According to the SRB president, the developed countries'  policy of unloading stocks on the world market wrecks prices and  hurts the poor countries. "Brazil's praiseworthy effort to try  to develop an economic activity that other countries already  have, such as dairy cattle, was ignored," he said. Camargo Neto  believes "Europe's agricultural policies are so complex that it  is possible to control surplus production and guarantee farm  income without subsidizing exports."    Camargo Neto emphasized, however, that Brazilian  agriculture's main problem is still right here within our  boundaries. He says that traditionally, there has been an  illusion that inflation could be ended by importing food and  other raw materials. "So we killed off domestic production of  wheat and cotton, and dealt livestock a serious setback."    In the case of cotton, for example, high volumes of imports  have drastically reduced domestic production. In 1985, Brazil  produced 970,000 tons of product, but this year the harvest is  not expected to exceed 400,000 tons.    Brazil's lag in the textile sector -- besides the deficit in  raw cotton production, insufficient investments rendered the  industrial plant obsolete -- will entail significant losses.  The country has only a 0.8 percent share of the world textiles  market, a market that is likely to expand by 60 percent between  now and the year 2005. During the same period, the expansion of  the fabrics sector should be about 34 percent, according to  figures cited by Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero.  <H5>  Textile Trade Liberalization </H5>   Textiles is one of the areas of world trade that is expected  to show the most growth in the coming years, according to recent  studies by the GATT. But that growth, which may be of particular  benefit to developing countries -- Brazil among them -- will  depend on progress in dismantling the Multifibers Agreement.    Multifibers is an agreement under which the developed  countries set quotas that are filled by exporter countries,  mostly developing countries. The first attempt to liberalize  world trade in this area was made during the Uruguay Round of  the GATT, which began in 1986 and ended last April, when 111  countries signed the final act in Marrakech.    India's permanent representative to the GATT, Ambassador  B.K.  Zutshi, explained yesterday during a lecture at the "New World  Trade Map" seminar that the Multifibers agreement is supposed to  be dismantled over a 10-year period. The liberalization is  divided into three phases. The first phase is supposed to begin  on 1 January 1995, when the countries are supposed to free up  imports equivalent to at least 16 percent, by volume, of their  1990 imports. This means those products will start being  governed by GATT rules.    In phase two, which is supposed to start on 1 January 1998,  the minimum percentage of products to be liberated rises to 17  percent in terms of 1990 volume. On 1 January 2002, this  percentage goes up to 18 percent, and by 1 January 2005, all  textile products must be integrated into GATT rules.    The implementation of this agreement, however, would follow  that timetable [only] if the World Trade Organization, the  entity that will replace the GATT, enters into force in January  1995.    The impact on exports from producer countries will also  probably be limited during the first five to six years,  according to the Indian ambassador. He said the agreement does  not require that, during this initial period, importer countries  must liberate precisely those products that are now under quota.  "I am assuming that the importer countries will not remove the  products from the quotas until the end of the process, and so  the impact on exports from producer countries will only occur in  the long term," he stated.    Furthermore, Zutshi observed that textile manufacturers in  the United States and the European Union are already mobilizing  to try to delay the timetable for a more open market. Some  organizations have even asked to have the start of the process  postponed from January 1995 to July 1995.    The outlook in Brazil gives cause for concern, said Finance  Minister Rubens Ricupero: "This is an area where Brazil lost  competitiveness. It invested too little and did little  renovation."    Brazilian businessmen are also worried. "Brazil is now more  open than the United States and the European Union," said the  financial vice president of Northern Minas Fabrics Company  (Coteminas), Gomes da Silva, who also attended the seminar. He  deplored the acceleration of the process of opening up the  textile market that started in 1990, at the beginning of the  Collor administration. "We had negotiated a gradual  liberalization during the Sarney government, to give the  industry time to get ready. Collor came along and accelerated  the process. That is a reality now."    Gomes da Silva cited Brazil's advantages in terms of climate  and energy. "Our production costs are low, despite high payroll  levies." He believes that if the government reduces the tax load  on the sector, Brazil may be able to increase its share of the  world textile market. "In 1992, world textile trade amounted to  $240 billion. That market was bigger than the automobile market.  Brazil, however, accounted for only 0.8 percent of that market."  <H5>  TRIPS Agreement </H5>   The agreement on intellectual property (Trade-Related  Intellectual Property Rights--TRIPS) approved during the Uruguay  Round of the GATT will be useful to countries like India and  Brazil, which have "a large reserve of scientific talent,"  Ambassador B.K. Zutshi, India's permanent representative to the  GATT, said yesterday. These two countries, which most fervently  opposed the inclusion of the new topic in the GATT realm, out of  fear of future sanctions from the developed countries,  especially the United States, now see opportunities under the  new accord, even though Zutshi believes that "the integration of  intellectual property rights into international economic  legislation puts a heavy onus on the developing countries."    The principal novelties the TRIPS agreement introduces are:     -  Copyright [preceding word in English]: countries that  signed the Uruguay Round will be required to follow Berne  Convention rules for protection of artistic and literary works  (last updated in 1971).    -  Computer programs (software): these will  be protected like literary works, in the same way as  "copyright."    -  Trademarks: the GATT agreement stipulates that  marks that are well-known in a given country should be given  additional protection.    -  Geographic indications (appellations of  origin): the agreement says countries should not use geographic  names that deceive consumers by leading them to believe that a  product originates in a certain country. Exceptions will be made  for names that have already become generic, probably the case  with "champagne."    -  Industrial designs: will be protected for a  10-year period.    -  Patents: this was the most controversial of the  intellectual property issues discussed in the Uruguay Round. The  TRIPS agreement grants 20-year protection on patents, whether on  processes or products, in all fields of technology. The  agreement excludes the following from the obligation to patent:  therapeutic, surgical, and diagnostic methods; and plants and  animals except microorganisms. Plant varieties, however, will be  protected either by patents or by a unique system such as the  one described in the "Upov Convention" that protects persons who  improve seeds, for example.    -  Layout and integrated circuits: the  agreement provides that protection in both cases will be  provided on the basis of the May 1989 Treaty of Washington on  integrated circuits. Protection will be granted for a minimum of  10 years.    -  Layout [preceding word in English] and integrated  circuits: the agreement provides that in both cases protection  will be accorded on the basis of the May 1989 Treaty of  Washington on integrated circuits. Protection will be granted  for periods of at least 10 years.    -  Trade secrets and "knowhow"  that has commercial value must be protected.    -  Oversight: The  TRIPS agreement sets up a council to monitor the operations.  There will also be a disputes resolution mechanism to hear  litigation in the intellectual property area.    -  Deadlines for  implementing the agreement: one year of transition for developed  countries, and five years for developing countries and economies  in transition. Those countries will have almost 11 years in  which to implement intellectual property laws containing the  provisions approved in the Uruguay Round. In the case of  pharmaceuticals and chemicals products, however, developing  countries must start accepting applications at the beginning of  the transition period.        Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who yesterday attended the  "New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this newspaper,  emphasized that "the benefits" of the incorporation of  intellectual property subject matter into the GATT have not been  clearly proven from the standpoint of the developing countries,  but they at least served "to cool off bilateral pressures from  the major partners, especially as regards patents and copyright  aspects. It is possible that the agreement will make it easier  for developing countries to gain access to advanced technology,  but that will depend on the political willingness of the  governments of the developing countries," he said.    Amorim recalled that the government has been trying hard to  get the Congress to pass the substitute industrial property  bill, now in the Senate, by 15 June -- the deadline stipulated  in talks with the United States. But the minister emphasized  that Congress is a sovereign power.    Francisco Teixeira, executive vice president of Interfarma,  which represents 39 foreign pharmaceutical laboratories in  Brazil, is optimistic that the substitute bill will be approved  in the Senate by the 15th. He expects, however, that the bill  will not return to the Chamber, which means passage will be  delayed. In general, the multinational laboratories are  satisfied with the provisions approved in the GATT.    The Brazilian government did not submit an amendment to the  Senate that deals with this subject, but promised the  international community it would consult the World Trade  Organization.    If the consultation authorizes nonprohibition of imports,  Brazil will have to implement that provision by 1996, Teixeira  explained. The multinational laboratories are also satisfied  because Brazil will ban parallel importation, thus preserving  the rights of the patentholders in their countries of origin.  <H5>  GATT Helps Expand Trade </H5>   The expansion in international trade that it is hoped will  accompany implementation of (GATT) Uruguay Round measures will  bring trade benefits and business opportunities to various  Brazilian production sectors. Chief among these are agribusiness  and mines and metals, including steel, in which Brazil is quite  competitive.    In the opinion of businessman Roberto Giannetti da Fonseca,  president of Silex Trading S.A., one of the members of the panel  on "Business Opportunities Resulting from the Uruguay Round,"  Brazilian businessmen do, however, need to improve their  performance by investing more money in modern technologies so as  to be able to compete. He mentioned, for example, agribusiness  products such as fruits and the commodities (soybeans, cacao,  coffee) that compete strongly with [as published] the United  States. These will need heavier investment in genetic  technologies and soil fertility.    Fonseca also pointed out the need for the Brazilian  Government to decide on an industrial policy in order to outline  the production priorities for its domestic companies, both on  the internal market, where they compete with imported goods --  now facilitated by the economic "opening," -- and on foreign  markets, where competition is stiff and demands a high degree of  competitiveness in order to be able to make sales.    If Brazil is to obtain the new business opportunities that  will be created in world trade, the businessman noted, it needs  to assume the role of "global trader," even if timidly, although  it is a nation with a vocation for international markets. "This  country has one of the best foreign trade structures, quite  diversified and well-balanced with the major trading blocs, the  United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America," but it is still  one of the world's most closed economies, with annual trade  representing only 10 to 12 percent of its GDP." According to  Giannetti, that index could be expanded to 15 or 20 percent by  the end of the decade.    Giannetti did, however, express concern about the continuity  of the application of antidumping laws by the developed  countries, despite their being defined in the Uruguay Round.  "They have not been applied consistently, thus inhibiting  Brazilian exports and new investments in products designed for  the foreign market," he observed.    In the opinion of Ambassador K. Kesavapany, Singapore's  representative to the GATT, no country is completely satisfied  with the final results of the Uruguay Round, not even the  developed countries like the United States. However, seven and a  half years of negotiations led to several agreements that favor  the expansion of business in various industrial sectors. In his  speech at the international seminar, he emphasized ease of  access to industrial products by companies all over the world,  because of the reduction of tariff levels -- such as in  textiles, apparel, and farm products -- in addition to the  opening, for the first time, of the services sector to foreign  companies.    According to Kesavapany, the tariff reduction alone is  expected to boost world income by about $212 to $274 billion.  That benefit, however, will not be shared equally: 65 percent of  it will be realized by Japan, the United States, and Europe.  <H5>  Export Subsidies Scored </H5>   Despite fighting vigorously against incentives granted to  the  agricultural sector by the developed countries, Brazil still  follows a policy of minimum price supports for products in the  "basic market basket" that, indirectly, also generates subsidies.    "But it is this policy that guarantees that the government  will buy up [excess] inventory. This is a food security policy,  a consumer protection policy," Pedro de Camargo Neto, president  of the Brazilian Rural Association (SRB) retorted yesterday,  during the "New World Trade Map" seminar sponsored by this  newspaper. "I am not a unilateral defender of the minimum price  policy, which is an issue that is also being debated within the  realm of Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. It is  undeniable, however, that it leads to increases in production  and the buildup of inventories," he pointed out.    The problem, Camargo Neto added, is the export subsidies.  "These are indefensible. There is no reason to applaud a 21  percent reduction in these subsidies. It is, in fact, a 79  percent injustice. It means permitting that, for the sake of  simplicity and economy of the strong powers in terms of their  internal policies, a large part of the world will still have to  wait, perhaps as long as six years, before it can grow," he  stated.    The president of the SRB acknowledged that a good part of  the  difficulties encountered by Brazilian agriculture are the result  of a failure to invest, particularly in the case of livestock.  But, he said, that is changing. "The figure of the winter  herdsman [invernista] , for example, who used to buy  cattle to fatten them on grass and then sell them, is becoming  extinct. Productivity increase programs, like that of the very  young steers novilho precoce, are springing up every  day. Brazilian grain producers have now achieved higher yields  than their counterparts in the developed nations."</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Reserve Bank of India announces loans package The Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank, yesterday announced an Rs10bn (Pounds 226m) loans package to promote growth, R C Murthy reports from Bombay. The bank is channelling loans worth Rs4bn to farming, mainly for machinery, and Rs6bn for purchases of heavy vehicles to ease a slump in engineering. While the bank expects overall economic growth to reach about 4 per cent in the year to June 1993, it is worried this relies heavily on exceptional expansion in agriculture, while other industry remains stagnant.</p>

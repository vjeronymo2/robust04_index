			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY MEXICO IS SO ANGRY  </P> <P> It's not surprising that the Drug Enforcement Administration would pull out all  the stops to get the thugs who killed DEA agent Enrique Camarena near  Guadalajara in 1985. But the latest indictments in that painful case are sure  to put new stress on U.S.-Mexican relations.  </P> <P> The Justice Department revealed this week that a grand jury in Los Angeles has  indicted, along with 17 other persons, the former head of Mexico's equivalent  to the FBI, Manuel Ibarra Herrera, and the former director of Interpol in  Mexico, Miguel Aldana Ibarra, as accessories to the Camarena killing. This  despite the fact that 12 key figures in the case have already been prosecuted  and jailed in Mexico. The two former lawmen are the highest-ranking Mexicans to  be charged with involvement in the murder -- and that ups the ante in the long  and often testy standoff between Washington and Mexico City over the Camarena  case.  </P> <P> U.S. investigators have never made a secret of the fact that they believe the  drug kingpins who murdered Camarena were linked to Mexican police officials.  The controversy over a recent television movie that purported -- in a fiction  format -- to document the Camarena killing was only the latest instance of the  case's causing a flap between the two governments. But by actually indicting  former top Mexican cops, the U.S. government is putting its suspicions on the  record. And handing over suspects as politically well-connected as Ibarra and  Aldana may be asking too much of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is about as  friendly a president as Washington has dealt with in Mexico for a long time.  Surrendering car thieves is one thing; giving up appointees of a former Mexican  president is quite another.  </P> <P> So maybe the best that can be hoped for now is that this festering sore in  U.S.-Mexico relations does not infect trade relations, environmental issues and  other important areas for the two countries. Ever since Salinas, a Harvard  graduate, and George Bush, a Texan with close ties to Mexico, became presidents  of their respective countries, people like U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John  Negroponte have been talking about a "new maturity" in relations between the  two nations. The latest development in the Camarena case will test just how  mature that relationship really is.  </P></p>

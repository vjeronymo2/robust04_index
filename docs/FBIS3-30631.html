			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Rados Smilkovic, charge </F> d'affaires at Yugoslav Embassy in Sofia, by Vulko Vulkov and  Albena Shkodrova; place and date not given: "The Serbs Have  Nothing Against What Is Good for the Bulgarians"]    [Excerpts] [STANDART NEWS] Now that the UN Security Council  has granted permission for convoys of trucks to ship Bulgarian  goods through the FRY, do you think it is possible that public  organizations like "New Byzantium" and "White Rose" may appear  and block the convoys? What does Serbian public opinion think  about the shipment of Bulgarian goods?    [Smilkovic] I have no reports on anyone wanting to block the  transit of Bulgarian goods. As far as the Serbian people are  concerned, I can say that have nothing against anything that is  to the benefit of the Bulgarians. We know that the  transshipment of these goods is of vital importance for you.    However, it is difficult for me to say whether some  organization may appear that wants to block the convoys.  Nevertheless, public opinion in Yugoslavia is in favor of  Bulgaria shipping its goods. [passage omitted]    [STANDART NEWS] If the conflict in Bosnia dies down, do you  think that the FRY will undertake operations in Kosovo and  Macedonia?    [Smilkovic] Kosovo is part of Serbia, and the problem is an  internal one, of concern only to the FRY. It is being resolved  according to the Constitution and the laws of Yugoslavia and the  Republic of Serbia, while, of course, observing world standards  regarding minority rights.    As for Macedonia, it is an independent state. In the SFRY it  had the status of a republic, just like the other republics, and  this was never disputed. We have never opposed the notion that  the Macedonians are a nation and, most important, the Serbian  people have never disputed this either.    Thus, the issue of the recognition of Macedonia as a  separate  state and of the Macedonians as a separate nation is not a  matter of dispute for the Serbian public.    Regarding the actual act of recognition, this is an issue of  practical politics that will be settled when it arises on the  agenda. In general, the recognition of the former Yugoslav  republics has been postponed until such a time as all the issues  between them and the FRY are settled. [passage omitted]    [STANDART NEWS] Does this mean that you consider that there  are no obstacles to Serbia recognizing Macedonia, if we leave  aside the war between Serbia and Bosnia, which is delaying this?    [Smilkovic] In the first place, the FRY has not been in a  state of war with Bosnia. As regards Macedonia, I have even  gone further than what I know as an official representative of  my country, because I am well acquainted with the view of the  Serbian people.    [STANDART NEWS] We are not sure whether we have understood  you correctly. Are you asserting that in essence there are no  obstacles to Serbia recognizing Macedonia?    [Smilkovic] I have already given a straight answer to this  question, and I repeat: Yugoslavia and the peoples of Serbia  and Montenegro have no dispute concerning the Macedonians as a  nation and Macedonia as a state.    The issue of recognition is a political one and will be  decided when the time comes. At the moment, during these years,  Yugoslavia has many other urgent issues that have to be decided.    Furthermore, during the whole of the period of transition  since Yugoslavia began to split up, Belgrade has had the fewest  problems of all with Macedonia.    In essence, no unresolved problems exist here. [passage  omitted]    [STANDART NEWS] According to reports from Bulgarian  correspondents in Yugoslavia, the newspaper of the Bulgarian  minority in the Western Outlands [in Serbia], which resumed  publication with such a fuss, produced only two issues before  shutting down again. The appearance of the newspaper is  interpreted as part of the election campaign waged by the  official authorities. What is your comment on this?    [Smilkovic] Such an assessment is not based on facts and  sounds rather ill-intentioned. The difficulties with the  printing of the BRATSTVO ["Brotherhood"] newspaper, as in the  case of other newspapers, are primarily a result of the economic  situation. Unfortunately, the unjust UN sanctions are having a  negative effect on the press as well.    Apart from this, recently some of the Bulgarian mass media  have been politicizing the situation of the Bulgarian minority  in Yugoslavia. A problem is being artificially created. I am  surprised that this is happening at a moment when all the  citizens of the FRY are fighting to survive, because the unjust  UN sanctions that I mentioned are threatening the very basis of  human existence.    Incidentally, I know much more about the situation of this  minority than the others for the simple reason that I have many  friends among its representatives.    A few days ago I was in Bosilegrad. I wanted to ask how many  members of the Bulgarian minority hold positions in the leading  structures. However, I found there was no reason to ask,  because the membership of these leading structures was entirely  composed of Bulgarians. For example, every third person in  Dimitrovgrad has a post.    There are not many Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. They were not  numerous even when they entered the country. Nevertheless, they  have been preserved. Do you think that they would have remained  if anyone had been oppressing them?    Incidentally, as we are talking about this issue, do you  realize how bad the Bulgarians in Yugoslavia feel when someone  comes from Bulgaria and hands out aid only to them? I, for  example, would find it insulting to receive medicine or anything  else, while my neighbor gets nothing merely because he belongs  to another nationality. For this reason, individual efforts to  donate aid on a purely ethnic basis are unacceptable, because  such aid has no humanitarian purpose and can only cause harm.</p>

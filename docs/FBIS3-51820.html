			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Linda Hutchinson] </F>   [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 22 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad  and Tobago's Prime Minister Patrick Manning on Friday night  announced a mini cabinet reshuffle which saw additional  responsibilities for some senior ministers. The cabinet  reshuffle followed the resignation of Trade, Industry and  Tourism Minister Brian Kuei Tung who at the beginning of the  month said he wanted to pursue other career options.    In the reshuffle, Junior Finance Minister Ken Valley, who is  considered to be one of the most productive ministers in the  government, will now have additional responsibilities for trade  and industry. The local government ministry which was handled by  Valley was shifted to the minister of works and transport, Colm  Imbert. Finance Minister Wendell Mottley was given the  additional portfolio of the tourism ministry.    In addition, Manning announced the creation of a Ministry of  Social Development which will be handled by Senator Camille  Regis- Robinson, who will continue as minister in the office of  the prime minister.    In a wide-ranging address to the nation, in which he raised  concerns about the upsurge in violent crime and gave an up-date  about the state of the economy, Manning said in the rebuilding  of the country's economy, government has to devote time to the  details of tourism and agricultural promotion.    "As we make this shift, we found it necessary to make some  corresponding organisational adjustments in the government," he  said. "Mr Brian Kuei Tung, the minister of trade, industry and  tourism leaves the government (on Friday). I would like to thank  him for the tremendous effort that he has exerted in the  discharge of his responsibilities over the last two years and to  wish him well in his new pursuits.    "In accordance with the government's priorities for the  development of the tourism sector in the context of job creation  and the need to accelerate the process of streamlining  administrative procedures to attract greater levels of  investment, there will now be a separate Ministry of Tourism."    Expressing concern about crime in the country, which he  described as "callous brutality," the prime minister announced  that from Monday, members of the Defence Force will be brought  out onto the streets on foot patrol.    "The government feels justified in taking this course of  action in the light of the anxiety of citizens over the  situation."    Manning also said that in seeking to make the operations of  the police more efficient, cabinet has accepted proposals which  envisage the establishment of a nine-person police service board  of management appointed by the president after consultation with  the government and opposition.    The minister of national security, the police service  commission, and the commissioner of police in recent times had  become embroiled in an issue involving the discipline of police  officers. Manning said that opposition leader Basdeo Panday was  informed of the proposal and government now awaits a reply. "The  board will have the authority to manage the police service and  to deal with the recruitment of all levels of police personnel  from the rank of constable to the rank of assistant  commissioner," said Manning.    "The commissioner of police will be responsible for the  discipline of officers in the ranks of constable to inspector.  The police service commission in this model will become an  appeal tribunal and will also have the power to discipline the  commissioner of police and deputy commissioners of police."    The proposal further envisages that both the police service  board of management and the police service commission will be  accountable to a committee of parliament.    "In addition to all of this, the proposals call for an  appointment of an inspector of police service whose  responsibility would be to keep the minister of national  security up-to-date on the performance of the police services,"  said Manning. He added that disciplinary proceedings could be  instituted against individuals in the service, based on reports  from the proposed inspector.    Speaking on the economy of the country, Manning described  1993 as being a "difficult year," which saw a double blow from  low oil prices and falling oil production, while an  unprecedented level of debt repayment had to be sustained.    "All of this translated into money worries which forced the  government to cut back expenditure in many areas," he said,  adding that through the sacrifice government had been able to  lay a solid foundation on which to build in 1994. He told the  nation that government was successful in diversifying the  economy away from the exclusive dependence on oil. He said that  in 1984, government's revenues were 42 percent dependent on oil,  while in 1993, it was only 27 percent dependent.    "So that unwelcome though the present oil prices are, we are  infinitely better able to sustain them than we are in 1984. Even  so, the repercussions of developments in the oil industry remain  too significant to be left to the vagaries of the international  oil market. Whereas we cannot control price, we have some  influence on our production," said Manning. He said government  has been working with several mulitlateral petroleum companies  in Trinidad and the local petroleum company to offset the fall  in oil prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] Karadzic's deadline for his butchers to enter Bihac  -- to capture the right bank of the Una River, that is -- runs  out today at noon. That is why his bloodthirsty butchers spent  the entire night charging and attacking at all the defense  lines. They attacked the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, Hasin Vrh,  Grabez. In many of these places hand-to-hand fighting  continues. Bad weather conditions are not deterring the Chetnik  artillery from further destroying civilian buildings, destroying  Bihac, [word indistinct], suburban districts, and Cazin.    [Words indistinct] that Fikret Abdic yesterday sent to  Tudjman, Karadzic, Milosevic, Boban, and his other superiors, to  urgently help his so-called army defend itself against the 5th  Corps. Obviously, (?he too) fears the growing awareness of the  people of Velika Kladusa.    This has been Mirza Sadikovic reporting for Radio Television  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The Ministry of Finance  decided Tuesday to scrap the regulation restricting an  individual's foreign currency holdings to 10,000 U.S. dollars  beginning June 1, setting no possession limit.    The Ministry, however, called on those who have over 50,000  dollars to report to the authorities, citing the need to have  correct information on the country's foreign currency reserves  for effective implementation of economic policies.    In another effort to internationalize the nation's economy,  the Ministry allowed businesses to use Korean won equivalent up  to 300,000 dollars, compared to the present limit of 100,000  dollars, in settling import, export and reinsurance accounts.    The Ministry also allowed businesses to spend Korean won in  settling freight and insurance accounts incurred through the  export and import of goods.</p>

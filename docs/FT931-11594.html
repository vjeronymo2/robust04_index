			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Second Marshall case opinion given - European Court The preliminary opinion in the second Marshall case was delivered last week. The case concerns compensation payments made under UK legislation for breaches of EC sex discrimination laws. The European Court has been asked to rule whether national limits on such compensation payments are lawful. In the first Marshall case, the court ruled that Miss Marshall was entitled to rely on the provisions of an EC directive in her action for wrongful dismissal on grounds of sex discrimination against her employers, Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority. Under the relevant UK legislation, the maximum compensation which could be paid to Miss Marshall at the time was Pounds 6,250. The Industrial Tribunal assessed her loss at Pounds 18,405, which included Pounds 7,710 in respect of interest. The Area Health Authority paid the capital sum, but appealed against the tribunal's award of interest. In his opinion Advocate-General Van Gervan rejected an argument put by the UK and Irish governments that the court should restrict itself to ruling on the question of the interest payable. He said the court should also consider the much wider point of a general compensation limit. In order to deal with this issue, it was necessary to decide the scope and content of the relevant EC law rights. The advocate-general found that the relevant provisions of EC law did give rise to rights which could be relied on by individuals in their national courts against member states and public authorities. These rights comprised not only the right to obtain an effective judicial remedy against sex discrimination, but also the right to obtain specific compensation, which had not previously been recognised by the court. Mr Van Gervan said national compensation limits were not, in themselves, unlawful, but that the compensation awarded had to be adequate in relation to the damage sustained. That did not mean that the compensation had to be equal to the damage. It was for the national court to assess the adequacy of the compensation in every case and remedies for breaches of Community law should be comparable to those for breaches of domestic law. The question of interest was divided into two: 'legal interest' - to compensate for any delays in the payment of the damages agreed by the national court - was due from the date of delivery of the national decision establishing the amount of compensation; and 'compensatory interest', which is a component of the compensation package, should form part of any award, otherwise that award would not be adequate in relation to the damage suffered and thus breach the Community rights of the individual concerned. C-271/91: M H Marshall v Southampton and South-West Hampshire Area Health Authority, Opinion delivered on 26 January 1993. Discriminatory tax treatment not unlawful. In a case involving tax benefits in Germany, the ECJ found that national tax rules, which made certain tax allowances dependant on the German residence of the taxpayer, were not contrary to the provisions of the Rome Treaty dealing with establishment rights and the rules against discrimination. C-112/91: Hans Werner v Finanzamt Aachen-Innenstadt, ECJ FC 26 January 1993. Preliminary references to the European Court. The European Court gave a salutary reminder last week to national courts wishing to refer preliminary questions to the ECJ. An Italian court had referred two questions to the ECJ for preliminary ruling concerning broadcasting restrictions and their compatibility with EC competition law. However, the questions were, according to the court, so laconic and lacking in precision that it was impossible to identify the questions to be answered. The court stated that it was the duty of the national court to identify the factual and legal framework within which questions for preliminary ruling were raised. As this had not been carried out by the Italian court, the ECJ could not answer the questions referred. Joined cases C-320/90, C-321/90 and C-322/90: Telemarsicabruzzo SpA and others v Circostel, Ministero delle Poste e Telecommunicazioni et Ministero della Difesa, ECJ FC, 26 January 1993.</p>

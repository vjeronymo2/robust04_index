			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Subpart 917.71 is deleted to remove obsolete coverage addressing Special Research Contracts with Educational Institutions. This type of contract has not been used by DOE for several years, and, pursuant to FAR 1.302, continued DEAR coverage is neither appropriate nor necessary to satisfy the specific needs of the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Subsection 919.705&hyph;2, paragraph (a), fourth sentence is revised to remove the reference to special research contracts, which are no longer used by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Subparts 936.70 and 936.73 are deleted to remove obsolete coverage addressing Rental of Construction Equipment and the Outline for Equipment Rental Agreement. These procedures have not been used by DOE for several years, and, pursuant to FAR 1.302, continued DEAR coverage is neither appropriate nor necessary to satisfy the specific needs of the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Section 943.301 is amended to remove language that is duplicative of FAR coverage addressing the use of Standard Form 30 for the deobligation of contract funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Subpart 952.1 is deleted to remove language addressing the incorporation of provisions and clauses by reference. The appropriate guidance is contained in the FAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Subsection 952.212&hyph;72 is revised to delete a reference to special research contracts, which are no longer used by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Subsection 952.215&hyph;70 is deleted to remove language addressing subcontractor representations and certifications. The appropriate guidance is contained in the FAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Subsection 970.0404&hyph;4(a)(3) is deleted to remove the requirement to include clause 970.5204&hyph;34, Sensitive Foreign Nations Control, in management and operating contracts. This clause applies solely to unclassified research contracts that may involve making unclassified information about nuclear technology available to certain sensitive foreign nations, and not to management and operating contracts which encompass broader missions than those contained in unclassified research contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Section 970.2272 is amended to remove obsolete language addressing conflict of interest policies for management and operating contracts with colleges and universities. The referenced ``Policy of the Federal Council for Science and Technology Relating to Conflicts of Interest by Staff Members of Colleges and Universities'' is no longer utilized by DOE, and, pursuant to FAR 1.302, continued DEAR coverage is neither appropriate nor necessary to satisfy the specific needs of the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;12 is amended to clarify the prescription for use of alternate language in the clause which addresses the responsibility of management and operating contractors for the conduct of their employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;34 is deleted to remove the requirement to include clause 970.5204&hyph;34, Sensitive Foreign Nations Control, in Management and Operating contracts. The clause does not apply to these contracts, as identified in the change to Subsection 970.0404&hyph;4(a)(3) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Subsection 970.5204&hyph;35 is amended to include a reference to Department of Energy Order 1240.2, Unclassified Visits and Assignments by Foreign Nationals, which had been omitted from the clause language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These amendments were announced in a notice of proposed rulemaking in the December 2, 1993,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 63553). DOE invited interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views or arguments with respect to the DEAR amendments set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking. The public comment period closed on January 31, 1994, a period of 60 days. During that period, no comments were received; however, comments were received from one interested party after the closing date and were subsequently considered by DOE prior to issuing this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments addressed DEAR 952.215&hyph;70, Required subcontractor representations and certifications, stating that the DEAR coverage did not recognize the dollar thresholds identified in the FAR for applicability of the representations and certifications to subcontractors. After review of these comments and the guidance contained in DEAR 952.215&hyph;70, it was determined that the requirements contained in FAR do not need supplementary coverage in the DEAR. Therefore, DEAR 952.215&hyph;70 will be deleted. Additionally, subsections 914.201&hyph;5(b) and 915.406&hyph;5(d) are deleted to remove the prescriptions for including this solicitation provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulatory Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject to review, under that Executive Order, by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Review Under Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b), include eliminating drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key terms. DOE certifies that this rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates, tax policies or liabilities, the cost of goods or services, or other direct economic factors. It will also not have any indirect economic consequences such as changed construction rates. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed by this rule. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Review Under Executive Order 12612  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, entitled ``Federalism,'' 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. This rule will apply to States that contract with DOE; however, none of the revisions is substantive in nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DOE has concluded that this rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.) (1976) or the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 904, 905, 914, 915, 917, 919, 936, 943, 952, and 970  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government procurement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on May 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard H.

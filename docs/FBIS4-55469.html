			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "kob": "No New Meciar Government After </F> Elections"]    [Text] Bratislava--Slovak President Michal Kovac stated in  an interview with Austrian journalists that he does not believe  that Vladimir Meciar will succeed in forming a coalition after  the elections in October.    Kovac, who will be visiting Austria next week, declined to  answer the question of whether he would ask an election winner  Meciar to form a government: "I have not yet made a decision,"  he pointed out.    The relevant Slovak parties--the Party of the Democratic  Left  (SDL), the Democratic Union (DEUS), the Christian Democratic  Movement (KDH), and the Social Democrats--have already ruled out  a coalition with Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS). The parties that might support Meciar are not likely to  receive 5 percent of the vote. Also, the popularity of the HZDS  leader has declined, Kovac believes. "Up to 93 percent of the  population used to support him, but now the percentage has  dropped to 20-30 percent."    The Slovaks have gotten used to the coalition government and  have started appreciating its stabilizing effect and its  contribution to calming down the political climate. There are  only a few left who are concerned about the sovereignty of the  young state. At 4.2 percent, the economy has shrunk to a lesser  extent than expected. Inflation is "not that high" at 25.1  percent.    Asked about the Slovak nuclear power plants near the  Austrian  border, Kovac showed understanding for Austria's concerns,  stating that his country would also welcome a Central Europe  free of nuclear power plants. Nuclear energy is not the only  energy source in Slovakia, but "numerous things do not depend  only on Slovakia. Bohunice will be closed down in the year 2002.  Yet Mohovce will continue to operate."    Referring to the delicate issue of the Hungarian minority,  Kovac mentioned the agreements that have been concluded with the  Hungarian representatives on place-name signs in two languages  and on the right to bear a name. They do not apply to towns and  villages that date back to the Magyarization phase between 1876  and 1918 and to the period between 1939 and 1944. To eliminate  "insinuations" between Hungary and Slovakia, a treaty on the  inviolability of the borders is required. Slovakia expects  positive impulses from Austria's planned entry into the European  Union. "We hope we will become a neighboring country of the  European Union." Austria will certainly gather "valuable  experience" and pass it on to Slovakia, Kovac stressed.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** ROGER WATERS "THE WALL: LIVE IN BERLIN" MERCURY: ALBUMS ARE  RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Restaging "The Wall" with a cast of zillions last July in an undivided Berlin  was a grand gesture, but need we bother with another recording of the 1979  magnum opus Waters originally conceived for Pink Floyd?  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the answer is yes.  </P> <P> The recording is a logistical achievement that seamlessly blends orchestra,  choir, Waters' extremely effective rock band and a succession of guest singers  and soloists. While Cyndi Lauper misfires on "Another Brick in the Wall" and  Sinead O'Connor underplays her role on "Mother," many of the guest turns are  exceptional: a shockingly husky-voiced but haunting Joni Mitchell, aggressive  grit from Bryan Adams, Paul Carrack's graceful R&amp;B classicism and, above  all, Van Morrison's impassioned "Comfortably Numb."  </P> <P> Though repetitive, and short on pop aria compared to such standard-setting  programmatic rock works as "Arthur," "Tommy" or "Quadrophenia," "The Wall"  remains involving and gains thematic resonance from this performance's locus  (the Nazi fantasy sequence played in the heart of Berlin!). All in all, this  Berlin "Wall" stands up well to the test of any live album: Hearing it, you  wish you'd been there. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

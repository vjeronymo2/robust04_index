			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 519 of the NAHA requires that the Department notify each HA submitting a plan of HUD's approval or disapproval of the plan not later than thirty days after the Department receives the plan. This requirement is set forth in &sect;&sect;905.308(c)(3) and 960.505(c) of the rule. Plan approval by the Department constitutes granting of the exemption from eligibility requirements that would otherwise apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received 11 comments on the proposed rule. The commenters consisted of housing agencies and one professional association. All commenters expressed general support for the Department's proposed implementation of section 519 of NAHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The main criticism of the proposed rule focused on loss of income due to the exclusion of units occupied by police officers from the Performance Funding System (PFS) formula. The proposed rule stated that dwelling units allocated to police officers in accordance with this subpart would be excluded from the total unit months available, as defined in 24 CFR 905.102 for IHAs and 24 CFR 990.102 for PHAs. For purposes of the operating subsidy under the PFS, the full amount of any rent paid by Officers in accordance with this rule is included in other income, as defined in &sect;&sect;905.102 and 990.102. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To make the most of its resources, the Department has consistently limited funding under the PFS to units that house low income families. Units used for other purposes, such as day care facilities or resident organization offices, are excluded from PFS. The Department currently permits the payment of operating subsidy for one non-dwelling unit per development that is used to promote economic self-sufficiency services or anti-drug programs. Anti-drug activities directly related to ridding developments of illegal drugs and drug-related activities include housing police and security officers. HA requests to allow consideration for the continued payment of operating subsidy for one unit per housing development used to support these activities may be submitted to the local HUD Field Office for review and approval. Operating subsidy for additional sites per housing development can only be approved by HUD Headquarters. This provision is added in &sect;&sect;905.308(f) and 960.511(b) of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were also directed at the Allocation Table, which set forth a formula for determining number of units within each housing development for residency by police officers. The comments indicated that the table was too rigid and failed to take into consideration local conditions. Since the local HUD Field Office is responsible for final decision-making in this area, local public safety factors must be evaluated by Field Office staff in making decisions regarding unit allocation. An HA must certify, however, that any additional units proposed to be allocated for Officers are vacant units for which there are no Eligible Families. No resident may be moved from a unit to make it available for occupancy by an Officer under the plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The balance of comments concerned issues on HUD Field Office approval of HA rents, alternative lease arrangements, and police responsibilities in lieu of rental payment. These are addressed as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment questioned why the local HUD Field Office should have the discretion to approve or deny the amount of rent to be paid by police officers. While the rule provides latitude to impose a ``reasonable rent'' on police officers, the Field Office is familiar with local market conditions and can make a prudent determination regarding rent to be charged. In addition, the Field Office has major oversight responsibility for the day-to-day operation of HAs, and should provide guidance in this area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment questioned why a ``memorandum of understanding'' cannot be used in lieu of a lease since the agreement could be considered a special service contract between the HA and the Officer. The overall intent of the rule focuses on police visability in HA developments. Since police officers will occupy units operated and managed by an HA as residents, a formal lease should be utilized. It may, however, be modified to meet special needs of the HA and the police officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed G.Dz.: "More Than 600,000 Unemployed Until </F> 1998"]    [Text] The Planning Office has updated its 1994-1998  forecasts according to the overall economic plan. It forecasts  a gradual recovery with 1.3 percent growth in the Belgian  economy this year and growth of 2.5 percent in the following  years (2.5 percent in 1995, 2.6 percent in 1996 and 1997, and  2.7 percent in 1998). There will be a gradual improvement  thanks to the recovery in Europe and better prospects for  domestic demand despite the negative effects of the overall plan  on household incomes.    The latter should drop by 0.3 percent this year and only  experience limited growth until 1996. The Office estimates that  there will be a gradual fall in the present high rate of savings  and hence a revival of consumption; the announced drop in  interest rates makes investments less attractive and the gradual  restoration of a climate of confidence, linked to a more  favorable economic environment, makes precautionary reserves of  saving less vital.    Inflation will remain below 3 percent (2.9 percent in 1994,  2.5 percent in 1995, 2.4 percent in 1996, 2.6 percent in 1997  and 1998). The public finances deficit (central state) will be  reduced to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1994, 5.5 percent in 1995, 4.7  percent in 1996, 4.3 percent in 1997, and 3.7 percent in 1998).    The Planning Office thinks that one of the most positive  results of the overall plan is to achieve both an improvement in  social security finances and the net creation of jobs in the  medium term.    In 1994, more than 20,000 jobs will be lost (a total of  622,000 unemployed); the stabilization of the unemployment rate  will come in 1995 thanks to job creation in the enterprises.  There will still be 622,000 unemployed in 1998, in other words  14.2 percent of the working population (Planning Office  definition).    The overall plan should contribute to this "positive"  development. Of the 59,000 private jobs created from 1994 to  1998, wage restraint would contribute to 20,000, reductions in  contributions and employment promotion would contribute to  28,000, economic growth would contribute to 26,000. Conversely,  measures to improve social security finances and tax increases  would lead to 15,000 job losses. It is the sector of market  services which would increase; in all others, aside from  construction, employment would fall. A decrease in jobs in  public administrative departments should also be noted  (especially in national defense): 600,000 employees in 1998 as  against 661,000 in 1990.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Msgr. Augusto Vargas Alzamora, the Lima  archbishop and Peruvian primate, yesterday harshly criticized  the lack of independence enjoyed by the judicial branch and  urged magistrates to act according to their conscience and not  yield to any form of alien pressure and not rule according to  the circumstances. He also urged them to step up their  investigations to determine whether those brought before the  court are guilty or not.    Vargas Alzamora gave a news conference after the Easter  Sunday mass in the Lima Cathedral. He indirectly referred to  the Goldman report disclosed last Thursday, 31 March, in  Washington which criticizes the reform of the judicial branch  following the self-styled coup staged by President Alberto  Fujimori on 5 April 1992.    Vargas Alzamora told LA REPUBLICA: "It would be fatal for  the  country if the judicial branch did not enjoy independence." He  recalled that the commission of international jurists headed by  U.S. law professor Robert Goldman referred to serious  deficiencies in the administration of justice in Peru and  recalled that it recommended the elimination of the faceless  judges and a substantial amendment of the antiterrorist laws  that had allowed the sentencing of innocent people.    During his usual meeting with the media in the main hall of  the Lima archbishopric, Vargas Alzamora said: "The only thing I  can tell the judges is to be loyal to their conscience, do not  yield to any pressure, and do not condemn those being tried for  circumstantial reasons. I urge them, from the bottom of my  heart, to exhaustively investigate cases and prove that the  charges are legitimate. The contrary would be fatal to the  country." [passage omitted]</p>

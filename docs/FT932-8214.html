			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Balladur leads in presidency poll MR EDOUARD Balladur, the French prime minister, has suddenly become the most favoured candidate to succeed President Francois Mitterrand if an election were held now, the second opinion poll in a week showed on yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. The polls are potentially worrying for Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac, the right's long-standing frontrunner, although Mr Balladur has said he has no intention of running against his longtime mentor. A poll by IFOP for the news magazine L'Express said Mr Balladur would score 37.5 per cent if he stood as Gaullist candidate in the first round of a presidential election pitting him against six other likely contenders. Runner-up was Socialist Michel Rocard with 23.5 per cent. Mr Balladur would beat Mr Rocard 62.5 per cent to 37.5 per cent in a run-off second round, the poll showed. Mr Chirac is the official presidential candidate of the Rally for the Republic (RPR) party in 1995 when Mr Mitterrand's term ends. Mr Balladur is an RPR member. The Express poll showed Mr Chirac would score less than Mr Balladur if he stood as Gaullist candidate, though he too would beat Mr Rocard by 57.5 per cent to 42.5 per cent in a run-off. Mr Chirac picked Mr Balladur, his finance minister from 1986-88, for the premiership, saying he did not want to serve under Mr Mitterrand again. L'Express said his calculation was that his protege's popularity honeymoon would inevitably end by 1995 because of difficult international economic conditions. By staying in the background, Mr Chirac felt he could keep control over Mr Balladur and the government's action while maintaining his popularity.</p>

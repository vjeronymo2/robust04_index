			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts of the Work Report of the Jiangsu Provincial </F> People's Higher People's Court Delivered by President Li Peiyou  to the Second Session of the Eighth Jiangsu Provincial People's  Congress on 27 February 1994"]    [Text] Fellow deputies:    In 1993, under the leadership of their party committee and  the supervision of the people's congress, and overseen and  guided by the Supreme People's Court, courts at all levels in  the province persistently used Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress as their guide,  implemented the party's basic line, centered their work on  economic construction, and played their adjudication role. As a  result, major progress was achieved in various fields of work.  A total of 222,080 cases were tried and concluded in the year,  an increase of 11.01 percent over the previous year; of which,  1,932 cases were concluded by the provincial higher people's  court, up 10.34 percent. They played their due role in  safeguarding social stability, promoting the struggle against  corruption, and serving the interests of reform, opening up, and  the establishment of a socialist market economy. The following  is a report on major aspects of their work for your examination  and deliberation:  <H5>  1. Firmly Implementing the Policy of Dealing Heavy Blows to </H5> Serious Crimes, Safeguarding Social Stability, and Cracking Down  on Corruption To Create a Fine Environment for Reform, Opening  up, and Economic Construction    For the past year, Jiangsu's situation in public order was  stable. However, there were still factors threatening social  stability and affecting economic development. Serious criminal  offenses rose, major serious cases became more prominent, and  social evils spread despite repeated bans. In light of this,  courts at all levels consistently regarded the struggle against  serious crimes as their primary task, made full use of their  functions of dictatorship [zhuan zheng 1413 2398], and promptly  launched intensive efforts to deal heavy blows to serious crimes  and special drives to improve public order. A total of 23,331  criminal cases of first instance was received during the year,  22,066 cases were concluded, and 26,807 criminals were  sentenced, roughly the same as the previous year. Of the  convicted, 2,647 were sentenced to prison terms of more than 10  years, life imprisonment, or death (including death with  reprieve), up 3.64 percent over the previous year. This  satisfied the demand to impose stricter sentences in accordance  with the law. Courts also stepped up their efforts to target  their campaign against prominent problems in public order.  Particularly beginning last June, they swiftly implemented the  guidelines of the third meeting of the Central Commission on  Politics and Law and the provincial conference on judicial and  public security work and launched a concentrated attack on  serious crimes from June to September. A total of 7,045  criminal cases endangering public order were tried and concluded  in accordance with the law, and 8,666 criminals were convicted.  Of the convicts, 499 were given sentences heavier than life  imprisonment. Special efforts were made to crack down on major  targets. During the four months, 4,409 culprits of serious  crimes were punished, including gangsters and thugs in the  transportation sector, key elements of criminal gangs,  murderers, robbers, rapists, major ruffians, kidnappers who  killed hostages, and major burglars. This effectively deflated  the swollen arrogance of criminal elements and curbed the  momentum of the outbreak of heinous crimes.    We decided to take investigating and handling major cases  as the breakthrough point in dealing heavy blows to serious  economic crimes and in promoting the deep-going development of  the anticorruption struggle. During the first half of the year,  the number of cases of economic crimes handled by people's  courts declined by 51.14 percent compared with the same period  in the previous year. Following the major arrangements made by  the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee  on launching struggles against corruption, people's courts at  various levels stressed cracking down on economic crimes in the  struggle against corruption. Taking the trial of major cases as  the breakthrough point, people's courts strengthened efforts to  crack down on crimes. In the second half of last year, the  number of cases concluded increased significantly, increasing by  206 percent as compared with that of the first half of the year.  Various people's courts handled 1,753 cases of economic crimes  of various kinds; concluded the trial of 1,595 cases; and passed  sentence on 1,390 people, of which 21 were sentenced to life  imprisonment and death (including suspension of execution).  Various people's courts gave prominence to the trial of major  and serious cases of crimes in enforcing macrocontrol and  launching the anticorruption struggle, including cases of  bribery, embezzlement, and smuggling. In the whole year,  various people's courts handled 647 cases of serious economic  crimes, involving more than 10,000 yuan in each case, and  punished 672 people who received more than 10,000 yuan of  illegal income per person.    While punishing criminals, people's courts at various levels  also carried out the task of comprehensive management of social  order. They vigorously strengthened the trial of civil cases,  and concluded 98,684 cases of civil disputes in first instance,  of which marriage and family disputes accounted for 53.17  percent. They also made efforts to prevent aggravation of  contradictions, and handled 1,719 cases to transform  contradictions. They also strengthened the trial of  administrative cases to maintain social security and state  administrative order and to protect the lawful rights and  benefits of citizens and legal persons. People's courts  concluded the trial of 747 administative cases in the first  instance. They improved procedures to facilitate the people's  lodging complaints, seriously handled a large number of people's  letters and visits, and promptly handled 3,976 cases of  complaints lodged by the people. They actively handled cases of  mitigation of punishment and parole, including 8,957 cases of  mitigation of punishment and 892 cases of parole. Concerning  crimes committed by juveniles, they attached importance to  educating juveniles and handled 2,009 cases of crimes committed  by 2,787 juveniles. They invited 613 people from educational,  trade union, youth, and women's organizations to take part in  adjudication. They further strengthened the establishment of  juvenile courts. Thirteen peole's courts set up juvenile courts  to provide all-out judicial protection for juveniles.  <H5>  2. Employ the Function of Trial To Adjust Economic Relations </H5> and Serve Macrocontrol and the Establishment of a Socialsit  Market Economic Structure    Last year was a year of relatively fast economic development  in this province and also a year of change from the old to new  economic system. Using the function of adjudication to  strengthen the adjustment of economic relations was a prominent  task of the people's courts. Judging from the handling of  various economic cases in the whole province, there were three  special features: First, the number of cases related to the  market economy increased. Various people's courts handled 85,926  cases of economic disputes in the first instance, increasing by  27.53 percent as compared with the previous year. Of this, the  number of cases of disputes in procurement and marketing, loans  and rentals, contract operation of enterprises, leasing  operation of enterprises and compensatory trade contracts all  rose by more than 50 percent. Second, the amount of money  involved in those cases rose by a great extent. Various  people's courts concluded the trial of 75,672 cases of economic  disputes in the first instance, involving a total amount of  5.025 billion yuan or 156.12 percent more than the total amount  of money involved in those cases in the previous year. Third,  new types of cases emerged constantly. Those special features  and changes reflected the deepening of the reform of the  economic structure and the development of the socialist market  economy in this province.    Correct and prompt handling of cases closely related to  strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control ensured the  implementation of the policy of exercising macroeconomic  regulation and control. After the Central Committee issued its  Document No. 6 and after the provincial party committee held its  economic conference in mid-July, people's courts in Jiangsu  intensified their efforts in handling cases about macroeconomic  regulation and control. From July to the end of the year, they  finished examining 61,124 cases of this nature, including 21,074  cases of economic disputes involving 2.319 billion yuan.  People's courts especially intensified their efforts in  handling disputes over securities, stocks, fund raising, bills,  and loans -- problems occurring while putting banking operations  in order -- and particularly cases concerning loan liquidation  and collection, creditor's rights, and debts. People's courts  also assisted enterprises to liquidate debts and helped  enterprises, banks, and other units retrieve 1.033 billion yuan.    People's courts' efforts in regulating the market's economic  relations promoted the establishment of a socialist market  economic system. People's courts stopped illegitimate  competition through handling cases and protecting legitimate  competition. We also strictly dealt with cases of producing and  marketing counterfeit and inferior goods; censured infringement  of patent rights, registered trademarks, and copyright as well  as defamation of enterprises' reputation and names. We handled  a total of 363 cases of this nature. People's courts in Jiangsu  also intensified handling new cases occurring during the  formation and development of various forms of markets. Our  accomplishment in handling 5,078 cases concerning credit,  securities, bills, interbanking loans, technology-related  contracts, labor disputes, real estate, and other problems  occurring in the financial, labor, technology, information, and  real estate markets in 1993 expedited Jiangsu's market  development. We also intensified our efforts in handling cases  relevant to the replacement of state enterprises' operating  mechanisms and our accomplishment in handling 9,546 cases  concerning disputes over enterprises' contractual operations,  stock system, partnership, merger, lease, and sales pushed these  enterprises to the market. People's courts in Jiangsu also kept  pace with rural reforms and served rural economic development.  Our efforts in handling 34,303 cases on rural contracts,  disputes between village and town enterprises, and socialized  services in rural areas ensured the revitalization of all  economic sectors in rural areas. Earnestly implementing the  central policy of reducing peasants' burdens, we tried 9,736  cases about peasants' excessive burdens. Our efforts in handling  economic cases involving foreign nationals or countrymen in Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan facilitated the development of Jiangsu's  export-oriented economy. We accepted a total of 44 of these new  cases in 1994, or 38 more than those accepted in 1992. We fully  exercised our judicial jurisdiction and our impartial  arbitration protected the legitimate rights and interests of  both sides. Attaching great importance to handling disputes  among foreign-funded enterprises, we finished handling 444 cases  of this nature, which involved 106 million yuan. By doing this  we created a good judicial environment for foreign businessmen.  We also prompted the government to change its administrative  functions by actively proceeding with the handling of  administrative cases closely related to the market economy. We  finished handling 461 administrative cases regarding business  management, tax collection, banking management, urban  construction, foreign exchange control, and environmental  protection; and we supported administrative organs in  controlling and stopping unwarranted fee levies, prorations, and  fines as well as infringement of enterprises' operating autonomy.    We intensified law enforcement and made continual efforts in  enforcing verdicts that had been pronounced. In 1993, people's  courts at all levels enforced verdicts on 79,398 cases, or 86.32  percent of all verdicts. Not only was this 12.84 percentage  points higher than that a year ago as well as the highest in  recent years, but it also exceeded the 80 percent target. The  provincial higher people's court also intensified its efforts in  providing people's courts in Jiangsu with macroscopic guidance  and in coordinating the handling of major, complex, and  difficult cases. Thanks to support from local party committees,  people's congresses, and governments, people's courts in various  parts of Jiangsu launched joint or special campaigns of varying  sizes between regions, provinces, or cities to enforce verdicts;  and we also made constant efforts in exploring and improving  enforcement methods to improve enforcement efficiency.    3. Vigorously Explore Ways To Reform the Work of Law  Courts, Persist in Strict Law Enforcement, and Comprehensively  Raise Judicial Levels    In the face of conspicuous contradictions -- increasingly  heavy tasks, progressively increasing number of various cases  year after year, and a serious shortage of judicial personnel --  law courts at all levels vigorously explored ways to reform  methods of hearing civil and economic cases and to improve work  efficiency. Focusing attention on reforming court trials, they  further stressed a litigant's responsibility to produce  evidence, thereby shifting the focus of judicial activities from  a venue outside the court to the court and from conducting  investigations outside the court for verification of evidence to  producing and questioning evidence during trial. Many law  courts experimented with the method of directly opening a court  session after a case was placed on file in accordance with the  law; their experiment enabled our reform of judicial methods to  take a step forward.    The economic disputes mediation center enjoyed new  development of its work. Giving convenience to its clients by  doing a quick and highly efficient job, it solved 9,694 cases of  economic disputes involving a total amount of 1,237 million yuan  through mediation. The figures posted an increase of 209 and 363  percent, respectively, over the previous year. The mediation  center further improved its standardization.    Law courts at all levels further enhanced their  consciousness  of law enforcement, cultivated the mentality of "giving top  priority to quality," and strived to make every case they  handled pass the examination of history. In particular, they  made sure that all big, important cases they handled become  "iron [incontestable] cases." Sixty defendants in criminal cases  were pronounced not guilty in accordance with the law. They  insisted on conducting public trials; public trials of 97.94  percent of various cases were conducted by law courts across the  province. They further improved their internal mechanism for  law enforcement; established and improved various systems for  handling cases; and paid close attention to their  implementation. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court  drew up "Interim Provisions on Investigating and Determining the  Responsibility for Cases Which Have Been Given Wrong Verdicts."  The provisions played an important role in ensuring strict law  enforcement after they went into effect in the whole province.  A total of nine cases and nine persons were investigated for  handling cases in violation of the law in the whole year.    We strengthened supervision over court trials and improved  guidance for judicial work. When law courts at the higher level  discovered mistakes in the court decisions pronouced by those at  the lower level, they resolutely corrected them in accordance  with the law. In the whole year, law courts at the higher level  wound up a total of 11,086 various cases in the second instance;  they changed court decisions pronounced on 1,938 cases by those  at the lower level or requested that a trial be conducted again  for some of them. We conscientiously handled cases lodged by  procuratorial organs in protest of verdicts rendered, and  corrected verdicts which were indeed wrong in accordance with  the law. We wound up a total of 60 cases protesting verdicts  given, and changed the verdicts for 32 cases or requested that a  trial be conducted again for some of them. The Jiangsu  Provincial Higher People's Court persisted in conducting survey  and study of the new situations and new problems confronting  judicial work under the conditions of a market economy, and  improved job-related guidance for courts at the lower level. It  drew up a total of 13 various standardized documents suitable  for legal guidance.    4. Vigorously Strengthen the Building of the  Contingents of Personnel of Law Courts and Lay a Sound  Foundation in the Grass-Roots Units To Guarantee That Judicial  Work Is Carried Out Effectively    In compliance with the new requirements on the contingents  of  cadres raised by our reform and opening up and by the new  situation under a socialist market economy, people's courts at  all levels persisted in attaching equal importance to judicial  work and the building of their contingents of working personnel;  comprehensively enhanced the political integrity of cadres and  police and improved their professional quality; and achieved  marked successes in building their contingents of working  personnel. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court  commended 19 advanced collectives and 47 advanced individuals  throughout the year. Among them, 13 units earned a collective  award of merit, second class, and four individuals award of  merit, first class.    We improved ideological and political work by making  education in the theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics our central task. In particular, after the  publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping and the convocation of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Higher  People's Court issued a special circular on plans for study.  Law courts in the whole province looked upon the task as an  important one for building ideology and for theoretical  education and handled it accordingly; they implemented Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's basic thinking as well as the guidelines of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in  various court tasks by closely integrating their implementation  with the actual conditions of judicial work. They aggressively  launched the anticorruption drive to promote the building of a  clean and honest government. Law courts across the province  conscientiously carried out the plans adopted by the Second  Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the  Seventh Plenary Session of the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline  Inspection Commission, and the Supreme People's Court on  launching the anticorruption drive; conducted intensive study;  and checked up on efforts to put banking operations in order, to  help enterprises liquidate debts, to make corrections, and so  forth. In the second half of the year, we organized law courts  across the province to conduct a general inspection of law  enforcement and promotion of a clean and honest government with  the anticorruption drive playing the dominant role. While  urging law courts at all levels to conduct self-inspection and  to correct themselves, the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's  Court and all intermediate people's courts assigned a total of  110 persons to form inspection teams to check up on law courts  at two levels in 11 cities. The implementation of the "five  prohibitions" ruled by the central authorities and the "three  requirements" raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee  was made possible through the anticorruption drive and through  the general inspection of law enforcement and promotion of a  clean and honest government. The 61 enterprises run by law  courts in all areas already either had their business operating  licenses revoked or terminated their connection with law courts;  all 37 personnel who had bought and sold stocks completed the  procedures for the transfer of their stocks; the two persons who  had accepted money and negotiable securities worth a total of  1,600 yuan offered to them as a present returned what they had  taken; and money accepted from convicts as a pledge for their  probation and as fees for their exemption from re-education were  all returned. Law courts investigated and punished 34 cadres  and police who had violated the law and discipline.    We persisted in strict management of the court and  conscientiously changed our work style. After the first session  of the eighth provincial people's congress, the Provincial  People's Higher Court, based on the views and proposals put  forward by the people's deputies, promptly issued the "Circular  on Earnestly Drawing People's Deputies' Views To Further Improve  Judicial Work" to courts across the province, putting forward  solutions. In the light of views voiced during the re-election  of the people's congresses on judicial work, courts at all  levels unfolded widespread activities to strengthen and reform  their work as well as to rectify their work style to bring about  marked improvements in law enforcement and work style. Courts  in such cities as Yancheng, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and Lianyungang  took the initiative to support and cooperate with people's  deputies in their appraisal activities, earnestly examining and  rectifying themselves and implementing rectification and reform  measures one-by-one in accordance with the deputies' views.    We persisted in integrating academic education with  on-the-job training, strengthening the upbringing of qualified  judicial personnel proficient in the four areas of law,  economics, market, and foreign language. Over the past year, 36  more cadres obtained graduate or post-graduate degrees, 290  judicial personnel were awarded the legal profession certificate  of the part-time Law University under the court, raising the  provincial ratio of court cadres and policemen with  qualifications in higher education to 52 percent. We conducted  eight provincial on-the-job professional training courses,  training 748 key personnel from the judicial profession.    We paid serious attention to the basic building of the grass  roots to further strengthen the work of the people's court. In  line with the principle of replenishing the grass roots, we set  up 12 more people's courts to bring the total number of people's  courts in the province to 566. We further improved the work of  the leading group for people's court work to strengthen  leadership; conducted regular investigations and study to sum up  and exchange the people's courts' work and development  experiences and promptly resolve existing difficulties and  problems; strengthened professional guidance and upgraded the  professional skill of people's court cadres by setting up  contact stations and organizing joint handling of cases and  court sessions for the purpose of professional discussion and  study, rotational professional training, etc.; unfolded  activities for standardization in the people's courts and  established and improved various work and management systems;  and vigorously conducted activities to produce advanced and  excellent work performance. The provincial people's higher  court organized a provincial appraisal of advanced people's  courts, commending 42 people's courts and awarding the  collective merit citation, second class, to three people's  courts. During the year, people's courts across the province  handled all kinds of cases -- 100,051 in all, accouting for  50.74 percent of all court cases in the province, and mediated  and dealt with 10,464 simple disputes.    The major problems and difficulties in judicial work in 1993  were: A small number of courts lacked initiative in giving full  play to the judicial function of serving the establishment and  development of the socialist market economic system; loose law  enforcement continued to exist, with quite a number of local  courts emphasizing entities over procedures, poorly handling  some cases, taking excessively long periods to settle some  cases, and impairing the social effect of case handling; under  pronounced local as well as departmental protectionism, the  difficult situation in enforcing court decisions and rulings on  financial and civil cases was not fundamentally changed;  unhealthy social practices interfered with judicial work rather  seriously, with a handful of cadres and policemen failing to  withstand the challeges of reform, opening up to the outside  world, and the market economy and violating the law and  discipline more frequently and seriously than in past years;  quite a number of courts, especially those in northern Jiangsu,  faced a shortage of case handling funds and continued to be  weighed down by the heavy task of building courts at two local  levels which restrained judicial work to a certain degree.    Fellow deputies! In 1994, courts at all levels in the  province will persistently follow the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee and will stress the proper  trial of serious and major cases and the improvement of the way  of trial, in further, comprehensively strengthening various  judicial work, strictly enforcing the law, upgrading the  administration of justice, and serving to safeguard social  stability, promoting clean administration, and accelerating the  establishment of a socialist market economic system. We will  continue to carry out the struggle of "dealing heavy blows to  serious crimes" to sternly crack down on serious criminal acts  and economic crimes; give further play to the judicial function,  and vigorously regulate economic relationships to better serve  the socialist market economy; deepen and improve court reform  and persist in strict law enforcement; and conscientiously  strengthen efforts to beef up the ranks to upgrade the caliber  and standard of law enforcement. In this new year, we will  strive to make a mark in dealing heavy blows to serious crimes,  produce results in dealing with serious and major cases, make  great progress in regulating economic relationships, and  comprehensively upgrade the administration of justice. I  believe people's courts at all levels across the province will  certainly be able to accomplish the various judicial tasks the  new period has entrusted to them, by working under the  leadership of the party committees and the supervision of the  people's congresses and their standing committees and by relying  on the support of the vast number of people across the province  and the unity and struggle of all their cadres and policemen.</p>

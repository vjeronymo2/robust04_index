			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Teymuraz Mamaladze: "Dangerous Fishing in Black </F> Sea of Disinformation Threatens to Aggravate Russian-Ukrainian  Relations"]    [Text] "Muscle-flexing" is what the mythical observers  from the ITAR-TASS correspondent's report called the flight to  Crimea by the Ukrainian defense minister. Variations on the  theme of "Radetskyy's march" were crowned with a mighty chord --  the suggestion that the ground was being sounded out "for the  introduction in Crimea of a special form of rule whereby the  Crimean president would be subordinate to a representative of  the Ukrainian president."    Of itself the report is such that it could cause the utmost  tension not only of sinews but also of all other muscles,  including the heart: There would be no worse news today for the  CIS, Europe, and the rest of the world than the specter of  mounting military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.  Reports from Nikolay Semena, our correspondent in Crimea, and  from the journalists of other mass media and explanations from  official Kiev allow us to relax a little: The Ukrainian defense  minister has not visited Crimea and a group of high-ranking  military officials from that independent state visited the  peninsula under the plan for inspection visits. Nonetheless, we  cannot relax completely.    Armed conflicts are always preceded and then constantly  attended by a "war of words." But while on the battle fields  absolutely standard firearms and heavy weaponry are used, on the  news agency tapes, in the newspapers, and on television and  radio weapons of mass destruction are often fired and blown up  -- weapons known in journalists' jargon as "black propaganda"  [chernukha]. And the blacker it is the more perfect in the eyes  of its designers and purveyors and the broader its range.    Disinformation as a means of pushing public opinion toward  approving necessary political decisions and supporting "certain  steps in a particular direction," and psychological warfare as a  selection of tools to destabilize and upset interstate relations  is the subject of a separate conversation. For the time being I  should like to say the following: All my personal experience of  work in trouble spots, be it in Abkhazia or South Ossetia,  attests that disinforming "black propaganda" feeds conflicts  more powerfully than irresponsible statements, actions, and  steps by some statesmen and politicians. It kills people more  surely than an AKM-47 or RPG grenade throwers and it kills them  in the literal sense -- I do not have the space now to cite the  examples and names I know. I have frequently held in my hands a  radio intercept of talks between some "source" and some reporter  in which the former has given an account of, for instance,  "atrocities committed by the Georgians" and the latter has shyly  wondered whom he should quote. "I shall tell you later," the  "source" has reassured him.    I don't want it later, I would like it now. But since that  is not entirely possible let us restrict ourselves to general  considerations: Attempts to turn the bluest sea in the world  and indeed other not entirely happy regions and spheres into a  black sea of disinformation are fraught with danger....    It remains to ascertain how eagerly public opinion will  demand similar attempts to aggravate Russian-Ukrainian and not  just Russian-Ukrainian relations (see the list of CIS  countries). Specific sociological research methods would be a  good thing here but for the time being my personal feeling is  enough: They would not be particularly eager to make this  demand.</p>

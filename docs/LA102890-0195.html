			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: A CHANGING OUTLOOK FOR RETIREE HEALTH PLANS  </P> <P> One of the most attractive employee benefits, health-care insurance for  retirees, is being re-examined by many companies. Older workers, particularly  those close to retirement, should expect to pay more for the benefit -- or find  it tougher to qualify for coverage.  </P> <P> Offered by most large companies and many small ones, retiree health-care plans  typically offer those retiring under age 65 a continuation of the same medical  coverage they enjoyed when working. For retirees over 65, the coverage  generally supplements Medicare.  </P> <P> Such plans have been quite useful as the nation's demographics change and the  percentage of retirees or near-retirees in the population grows. Such coverage  has been particularly useful for those retiring before 65, because they can't  fall back on Medicare until age 65. And many employers have been quite generous  with coverage, often footing the entire cost.  </P> <P> But thanks to new corporate accounting rules expected to take effect in 1993,  such generosity is becoming a thing of the past.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which makes the  nation's accounting rules, adopted new standards that require companies to  recognize on their financial statements some of their present and future costs  of providing retiree health plans. Currently, companies recognize only what  they actually pay out in any given year -- a figure that does not reflect their  vastly larger future commitments.  </P> <P> It's no surprise that the new rule will have a devastating effect on corporate  bottom lines, reducing profits by hundreds of millions of dollars.  </P> <P> And coming as corporations are already reeling from rising health-care costs --  and as they brace themselves for an expected recession -- the timing of this  new rule is inopportune.  </P> <P> The implication for workers is clear: More companies will think twice about  offering generous retiree health benefits. Indeed, surveys show that many  employers intend to alter their plans in anticipation of the new accounting  rules.  </P> <P> "It's going to really turn up the heat on employers to minimize their  obligations to retirees," says Lois Salisbury, chairperson of Health Access, a  coalition of labor, consumer and other groups in California working to promote  affordable health care. "For many retirees, those obligations are already  uncertain, so this will exacerbate that trend."  </P> <P> Few employers say they will eliminate retiree health plans completely. But you  should expect other changes, such as:  </P> <P> * Higher costs for retirees. Most big companies say they will require retirees  to contribute more toward the costs of coverage. They also may require higher  deductibles or coinsurance.  </P> <P> Some employers -- recognizing that plans cost more for retirees under age 65  because they cannot yet draw on Medicare first -- are specifically increasing  costs borne by early retirees.  </P> <P> The median annual cost for employers to provide retiree health coverage for  individuals retiring under 65 is $2,246, compared to only $1,033 for retirees  above age 65, according to a survey by Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits  consulting firm.  </P> <P> * Stricter eligibility requirements. Some companies are tying plan eligibility  or benefit levels to employees' length of service. If you have fewer years of  service, you might be required to make higher contributions -- or you might not  be eligible at all.  </P> <P> "Employers are increasingly structuring these retiree plans more like pension  benefits, (where they) reward long service," says John W. Bauerlein, a  consulting actuary in the Santa Ana office of Hewitt Associates.  </P> <P> For example, if you have 30 years of service when you retire, a company might  subsidize 100% of the cost, Bauerlein says. But if you only have 15 years of  service, the subsidy may be only 50%.  </P> <P> * Provide lower-cost options. Employers may provide alternatives for retirees  to select reduced coverage in exchange for lower contributions. For example,  you might be able to select catastrophic care with a much higher deductible in  exchange for a lower premium.  </P> <P> What can you do about these changes?  </P> <P> Unfortunately, not much. If you are a union member, figure that the controversy  over retiree health-care cutbacks will be an issue in labor negotiations. It's  already been a bone of contention in labor talks involving such large companies  as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and the Baby Bell regional phone firms.  </P> <P> But whether you're in a union or not, you should consider the strength of a  company's retiree health plan, along with other factors, before joining that  company, Salisbury says.  </P> <P> And if your retirement is imminent, "you ought to double- and triple-check your  own expectations for retirement coverage against what your employer says,"  Salisbury advises. Get your employer to commit its plan terms in writing, she  urges.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of gray areas where employers may feel free to change  commitments," she says. "Be vigorous in determining exactly what your  employer's obligations are going to be."  </P></p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Letter: Lloyd's Names should not have to bear burden of losses twice Sir, With reference to Mr Gurney's letter (May 27) in relation to Lloyd's, the fundamental point, with which he seems to agree, is that a growing and profitable Lloyd's market is in everyone's best interest. However, before Mr Gurney pursues his misjudged demand for an extraordinary general meeting of members (quite besides the unnecessary expense and effort, as there is an annual general meeting already scheduled for June 22) I hope that he would consider these two important points. First, a suggestion that 25 per cent of future profits earned by corporate Names should be 'taxed' by the Society of Lloyd's and credited to its 1980s membership would almost certainly deter any new corporate capital entering the market. It has already been suggested that a levy of 1.5 per cent on capacity be made on corporate Names which, if the profits are 10 per cent on capacity, levies a 15 per cent charge on profits. In addition, Lloyd's itself is proposing a bidding system for capacity on top of this charge the combination of which brings into question whether new capital is better supplied to Lloyd's syndicates or to other London insurance entities. Second, before seeking to demand a proportion of future profits, both Mr Gurney and Lloyd's should understand that some proportion of this 'corporate capital' will be supplied by individuals who, like myself, have already suffered those same very heavy personal underwriting losses but who might choose to underwrite in future through an incorporated Name route - why, then, should that category of incorporated Name have to bear such a heavy burden twice?

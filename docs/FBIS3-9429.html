Jarcevic said that the deposits were being made on Mt Papuk  in an area 35 times 50 kilometers, that is now ethnically  cleansed from Serbs, in four locations identified so far:  Straza, Tucak, Bilo and Lom.    The RSK was formed in 1991 in parts of the former Yugoslav  Republic of Croatia populated by Serbs in response to the  Croatian forcible secession from the former Yugoslav Federation  and has been a U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) since March 1992.    The RSK Foreign Ministry has conveyed this information to  the  co-chairmen of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and U.N.  member countries that have their troops within the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces], Jarcevic said adding that they had not shown  any particular interest.    Jarcevic said that the nuclear waste and the poisonous  chemicals originate from Germany and are transported through  Austria and Hungary.    According to further information Bosnian Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic has also promised his patrons and the initiators of  the new world order locations for depositing their nuclear waste  and toxic chemicals on Serb territory stretching from Kupres to  Drvar.    It is also reported in Knin that Greece fears that similar  engagements were undertaken by the president of The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Kiro Gligorov and information  about Germany's deposit of its toxic waste in Albania near the  border with the F.R. of Yugoslavia has already been partly  revealed.</p>

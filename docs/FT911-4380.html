			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (2): New vocabulary of building - European prospects DEVELOPERS usually wince at the prospect of crossing national boundaries. They are a home-loving bunch, skilled in the black arts of untangling red tape and anticipating the wants of local customers. Why try to compete under different rules in a new language for customers you don't understand? But boundaries are dissolving in Europe. They already have dissolved for many leading tenants, who expect a suitably international service from their landlords and agents. A nagging background noise has also thrown doubts on the safety of staying tucked up at home: the sound of business hitting the bottom of the barrel. When the UK market is as flat as a millpond, the challenge of learning a new language seems much less severe. But business park developers will have to absorb more than a few phrase books to make a success in mainland Europe. They must adjust to a whole new vocabulary of building. Previous invasions were marred by an irritating attitude of taking civilisation to the natives. Full air-conditioning was mandatory for office blocks, for instance, no matter what locals felt. The fact that tenants turned their collective noses up at such extravagance taught a few expensive lessons. This time around there should be fewer mistakes. The British still profess to offer a better product - but quickly emphasise the importance of bending it to local needs. 'We are entering a market part way through an evolution from industrial estate to high-quality office park,' says Peter Mantle of Jones Lang Wootton  -a polite way of saying the continentals have yet to catch up with the UK. International groups such as IBM want the sort of space they get at home, but it would be a disaster to just superimpose US and UK forms without reference to local traditions, he adds. Even the multinationals are changing their spots, however. John Worthington of architects DEGW, deeply involved in Spain and France for UK and local developers, says: 'Ten years ago they would have demanded the same building in every country. Now they recognise that local people work in these places and their needs must be recognised.' In Sweden and Germany, for instance, staff expect a high degree of control over their work environment. In other words they demand the power to open a window and let in fresh air rather than endure the contraints of central air-conditioning. What goes under buildings seems to be as important as the people who work in them. The Italians and Spanish are passionately attached to their cars - but they do not want them cluttering up the place when not in use. That is why London &amp; Edinburgh Trust is building underground space for close to 800 vehicles at its 400,000 sq ft business park next to Milan airport. This sort of idiosyncrasy raises building densities, however, making it harder to export the idea of low site cover and high-quality landscaping. And continental parks are already more dense than their UK counterparts. France, for instance, claims to lead the market with futuristic 'technopoles' such as the group of 11 science centres covering more than 2,000 acres around the southern town of Montpellier, but a more typical scheme is much further down the evolutionary scale. Low-rise, low specification buildings normally cover 35 per cent of a site, leaving only 15 per cent for impressive landscaping after providing roads and parking. This is the exact opposite of a UK park, according to Mr Worthington, with its low site cover and multi-storey buildings. The Germans, on the other hand, build densely because planners set maximum plot ratios of 1:1 or 1.5:1, which generate land values only justified by high-rise office centres. Tenants are therefore less interested in landscaping than the quality of a building, says Andrew Burt of JLW. They carry that attitude around Europe, so a massive amount of work is going on to determine which companies are looking to move and what they are looking for. A good environment might be unimportant to Germans, for instance, but is crucial to 90 per cent of Italians, according to a study by Applied Property Research. Like the British, Dutch and French, they also demand good housing and shops, while the Germans differ again, says APR, placing more emphasis on location near markets. One surprising fact is that links with universities and quality of life come low down the list of priorities. This learning process is not just geared to UK developers. DEGW is designing for continental developers, while JLW is working up a 1.3m sq ft park in Barcelona for the Germany company Grupo Dorn. But a market leader such as Arlington believes it has the advantage of being able to integrate new lessons about tenant priorities with the successful UK formula of prime locations, good design, flexible tenure and on-going management control. Phil Alexander, chief executive of new European subsidiary ASE, is already looking after schemes in France, Spain and Italy. He also has his eyes on eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The company's reputation has gone before it, gaining a role to 'internationalise' the 2m sq ft high-rise office park planned outside Milan by SNAM and Cogefar-Torno. Pre-lets would be important here - mainly to Italians - but so would sales to the 'blue chip' multi-nationals targetting this important European growth centre. Arlington has a head start because most big names already have buildings on the developer's UK parks. That advantage could also be useful in eastern Europe, with the company offering to provide the same sort of space they have at home - bent to local needs, of course. Stuart Lipton's Stanhope Properties will hope for the same transfer of loyalties from Stockley Park, the 1.5m sq ft scheme near Heathrow which has set the pace for UK development and scooped a hatful of awards. He is set to open its first European office later this year, and has chosen Berlin with an obvious eye on the east. 'The crucial thing is to ensure that development is demand-led rather than property-led,' says Mr Mantle. If UK companies can manage that through more sophisticated research and concentration on tenant needs, the potential for expansion into a growing market is incalculable. If not, they face a bleak future, locked into an increasingly marginalised island off the European coast while others reap the rewards.  --------------------------------------------- Rental levels (Pounds /sq ft) January 1991  ---------------------------------------------                      Prime       Business                     office       park  --------------------------------------------- London                60          25 Paris                 40          12 Madrid                33          15 Milan                 32          13 Frankfurt             30           9.50 Barcelona             24          13 Munich                23           9 Brussels              13           8.25  --------------------------------------------- Source: Jones Lang Wootton  ---------------------------------------------</p>

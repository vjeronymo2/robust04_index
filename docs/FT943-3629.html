			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals shares fall on warning Country Casuals shares plunged by more than a fifth yesterday as the clothing retailer warned profits would be hit by unexpected difficulties in establishing its larger women's brand, Elvi. The shares fell by 32p to 120p following the announcement. Analysts, who had been expecting some costs as a result of the expansion of Elvi, marked their forecasts for annual profits down from about Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m. Mr John Shannon, chairman, said establishing Elvi as a retail chain had taken longer than expected. The group had encountered difficulties in opening shops and sales had been below budget. Country Casuals was forced to discount higher levels of Elvi stock in the summer sales as a result and gross margins were hit. Mr Shannon said the group remained committed to developing a middle market niche in the larger women's market. In the second half, Country Casuals would be supporting its 50 shops with national advertising. Country Casuals also suffered delays in opening shops in its smaller Koto business, which caters for the younger fashion market. Although sales were 10 per cent higher in the first half, margins were affected by discounting. These factors meant that full year profits would be substantially below market expectations, Mr Shannon said. He refused to quantify the extent of the expected writedowns and provisions. More details would be given with the interim results due in October, he said. The Elvi management team has been strengthened with the appointment of Mr Russ Hamer, formerly of Debenhams and Laura Ashley, as managing director. The core Country Casuals chain improved margins by about two percentage points. The division achieved sales of Pounds 15.1m in the first half, down by 1 per cent. Lerose Manufacturing enjoyed a strong first half, with sales up by 26 per cent.</p>

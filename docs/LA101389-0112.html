			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFLATED HOPES  </P> <P> Pitting their wits against competitors from some of the Southland's major  universities, Caltech engineering students took first prize in the Collegiate  Technology Challenge held Thursday at Universal City. The contestants were  asked to build a contraption that would inflate a 16-inch globe. Caltech's  winning entry included a couple of old shoes, an aquarium and the usual number  of chutes, lines and pulleys, but ultimately used liquid nitrogen to compress  the air needed to fill the globe. The winners share a $10,000 scholarship from  competition sponsors, the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The contest  was part of the firm's 1989 Technology Network Exchange conference.  </P></p>

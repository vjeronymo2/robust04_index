			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian Government  and the governing parties do not strive to monopolize and occupy  the public service mass media, the National Information Office  (OIH) of the Prime Minister's Office said in an analysis sent to  MTI today.    Entitled "What Happened in Hungarian Radio?", the document  states that the Hungarian Government is not in a position to  directly intervene in the management of Hungarian Radio.  Precisely due to the forthcoming elections, the governing  parties would have been interested in postponing the required  workforce cuts until the post- election period.    According to the analysis, the radio deputy chairman's  decision to dismiss 129 members of the staff was motivated by  financial and ethical considerations, the reasoning of which had  to be understood by the government, as well. The present  situation would not have come about, the analysis says, if  President Arpad Goncz had relieved the chairmen of Hungarian  Radio and Hungarian Television of their posts after they asked  him to do so on January 6, 1993, and if the attitude of the  opposition parties had not prevented enactment of a media law.    The document says that there are only a few papers and  programs in Hungary in which government officials can speak in  the awareness that they will not be subjected to the methods of  intentional and one-sided distortion. Since the leaders and  editors of the majority of national and provincial papers have  retained their previous positions, 80 to 85 percent of the press  follows an opposition (usually left-wing) line, the document  says. The OIH excludes the chance that this situation,  detrimental to the government, would or could become a relic of  the past.    Reacting to criticism addressed to the government over the  dismissals, the analysis says, "it would be beneficial if all  those abroad who have doubts listened to the daily program of  Hungarian Radio for only a single occasion to decide whether or  not it is pro- government."    The OIH sees it as reasonable that a media company, even one  belonging to the opposition, should conduct a survey of the  programs for the coming month.    Referring to a recent report by the Hungarian Radio's  Supervisory Committee, the analysis says, "Hungarian Radio  continues to give much more coverage to the media debate than is  justified."</p>

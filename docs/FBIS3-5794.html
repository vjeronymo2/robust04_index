			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The Armed Forces (ABRI) must be  prepared to ensure a smooth transfer of power in the national  leadership, Minister of Defense and Security Edi Sudrajat said.  Edi told a military seminar on Wednesday that the national  leadership succession will be one of the most critical issues  facing the nation in the coming years, along with democracy and  human rights.    ABRI's task will be to ensure that the transfer of power  takes place in a constitutional manner, said Edi, a retired army  general who headed ABRI for a brief period last year. This is  the nearest admission by the military regarding the likelihood  that President Suharto will relinquish power at the end of this,  his sixth five year term in office, in 1998.    The ruling political organization Golkar [Functional Group]  has declined to be drawn into the succession debate, saying that  it was unethical, preferring to leave it until nearer the time  of the next election in 1998.    Edi's statement followed remarks made by the incumbent  himself that he had no intention of remaining president for life  and that he would know when to step aside. Suharto is now 72  years old. Edi also made the point in his speech on Wednesday.  "Whatever happens, the national leadership succession process  must get underway because the time has come for that." He  expressed appreciation for Suharto's long service to the  country, but pointed out that succession was inevitable because  nobody could hold the post forever.    The remarks were made during a gathering of middle and  senior  ranking ABRI officers organized by the Army's Strategic Reserves  Command, an elite force once headed by Suharto. The meeting was  held to mark the command's 33rd anniversary.    Edi said in his speech that ABRI must continue to attempt to  define its position and role in the nation, especially to ensure  the success of the next 25-year long term development which  begins on April 1. "ABRI always stands above the interests of  all social, ethnic and religious groups," he said. "Its chief  task is to maintain national unity and cohesion and it must  fight for the interests of the people."    The military must play an active role in national  development  and set a positive example for the rest of society, he said. He  warned that the problems facing the nation will become even more  complicated in the coming years, but cautioned the military to  remain loyal to its oath and motto. He also said that ABRI must  continue to be loyal to the state ideology Pancasila and the  1945 Constitution. History has shown ABRI's important role in  the nation's life and this will remain true in the future, he  added.    The minister also discussed the allegation that certain  groups in society now seek to replace Pancasila with other  ideologies, notably liberalism.    "We have to remain vigilant. History has shown that liberal  democracy, which Indonesia adopted in the early 1950s, was  doomed to failure," he said. "It does not fit with the nation's  identity." He did not specifically name the groups but said that  vocal opposition exists to the security approach to development  and ABRI's role in politics. Edi said the government has no  intention of loosening its security grip in the coming years  because such an approach was still necessary to ensure  development, economic growth and a more equitable distribution  of income. The aversion of some people to security baffled him,  he said, stressing that people are concerned with security every  day.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ruling on Drug: The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that companies that  manufactured the suspected cancer-causing drug DES cannot be forced to pay  damages to "DES daughters" who do not know what company manufactured the DES  their mothers took. Justices ruled in the case of a Chicago woman who  contracted cervical cancer and sued Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and  several other makers of the controversial drug diethlystilbestrol, a synthetic  female hormone. Studies show daughters of pregnant women who often took the  drug to prevent miscarriage from the 1940s to the 1960s had a higher incidence  of cervical cancer.  </P></p>

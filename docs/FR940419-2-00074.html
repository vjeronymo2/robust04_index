The committee also provides advice and makes recommendations on ways of communicating to the public the potential risks associated with these issues and recommends approaches to be considered in addressing them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Criteria for Members <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Persons nominated for membership on the committee shall be knowledgeable in the fields of life sciences, food science, risk assessment, or other relevant scientific disciplines.

The term of office is up to 4 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Nomination Procedures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Interested persons may nominate one or more qualified persons for membership on the committee. Nominations shall state that the nominee is willing to serve as a member of the committee and appears to have no conflict of interest that would preclude committee membership. Additionally, the nominee's mailing address, telephone number, and curriculum vitae must accompany the nominations. Potential candidates will be asked by FDA to provide detailed information concerning such matters as financial holdings, employment, consultancies, and research grants and/or contracts to permit evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Criteria for Consumer-Nominated Members <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of representatives of consumer interests will be conducted through procedures that include use of a consortium of consumer organizations which has the responsibility for screening, interviewing, and recommending candidates for the agency's selection. Candidates from this group, like all other candidates for membership on the committee, should possess appropriate qualifications to understand and contribute to the committee's work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Industry Representatives <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding nominations for members representing industry interests, a letter will be sent to each person or organization that has made a nomination and to other organizations that have expressed an interest in participating in the selection process together with a complete list of all such organizations and the nominees. The letter will state that it is the responsibility of each nominator or organization that has expressed an interest in participating in the selection process to consult with the others and to provide a consensus slate of possible members representing industry interests within 60 days. In the event that a slate of nominees has not been provided within 60 days, the agency will select an industry representative for each such vacancy from the entire list of industry nominees to avoid delay or disruption of the work of the committee. The agency is particularly interested in nominees that possess the essential scientific credentials needed to participate fully and knowledgeably in the committee's deliberations. In addition to this expertise, the agency believes that it would be an advantage to the committee's work if the individual(s) had special insight and direct experience into specific industry-wide issues, practices, and concerns that might not otherwise be available to others not similarly situated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This notice is issued under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2) and 21 CFR part 14, relating to advisory committees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linda A.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 8 (AFP) -- Rwandan employees of aid  organisations in Kigali have been murdered by Rwandan troops,  while at least 22 Rwandan missionary priests and nuns have been  killed amid the ethnic violence, sources said Friday [8 April].    In Brussels, a director of the humanitarian organisation  Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium [MSF--Doctors Without Borders],  Georges Dallemagne, said in a statement that "several dozen"  Rwandan employees of the aid workers had been killed by members  of the presidential guard drawn from the majority ethnic Hutus.    Dallemagne said the victims were slain in front of their  expatriate employers.    But MSF official Dominique Bontriau said later it was  impossible to estimate how many workers had been killed. "It is  chaotic," she said, but could not confirm that they numbered  several dozen.    She said Dallemagne had been misquoted as saying there were  several dozen victims.    Meanwhile, church officials in Kigali, contacted by  telephone  from Paris, said that at least 22 missionary priests and nuns  have been killed in Rwanda since the clashes began there  Thursday following the plane crash death of the Rwandan and  Burundian presidents.    Six priests and nine nuns were killed in Kigali itself and  six priests and a nun in the town of Nyundo, in the northwest  province of Gisenyi, the official at the papal nuncio's office  said.    The church official, who refused to be identified, said the  Kigali parishes were "full of people seeking shelter."    The sound of light and heavy gunfire could be heard in the  town and streets were deserted, he said.    "The situation is becoming explosive, there is much  confusion," he said.    He added that UN troops in the capital were keeping to  barracks following the death of 10 UN Belgian soldiers on  Thursday.</p>

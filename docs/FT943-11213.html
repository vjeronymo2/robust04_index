			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Independent cuts price 20p 'to protect circulation' The Independent last night cut its cover price by 20p to 30p in a move which could cost more than Pounds 14m a year in revenue, although the newspaper said the move was temporary and the price may increase at a later stage. The move to cut the price of the weekday Independent means that The Independent will now sell at the same price as The Daily Telegraph and below those of the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. It has been clear for some time that the directors of Newspaper Publishing, which owns both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, were planning a cover price cut. It has been acknowledged that last year's decision to increase the cover price to 50p was a mistake. The main price cuts tested in different areas were to 40p and 45p. The fact that The Independent has now gone for a deeper price cut suggests that it is facing a more serious loss of circulation than has been supposed. Shareholders last night made clear that the price cut was seen as tactical and designed to protect circulation until significant editorial improvements are made. Mr Ian Hargreaves, former deputy editor of the Financial Times, takes over as editor of The Independent in the middle of this month and editorial changes are expected to follow. The main problem with last night's announcement for Newspaper Publishing is the difficulty of increasing the price of the paper after consumers have got used to 30p. The decision on The Independent's cover price decision will also put pressure on The Guardian, which has kept out of the price wars at 45p a copy. Mr Peter Preston, its chairman and editor, said last night: 'We will continue to watch the situation, which so far has had very little impact upon us.'</p>

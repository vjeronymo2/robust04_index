			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Akshintsev: "Russia Losing </F> the Arms Market: USA Already Exporting Seven Times More"]    [Text] The arms trade problem has recently acquired special  urgency, as a result of which the mass media report on it  practically daily, evoking numerous discussions and debates.    In the discussion of the question as to whether or not  Russia  should sell arms, one is astounded by the simplicity with which  many of our citizens approach this complex, delicate problem.  Having digested a certain amount of superficial information, and  not burdening themselves with a meticulous, comprehensive  analysis, in all seriousness they offer proposals which not only  possess content that often recalls the line of reasoning  followed by Manilov in Gogol's Dead Souls, but which  may also lead to serious negative consequences.    In the estimation of the Ministry of Defense, the USA's  share  of the world arms market is currently around 60 percent.  However, citing available official international data, Doctor of  Historical Sciences A. G. Arbatov, a prominent specialist in  security matters, asserts that of the total volume of world arms  exports, which was $18 billion in 1992, the USA's share was  approximately $8 billion, or only 46 percent.    How correct are these estimates, and which is closer to the  truth?    Of course, the differences in the indicators are the product  of different procedures for calculating them, and there is  nothing prejudicial in this. Something else is  important--correct manipulation of data obtained by means of  some specific methodological approach, and a clear understanding  of their limits.    Having no information on the procedure by which the volumes  of arms exports by different countries were estimated by  specialists of the Ministry of Defense, we need to offer some  clarifications regarding estimates of the world arms trade  volume and the USA's share of it.    The principal data were obtained from an analytical survey  of  armament and disarmament problems covering 1993, prepared by  specialists of the Stockholm International World Problems  Research Institute (SIPRI). There can be no doubt as to the high  professionalism and objectivity of this well-known  organization's scientists. And as with anyone concerned with  maintaining one's scientific image, SIPRI specialists accompany  the cost indicators of world arms trade volumes cited by them by  the corresponding methodological explanations.    It follows from these explanations that the data reflected  in  the SIPRI survey embrace only five basic forms of conventional  arms: Warplanes and helicopters; armored equipment and artillery  systems of 100 mm and higher caliber; radar stations and other  electronic systems (tracking, control, guidance etc.); guided  missiles; ships of the principal classes (with displacement  greater than 100 tonnes). That is, export and import of forms of  armament such as ammunition, infantry weapons, artillery  armament of up to 100 mm caliber, military launches etc. are  disregarded.    Considering the complexity and the practical impossibility  of  clearly tracking deliveries of this assortment of military  property, SIPRI specialists make special reference to their  well-known table, which contains data on the world trade volume.    In the meantime when he cites SIPRI data but fails to  mention  this reference, Mr. A. G. Arbatov unwittingly reduces the real  volume of arms trade in the world, and the roll played in it by  the USA. An estimate of the difference may be obtained by  comparing the SIPRI estimate with indicators contained in a  special annual report written by the research service of the  U.S. Congress on deliveries of conventional arms to Third World  countries.    Thus according to the last report, which accounted for all  deliveries of American arms through state and private channels,  in 1988-1992 the USA exported weapons and military equipment to  developing countries amounting to $36.2 billion in current  prices. Considering that according to SIPRI data Third World  countries represented only 36 percent of American exports of the  main forms of conventional arms in the indicated period, and  making the assumption that this proportion also applies to  deliveries of other types of military property abroad, we find  that total exports of weapons and military equipment by the USA  in 1988-1992 were approximately $100 billion. In the meantime,  we see an indicator of only $55 billion in the SIPRI survey;  however, it corresponds only to that part of armament which the  USA supplies to other countries. Thus, one of the indicators  exceeds the other by 82 percent.    With regard for this, and ignoring the nonessential error  due  to differences in prices observed in the Congressional report  and in the SIPRI survey, and adopting an average coefficient of  excess for the entire five-year period, we find that American  arms exports in 1992 exceeded $15 billion.    Why cite all of these complex calculations, which are  tiresome to the reader and which aren't commonly found in  newspapers as a genre? To once again demonstrate to our people  that we continue to approach arms trade, which is such a complex  problem, in a very superficial way, without accounting for the  evolving realities. As a result, while we were waging a campaign  of directive and, in many ways, unilateral conversion, and  debating whether Russia should sell arms or not, the leading  foreign military exporters, chiefly in the USA, began building  up the efforts to increase their exports, including by  penetrating into markets abandoned by us. As a result, a  significant imbalance revealed itself in world arms trade, which  was pointed out in particular by Russian President B. N. Yeltsin  in his report to a joint meeting of the Council of the  Federation and the State Duma in February 1994.    Thus, while according to calculations the volume of American  arms exports exceeded $15 billion in 1992, this indicator was  only $2.3 billion for Russia (taken from the cited report to the  U.S. Congress, and corresponding to our arms exports to Third  World countries, because for practical purposes there were no  deliveries to other countries in 1992). Indicators contained in  the United Nations conventional arms register also attest to  presence of such a large imbalance in the volumes of American  and Russian exports of weapons and military equipment (a factor  of more than seven times, and not the four times arrived at when  using SIPRI data). Corresponding with this, in 1992 the USA  exported 1,241 tanks (82 percent of world exports), 706 IFVs and  APCs (63 percent), 166 large-caliber artillery systems (17  percent), 165 warplanes (69 percent) and 6 helicopter gunships  (75 percent). Of these types of arms, Russia exported only 7  tanks, (0.5 percent), 198 IFVs and APCs (18 percent) and 26  warplanes (11 percent).    The Soviet military-industrial complex was distinguished by  a  high potential in relation to creating and exporting defensive  products, permitting it to successfully compete in the world  arms markets. However, the USSR's disintegration significantly  weakened this potential.    First, in the heat of the infighting that engulfed us, and  desiring to reach the finish line first, we began pursuing an  uncoordinated arms export policy, and developing ill-conceived  competition, which is ultimately leading to serious political  and economic losses for all parties. In particular, when the  same types of equipment are aggressively offered in the same  markets, their prices decrease.    Second, disturbance of the unified military-economic space  seriously undermined our possibilities for designing  state-of-the-art, competitive arms. Because of nondelivery of  certain units and parts by some neighboring sovereign state it  is impossible to manufacture and export entire weapon systems.  Even Russia suffers this fate in some cases, despite the fact  that it possesses the most powerful military-industrial base in  the CIS. A meeting with the director of a certain defense  enterprise comes to mind in this connection. When asked about  seeking new export orders, he replied that he wasn't especially  troubled by this (there was a demand for his products), and that  the main problem was filling the orders already placed, which  was jeopardized by violations of cooperative deliveries.    This negative factor elicits serious apprehensions among our  potential customers regarding the ability of CIS exporters to  ensure dependable post-sales maintenance of the delivered weapon  systems, which is extremely important to successful activity in  the world arms market.    As a result of these and a number of other causes, some  countries that have been traditional importers of Soviet  armament are starting to actively seek alternative sources of  deliveries. For example India, which was the biggest purchaser  of Soviet armament (the latter represented 80 percent of India's  military imports in 1987-1991), has been developing military and  economic cooperation with Western countries in recent years,  thus attempting to insure itself against possible failures of  military deliveries from CIS states. Concurrently, capitalizing  on the problems in our military-industrial complex, arms  exporters in Eastern Europe are also rushing into the Indian  market. For example, during a recent visit to Delhi by a  high-placed Hungarian military delegation, it was announced that  Hungary was prepared to supply India with spare parts and  equipment for MiG airplanes as well as for T-55 and T-72 tanks.    Unfortunately, many of us who are concerned about  proliferation of arms in the world believe the main threat in  this sphere to be coming from the Russian military-industrial  complex, which is striving to sell its state-of-the-art,  competitive defensive products in the foreign market. But this  is a deeply mistaken position, inasmuch as the solution to this  problem must be approached under the conditions of strict  parity, with all of the principal exporters and importers  involved. Otherwise, tensions in certain regions of the world  would not be reduced, inasmuch as other countries would deliver  weapons there. In the meantime, not only will we fail to earn  additional hard currency necessary to reform the Russian  economy, but under the conditions of limiting defense orders to  our own armed forces, ultimately we will transform from an arms  exporter into an arms importer.</p>

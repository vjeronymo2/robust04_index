			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Petty broadcasting restriction Sir, France's culture minister, Jacques Toubon (The FT Interview, November 29), claims to have heard that 'British delegates' in Brussels are now 'more conciliatory' towards proposed EU plans further to restrict the amount of non-EU material that can be shown on European broadcast media. One can only hope that he is wrong. In the past such a policy could, perhaps, seek some remote justification in the limited broadcasting capacity then available. Fortunately, with today's technology such an excuse can no longer stand. The proposed legislation can now be seen for the petty anti-Americanism that it really is. National quotas no more belong in the TV schedule than they do in the book shop. In defending this policy, Jacques Toubon may well find comfort in France's authoritarian traditions. The 'British delegates', however, would have no such excuse and no reason to be 'conciliatory'. The free flow of ideas should not be negotiable and the sooner this is explained to the European Commission the better. Andrew Stuttaford, 280 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10010, US</p>

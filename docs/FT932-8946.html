			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Records: Between the 'best of' and the boxed - The latest pop anthologies LURKING benevolently between the 'Best Of', with its all the hits and nothing more philosophy, and the boxed set, with its detailed discography and emphasis on unreleased material, lies the anthology. Intended neither for the dabbler nor the completist, the anthology, if is to succeed, has to find a way of bring together rather more material by an artist than one would initially expect to find. One way of doing this is to focus on an artist's career, including the interesting moments as well as the peaks. This is the strategy adopted by Motown for their Anthology series. Recent releases include double CDs devoted to Marvin Gaye (530-181-2), The Four Tops (530 190-2), The Temptations (530 184-2), Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes (530 196-2). All follow the same path: they include virtually all the hits, early recordings and fillers from would-be 'classy' albums made by Motown to show that its artists were as at home at the Copacabanna as the Apollo. Take the Supremes. The first (non-hit) recordings are quite fascinating. They reveal a group with no identity veering from style to style, awaiting the tambourine and chord-driven rhythms and coy come-hither vocal pose of 'Where Did Our Love Go' and 'Baby Love'. The hits are fine but the fillers are real fillers. No one needs the Supremes' version of 'Funny How Times Slips Away' or The Temptations singing 'Ole Man River'. Nonetheless, although the general strategy backfires (unless like the Four Tops or Marvin Gaye, you have made very few clinkers) and confirms the view that Motown at its height was essentially a singles label, since the 40-plus sets have hits galore it is hard to complain too much. Love may have been one of the seminal groups of the psychedelic era, but it certainly recorded a few clinkers in its time. There is none, however, on Comes In Colours (Raven RVCD 29). Culled largely from their first three albums the 24 track CD neatly catches the mysterious romanticism, terse, edgy druggy rhythms, hippie philosophising and lush string-laden productions that is as awesome today as it was a quarter of a century ago. This is the perfect introduction to Love. Enjoy it and you'll be bound to want their classic album, Forever Changes. Also from Raven is Warm Evenings, Pale Mornings, Bottled Blues (RVCD 24) which charts the erratic but historically hugely important career of Gram Parsons, the man who forcibly yoked country and rock together without losing the heart of either. Warm Evenings collects together his early recordings with the Shilohs and International Submarine band, classic tracks from his short stay with the Byrds, his seminal works with the Flying Burrito Bros and a fine selection of his solo recordings. Not all the tracks are wholly satisfying but all are passionate, from the melancholy of 'Hickory Wind' to the surreal mystery of 'The New Soft Shoe'. What makes the album so satisfying is that all the stages of Parsons' career are covered (and from five different record companies, no less). This is a true anthology. 'Satan Is Real' sang the Louvin Brothers a decade or so before Parsons recorded the remarkably similar 'Sin City'. Like Parsons, they dealt in unfashionable extremities - 'Broadminded is spelt s,i,n'; 'When I stop breathin', that's when I'll stop loving you' they sang in fierce, delicate harmonies. Capitol Country Classics (EMI 7 89271 2) collects together their finest recordings of the 1950s. Though the brothers had few hits, their intense harmonies and direct celebrations of the joys and sorrows of life were too old fashioned for the times, they were direct influences on the Everly Brothers 'Love Hurts' and so entered the mainstream. They deserve to be better known. Weighing in at 3 CDs and including its fair share of unreleased tracks, Watching The Dark (Hannibal HNCD 5303) is big but essential. Its subject is Richard Thompson, who from the 1960s and Fairport Convention to the 1990s and a solo career that has won him cult status, has sung and played about pain and trouble with an incisiveness only seen elsewhere in the work of Neil Young. Touching on every stage of his recording career The Dark reveals a powerful songwriter and performer whose generally bitter view of life is relieved by a caustic wit and an enthralling guitar style. Not for the wearers of rose-tinted spectacles.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / UK Company News: Cisco proposals include shake-up in SE structure A CITY lobby group is seeking a shake-up in the structure of the Stock Exchange as part of its proposals for alterna-tives to the Unlisted Securities Market which faces closure in 1996. The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) has drawn up proposals for a three tier market which will be sent out to its members some time this week. The tiers include: an international equity market made up of the top 350 securities; a national market for the majority of the remaining companies listed both on the Official List and the USM; and an enterprise market with minimum regulation for companies not on the Official List. Mr Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Cisco, said the latter two tiers would have separate governance from the international market. This should be done under a Stock Exchange umbrella, he said. However, 'it would mean a significant restructuring of the governing board of the Stock Exchange'. Cisco is also proposing that the class tests on the national market - ie, the levels of disclosure - should be similar to those currently used on the USM. This would reduce the costs of maintaining a listing for companies on the national market, the vast majority of which would be capitalised at less than Pounds 50m. Companies falling into the enterprise category would be higher risk, with no trading record or market value requirements. However, Cisco argues that investors should be protected from fraud rather than business risk. Mr Balarkas said this could be done with existing regulations, such as independently audited accounts and codes of practice for corporate governance. The group proposes that regulatory requirements for admission should be the minimum possible under UK and EC law. This last market would be governed by the same structure as the national market. The Stock Exchange said the document raised several issues 'which we are sure investors and companies would be concerned about at first sight'. The working party, which is being set up to examine alternatives to the closure of the USM and will be announced in the next few days, was expected to study the proposals closely. It is unlikely the Stock Exchange will accept proposals on easing the class test requirements for the Official List. It is thought to argue that investors would reject attempts to reduce corporate disclosure.</p>

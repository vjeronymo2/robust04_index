Over 500 veteran Red Army men and  veteran cadres who previously worked for the provincial-level  organs happily met together and extended greetings to each  other. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee,  and Dai Suli, former veteran leader of the province, gave  speeches at the party.    There are some 190,000 retired veteran cadres in the  province. Since last year, these veteran cadres have played an  important role in maintaining political and social stability and  building the socialist spiritual civilization.    On behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government, Gu Jinchi extended Spring Festival  greetings to all veteran comrades of the province. After  affirming the positive contributions made by veteran cadres in  accelerating the province's reform and development, he pointed  out: Now that we are precisely in the process of replacing the  planned economy with the socialist market economic structure,  the emergence of new contradictions and new difficulties is  inevitable. Under the new situation, all levels of leaders  should show concern for the weals and woes of veteran comrades  and should do more tangible deeds for them. The first task we  should do for veteran cadres after their retirement is to ensure  that they spend their remaining years in happiness and good  health. At the same time, we should arrange for them to attend  study classes, show concern and love for them politically, and  pay attention to making use of their role.    Dai Suli, former veteran leader of the province, also spoke  at the tea party. He expressed hope that veteran cadres would  study the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping to keep pace with the development of the current  situation. At the same time, he called on veteran comrades to  make best possible use of their remaining strength under the  leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government so that they can truly have something to do in their  old age.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World markets fall on fears of further rate increase in US World equity and bond markets fell again yesterday in the wake of new figures showing robust US economic growth. The data heightened fears of an imminent increase in US interest rates. News of higher-than-expected orders for US manufactured goods in August caused a sharp sell-off in the US Treasury bond market. The 30-year bond fell by nearly a point, driving the yield up to 7.96 per cent in early afternoon trading, close to the psychologically important 8 per cent level. The benchmark bond later climbed off its lows. The weakness of the Treasury market had a negative effect on share prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen 45 points on Tuesday, dropped a further 50 by early afternoon, triggering trading restrictions on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow ended just 13 points down, but declining issues outnumbered advances by a 19-to-three margin. Analysts said the markets feared that the Federal Reserve would raise rates in response to a series of recent economic indicators, possibly after Friday's employment figures. But some bond investors also worry that the Fed is acting too tardily to slow US expansion, making inflation rise sharply. Equity investors are concerned that corporate earnings are being squeezed by rising raw material prices which they cannot pass on to customers, say analysts. With shares looking quite expensive relative to bonds in historic terms, any bond market weakness has prompted shares to fall. European stock markets fell in the wake of the US market weak ness, with the German and French markets closing at new 1994 lows. In after-hours trading, the Dax index in Frankfurt was down 2.1 per cent on the day, while in Paris, the CAC-40 index fell 2.3 per cent. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 45.5 points down, or 1.5 per cent, at 2956.3, to stand at its lowest level since early July. London stocks, Page 48 World stocks, Page 45</p>

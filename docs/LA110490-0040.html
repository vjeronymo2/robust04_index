			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRET REVEALED  </P> <P> Nuts! You've done it again. You just can't keep a secret, can you.  </P> <P> This time it's Hua-Hin, Thailand ("A Royal Retreat," Traveling in Style, Oct.  21). Back in the 1960s, when I discovered Hua-Hin, it was a beautiful escape  from the then-less-crowded Bangkok. Last time I was there, it was all the  nicer, especially after a couple weeks in the Bangkok of the 1980s.  </P> <P> So now you tell the world about Hua-Hin. It's a great service to your readers  and I guess that's what you strive for, but if it's overrun with tourists in  the 1990s, I'll have to lay some of the blame on Stirling Silliphant's fine  story.  </P> <P> WILLIAM TIMLIN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

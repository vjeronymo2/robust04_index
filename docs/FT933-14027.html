			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / MPs attack canteen arm of Treasury THE TREASURY was yester-day attacked by MPs over irregularities in its catering arm, ranging from mismanagement to fraud. The breakdown of control and management of Forward Civil Service Catering - which runs about 175 Whitehall canteens and restaurants - is estimated to have cost the taxpayer between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m. The organisation is part of the Treasury, but run on commercial lines. A report from the Commons public accounts committee yesterday declared the case 'a serious failure in the proper conduct of public business in what is  -or should have been - a straightforward trading operation'. The fact that the 'shambles' - as one MP put it - was the responsibility of the institution charged with monitoring financial control both in Whitehall and nationwide made it 'particularly unsatisfactory'. One MP said: 'You can understand why a taxpayer would wonder why we would think the Treasury could manage the British economy when they cannot run a tea shop.' Forward, which is the in-house caterer to the bulk of Whitehall, has a turnover of about Pounds 30m a year. It has its own chief executive and management board. Its accounts for 1991-92 were qualified after a large number of long-running irregularities came to light. The latest report says the full financial consequences of such failures have yet to be established. To date the consequences comprise Pounds 400,000 lost due to failures in cash handling, up to Pounds 450,000 liability for tax and national insurance, and a Pounds 110,000 fee from accountants Ernst and Young. The main weaknesses and irregularities found were: Failures in cash handling and documentation systems. Fictitious employees entered on the payroll. Payments to casual employees made without deductions for PAYE and national insurance. Failures to comply with purchasing procedures since 1988 - 39 out of 43 contracts were rolled forward without re-tender or a search for alternatives. The person who placed Pounds 5m of contracts discussed with the companies that benefited the financing of his private company. Account records destroyed at four restaurants. The Treasury admitted that it had failed to carry out a 10-year-old recommendation to furnish Forward with proper commercial accounts. MPs did not accept the Treasury's argument that uncertainties over Forward's status and its possible privatisation were reasons for not equipping it with efficient and effective financial systems and controls. The committee demanded that the Treasury pursue 'vigorous' disciplinary action against staff responsible for Forward's lapses. The report says action has been taken against 15 Forward staff, but 'notes' the Treasury's view that action against its own headquarters staff is not appropriate.</p>

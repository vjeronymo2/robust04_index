			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been precisely clarified, following the  return of the special expert team of the Islamic Republic of  Iran to Karabakh, that the C-130 plane belonging to the Iranian  Air Force has crashed in Karabakh region due to a missile fired  by the Armenian forces stationed there.    Based on the investigations conducted by the Iranian team,  the plane had deviated course before the crash due to a  technical problem. The area's control tower and navigation  facilities did not respond to the pilot's request for help and  assistance either.    It must be noted that the Iranian expert team dispatched to  the scene of the C-130 crash did not manage to find the plane's  black box, which could answer so many puzzles.    The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry -- in the  wake of the announcement of the final results of the experts  about the March 28th incident -- condemning the downing of the  C-130 plane, mentioned the bitter tragedy as a clear indication  of the adverse consequences and the rest of the situation in the  region [sentence as heard].    The Iranian plane was carrying 32 people -- including 13  crew, 19 passengers, and 17 women and children belonging to  diplomats' relations as well as two Iranian students residing in  Moscow -- who were returning home on March 18 to spend the New  Year holidays. In the incident even the lives of the innocent  people and other countries' nationals were seriously exposed to  danger.    Assuredly, the responsibility for these acts lies with the  people who are trying to step up the disputes. It is necessary  that proper measures be taken to prevent occurrence of such  pitiable incidents.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, since the outbreak of the  Karabakh conflict, laying emphasis on the importance of peace  and security in the region, has called on the belligerent sides  to search for a peaceful way. To this end, the impartial  mediation by Tehran and the periodical visits of the Iranian  officials to Baku and Yerevan indicate honesty in the part of  Iran to grant help peacefully solve the Karabakh crisis  [sentence as heard].    In (?a lot) of the experts' opinions, the Islamic Republic  of  Iran reserves the right of legal pursuit of the plane crash and  fulfilment of the rights of the incident victims and  compensation for the survivors of the horrible incident.  Undoubtedly those behind the incident should be answerable to  such inappropriate acts.    The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry on Monday  March 28th released a statement requesting the Armenian  Government to identify and punish those behind the incident. It  is natural that such a measure by the Armenian Government can  avert the recurrence of such incidents, which in no way (?help  to) resolve the current disputes and improve the atmosphere  prevalent in the regional relations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Topical interview" with Igor Chekmezov, chief of Russian </F> Federation State Grain Inspectorate, by Pavel Khomitskiy; place  and date not given: "As You Were"]    [Text] The State Grain Inspectorate  (Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya) was created in the Russian Federation  at the end of April, directly subordinate to the government.  Our correspondent talked with its chief -- Igor Chekmezov,  chief state grain inspector of the Russian Federation.    [Khomitskiy] Igor Mefodyevich, why was the grain  inspectorate created specifically under the government? For  there was previously a similar organization under the former  Committee for Grain Products of the Russian Federation Ministry  of Trade and Material Resources, was there not?    [Chekmezov] Yes, there was. Throughout the 70 years of its  existence this was a departmental service. But in August 1992,  in accordance with a presidential edict, the state system of  grain products started to be eliminated, shares in  grain-reception, milling, and groat and mixed-feed enterprises  were floated, and the committee which you mentioned was  reorganized as the "Roskhleboprodukt" Joint-Stock Company,  which, as a commercial structure, lost the functions of state  control. Therefore the Russian Federation Law "On Grain" of 14  May 1993 provided for the creation of the Roskhlebinspektsiya  under the government.    [Khomitskiy] What will be the main functions of the  inspectorate which you head?    [Chekmezov] It is no secret that 15-20 percent of the grain  is lost on the way from the field to the consumer's table.  Therefore our main concern today is to do the utmost to help  reduce and prevent these losses by means of control over  production quality and the rational utilization both of the  grain itself and of the products of its processing. At all  stages. Of course, we also will not lose sight of the  transportation and storage of grain and oil seeds.    It has to be said that at the present time many  organizations  which have the money to get their laboratories accredited have  secured the right to determine the quality of grain and of the  products of its processing. It goes without saying that  discrepancies in issuing descriptions of the selfsame  consignments of grain by different structures are simply  inevitable. A government decree has laid down that certificates  and conclusions by the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya and its organs  locally are obligatory for all legal and physical persons.    I wish to emphasize especially that we will carry out  compulsory state inspections of the quality of grain, the  products of its processing, and oil seeds being supplied for  export, to regions of the Far North, and to military consumers  and consumers equated with them, as well as of those being  imported, with the appropriate certificates being issued. At  the same time we alone will be exclusively responsible for  inspecting the grain being exported.    One of our service's most important tasks in the future will  be to elaborate proposals for shaping state policy in respect of  grain and also to draw up the rules of a civilized grain market.    [Khomitskiy] How will your inspectorate be represented in  the provinces? Who will finance it?    [Chekmezov] Territorial organs of the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya  are being created in all the national formations, krays, and  oblasts where there is commodity production of grain. The cost  of maintaining them will be met out of the federal budget and  from nonbudget sources. What is meant by the latter is our  organs' rendering of paid services -- on a contract basis -- to  all commercial structures conducting grain transactions.    [Khomitskiy] Peasant labor accounts for most of the labor  in a grain product. But as for remuneration, the present  so-called "market" leaves rural folk with not even a share but a  tiny share of the proceeds from sales of grain or grain  products. Does the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya intend somehow to  promote the removal of this injustice?    [Chekmezov] Of course! In connection with the  liberalization of the grain market various commercial  organizations and private persons, who frequently seek to  deceive the commodity producer, have begun making grain  purchases. Therefore, at the request of the grain producer and  on its own initiative, the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya will monitor  the correct determination of the quality of grain in trade  deals. Incidentally, we also intend to do the same when grain  is delivered to elevators and grain-reception centers.    [Khomitskiy] Harvest time is not far off and, like the  sowing campaign, it will require considerable energy sources.  Does the Rosgoskhlebinspektsiya intend to give the commodity  producer any assistance in upholding the idea of parity for the  prices of fuel and lubricants and of grain?    [Chekmezov] You know, it is my conviction that this would be  fair. As for real assistance for peasants on our part, in this  case, again, I see it as the task of our organs locally not to  allow businessmen (but it would be more accurate to say rogues,  who frequently hide behind this fashionable word) to cheat the  rural commodity producer in barter deals (fuel and lubricants  for grain) by means of artificially understating the quality  and, accordingly, the price of the latter.    [Khomitskiy] In conclusion I will ask you to say a few words  about yourself.    [Chekmezov] About myself.... To be brief, I will say this.  After graduating from an agricultural institute, I traveled the  path from agronomist to chief of a rayon agricultural  administration, working on farms in Rostov Oblast's Morozovskiy  and Milyutinskiy Rayons.    From 1975 I worked in the system of the USSR Ministry of  Grain Products, becoming deputy director and then director of  the Morozovsk Elevator, again in Rostov Oblast. In 1987 I was  invited to work on the central apparatus of the USSR Ministry of  Grain Products, and two years later I headed the State Grain  Inspectorate under the USSR Council of Ministers State  Commission for Foodstuffs and Purchases. For the past two years  I led the Administration for Purchases of Grain and Oil Seeds of  the Grain Products Committee of the Russian Federation Ministry  of Trade and Material Resources and headed the "Zerno" Firm of  the "Roskhleboprodukt" Federal Contract Corporation.    [Khomitskiy] Well, in that case you are the right man for  the job, as they say. I thank you for the conversation and wish  you success!</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMAN ENVOYS URGE REFUGEES TO RETURN  </P> <P> East German diplomats set up an office near a refugee camp Wednesday to try to  persuade thousands of their countrymen to give up dreams of a new life in the  West.  </P> <P> By late Wednesday, about 5,600 East Germans hoping to flee to West Germany via  Hungary and then Austria had registered to do so, officials of West German  charities said.  </P> <P> Hungarian charity officials said a sixth refugee camp has opened.  </P> <P> At the Zugliget refugee camp in Budapest, First Secretary Dieter Grahmann of  the East German Embassy began distributing leaflets Tuesday promising the  refugees that no harm would come to them if they returned home. He left quickly  after an angry crowd gathered.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, he returned with a colleague and set up for business in a trailer  across from the camp. Small groups gathered near the trailer shortly after it  was manned at 9:45 a.m., but no one went inside.  </P> <P> "They must really be stupid to come here," said a refugee from Dresden. "But I  guess they have no choice -- it's either victory or Siberia for them."  </P> <P> Grahmann told reporters the refugees are free "to discuss the situation" with  him or a colleague. The East German Embassy said the trailer will reopen today.  </P> <P> Hungarian Red Cross officials at nearby Csilleberc camp said an East German  diplomat carrying leaflets was barred from entry because "it would have been  difficult to guarantee (his) safety," the official MTI news agency reported.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 30 East Germans, apparently frustrated at waiting for a promised  freedom convoy from Hungary to the West, fled illegally Tuesday night to  Austria, Red Cross officials there said.  </P> <P> In May, Hungary partially cleared barbed wire and other barriers from its  border with Austria, an action that helped spark the current exodus of East  Germans into Hungary.  </P> <P> West German officials, who had seemed optimistic last week that a mass transit  westward could begin in days, now are more cautious.  </P> <P> In Bonn, where West German officials have been negotiating with Communist East  German leaders over the refugee standoff, government speaker Hans Klein said  East Germany showed no flexibility.  </P> <P> However, in East Berlin on Wednesday, the official ADN news agency blamed Bonn  for the lack of progress in the talks.  </P> <P> More than 6,000 East Germans have fled through Hungary and Austria to West  Germany since Hungary began clearing its westernmost border in May.  </P></p>

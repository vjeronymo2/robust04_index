			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Ecology parties divide the spoils TWO PARTIES of similar political persuasion which can together capture a combined 14 per cent of the votes in an election, putting them in third place behind the other parties, might see merger as the sensible solution. But, as anyone who watched Sunday night's television debate between the heads of France's two ecology parties will be aware, there is no immediate prospect of a merger between Mr Antoine Waechter's idealistic Greens and the more pragmatic Generation Ecology, led by Mr Brice Lalonde, the environment minister. During the debate an emotional Mr Lalonde repeated his long-standing offer for the two parties to merge. Mr Waechter replied by sternly shaking his head. The ecologists' success was a salient feature of Sunday's poll. The Greens secured 6.8 per cent of the votes and GE claimed 7.1 per cent. This meant that, together, they were the third largest political force, with almost 14 per cent of the poll, just ahead of the National Front. Moreover the ecologists' gains in particular regions - Alsace, Haute-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Rhone-Alpes - should bolster their campaigning strength in next year's national elections. At first glance the ecologists have made significant progress since the 1989 European elections when the Greens, then the only large environmentalist party, captured 10.6 per cent of the poll. The underlying picture tells a different story of the Greens themselves losing ground to the 15-month-old Generation Ecology. It goes a long way to explaining why Mr Waechter is so strongly opposed to Mr Lalonde's overtures. Until GE's emergence, the Greens, with their utopian agenda, were the driving force in French environmentalism and a prime beneficiary of the protest vote against the ruling Socialists. That role has now been usurped by GE which, as one would expect from a party led by a government minister, advocates a more pragmatic form of environmentalism working within the existing political system. Sunday's poll was the first real test of the relative power of the two parties. Originally the Greens had hoped to cling on to a majority of the ecology vote. Instead they were outstripped by GE. Mr Lalonde has long argued that the two movements should merge. So far Mr Waechter has argued against an alliance, although some factions of his movement are known to be in favour.</p>

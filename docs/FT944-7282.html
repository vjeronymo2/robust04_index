			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / People: Faircloth to quit BTR Bob Faircloth, the American credited with turning round Hawker Siddeley following its acquisition by BTR in 1991, is to retire as BTR's chief operating officer at the end of the year. He will become a non-executive director from April. His post will be scrapped - which will leave BTR's five regional chief executives to report direct to group chief executive Alan Jackson. Faircloth, 58, joined the board in 1988 and was promoted to the new position of chief operating officer to handle Hawker Siddeley. Faircloth, who plans to return to the US, was not seen as a successor to Jackson, who is also 58.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Defence group cleared on Iraq case A group of defence consultants, convicted on its own admission in an arms-for-Iraq case, was cleared by the Court of Appeal yesterday after arguing that Customs prosecutors had abused the process of law by dissuading defence witnesses from giving evidence. Atlantic Commercial, based in Cuckney, Nottinghamshire, was fined Pounds 7,500 in November 1985 for exporting arms with intent to evade export prohibitions. Two company directors, Mr Alexander Schlesinger and Mr Reginald Dunk, were fined Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 12,500 respectively. The defendants insisted that end-user certificates showed that Sterling sub-machine guns intercepted by Customs, although paid for by Iraq, were legitimately destined for Jordan and Sudan. They had planned to contest the case and call witnesses from the Iraqi and Jordanian embassies in London. Last June the Scott inquiry heard evidence from Sir Stephen Egerton, former assistant under-secretary at the Foreign Office, when it emerged that Customs, backed by the Foreign Office, had deliberately interfered with potential defence witnesses and persuaded embassies not to allow them to give evidence.</p>

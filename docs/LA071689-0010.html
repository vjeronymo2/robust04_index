			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROXANI GILLESPIE  </P> <P> I applaud Gillespie for trying to fight the lawyers, educate the legislators,  tolerate the crusading, immature professional "consumerists" and reform the  insurance companies. Anyone who has had a claim against an insurance company  knows insurance reforms are needed, but the insurance companies should not be  destroyed in the process. Despite the article's constant references to the  clothes Gillespie wears, her dresses and shoes are unimportant -- it is her  ideas that really matter.  </P> <P> FLORENCE RICHARDS  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

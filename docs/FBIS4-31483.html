			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/6/1994 -- Romania's Supreme  Court, by its civil department, granted [approved] Tuesday, 7  June, the contestations filed by several parties, associations,  and revolutionary unions of the country against a re-birth of  the Romanian Communist Party (RCP.) On 4 May 1994, the  Bucharest Municipality Tribunal approved the application for  registration of the RCP headquartered in Targu-Jiu. RCP founder  Victor Hancu had said then that his party was not a follower of  the former RCP.    After a half-hour deliberation, the Supreme Court ruled the  decision: "To grant the contestations and the intervention  requests, to annul the Bucharest Municipality Tribunal's  decision of 4 May 1994, and to reject the application for  registration of the Romanian Communist Party."    During the trial, the challengers' defendants have invoked  law 51/1991 regarding Romania's national security, Article 3,  Paragraph H, which stipulates: "The initiation, organization,  carrying out, and support in whatever manner of totalitarian and  extremist actions of communist, fascist, or iron-guardist  expression is banned."    In his defense and in defending the party he initiated,  Victor Hancu said: "We are not the followers of the RCP and  most of our members had not been enrolled in the former  Communist Party. We have no former activists in our structures."</p>

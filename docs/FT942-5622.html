			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lonrho spotlights its African interests Lonrho yesterday signalled the next stage in its plan to realise the value of its African assets by saying it might float its general trading activities on the Continent. The move follows the successful market debut earlier this year of Ashanti Goldfields, which valued Lonrho's 43 per cent stake at Dollars 720m - five times its book value of Pounds 90m. It announced yesterday that it was considering selling a minority stake in its African businesses excluding mining or sugar. This though would leave a question mark over the future of these extensive and more profitable operations. Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executives, said in a statement yesterday that Lonrho was setting up a board committee to look at ways of strengthening the group's African trading activities. The shares closed up 3p at 138 1/2 p. Lonrho has a diverse range of trading activities in Africa including motor and equipment distribution, textile manufacturing, electrical goods supply and aircraft services management. The combined businesses are estimated to have a total turnover of up to Pounds 500m and were profitable last year. If a flotation is decided upon, it is likely that the African company will come to the London market, and possibly another, within a year. It is estimated that Lonrho will be looking to sell a stake of about 30 per cent. The company said a sale would help it to determine the value of a mixed range of businesses. It would also strengthen the operations by bringing in outside shareholders who might be prepared to invest further in the businesses. Analysts said the move might be seen as part of a strategy to strip out lower growth businesses Mr Bock has been pursuing since he took charge of the group earlier this year.</p>

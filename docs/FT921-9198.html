			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Latin America 'to double investment' LATIN AMERICA is expected to double its annual investments in the petroleum industry over the next four years, taking advantage of new flows of foreign capital into the region. Mr Alvaro Teixeira, Secretary General of the Association of Latin American State Petroleum companies, said yesterday that new investments in exploration and production between 1992 and 1996 are likely to total Dollars 75bn, an annual average of Dollars 18.75bn, not including the petrochemical sector. This compares with Dollars 8bn invested in 1990 and Dollars 9bn last year. The major part will come from Venezuela, the region's biggest producer, which is embarking on a series of joint ventures, followed by Mexico and Brazil, which has an ambitious programme to become self-sufficient by 1994. Latin America has the world's second largest oil reserves after the Middle East and is at present responsible for 12 per cent of global production. According to Mr Teixeira the new investment drive will increase the region's production from 7.4m barrels per day to 10m b/d by the end of the decade. He said: 'Latin American reserves have increased 600 per cent over the last 25 years - more than any other region in the world. The potential of new discoveries is still very high because the area is still little explored'. Mr Teixeira described the petroleum sector as 'one of the engines of growth of Latin America', which could 'benefit greatly from the region's re-entry into the international financial community'. He said it could be an essential tool for integration, adding that several countries including Brazil and Mexico were negotiating with Cuba for offshore exploration rights and shared use of terminals and refineries.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> BRIDGE CLOSED FOR REPAIRS  </P> <P> The San Rafael Bridge, which crosses a flood control channel on Laguna Road  between San Rafael Avenue and Arroyo Boulevard, is closed until January for a  $1.3-million reconstruction program.  </P> <P> The 68-year-old bridge, one of about 100 reinforced single-span concrete arch  bridges in the state, will be restored to "its original appearance and  load-bearing capacity," said Cynthia Kurtz, project manager for the Pasadena  Public Works and Transportation Department.  </P> <P> Rails and balusters will be replaced, defective concrete will be repaired and  the surface will be repaved, Kurtz said. A new mortar coating will be applied  to much of the structure. The area around the bridge, largely obscured by  vegetation, will be landscaped. The La Loma Bridge a mile north may be used as  an alternate route.  </P></p>

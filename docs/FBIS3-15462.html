Speaking to journalists, he noted that the document will  take  into account all recommendations of the presidential public  chamber approved three weeks ago. These recommendations suggest  extending election campaign in regions until June and not  holding elections to local self-government bodies until the  preparation of a corresponding legislative basis at the federal  and regional levels.    Filatov pointed out that "the elections should not stick to  a  certain date and the issue of fixing it can be submitted to  local governments".    Asked by IF's correspondent, the head of the administration  said that the memorandum on civil accord, the need for which  Boris Yeltsin stressed at an expanded meeting of the government  last Friday can take a shape of a broad agreement between "the  power, influential socio-political parties, entrepreneurs and  trade unions".    In Filatov's opinion, the agreement could include the  government's commitment to fight inflation, entrepreneurs'  pledge to control growth of prices and trade unions' obligation  to control strikes.    The head of the administration believes that such an  agreement would considerably stabilize the situation by the  beginning of the presidential election campaign in 1996. A  working group for its preparation will be formed soon.    Filatov explained that warning the coup plotters amnestied  by  the resolution of the State Duma about their arrest in case of a  new attempt to destabilize the situation in the country, the  president did not mean a ban on any political activities.  According to Filatov, the amnestied have the full right to such  activities in civilized forms, including the right to be elected  to the State Duma.    "If they start again to call for the ouster of the  legitimate  power at rallies, they will be punished", Filatov said.</p>

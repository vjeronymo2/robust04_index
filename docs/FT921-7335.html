			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / BT will cut another 3,100 staff by 1995 BT, the telecommunications group, plans to make a further 3,100 redundancies among telephone operators in addition to 7,500 announced last year. The company told staff yesterday the additional cuts would be made between December next year and the end of 1994. The two redundancy programmes will cut the number of directory and operator staff from 16,000 to 6,000 by 1995. The number of operator centres will be cut from 163 to 83. The additional round of redundancies will be evenly split between directory-service staff and operators, who provide assistance in response to 100 calls. The first round of 7,500 job cuts, planned for this year and next, reflect the way digital technology has improved the quality and reliability of the telephone system, so reducing the need for operator-assisted calls. BT's decision to charge for directory inquiries has also reduced the number of calls to the service. BT is in the midddle of a sweeping job-reduction programme to exploit productivity gains in new-technology systems and to trim management to give the company a more commercial outlook. At a peak in the late 1980s, when BT had to hire staff to help arrest the deterioration in its quality of service, it employed about 247,000 people. With job cuts in the past two years its workforce is about 200,000. Last October BT announced plans for 16,000 redundancies among clerical and engineering staff by March next year in addition to the 40,000 jobs it said it expected to shed in the next few years. BT hopes the latest cuts could be voluntary. Staff affected could ask to be redeployed elsewhere in the company. It is also offering an early-retirement package.</p>

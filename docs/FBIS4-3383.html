			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>   [Text] The Portuguese Prime Minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva,  will meet the Governor, Chris Patten, today to discuss the  run-up to 1997 and Macao's reversion of sovereignty in 1999.    Cavaco Silva, who arrived in Hong Kong yesterday afternoon  from Macao for a two day visit, denied that Chinese leaders had  given him a message to convey to Patten during his seven-day  visit to China last week.    Speaking at a press conference before he left Macao  yesterday, Cavaco Silva said Portugal would strengthen its  presence in Macao after 1999 with the establishment of  Portugal's largest mission in a foreign country.    Unlike Britain's stormy relationship with Beijing, Portugal  has so far avoided any public dispute with China over the 1999  hand-over and both countries regard the enclave as Chinese  territory under Portuguese administration.    "I am very interested in talking with Chris Patten about the  transition periods of Macao and Hong Kong," Cavaco Silva said.  "If I had any message from Chinese leaders for Chris Patten, I  would not reveal it here [in an interview]."    Cavaco Silva also yesterday defended his stance on human  rights during his talks with Chinese leaders -- the Premier, Li  Peng, and President Jiang Zemin.    He has been criticised by the Catholic Church in Portugal  which accused him of not pursuing the issue adequately. The  Portuguese media also accused Cavaco Silva of avoiding raising  the issue in order to acquire trade advantages for Portugal.  But the Prime Minister said that a "discreet" and "private"  approach when dealing with China on the issue achieved better  results than discussing it "on a public square".    Cavaco Silva said Portugal advocated the "Western and  democratic concept of human rights" in its relations with  foreign countries, particularly those in Asia and Africa.    The Prime Minister said Portugal would also make efforts to  establish itself as a gateway for Asian businesses while Macao  constituted an "advantage for the Portuguese" entering China and  other regional markets.</p>

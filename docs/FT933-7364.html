			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Special Report - Courses and Careers: Performing for the future IN A school hall cluttered with the kind of detritus you would normally hope to dispose of in a jumble sale, Helen Adams and Natalia Campbell are busy rehearsing Sue Townsend's Bazaar &amp; Rummage, for the 1993 Edinburgh Festival fringe. It is the student equivalent of coals to Newcastle. Both are taking a BTEC course in the performing arts at Barking College. The fact that they are prepared to spend their summer vacation rehearsing and performing is a measure of their enthusiasm. Neither embarked on the course with precise ideas about her future. Helen intended to study theology at university. Half way through A levels, she was invited by her school's enterprising drama company, Short Back &amp; Sides, to help out with stage management for their 1992 'fringe' production. 'I went up there, and I just loved it,' she recalls. 'I don't think I've ever made such a big decision,' she says. Her parents were supportive, but cautious. 'They thought I'd just get it out of my system and then go back and finish my A levels. But since I've been doing the course, they've really had their eyes opened. They've seen how much I've changed.' Natalia had had early ambitions to study drama. After leaving school she spent some time at the Lee Strasbourg Studio in London. 'At the time I was only 17. It was a bit strong for me, I think. I couldn't handle it.' But after a couple of years at work, she felt it was time for a rethink. 'I started looking for colleges in the area, and I was advised to do a BTEC (a nationally recognised diploma) because it's a much more practical approach. You get involved, rather than just sitting in a classroom.' Barking's two-year full time course is concerned with the development of practical creative skills in drama, dance, music and stagecraft. Most of the work is carried out in groups. Performance and production, a study of the arts in society, and arts administration form the core subjects. Students have the opportunity to specialise in particular areas, but the compulsory units mean that everyone gains experience of all aspects of the performing arts. Helen and Natalia were thrown in at the deep end. Their first assignment was to research and produce a 30-40 minute production. The course is almost entirely practical. The lack of written work may be a relief from the more academic regime of A levels, but in some ways it is even more demanding. 'Everything you do is assessed,' explains Natalia, implying that you cannot get away with three weeks' cramming before a final exam. Students also have to produce a working diary, which forms a personal record between pupil and tutor. It is both a form of self-assessment, and a means of developing critical faculties and an understanding of group dynamics. There are individual tutorials at the end of each project, to focus on any problems which may have arisen. But this is not an encounter group or a course in navel-contemplation - quite the opposite. Natalia notes the way in which the course has developed maturity and communication skills among the students. 'Some people came straight out of school. With seven or eight of us thrown together doing a project, you always get people who clash. But you work it out,' she says. 'So many people have changed in the process of working from September to now. It's unbelievable.' Helen endorses this view: 'It teaches you how to communicate in real life, how to react to different things, and how to accept people, for what they are and what they believe in. A lot of us have different beliefs. We've all come up against it, and we've all found a way of getting on.' One year into the course, how do the two students see their future? 'Since I've been at the college, I've done so many things outside as well. It's opened doors,' says Helen. 'I'm ready for anything, from singing on a Caribbean liner to skivvying in a theatre in London.' Not everyone will enter the arts professionally. But there is more to be gained here than vocational training. Helen and Natalia thought they'd be learning about the theatre, and find they're learning about life. The course breeds confidence. 'I reckon most people at the college will get a place somewhere,' says Helen. 'Everyone's got the enthusiasm to do anything. That's the basis, isn't it?'</p>

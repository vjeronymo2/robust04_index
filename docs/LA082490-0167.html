			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POSTAL SERVICE FORMALLY OPENS CONTRACT TALKS  </P> <P> Postal officials and union leaders today formally opened what will likely be  months of grueling contract talks.  </P> <P> "I hope that the parties will communicate together and work together to gain a  contract marked by fairness and flexibility," Postmaster General Anthony M.  Frank said.  </P> <P> The financially strapped Postal Service is preaching moderation, meaning it  hopes that workers will hold down their financial demands.  </P> <P> But union leaders say their members should not suffer because of management's  inability to improve efficiency and hold down costs.  </P> <P> "We don't want the public to be gouged, but we're not going to take the blame  for poor management either," said Moe Biller, president of the American Postal  Workers Union.  </P> <P> Labor contracts between the U.S. Postal Service and its four largest unions  expire Nov. 20. The labor groups represent 660,000 workers.  </P></p>

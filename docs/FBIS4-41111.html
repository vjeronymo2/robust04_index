			<p>BFN     [Text] The press office of Gosatomnadzor [the State  Committee for Supervision of Nuclear and Radiation Safety]  reports that Amendment 185, which envisages the allocation of  560 billion rubles for ensuring nuclear and radiation safety at  atomic power stations, is missing from the final version of the  federal budget for reasons that have not been established.  Moreover, the Ministry of Atomic Energy pledged to return this  money as soon as it was paid by consumers for electricity  produced by atomic power stations. The amendment was backed by  the State Duma's power-engineering and ecology committees and  was included in the draft budget passed at a second reading.  However, the amendment is not in the final version of the  budget that is due to be approved on 22 June. Atomic energy  industry workers are sounding the alarm, claiming that to shut  down all atomic power stations would require significantly more  funds to ensure minimum safety standards.</p>

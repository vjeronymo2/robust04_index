			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / European Court to hear pension case A GROUP of 78 female employees challenging their employer's right to raise their retirement age to 65 have had their case referred to the European Court of Justice by an industrial tribunal. The women, whose case has been taken up by the Equal Opportunities Commission, are employees of Avdel Systems, an engineering company based in Welwyn Garden City, Herts. In July 1991 Avdel raised its retirement age to 65 from 60, in line with that of male employees, following a decision by the European Court that employers may not offer different pension benefits to men and women. If they still retired at 60, the commission said, 'This means they would have to take up to a 20 per cent cut in their pension payments.' The women complained to the industrial tribunal that their employer was acting unfairly by unilaterally changing the age at which they were eligible for a full pension. In 1991 the European Court, in the landmark case Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange, ruled that companies which required men to work until the age of 65 before receiving full pension benefits while requiring women to work only until 60 were discriminating against men. In response, many British companies moved to equalise pension ages, mostly by raising the normal retirement age for women to 65. In the case of the female employees, Avdel agreed the case should be referred to the European Court for judgment because employers needed to know their legal position, the commission said. The court is scheduled to hear arguments in January by representatives of the Coloroll Pension Scheme intended to settle some of the questions about the equalisation of pensions. Ms Vereena Jones, a lawyer for the commission, which is representing the Avdel female workers, said, 'There are a number of pensions cases waiting to be heard in Europe. The commission feels sure that the European Court would not want employers in Britain to implement the Barber judgment by depriving women of their own pension rights.'</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / OECD may bring in Poland Poland has a realistic chance of becoming a member of the OECD by 1996, Mr Jean-Claude Pays, the secretary general of the Paris-based organisation said yesterday at the close of a visit to Warsaw. Poland and the other central European post-communist countries, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have since 1990 participated in a 'Partners in Transition' programme with the OECD, and last February the four formally applied for membership. Negotiations for full entry are to start 'shortly', Mr Pays said. He noted that Poland was doing well in its transition to a market economy and that its macroeconomic situation was under control. Mr Pays said the talks would include subjects such as the necessary changes in Polish legislation to bring the country's laws into line with OECD rules, on issues such as the right to transfer capital freely.</p>

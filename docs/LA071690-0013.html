(NACP) has announced that it will cancel its New Orleans convention this fall  if the governor signs into law a bill requiring labels on explicit records.  </P> <P> The threat was the latest complaint about the bill, which would be the first  state law of its kind if passed. "If this bill becomes law, concert promoters,  recording artists and community retailers will be driven out of business," NACP  Director Carl Freed said in a statement. "They are being made scapegoats by  soap box politicians." GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

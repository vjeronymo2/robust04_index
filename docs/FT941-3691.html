			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Carlson and Accor form joint venture in business travel agency Carlson Companies of the US and Accor of France, two of the world's biggest travel groups, plan to merge their business travel operations into a 50-50 venture, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, this summer. The new venture, to be based in London, will vie with American Express for the position of the biggest travel agency. It will have 4,000 branches in 125 countries with annual revenues of Dollars 10.8bn (Pounds 7.3bn). The two companies being merged are the Carlson Travel Network, the second biggest travel agency network in the US, and Accor's Wagonlit Travel, a Paris-based agency operating in 125 countries. The companies will combine their business travel operations in countries where they overlap and set up new operations where neither company is represented. The companies said the merged operation would enable them to provide a better service to international businesses which increasingly required global travel management services. Other offices covered by the deal include the Carlson P. Lawson Travel offices and the Voyages Bel-Air business travel offices in Canada. Carlson's AT Mays holiday business in the UK and its Neiman Marcus branches in the US are not included. Carlson Companies, Carlson Travel Network's parent, is one of the largest private companies in the US. It is headed by the Swedish-born billionaire Mr Curt Carlson, 79, who founded it in 1938 to sell trading stamps. Its three main activities are marketing, hotels (including the Radisson chain) and travel. Accor is a Paris-based travel, tourism and businesses services company operating 2,250 hotels under the Sofitel, Novotel, Motel 6, Mercure, Ibis and Formule 1 names. It also operates 700 restaurants and owns the Europcar car rental business.</p>

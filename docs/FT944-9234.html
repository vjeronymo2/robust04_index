			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Big US retailers advance sharply in third quarter Three of the biggest retailing groups in the US - JC Penney, Dayton Hudson and Home Depot - yesterday reported strong increases in earnings for the three months to October. Their results coincided with the latest monthly report from the US Commerce Department showing that retail sales rose by 1.1 per cent overall in October and by 0.6 per cent excluding the volatile auto sector. Both figures were much higher than expected. JC Penney, enjoying a third consecutive year of strong sales and record earnings, increased third-quarter net income by 24 per cent to Dollars 274m from Dollars 221m, excluding an extraordinary charge in the year-earlier period. Earnings per share, excluding extraordinary charges, rose to Dollars 1.04 from 83 cents. The increase was flattered by a one-time tax charge the previous year: pre-tax profits were up rather less, by 13 per cent. The gain also reflected a 9 per cent increase in sales revenues, which the company attributed to better targeting of goods in its stores and catalogue. Dayton Hudson, owner of the Target and Mervyn's store groups, saw a surge in net income to Dollars 67m from Dollars 43m, with fully diluted earnings per share rising to 83 cents from 53 cents. Total revenues rose by 9 per cent to Dollars 5.05bn, while same-store revenues increased 3 per cent. The company said Target had continued its strong performance, and Mervyn's, which suffered difficulties last year partly because of the sluggish Californian economy, had improved from a low base. The department store division, however, had come in slightly below expectations, with operating profits unchanged. Home Depot, the biggest home improvement retailer in the US, reported a 36 per cent surge in third-quarter net income to Dollars 141m from Dollars 103m, with earnings per share rising to 31 cents from 23 cents. Sales revenues rose by 40 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn, while on a comparable store-for-store basis they rose by 9 per cent. During the quarter the company opened 15 new stores, including 13 in the US and two in Canada. Tiffany, the US jeweller, increased net income to Dollars 4.7m from Dollars 3.3m on sales up from Dollars 135m to Dollars 160m. It said the figures reflected strong retail sales growth in the US, where same-store sales were up 12 per cent, and in Japan.</p>

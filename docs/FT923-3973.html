			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: HK and China Gas announce 21.5 percent increase HONG Kong and China Gas, the local monopoly supplier of piped gas, yesterday announced a 21.5 per cent increase in net profits to HKDollars 472.2m (USDollars 61.1m) for the six months to June, writes Simon Davies. The results for the company, which is better known as Towngas and is controlled by Mr Lee Shau-kee's Henderson Land, were in line with stock market expectations. Turnover increased 12 per cent to HKDollars 1.53bn. Mr Lee said he was confident of further increases in sales for the full year. In the past year, Towngas has connected 65,057 new customers. The company's expansion of its Tai Po plant is proceeding according to schedule, and upon completion in the first quarter of 1993, it will double overall production capacity. It will 'be adequate to meet Towngas demand into the next century', said Mr Lee. The new plant will leave another site redundant and available for redevelopment into a residential property complex. The company will pay an interim dividend of 36 cents. This compares with the payout of 36 cents in 1991, adjusted for the company's bonus share issue.</p>

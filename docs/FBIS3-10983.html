He  called the plan by Haitian parliamentarians anticonstitutional  and not in compliance with the Governors Island agreement. The  plan contains nothing but flaws, Martineau explained.    [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] Another refugee boat  sank off the Bahamas. According to the latest reports, there may  be another 50 deaths. In Miami, Daniel Buron has been  assassinated. The Keep-an-Eye-on-Them Organization [Veye Yo] and  the entire community of Little Haiti in Miami are in mourning.  In Haiti, lawbreakers are sowing death.    Meanwhile, a plan is moving around the streets, promising to  resolve the crisis like a magic wand. This plan does not comply  with the country's Constitution. In addition, it does not comply  with the Governors Island agreement, neither in what it says,  nor in what it means to say. Since this plan came out, people  have been hearing comments about it from time to time, but  nobody has asked the Haitian people -- who voted for the  Constitution and who voted for President Aristide -- what they  think. So we, who are speaking on behalf of the president the  people elected, think it would be good to recenter the ball:    1. When Gen. Cedras signed the Governors Island agreement,  he did it on behalf of an institution called the Army.    2. The international community has imposed an embargo on  Haiti because of the coup d'etat. So the embargo cannot be  lifted if Gen. Cedras alone goes. The coup d'etat must be  eradicated.    3. Lt. Col. Michel Francois has caused the deaths of many  people in Haiti. He is not a soldier. He is a butcher. The  Haitian people want justice. They do not want to reward him for  his crimes.    4. The constitutional president is the head of the Army  even though he is not directly in charge of it. The Army is not  a state within the country.    5. It [not further identified] is so flawed that it allows  people to say whatever they want. We want the international  community to keep in mind that the crisis must be resolved in  favor of democracy, not in favor of a coup d'etat. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["More Than 20 Arrested in Connection With Jalisco Bomb </F> Attack" -- NOTIMEX headline]    [Text] Guadalajara, Mexico, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The State  Judicial Police [PJE] have reported that more than 20 people are  under investigation in connection with the car-bomb explosion  that occurred early Saturday morning in this Jalisco State  capital.    The PJE reported that those arrested were in possession of  weapons. Carmen Victoria Coronel, wife of Juan Jose Quintero  Payan, was among those arrested. Quintero Paya apparently is a  relative of drug-trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. The police  also reported that authorities seized a briefcase containing  4,000 new pesos and $7,000 in cash, as well as an additional  14,110 new pesos.    As part of the investigations, police raided the residence  of  Luis Enrique Fernandez Hurtado, who was not arrested, and seized  seven AK-47's, known here as "goat horns"; an R-15 rifle; and a  .45 caliber pistol.    It also has been reported that the people killed in the bomb  blast have been identified as Marcial Gonzalez Muniz and  Guillermo Gomez Chavez. Manuel Delgadillo Paez, director of the  Investigations Department of the State Attorney General's  Office, also reported that experts are working to determine what  kind of explosives, and how much, were used in the bomb.    At 0200 (0800 GMT) Saturday, a Ford Grand Marquiz exploded  in  the parking lot of a Guadalajara Hotel where a birthday party  was being held. Two people were killed and five others injured  as a result of the explosion. The hotel management has filed a  property-damage suit against whomever is found guilty of the  attack.    The police also reported that their investigations have  established that two stolen cars were parked in the parking lot  in which the bomb exploded.</p>

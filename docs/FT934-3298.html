			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Food side boost for Greenalls Hordes of hungry drinkers helped Greenalls, the pubs and hotels company, to increase annual pre-tax profits by 19 per cent before exceptionals to Pounds 68.3m. Sales were 13 per cent ahead at Pounds 596m for the year to September 24. Pre-tax profits, after exceptional charges of Pounds 15m in 1992, rose by 61 per cent. Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman, said the 25 per cent increase in food sales to pub customers had helped the group to return 'a solid performance in what has not been an easy market'. Beer consumption was still under pressure, he said, with sales 3.3 per cent lower than last year. Devenish, the 550-strong pubs chain acquired for Pounds 214m in July, contributed Pounds 18.5m in sales and Pounds 4.8m in operating profit. Mr Thomas said he was confident that the integration benefits highlighted at the time of the acquisition would be more than achieved. All divisions, with the exception of the fruit machines and drinks business, improved during the year. Drinks and leisure had been hit by a 'very difficult first half for soft drinks,' Mr Thomas said. However, trading had stabilised in the second half. The pubs division, excluding Devenish, showed a 6 per cent increase in operating profit to Pounds 50.3m on sales just 2.3 per cent higher at Pounds 190.2m. The branded pub restaurant and lodge business increased by 19 per cent at the operating level to Pounds 10m. Greenalls' hotels division benefited from improved occupancy rates of 67 per cent, against 60 per cent last year, and a return to profit in the US. Occupancy had been improved at the expense of average room prices, however, which fell from Pounds 48 to Pounds 43. The off-licence division was held back by redundancy charges and stiffer competition from supermarket chains. Off-licences showed a marginal 0.6 per cent improvement in operating profits to Pounds 4.5m. The group took a Pounds 77m write-down against its revaluation reserve to cover its hotels and pubs. Mr Thomas said that in the light of recent controversy surrounding hotel valuations, the company had decided to examine the portfolio 'fairly carefully'. The final dividend is increased to 7.28p for a total 5 per cent higher at 12.36p. Earnings were 59 per cent higher at 28.55p, although just 4 per cent higher to 28.46p before exceptionals. COMMENT Investors who felt Greenalls had paid what was politely called 'a full price' for Devenish will be pleased at the better than expected progress so far. The group has also shown unexpected resilience in non-pubs businesses. Nevertheless, even Greenalls is making cautionary noises about the immediate outlook for beer consumption and it is uncertain just how much more can be taken out of the already lean Devenish. The hotels business is also likely to be a late cycle developer. Forecasts are for about Pounds 84m, with a prospective p/e of 14 times. Although the shares are sitting at a small discount to the market, it might still be early days.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Capt 3d Rank M. Shepovalenko based on foreign </F> publications: "`The Great Wall of Steel' (Present Status and  Prospects of Development of the PRC Navy)"]    [Text] The Chinese People's Republic is one of the oldest  sea powers, one possessing the experience and possibilities for  building almost all classes of ships. It has also developed the  concept of using its naval forces to defend national interests.    The origins of the Naval Forces of the People's Liberation  Army of China (VMS NOAK)--such is the official name of the  Chinese naval fleet--date back to 1954, when the Soviet Navy  started transferring submarines, destroyers, patrol escorts,  minesweepers and torpedo boats to it. Some of these ships were  assembled at Chinese ship building plants on the basis of our  technical documents, and out of parts, structures, units and  machine units we supplied. Later on the Chinese began copying a  number of Soviet ship designs with the technical assistance of  our specialists. This went on for almost a decade, which may be  considered to be the first stage in development of Chinese  warship construction.    After Sino-Soviet relations "went cold" in the mid-1960's  and  our specialists were called back home, the Chinese leadership  found itself facing the need for developing this sector of  industry on its own. The period from the second half of the  1960's to the early 1980's is the second, transitional stage of  the navy's development. It was characterized by construction of  ships and submarines that were a further development of Soviet  designs.    The mid-1980's were marked by entry of Chinese ship building  into its third, modern stage. Its typical traits are: a quest  for new concepts, and extensive development and implementation  of original designs of warships and auxiliary vessels of various  classes.    The "Program of Balanced Development of the Navy to the Year  2000" was developed in the PRC on the basis of the strategy of  "coastal oceanic defense" adopted in 1989. Several programs are  being implemented in parallel today in accordance with this  strategy. Construction of submarines--both nuclear-powered and  diesel-electric--is considered to be a priority direction in  this case.    Development and construction of "Xia" class SSBNs (type 092)  is an important accomplishment of Chinese ship builders. It was  laid down in 1978, and launched on 30 April 1981; however,  difficulties arose later on in "perfecting" the missile system  launching "Julang-1" SLBMs. The first launching of this missile  from an experimental submarine in 1985 was unsuccessful, and it  was not until September 1988 that a test launch was graced with  success. This was, moreover, after the SSBN had already been  introduced into the navy (Figure 1).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-37A>      Figure 1. "Xia" Class Nuclear-Powered Ballistic-Missile Submarine </FIG>     It is considered that the SLBM "Julang-1" (CSS-N-3 according  to the Western classification) is outfitted with a single  2-megaton nuclear warhead. However, the level of development of  Chinese missile technology, which was sufficient for the  launching of three satellites to different orbits simultaneously  by a single launch vehicle in 1981, provides the grounds for  supposing that this SLBM may be fitted out with a multiple  warhead. The possibility is not excluded that "Xia" class SSBNs  will be re-armed in the second half of the 1990's with a new  missile system launching "Julang-2" (CSS-NX-4) SLBMs, presently  under development.    Despite the fact that the "Xia" class SSBN is inferior to  similar American, British, French and Russian submarines in  level of technological execution and performance  characteristics, its introduction into the navy marks the  beginning of creation of the sea component of the triad of  Chinese strategic nuclear forces. Deployment of SSBNs in the  Yellow and East China seas significantly raises China's military  potential, and can significantly influence the strategic  situation in the Asia-Pacific region.    It was believed for some time that the lead SSBN would be  followed by three to five similar submarines to permit  maintenance of a normal combat patrol cycle. However, the fact  that this submarine is still the only ship of its class  indicates that it is experimental, and that it is being operated  in order to acquire experience in the combat use of naval  nuclear forces, and to perfect the design to permit construction  of a series of SSBNs of a new class (type 094). It is expected  that they will possess 16 launchers for higher-range SLBMs, and  that construction will begin in the second half of the 1990's.    Construction of the "Han" class multipurpose nuclear-powered  submarine (Figure 2), which was started in the first half of the  1970's, is continuing as well. There are presently five such  submarines in the fleet's force composition. According to  reports in the Western mass media a number of design  shortcomings were revealed in the lead submarine of this class,  including in the nuclear reactor reliability system. Also, its  noise level was high, and the effectiveness of external lighting  and weapon control systems was low. Consequently, improvements  were made in ships of this class beginning with the third hull.  The design of the propulsion unit was improved, "Ying-ji-1"  anti-ship missile launchers firing from surfaced position were  installed behind the bridge, and the sonar system was  modernized, with the French DUUX-5 sonar system at its basis.  However, feeling that launching anti-ship missiles from surfaced  position would sharply increase the submarine's vulnerability,  the command of the VMS NOAK is considering, as one of the  priority directions in this issue, arming them with anti-ship  missiles launched from torpedo tubes. According to reports in  foreign military periodicals, Chinese representatives conducted  negotiations with a number of Western companies with the goal of  acquiring some weapon systems, state-of-the-art external  lighting systems, and technical documents for their subsequent  production under a license. They include the MINICIN inertial  navigation system and the Pivair (SPS) periscope with  conventional and infrared observation channels produced by  France's Sazhem [transliteration], and a sonar system with a  long towed antenna manufactured by America's Westinghouse. Of  course, in view of aggravation of American-Chinese relations at  the turn of this decade and the fear the Americans have of  losing their technological leadership, conclusion of the last  deal is rather problematic.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-38A>      Figure 2. "Han" Class Multipurpose Nuclear-Powered Submarine </FIG>     An orientation on the French SSBNs "Le Redoubtable" and  "L'Inflexible" and "Rubis" class nuclear-powered submarines is  noticeable in the design of "Xia" SSBNs and "Han"  nuclear-powered submarines respectively. Similarities include  the hull lines, the propulsion unit and propeller, and the  arrangement of the weapon systems. And the choice of the  external illumination and weapon control systems with which to  modernize them, which are once again French-made, is another  indication of continuing cooperation between the PRC and France  in development of China's nuclear-powered submarine fleet. In  this case, in addition to significant attention to building  nuclear-powered submarines, in the opinion of Western  specialists China's main efforts will be concentrated now and in  the next decade on modernizing diesel-electric submarines, which  represented 92 percent of the submarine forces of the VMS NOAK  at the beginning of the present decade.    The most numerous among them are the "Romeo" class  submarines  created on the basis of technical documents for the type 633  Soviet medium submarine. They were built in two large series: in  the 1960's (type 031--the base modification ES3B) and in the  first half of the 1980's (type 033, improved). However, these  ships have also grown obsolete, and despite the fact that the  more up-to-date French DUUX-5 sonar system was installed in the  last submarines of the second series, in the estimation of  specialists their ASW capabilities are rather limited on the  whole. Moreover they are starting to be actively transferred to  the reserves in connection with expiration of their useful life.  Consequently, in the 1970's China began building new "Ming"  class (type 035) submarines. In this case three submarines of  the first modifications (ES5C and ES5D) of this class were built  in 1970-1979. And such a slow pace of their creation permits the  supposition that Chinese specialists encountered serious  technical problems. This is also confirmed by the fact that  construction of "Ming" class submarines was suspended for a  certain time, and construction of "Romeo" class submarines was  resumed. It was not until 1987 that construction of "Ming" class  submarines was resumed, but only two such ships of the new ES5E  modification were created.    In the opinion of specialists this is associated with the  fact that the "Romeo" submarine type long exhausted the  possibilities for further modernization. Which is why a new  submarine (type 039) is being planned. It is being developed on  the basis of the French "Agosta" class submarine. Its  construction and commissioning are possible in the second half  of the 1990's. It is anticipated that its hull will have a drop  shape, and its lines will resemble those of the "Albacore"  class. While the main dimensions and displacement are comparable  with "Ming" class submarines, there are plans to increase the  radius of operations of the new submarine, its diving depth, its  submerged speed and the power of the propulsion unit. The  submarine will probably have a single shaft, which together with  the improved hull lines will help to reduce its noise.    By the way, although noise reduction occupies one of the  important directions of work in Chinese submarine building, this  is not a priority objective at this stage. This is explained by  the fact that the relatively shallow and warm waters of the seas  adjacent to the Chinese coast significantly complicate  antisubmarine warfare, and thus significantly reduce the  effectiveness of modern ASW forces of the navies of the world's  leading countries in these regions. The current concept of the  use of the VMS NOAK does not presently foresee the navy's  emergence onto the ocean, which is something for the more remote  future.    Construction and commissioning of a number of surface ships  of a new generation was typical of China in the late 1980's and  early 1990's. Thus, the "Luhu" class guided missile destroyer  (type 052), which was transferred to the navy in 1993, is the  first ship of this class of specifically Chinese design. It is  the most powerful warship ever in the force composition of the  VMS NOAK. The destroyer is well armed in antiship and  antisubmarine respects, including with antiship missile system  launchers, as well as modern electronic systems. Design  deficiencies include the relatively weak surface-to-air  armament: Although the short-range Crotale Navale-PDMS  surface-to-air missile system and four 37-mm twin H/PJ-76A guns  provide reliable air defense for the ship, it still is point  defense. It has a combined diesel and gas turbine propulsion  unit, which together with the smooth hull lines and modern  superstructure architecture significantly improves its seagoing  qualities and endurance.    According to the handbook Jane's Fighting Ships  the lead ship will be followed by a second destroyer. The  possibility is not excluded that construction of the series will  end with this, and the operating experience will be accounted  for in developing the design of a new guided missile destroyer  in the second half of the 1990's.    "Luda" class (type 051) guided missile destroyers are  currently undergoing modernization, during which they are to be  equipped with the French THOMSEA ASBU [automated tactical  control system], which includes the TAVITAC BIUS [combat  information command and control system] and the Vega missile and  artillery fire control system. New radar and sonar,  radiotechnical and ECM systems, a navigation system and a  communication equipment outfit produced in China on the basis of  licenses from a number of French firms are also to be installed  (Figure 3).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-023-39A>      Figure 3. "Luda" Class Guided Missile Destroyers </FIG>     Destroyers ("Luda-III" class) are armed with new ASM  systems--four twin launchers of the Ying-ji-1 ASM system (the  bow twin launcher of the ASM system is adapted for launching  SU-1 antisubmarine missiles). New 37-mm twin turret guns are  installed in place of four 25-mm and four 57-mm deck guns.  Antisubmarine armament was also reinforced with the installation  of two 324-mm triple-tube type B515 torpedo launchers firing  A244S torpedoes. New electronic equipment was also installed  aboard the destroyer: a towed variable-depth sonar system, and  airborne and surface target detection and fire control radar,  developed on the basis of Western models. The stern 130-mm and  57-mm twin gun mounts on ships undergoing modernization under  the "Luda-II" project are being dismantled, and replaced by a  helicopter pad and a hangar for two Zhi-9A helicopters and a  SAFECOPTER takeoff and landing support system.    Construction of "Luda" class guided missile destroyers  obviously came to an end with introduction of the "Zhuhai"  guided missile destroyer into the force composition of the navy  no later than 1993.    Construction of new "Jiangwei" (type 055) guided missile  escort ships is continuing. The lead ship was placed within the  force composition of the navy in late 1992. In terms of the  level of automation and availability of different weapon systems  and electronic resources this escort ship is the most up-to-date  ship of its class. It carries a six-container Hongqi-61M SAM  system launcher (an improved version of the Hongqi-61 system).  The aft Ying-ji-1 ASM launcher group is possibly adapted for  launching SU-1 antisubmarine missiles. Another two "Jiangwei"  class guided missile escort ships are presently in different  stages of construction, and the series will number a total of  four to six units.    Beginning in the mid-1980's China started modernizing  "Jianghu" class (type 053) guided missile escort ships. The hull  structure was changed on escort ships modernized as the  "Jianghu-III" version (type 053HT): A twin deck bearing four  stationary Ying-ji ASM launchers was added; the number of 37-mm  twin gun mounts was reduced from six to four. The outfit of  electronic equipment was supplemented by a Chinese ASBU, a  early-warning aerial observation radar, ASM system and  universal-caliber artillery fire control radar, light AAA fire  control radar, and radiotechnical and ECM systems. The lattice  mast was replaced by a tower. There are presently two  "Jianghu-III" class guided missile escort ships in the force  composition of the VMS NOAK.    In early 1993 a "Zhoushan" guided missile escort ship of the  new "Jianghu-IV" modification was transferred to the navy. It  differs from series "Jianghu-III" ships in having a somewhat  altered ASM launcher, which is associated with adoption of a  modified variant of the Ying-ji-1 ASM of greater firing range.  The second guided missile escort ship of the "Jianghu-IV" class  was launched in 1992.    The guided missile escort ship "Siping", which was finished  as the "Jianghu-II" version (type 053HT(H)), was transferred to  the navy in 1986. Together with the "Luda-II" modification of  the "Jinan" guided missile destroyer, it became the first  helicopter-carrying escort ship within the VMS NOAK.    The design of the ship's hull from the first ASM launcher to  the stern was altered with the purpose of installing a  helicopter pad and hangar: A helicopter deck was added, the  second ASM launcher was dismantled, and the shape and height of  the falshtruba [false stack?] were changed. Changes were made in  the armament: A French one-barrel 100-mm Creusot Loire gun mount  and two type ILAS triple-tube 324-mm torpedo launchers firing  A244S torpedoes were installed. The outfit of electronic  equipment was supplemented by the French NAJA electron-optic  sight for fire control of the 100-mm gun mount, the SAFECOPTER  helicopter takeoff and landing support system, and two launchers  firing Mk.33 SRBOC passive jamming munitions. The ship carries  one Zhi-9A helicopter.    Modernization efforts on other "Jiangu" class guided missile  escort ships of the basic plan have been limited up until now to  replacement of the single-barrel 100-mm gun mounts by twin gun  mounts of the same caliber, and installation of early-warning  aerial observation radar, as well as fire control radar for two  twin 100-mm guns. Fire control radar for four 37-mm twin gun  mounts was installed aboard some ships.    Modernization of the "Jiangdong" class (type 053K) guided  missile escort ship was started in 1992. There are plans to  install Western-made modern weapon systems and illumination  resources or their Chinese analogues aboard these ships.    New escort ships--the "Luhu" class guided missile destroyer  and the "Jiangwei" class guided missile escort ships--were  initially planned and built as helicopter carriers: The former  carries two and the latter carries one Zhi-9A helicopters, which  are the Chinese version of the French Dauphin-2 helicopter. The  armament of the Zhi-9A helicopter includes Italian A244  antisubmarine torpedoes or American Mk.46 Mod.2 torpedoes,  French HS-12 submersible sonar systems, and a magnetometer. The  helicopter can be equipped with four ASM for action against  surface ships.    Two ship-based Ka-27 helicopters acquired in Russia were  transferred to the navy in 1993 for testing and evaluation. If  they exceed the Zhi-9A in their performance characteristics,  China may purchase an additional lot of Russian helicopters, or  the license to manufacture them.    The "Houjian" class (type 520) small guided missile ship was  built and transferred to the navy in July 1991. The new small  guided missile ship carries strengthened missile and artillery  armament, which is twice greater in comparison with existing  classes of long-range warships. It is intended for action  against surface ships on the outer perimeter of the seas  contiguous with continental China. In the future it is to be  outfitted with PL-9N close-range surface-to-air missile systems.  From all appearances it is an experimental platform intended to  study the problems of combat use of small guided missile ships  and to check the effectiveness of new models of armament and  equipment installed aboard them.    The "Houxin" class (type 037-II) small guided missile ship  is  the missile variant of the "Haijui" class small ASW ship. The  lead ship was placed in the force composition of the navy in  1991. There are five such small guided missile ships in the  force composition today, and another three are in different  stages of construction. The rate of construction is three ships  a year. Introduction of such small guided missile ships into the  navy will make it possible to partly compensate for transfer of  obsolete "Hegu" and "Huoku" class missile boats and their  subsequent retirement.    In 1992 the navy began receiving LSM class small amphibious  warfare ships of a new design. With a displacement of 600  tonnes, their loading capacity is 150 tonnes and they can be  used to land personnel and tracked and wheeled equipment on an  unimproved coast, and supply ammunition and provisions to  troops. In distinction from small amphibious warfare ships built  earlier, the ship's superstructure is shifted from the stern  closer to the middle, which improved its controllability and  seagoing qualities. The ship's artillery armament includes bow  and stern 25-mm twin automatic guns. The cruising range is  around 1,000 miles at a speed of 12 knots. It is anticipated  that by the end of 1993 there will be not less than three small  amphibious warfare ships of this class in the navy's force  composition.    By the second half of the 1980's the minesweeping forces of  the VMS NOAK were considerably worn and obsolete. They now  possess insignificant possibilities for laying and sweeping  mines.    Class T-43 (type 010) ocean minesweepers, built in China in  the second half of the 1950's on the basis of Soviet technical  documents, reached the limit of their useful life by the  mid-1980's. And in connection with the absence of a new design  of a mine warfare ship, the naval command decided to resume  their construction.    Beginning in 1988 the navy started receiving "Wosao" class  coastal minesweepers. By now there are five coastal minesweepers  of this class in the forces, and another three ships are in  different stages of construction. The rate of construction is  one ship a year. The new minesweeper carries two types of  acoustic (sonic and infrasonic), electromagnetic and small  contact sweeps, and it is armed with two 25-mm twin automatic  guns. Its hull is made from steel with low magnetic properties.  The coastal minesweeper can also be used as a harbor and a river  minesweeper. It will replace the "Fushun" and "Lienyun"  minesweepers, refitted correspondingly out of "Shanghai-II"  patrol boats and fishing trawlers.    The long-range plans for developing minesweeping forces  foresee construction of a new class of mine warfare ships by the  mid-1990's--minehunters. Chinese developments in this area are  complicated by the absence of modern mine detection and sweeping  resources, in connection with which Chinese specialists intend  to turn to foreign developers. There are plans for basing the  design on the Italian "Lerici" class minehunter. Nor is  cooperation with England's Vosper Thornycroft excluded.  Negotiations were conducted with it on this matter by the  Chinese side in 1988. There are also plans to make foreign  purchases of mine-seeking sonar and sweeping equipment with the  right of its licensed production.    In 1988 the "Bieliejian" class minelayer was transferred to  the navy as the lead ship in a series of three units. With a  displacement of over 1,000 tonnes, it has bow and stern mine  holds, each of which is equipped with a crane, and side ports  for the mine tracks are located on the stern transom. The  artillery armament of the ship consists of four 37-mm twin gun  mounts.    Construction of the "Hainan" class small ASW ship (type  037),  which began in 1963-1964, is continuing (it is based on our type  201 ASW launch). A number of changes were made in the basic  design: The single mast was replaced by a tripod, a surface  target detection radar was installed on it, and underwater  illumination resources were supplemented with a French SS-12  variable-depth towed sonar system. A similar sonar system is  also being installed aboard "Haujui" class (type 037-1) small  ASW ships, which are a further development of the "Hainan"  design. The numerical strength of fleet forces of the VMS NOAK  is shown in the Table.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fleet Forces of the VMS NOAK as of 1

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Thus construction of warships of a new generation and  modernization of ships within the force composition of the navy  since the 1970's indicate transfer of the line of detection of  the probable enemy and of fire effect upon him from coastal  waters to the outer perimeter of the seas bathing continental  China. However, in terms of their combat capabilities these  ships still cannot be considered to be ocean-going ships.    A shortage of financial resources will obviously prevent the  VMS NOAK from initiating large-scale series construction of new  ship designs in the immediate future; most probably ships will  be built in small series with the goal of testing and evaluating  new weapons and illumination systems. Priority in developing  surface forces will obviously be given to creating escort ships  such as guided missile destroyers with ASM systems providing  zonal air defense, and guided missile escort ships with  specialized antisubmarine armament. Mine warfare ships armed  with modern mine warfare resources will also enjoy further  development.    Evaluating the prospects for developing the navy's light  forces, it should be noted that construction of new missile and  torpedo boats is not currently proceeding. Launches of these  types within the fleet forces of the VMS NOAK satisfy modern  requirements in general, but a significant number of them are  worn, and require replacement.    In the second half of the 1980's China continued  construction  of "Huangfen" class missile boats (type 021), making changes in  the composition of the missile and artillery armament: Eight  (four twin) or six (two twin stern and single bow) stationary  Ying-ji-1 ASM launchers were positioned on the sides of the  boats in place of four Feilong-2 ASM launchers, and 30-mm twin  gun mounts and fire control radar were installed in place of the  bow and stern 25-mm twin automatic guns. The outfit of  electronic equipment was supplemented by radiotechnical and ECM  resources.    The transition to building small missile ships, however,  does  not mean rejection of further development of the  small-displacement type of missile boats. Thus, in an  international arms exhibition in Abu Dhabi in February 1993 the  Chinese delegation displayed plans for a small missile boat 31 m  long with a 118 tonne displacement, armed with four Ying-ji-1  ASM launchers and a single-barrel 76-mm turret gun, the Oto  Melara Super Rapid. In comparison with the "Hegu" and "Huoku"  missile boats, this one is equipped with improved electronic  equipment, and it has a propulsion unit with a greater power  reserve (two diesel engines manufactured by Germany's MTU).    New "Huludao" and "Huxin" patrol boats are continuing to  enter the fleet forces of the VMS NOAK and river forces of the  border troops of the People's Armed Militia.    The "Huludao" class gunboat is a reduced version of the  "Barkat" gunboat (Chinese-made), which is operating with the  coastal defense forces of Pakistan. The boat's displacement was  reduced from 400 to 180 tonnes, with no change in its overall  layout. In contrast to the Pakistani model, the artillery  armament of the new boat is limited to bow and stern 14.5-mm  automatic guns (type 81). The boat's radius (1,000 miles under  economical power) allows it to effectively patrol the 2,000-mile  economic zone. The navy possesses four gunboats, and a fifth is  under construction.    The "Huxin" class river gunboat is a modification of "Hapu"  class boats. It has a higher freeboard and an altered  superstructure configuration. Series production of the new boats  began in 1989. There are currently eight "Huxin" class gunboats  in operation, and another four are nearing completion.    Thus presence of a large grouping of combatant craft in the  present stage (over 500 units) generally permits successful  completion of the missions of fighting surface ships and  maintaining favorable operating conditions in China's coastal  zone.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Czech-Russian Talks Are Faltering </F> on the Concept for the Structure of Imports"]    [Text] Although the outcome of the visit by the Russian  delegation that was holding talks in Prague this week on Czech  outstanding claims in Russia did not live up to expectations,  they are still not a reason for skepticism. This is roughly the  opinion of Jan Hronik, who took part in the talks on behalf of  the Trade and Industry Ministry. During his visit to Moscow in  April and within the framework of his talks on restructuring the  Russian debts, Vaclav Klaus also agreed with the Russian prime  minister that the list of goods that Russia, during the course  of this and next year, would deliver to Czech enterprises as  part payment of its debts will be signed in May. In Prague,  however, the Russian delegation -- according to Hronik --  submitted a list of goods that does not correspond to the  requirements and needs of the Czech side, even if the goods were  to be earmarked for reexport. Apparently, the bulk of the  Russian list was made up of engineering products, which are  manufactured in the Czech Republic, while the Czech side would  be interested, first and foremost, in certain Russian raw  materials. Nevertheless, the two sides are willing to work  further on the list and to harmonize their concepts, although it  is clear that the Czech Republic will, obviously, be more  active. There already exists a draft mechanism whereby the  receipts from the eventual import of Russian goods would be  divided between the enterprises that have outstanding claims in  Russia. Their overall amount hovers around $300 million.    A little progress was also made on the possibility of  capitalizing these outstanding claims. In Prague, the Russian  side submitted proposals for facilities in which the state is  still involved and that the Russian state would perhaps be  willing to offer the Czech enterprises in return for their  outstanding claims.    This involves, for example, electrical engineering and  petrochemical products and some unfinished facilities. The  Czech firms interested in capitalizing their outstanding claims  in Russia can already "hold consultations" with the Russian  State Committee for the Administration of State Property --  which is the local version of the Czech National Property Fund  -- on their concepts. Nevertheless, a law is only now being  drafted in Russia that would make foreign investment possible by  a form of capitalizing outstanding claims.    Russia does not have the slightest wish to include oil and  gas in the list of goods suggested as a part payment of its  debts. Nevertheless, following the Prague talks, it seems that  an inter- governmental protocol could be signed in the  foreseeable future that would guarantee the Czech Republic a  long-term Russian supply of both oil and gas. Whereas, in view  of the envisaged diversification of sources, the precise volume  of oil would be specified every year (this would involve roughly  7.0 million tonnes per annum), in the case of gas, the protocol  would define directly the amount for each year (8.0 billion  cubic meters in 1996 up to 10.5 billion in the year 2000).  Naturally, the payment for the oil is expected in convertible  currencies at world prices and at world conditions, while part  of the gas could perhaps be paid for by Czech construction and  supplies for the Russian gas industry and by transit services.</p>

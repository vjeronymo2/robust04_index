			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Arts: Fun with The Bard - Theatre Peter Whelan is one of the best contemporary British playwrights. If his work has a fault, it is that he is a bit long on research and short on fun. See, for examples, The Bright and Bold Design about politics in the Potteries, and School of Night about the politics of Christopher Marlowe. In short, he is a trifle earnest. This has now been rectified in a glorious new entertainment called Shakespeare Country. The erudition remains, but there is champagne to go with it. The piece is a wonderful mixture of pure wit and sheer corn. Shakespeare country is what it is: Stratford-upon-Avon on Midsummer night. The RSC is actually playing the Dream, tickets changing hands for fabulous prices on the black market. The actors playing Oberon and Titania are about to get married in real life. Visitors arrive from Germany, the US and Japan, all of them admirers of the Bard. Everyone goes off to the woods and much the same happens as in Shakespeare's play: confusion all round, except that here the agent is not a fairy potion, but a Japanese 'friendly tablet' taken in coffee. The scholars among them specialise in esoteric subjects like Shakespeare's foot fetishes. The American claims to be a direct Shakespeare descendant through an illegitimate line. He has discovered a play called Love's Labour's Wonne, (the famous elusive text if it ever existed), but thrown it away because Shakespeare would never have spelled 'wonne' like that. The Japanese phones his company in Tokyo in his excitement about the effects of the tablet. A British army sergeant turns up to evict them for their cavorting on what has become the property of the Ministry of Defence. He, too, turns out to be a Shakespeare lover. All ends happily, of course, just like the Dream. Shakespeare text is cleverly woven throughout the play, but there is the voice and sheer fun of Whelan as well. Who can resist this line? 'It's not the policemen getting younger, it's the King Lears getting younger, that makes me feel old.' There is a lovely scene when the tablets get mixed up and the elderly German man falls for the young Japanese male. And who would have guessed that you could turn Shakespeare's sonnet 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' into a song and sing it all the way through, country and western style? It could be a hit; certainly it has very good words. The whole evening is a delight. The occasion is the second Biennal sponsored by British Telecom under which the same play is performed at the same time in about 50 amateur theatres around the country. I saw it as the admirable Questors in Ealing, where the part of the English academic is played by Whelan's wife Ffrangcorn. There are still a few performances to go in the course of this week in places stretching from Wrexham to Carlisle and Brighton. Catch one where you can.</p>

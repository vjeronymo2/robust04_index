			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 May (DPA) -- The private  Caracol radio station reported the Colombian Government decreed  a state of internal disturbance tonight, thereby preventing the  release of more than 700 inmates, including dangerous  terrorists, drug traffickers, and guerrillas. This mechanism  authorizes President Cesar Gaviria to issue special, temporary  laws without the approval of the National Congress.    This is the only mechanism available to the Gaviria  administration to prevent the mass release of inmates upon the  completion of their prison terms because public prosecutors have  failed to study their cases to begin their trials.    The decrees issued by Gaviria during this period will be  valid for as long as the state of exception is in effect.  According to the Constitution, the state of internal  disturbance could last 90 days and could be extended for an  additional 90 days.</p>

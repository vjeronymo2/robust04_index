			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by SIM: "Russian Troops Left Their Bases and </F> Radiation" -- first paragraph published in boldface]    [Text] The ecological problems of disarmament will be  discussed at a planned seminar at Narach lake under the auspices  of the Belarusian Defense Ministry, the State Committee for  Ecology, and the Belarusian Academy of Sciences.    An area of more than 4.5 million hectares has been vacated  after the withdrawal of certain units of the Russian Strategic  Missile Forces. Use of this land, however, has been complicated  by the fact that increased radiation has been observed at  numerous sites. For example, in Marina Horka -- one of the  Russian units' bases -- the level of radiation exceeds the norm  by 10 times. There have been reports that radioactive emitters,  which were used for didactical purposes, were stored here. The  lack of controls and natural aging of the emitters have led to  the increased radiation levels. At Rechytsa, a radioactive  waste dump which has been handed over to the Belarusian Interior  Ministry, radiation is detectable within 200 meters of the  perimeter. Since the dumping ground is located in an  unprotected forest area, the local citizens -- unaware of any  danger -- are taking advantage of nature's bounty there.</p>

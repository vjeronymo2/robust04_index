			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Biggest ever intra-day margin call from LCH The London Clearing House, which clears London's four futures exchanges, yesterday made a record intra-day margin call, reflecting sharp movements in contract prices. The LCH made margin calls totalling almost Pounds 500m on members holding long positions in bund, Bobl, BTP long gilt and FT-SE 100 contracts, when initial margin limits were breached. It also increased margin rates on bund, BTP and FTSE futures and options, and some stock options, effective March 7. Margins act as deposits on futures contracts and are returned when positions are closed.</p>

That notice described the provisions of CITES for listing species in the appendices and set forth information requirements for proposals. The present notice announces the proposals received, explains why the Service does not intend to consider certain proposals, and describes those proposals that will receive further consideration prior to a decision as to whether to submit any of these proposals to the CITES Secretariat by the June 10, 1994, deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service received proposals from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (FFPS), ICCAT Watch (a coalition consisting of the Center for Marine Conservation, the National Audubon Society, and World Wildlife Fund-US), the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Oregon Natural Resources Council, by September 28, 1993. These organizations proposed adding or transferring nine different taxa, and in addition, EIA proposed transferring all bird species listed in Appendix III to Appendix II. In addition, the Service is considering the development of certain other proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service continues to consider submitting proposals to amend the appendices for the following species: Narwhal (for possible transfer from Appendix II to Appendix I); musk deer (for possible listing of species or populations in Appendix I); saiga antelope (for listing in Appendix I or II); box turtles (add to Appendix II); copperbelly water snake (add to Appendix II); bluefin tuna (add to Appendix II); whale shark (add to Appendix II); requiem and hammer-head sharks (add to Appendix II); tarantulas (add to Appendix II); Port-Orford-Cedar (add to Appendix II with its logs, sawn wood, and veneer only); bigleaf mahogany (add to Appendix II with exclusion of secondary and finished products); and two genera of African mahoganies with their logs, sawn wood, and veneer only (for possible listing in Appendix II). The Service will continue to consider a listing of freshwater pearly mussels that will provide protection to the most endangered while excluding those easily identifiable species that are used in the pearl bead industry and that are not believed to be threatened by trade. The Service is also considering a proposal to remove the non-African populations of aloes from the appendices. In addition, the Service at the suggestion of the CITES Nomenclature Committee will consider developing a proposal to clarify the present listing of the urial,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ovis vignei. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

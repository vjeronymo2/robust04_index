Having seen scorn and super-ciliousness from Lumley in AbFab we know just how effective she can be (9.00 ITV). Anyone who has worked in a hospital knows that there really does seem to be an odd association between the incidence of death and the sex drive of the staff. An instinct to keep population figures steady? Who knows, but Cardiac Arrest is the first hospital series I have seen which captures the frenetic atmosphere (9.30 BBC1). The BBC2 series True Brits tells 'The Ambassador's Story'. David Gore-Booth leaves the Foreign Office to take up his new post as ambassador to Saudi Arabia and the programme records his meetings with Salman Rushdie and the Queen (9.30). Crimewatch UK screens its 100th edition, its proponents still arguing that its help in solving certain crimes somehow justifies thoroughly nasty re-enactments of often violent incidents (10.00 BBC1).</p>

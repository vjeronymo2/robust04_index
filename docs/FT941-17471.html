			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Rival bidders weigh up final moves  -Paramount The four-month Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) takeover battle for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group, should reach a climax by Friday, the last date for rival bidders Viacom and QVC Network to increase their offers. QVC, a cable television home shopping channel, has the edge. It is offering Dollars 92 a share in cash for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock and a mixture of securities for the remainder. Viacom, a cable television company, is offering Dollars 85 a share in cash for 51 per cent, plus a blend of securities. However, Viacom is expected to announce a higher bid this week after negotiations with two backers - Nynex and Blockbuster Entertainment. They are believed to want improvements in the terms of their investment, as well as a greater say in the running of Viacom-Paramount. The central question is how much control Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, is prepared to give up. The current takeover terms would leave him with around 70 per cent of Viacom-Paramount's voting stock. He could boost his bid by selling voting shares to partners. Assuming Viacom bids again, QVC will have to decide whether to go still higher. The stock market doubts it, since it has been depressing the share price of whichever looks the victor. The winner, in other words, may be the loser.</p>

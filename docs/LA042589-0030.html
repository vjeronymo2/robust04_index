			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS' TOP PICK TESTED POSITIVE FOR STEROIDS  </P> <P> The Chargers confirmed Monday a Pittsburgh Press newspaper report that Burt  Grossman, their first-round selection in Sunday's National Football League  draft, tested positive for steroids at the January scouting combine workouts in  Indianapolis.  </P> <P> The Monday report said Tom Ricketts, an offensive lineman at Pitt and former  college roommate of Grossman, also tested positive. The paper quoted Pittsburgh  Steelers Coach Chuck Noll as saying the Steelers were aware of Ricketts'  positive test even before they made him the 24th player selected in the first  round.  </P> <P> Noll said it was his understanding that Ricketts' steroid use was small in  dosage and only for the purpose of healing a sprained arch.  </P> <P> "I believe that's exactly the story with Grossman," said Steve Ortmayer, the  Chargers director of football operations. "It (the steroid use) was to help his  injury heal."  </P> <P> Grossman suffered through much of the 1988 season with a sprained ankle.  According to new NFL steroid guidelines, Grossman could be subject to weekly  steroid tests for up to two years.  </P> <P> "Our guys are not worried about it," Ortmayer said. "We are not at all  concerned."  </P> <P> The testing ends as soon as the traces of steroids clear the body.  </P> <P> Monday was Billy Joe Tolliver's first chance to meet the local media. And Texas  Tech quarterback, the Chargers' second-round draft pick, lived up to his  Texas-style name.  </P> <P> He said he grew up in the tiny town of Boyd, Tex. (population 800), about 35  miles northwest of Fort Worth.  </P> <P> "Let me tell what an adjustment this is for me being in San Diego," Tolliver  said. "I can remember when I was about 4 or 5 years old, we lived out in the  country. We didn't have a lot of money and it didn't take much to get by.  </P> <P> "One day, my dad just decided he was gonna take me and my mom down into Fort  Worth to let her window shop. My mom didn't get to do much (in Boyd).  </P> <P> "We get into Fort Worth and we go into this big ol' store, glass on the outside  and everything, and we walk inside and my dad tells my mom, just go on and look  at all the stuff she wants to see and we'll just stand here and wait for her.  </P> <P> "So we're just sitting there in the lobby and my mom, she's just having a day  out there. Now I look down the hall and there's these two big silver doors. I  asked my dad, I said, 'Pop, what are those down there?' And he said, 'I don't  know. Let's go look at it and find out.' So we walked down.  </P> <P> "I can remember looking at these doors and my pop standing there checking them  out. And all of a sudden they open up and we're just standing there amazed. And  this lady walks up and she had to be the ugliest woman I'd ever seen in my  life.  </P> <P> "I was only 4 at the time, but she was really ugly.  </P> <P> "She walked inside those doors in that little closet and then all of a sudden  they closed up and I'm looking at it and I see numbers flashing -- 2-3-4-5-6.  And then it stops.  </P> <P> "I'm looking at my dad and he's looking at the numbers. Then all of a sudden it  goes 5-4-3-2-1. And the doors open up and the best looking woman you've ever  seen in your life stepped out of that thing.  </P> <P> "I'm looking at my dad and I said, "Pop, what is that? How'd that happen?' He  goes: 'I don't know, boy. But you need to go get your momma. We'll run her  through it a couple of times.  </P> <P> "That's how small a town we are."  </P> <P> The rest of Monday was devoted to announcements of the Chargers' late-round  picks. They started in the seventh round by selecting Florida State's Marion  Butts, a 6-foot-1, 248-pound fullback. According to Seminole offensive  coordinator Wayne McDuffie, Butts is "John Dillinger in head gear." The  Chargers were especially impressed with Butts' special teams' play.  </P> <P> Later in the same round, they chose Tulane quarterback Terrence Jones. Henning  compared Jones to Miami utility back Jim Jensen, who can line up at wide  receiver, running back or quarterback.  </P> <P> The Chargers' eighth-round pick was Nebraska wide receiver Dana Brinson, who is  only 5-9 but an excellent punt returner. In the ninth round, they opted for  Syracuse tight end Pat Davis. In the next round, they got Ricky Andrews, an  inside linebacker from Washington. And their last selection of the day was  Florida State running back Victor Floyd.  </P> <P> The Chargers traded their 12th-round choice to Washington for the Redskins'  12th-round selection in 1990.  </P></p>

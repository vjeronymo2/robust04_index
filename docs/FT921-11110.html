			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Nalgo's membership increase bucks trend NALGO, the public-services union, increased its membership by more than 15,000 in the last year against a background of declining member rolls suffered by most unions. Membership stands at 759,735, an increase of 15,282 on last year. That is slightly more than in 1987, since when numbers had declined until this year. One factor in the latest expansion has been an increase in numbers of white-collar workers in local government, which represent the bulk of Nalgo's membership. The Local Government Management Board said councils had added 13,500 white-collar workers to their staff in the year to September. Mr Alan Jinkinson, Nalgo general secretary, said the membership increase was a vote of confidence in the union and its policies.</p>

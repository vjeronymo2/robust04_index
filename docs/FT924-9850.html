			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: SAS rules out any role in a Continental bid SCANDINAVIAN Airlines Systems (SAS) has decided not to participate in any of the bids for Continental Airlines, the US air carrier which has been in bankruptcy since late 1990. SAS has had a co-operation agreement with Continental since 1988, under which it feeds around 150,000 passengers a year into Continental's US network. This was cemented by a Dollars 106m investment in Continental, since written off. The Scandinavian carrier said yesterday that it saw no point in making a further investment in Continental as the co-operation was now 'firmly established' and would continue. SAS has three members on the Continental board. AIR Canada has failed to agree terms for a merger with rival Canadian Airlines International, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The terms of a pre-merger agreement made by Air Canada and PWA, parent of Canadian, on October 8 'contained conditions that cannot be met'. The deal is 'unachievable', Air Canada said. Under the merger plan, Air Canada and Canadian would have continued as separate entities while a new holding company would have been formed with shareholders of each group exchanging their stock for new shares in the holding company.</p>

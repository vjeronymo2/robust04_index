			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Uncertainty over North Korea takes toll on region Shares posted small losses in low volume as investors remained inactive due to uncertainty over the North Korean situation and the movement of the yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 53.42 at 20,473.09 after a low of 20,369.07 in the morning and a high of 20,534.51 just before the close. Domestic and foreign traders were initially braced for heavy selling due to political uncertainty on the Korean peninsula following the death of President Kim Il Sung at the weekend, but were surprised after most investors failed to react. Late afternoon arbitrage selling, however, eroded earlier gains. Volume was 210m shares against 342m. 'People who were expecting a sell off and were waiting to buy shares at lower prices were disappointed and failed to join the activity,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 4.72 to 1,656.16 and the Nikkei 300 lost 0.74 to 300.74. On the first section, 653 issues declined while 301 advanced, with 209 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.39 to 1,343.73. Consumer spending related stocks were up on hopes of a rise in consumer purchases due to the hot summer weather. A sharp rise in sales of summer items such as air conditioners, summer clothing, and beer, has been encouraging investors, and prompting some Japanese economists to call the current heat wave a 'divine wind'. Among retailers Takashimaya rose Y50 to Y1,530 and Matsuya Y20 to Y685, while Kirin Brewery, the leading beer manufacturer, added Y20 to Y1,240. Mitsubishi Oil, the most active issue of the day, rose Y40 to Y1,150. Reports that the company had discovered a second oil field of Vietnam helped to fuel interest. Large capital stocks were sold on profit-taking. Kawasaki Steel fell Y6 to Y348 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y12 to Y788. Electricals were also weaker, with Hitachi down Y20 to Y1,030 and Toshiba falling Y8 to Y801. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 93.35 to 23,018.65 in volume of 17.6m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y100 to Y6,890 on profit-taking. Roundup Seoul was unnerved by developments in North Korea, but elsewhere the region could find few fresh investment incentives. SEOUL was overshadowed by uncertainty following the death of North Korean president Kim Il-sung, although the composite index recovered from an early 2.1 per cent fall to finish 7.54 lower at 948.84. The early decline was the result of a lack of immediate information about the heir, Kim Jong-il, together with news of the indefinite postponement of the scheduled summit. One analyst commented that the outlook for the Seoul market was one of heightened uncertainty in coming months from a political view, but with much more realistic prospects of economic benefits from a more open policy in the North in the long run. Trading houses, which had recently gained momentum on hopes of bettering North-South relations, lost ground more than other shares. Its sub-index shed 23.97 to 734.99. TAIPEI saw intensified buying in the heavily weighted financial sector in the last minutes of trading which pushed the market 2.1 per cent higher, although some brokers noted increasing profit-taking. The weighted index rose 127.73 to 6,313.00, but turnover fell to TDollars 68.86bn from TDollars 85.38bn in Saturday's short session. The financial sector added 3.9 per cent, with China Development up TDollars 6 to TDollars 162. Petrochemicals also saw strong buying because product prices have been rising in recent weeks. SYDNEY finished close to a 10 month low, the All Ordinaries index dipping 3.7 to 1,961.2, with a lack of local economic news and conflicting influences from other bourses making for lacklustre trade. The day was punctuated by activity surrounding Bridge Oil, which fell 1 cent to 90 cents with 12m shares changing hands as Parker &amp; Parsley Petroleum built its stake. WELLINGTON fell to a year's low, driven more by lack of interest than specific factors, and the NZSE-40 capital index closed down 10.42 at 1,945.51. Analysts commented that the strength of the local currency, at a 40-month high, was a negative for some exporters, but helped to support interest rates. But confirmation from Westpac Bank that mortgage interest rates were on the rise came as little surprise and was expected to have only a minor negative impact on equities. MANILA fell 1.6 per cent in the absence of fresh incentives. The composite index fell 40.1 to 2,543.75. HONG KONG remained aimless, the Hang Seng index giving up another 38.02 to 8,394.94 in turnover that fell to HKDollars 1.78bn from Friday's HKDollars 2.60bn . Recently steady utilities fell victim to profit taking and suffered the heaviest losses. Hong Kong Telecom, an index heavyweight, dipped 20 cents to HKDollars 13.80, China Light dropped 30 cents to HKDollars 37.20 and China Gas eased 15 cents to HKDollars 13.15. SINGAPORE closed lower with interest in Malaysian shares traded over the counter quickly waning as investors turned cautious. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 11.69 lower at 2,151.25. On Friday, a late spate of buying in OTC shares was seen following a recycling of old rumours that an early Malaysian general election was about to be announced. KUALA LUMPUR gave up early gains and closed mostly lower on profit-taking although the composite index put on 1.10 to 988.88, bolstered by a MDollars 1 gain in Genting, the casino owner. BANGKOK was in negative territory throughout the day on concerns about US interest rates. The SET index closed 8.97 lower at 1,278.37, up from the day's low of 1,273.08. KARACHI saw profit-taking on settlement day as brokers offloaded blue chips fearing that the market's retreat was gathering pace. The 100-share index fell 35.14 or 1.6 per cent to 2,227.62.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion in the "World Studio" program </F> entitled "NATO, the Promised Land, Viewed From the East" with  Geza Jeszenszky, Hungarian foreign minister; Gyula Horn,  chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party; Gyula Kodolanyi,  state secretary and foreign political adviser to the prime  minister; and Jozsef Szajer, leader of the foreign policy group  of the Alliance of Young Democrats; moderator not identified --  live or recorded]    [Excerpts] [Moderator] Let us start with the question of  whether Hungary is threatened by any outside danger, and from  this point of view, just how necessary this NATO membership is.    [Jeszenszky] Perhaps I shall start, since at present I am  responsible, with several of my colleagues, for the security of  the country. I think that at the moment, no direct danger  threatens us. I do not know of a country which would want to  attack Hungary with its soldiers and army.    However, Hungary has been occupied several times in the 20th  century. [passage omitted] I think even a child knows in Hungary  that in the past 50 years in Europe, peace was saved by NATO.  Thus, in Europe, NATO is the only effective security  organization in possession of armies and forces; I think it is  totally understandable that I would like to see Hungary in NATO.    [Horn] I agree with the foreign minister that there is no  immediate danger. It is my conviction that none of our  neighbors would have any reason or perhaps means to initiate any  kind of attack against Hungary. [passage omitted] However, I  feel that this region, Hungary included, is in a security policy  vacuum.    I fully understand NATO, that it did not want to take on  this  unstable region by offering NATO membership. Even if the  Russian behavior, or the Russian issue does not mean a veto  factor for them [NATO], they had to consider whether the region  was a destabilizing factor for the world or for Russia.    I would argue with Mr. Woerner on one point: I do not  believe  that if a new situation develops, any sort of consultation with  NATO will help us.    There is something else which is more important for me: The  important thing is how can we come to an agreement with the  neighbors and what sort of policies shall we follow in  connection with Russia and other countries of the region. This  will be the key question concerning our security. The other is  our relation with the European Union. [passage omitted]    [Szajer] [passage omitted] I think that the main principle  of  Hungarian foreign policy must be to ensure the conditions for  Hungary to complete the integration strategies. The real token  of this is full NATO and European Union membership. I think  that there are no other priorities. [passage omitted]    [Moderator] What is our hope, until perhaps NATO accepts  Hungary as a member?    [Kodolanyi] [We can trust] in the fact that Hungary is a  stable country at present and no neighboring army threatens us.  [passage omitted]    [Horn] I cannot agree with the idea formulated by Jozsef  Szajer that our only savior -- either from an economic or from  security aspect -- is NATO membership. Because Brussels and  Prague made one thing clear, and that is that a very long period  has to pass before NATO will accept us. I understand this NATO  position. But what should we do now? Will our security be  doubtful until then? No. I see this: that the Partnership for  Peace program is progress of a kind. [passage omitted]    I do not narrow the question of our security down to our  neighbors. However, I consider it a fundamental issue. All  external attacks throughout history came from there. We have no  say in the formation of parliaments and governments in the  neighboring countries and God forbid that Hungarian foreign  policy would become involved in this. This is the internal  affair of the people living there.    We have to cooperate with the people who are elected and  considered legitimate in the respective countries, like it or  not. I do not like quite a few members of the Romanian  leadership, but I do not elect them. We must take the  initiative in order that reconciliation should come about.    We must strive for reconciliation and must not keep harping  on about our historical grievances. Step by step, we have to  establish the trust which is lacking. For this is the situation  today. And the West will also be a partner to us in this. The  West will be no partner of ours if we clash with each other and  increase tension among ourselves.    [Jeszenszky] I entirely agree with [Hungarian Socialist  Party] Chairman Horn that we have to strive for good relations  with our neighbors, this is obvious. This is also included in  the program of the Hungarian Government.    Anybody who followed the events of the past three and half  years, can see that Hungary made several initiatives which were  sometimes answered, sometimes not. My latest visit in Belgrade  also indicates that Hungary always took steps even in situations  laden with new conflicts. It is out of the question that  Hungary would be responsible for these [present] relations.  [passage omitted]    I can most categorically state that the Hungarian Government  and other responsible factors -- I include the opposition, too  -- did everything possible recently to bring about a compromise  with our neighbors. So this compromise is not up to us.  [passage omitted]    [Szajer] In reaction to what Mr. Horn said, I did not mean  that NATO membership is the only guarantee for our stability. I  also agree that approaching the European Union is the primary  political goal of the country. [passage omitted] However, it  could happen easily that we miss the boat, for signs already  indicate that the West is taking more and more notice of  Russia's opinion. [passage omitted]    So we have to draw the conclusions from this and we have to  relate to the situation in a pragmatic and realistic way, but at  the same time, every opportunity must be utilized.    [Moderator] But what will happen if the negative alternative  comes about, that is, if Zhirinovskiy or the likes of him come  to power in Russia? Since Mr. Kodolanyi has already referred to  the possibility of having a common border with Russia again in  the future. Are we prepared for this negative scenario?    [Horn] I do not see the situation as being so dramatic.  However, I consider the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon to be a big  challenge and one must react to the situation by all means,  because unfortunately, this phenomenon can find followers easily  in other eastern-central European countries, too. However, the  danger of this does not exist for the time being.    As regards the issue of our neighbors, we should survey the  past four years as a whole and there were manifestations during  this period which did not do much good for our relations with  our neighbors. However, let us leave this and look ahead.  [passage omitted]    It is not disputed by anybody that our wish to join NATO  must  be [officially] maintained. However, I have to add that when  touring the country I found that people do not seem to think the  same way about this. On the contrary, many people question the  wisdom of joining NATO after having gotten rid of the Warsaw  Pact. [passage omitted] This is why our party proposes to hold a  referendum on the matter in order to form a true national  consensus.    For the West, the Soviet factor in the past, and now the  Russian factor, has always enjoyed absolute priority. They have  always approached their former allies -- today the  central-eastern European states -- via the Soviet factor and  Moscow. This will prevail all along as long as Russia remains a  superpower and, chiefly, a main nuclear power. Unfortunately,  this is the reality. And no matter how much we wriggle, we  cannot avoid facing this. [passage omitted]    [Jeszenszky] I do not want to boast, but Hungary -- and  perhaps Poland -- played a very significant role in devising the  Partnership for Peace program. When it was announced the first  time, back in October, it was rather a lean offer. It was  expanded a lot since then, and it was the Americans themselves  who acknowledged at the Prague meeting that this was already  something different from what it had been at the start. [passage  omitted]    The issue, where there is rather a sharp conflict between  the  HSP and other parties, is the issue of the referendum. I do not  consider the method of referendum a good one, especially not  before an election. I said a few days ago here on the radio  that the MDF is in favor of NATO membership, but I did not say  that everybody who wants NATO membership has to vote for the  MDF. What I say is that if you vote for the MDF, or Fidesz  [Federation of Young Democrats] for that matter, you vote for  NATO membership at the same time. [passage omitted]    I think that we can spare the country from an unnecessary  and  costly referendum if all parties state their position clearly in  their election manifesto. [passage omitted]    [Horn] As for the question of Partnership [for Peace], I  would be cautious with the adjectives. I say that it is a  clever invention which is rooted in reality and I can only  support it, not that this matters much. On the one hand, it  maintains the opportunity of cooperation but on the other hand,  it does not oblige NATO to anything which would be impossible  for NATO. [passage omitted]    And just to remind everybody, to clear any misunderstanding,  Hungary was not liberated by NATO. True, Western help was  necessary, but in Hungary, a conscious process, directed from  above, took place in the interest of changing the regime, in  cooperation with the opposition at the time. I think you can  all agree with this.    As for the other issue, whether or not the Warsaw Pact or  Moscow considered us as cannon fodder, I would be a bit cautious  with this, I did not feel it that way. It was true that they  wanted to create a buffer zone and this is how they looked on  the central-eastern European states.    I have to say that we weirdly encounter the same today in  quite a few Western manifestations, when their policies in  connection with Russia are discussed; we are a kind of buffer  zone here. Let us not kid ourselves. [passage omitted]    It is no use telling NATO or Mr. Woerner to handle us  separately [from the other eastern-central European countries].  It became fully clear after the summit [in Prague] that these  countries are handled together -- you can keep on saying the  same in the next few years, it is totally unrealistic. [passage  omitted]    What is most important for us in these matters is that  reality has to be taken into account to the greatest extent. It  is not a bad thing for foreign policy to be adapted to reality  and to be flexible, [while at the same time] preserving its  essence. [passage omitted]</p>

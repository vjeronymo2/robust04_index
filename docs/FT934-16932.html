			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Handcuffed Howard aims to crack the whip: As the Tories try to regain the initiative on law and order FT writers look at the crisis in the criminal justice system MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the home secretary, has an unenviable task when he replies to the debate on law and order at the Conservative party conference on Wednesday. He will be under intense pressure from constituency representatives to regain the ground which has been lost to the skilful campaigning of Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman. Opinion polls show that after 14 years of Tory government, public confidence in the police and criminal justice system is low. According to Mr Robert Seabrook QC, vice-chairman of the Bar, the reasons for public unease include a succession of miscarriages of justice, concern about the integrity of the police and a feeling by victims that the police are uninterested in their fate. But righting these matters will involve far-reaching changes which are unlikely to produce quick results. Take the Sheehy report on police pay and conditions. Many of the 272 recommendations in Sir Patrick's report are uncontroversial, but the introduction of fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay have produced an outcry among police. While Mr Howard may be prepared to give ground on the more controversial recommendations, the comfortable relationship between the police and the Conservative government has been weakened. Implementing even a watered-down version of Sheehy will make it harder to win police co-operation for a more effective drive on law and order. The courts are no less of a challenge. Mr Howard has on his desk the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which produced 352 recommendations in July. Chaired by Lord Runciman, the commission was set up in 1991 after a series of well-publicised miscarriages of justice. When it reported public concern had shifted from miscarriages of justice to what was seen as the inability of the courts to convict criminals. Steps that make miscarriages of justice less likely now need to be balanced by measures to ensure that the guilty do not escape justice. However, sending more people to prison would add to Mr Howard's troubles in accommodating the growing prison population. Sentences are already increasing, according to Mr Stephen Shaw, director of the Prison Reform Trust. He said: 'The number of prisoners has been rising at 500 a month this year.' The prison population would top 50,000 by 1995, not the end of the decade as had been projected. The growth has been accelerated by the repeal in May of elements of the 1991 Criminal Justice Act that promoted the use of community-based penalties rather than custodial sentences. Mr Charles Elly, vice-president of the Law Society, said that the speed with which this had been done would be regretted. The act had been too rigid, he said, but 'the government's complete volte-face has gone too far the other way - they need to get into equilibrium'. The temptation for Mr Howard at Blackpool will undoubtedly be to announce something new to an audience hungry for action. However, his hands are tied on the Sheehy report, on which he has promised to say nothing until the government publishes its response at the end of the month. Measures to make prison regimes 'more austere' would be a risky option. The leaking of a Home Office memo in August setting out such wishes was widely blamed as a factor in the prison riot at Wymott jail in Lancashire, which caused Pounds 20m of damage. Mr Shaw said: 'The prison system is more volatile than at any time since the Strangeways riot. Officials will have advised him that if you play party politics with the prison system, you're likely to come unstuck.' Lord Williams QC, a former chairman of the Bar and Labour's legal affairs spokesman in the House of Lords, said the government needed to recognise that short-term policy responses had created even greater problems. The Dangerous Dogs Act, the Bail (Amendment) Act and the Aggravated Vehicle Taking Act to outlaw joy-riding had all been expensive white elephants. Lord Williams added that having to review the 1991 Criminal Justice Act just seven months after its introduction said it all.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CRIMINAL JUSTICE - THE AGENDA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   COURTS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice were:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- End defendant's right to choose jury trial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Shorter sentences to those who plead guilty through formalised plea bargaining  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Disclosure of defendants' case before trial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Closer liaison between police and Crown Prosecution Service at the investigation stage  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Continuous video recording at police stations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- More caution about confessions but no requirement for supporting evidence  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Independent review of miscarriages of justice  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  POLICE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Main recommendations of Sir Patrick Sheehy's report were:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten-year contracts for new recruits, subsequently renewable every five years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Performance-related pay  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lower starting rates for new recruits  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ending of many overtime payments and allowances  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Retirement age up from 55 to 60 and full pensions after 40 years instead of 30 years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Abolition of ranks of chief inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The home secretary also plans to change disciplinary procedures and to cut local authority representation on police authorities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   PRISONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Prison Service Agency is creating a private-sector market in prison management by increasing the number of privately run establishments to 12 - about 10 per cent of the total.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr Derek Lewis, the agency's chief executive, intends to shake up state-run prisons by:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- More day-to-day responsibility for governors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Changing work and staffing practices - possibly through more market-testing.

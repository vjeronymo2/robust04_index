			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Government to simplify company law THE GOVERNMENT is to launch a detailed review of company legislation in preparation for a bill which could be in the parliamentary programme for the next session. In a speech to be delivered in London today, Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, will outline his intention to review the 1985 Companies Act, the principal piece of company legislation since 1948. Mr Hamilton said yesterday that the review would focus on areas which have become 'unduly burdensome or ineffective'. A number of recent corporate failures had raised questions about the effectiveness of existing legislation and he outlined three principal 'reform candidates': Simplifying and distinguishing public companies from private companies in the act's requirements, which were scattered throughout existing legislation. The aim would be to reduce burdens on private businesses where there was no severe threat to protection of the public. Tightening the act to ensure the enforcement of regulations for fair dealing by directors of companies. Clarifying the extent to which companies could assist people to buy shares on their behalf. The review is also at first designed to cover about 17 other areas, including disincorporation of limited liability companies, insolvency proceedings concerning Company Voluntary Arrangements, directors' transactions and the clauses dealing with the objects of a company. Mr Hamilton stressed that it would be part of a 'rolling programme' of reform. There would be an initial period of discussion with organisations such as the Law Society followed by consultative documents on specific issues over the next few months. He said he wanted submissions to be prepared by next summer so that the DTI could be ready with amendments if the government could find sufficient parliamentary time during the next year. Publication of official statistics on trade between companies in EC member states will be substantially delayed because of the introduction of the single European market in January. Intra-EC trade figures - an essential part of the UK's balance of payments statistics - will be unavailable at least until June while British businesses adjust to a new system of statistical collection, called Intrastat. Meanwhile, it has emerged that companies could face criminal penalties, including fines of up to Pounds 2,500, for not filing the new statistical documents on time. Intrastat is being created to provide the trade statistics previously compiled from documents handed by exporters and importers to Customs officials at national borders. Companies with imports or exports to other EC countries totalling more than Pounds 135,000 a year will be expected to complete monthly Intrastat returns, which are far more concise than the existing border documents. This will affect about 30,000 companies. If the companies do not file the documents within 10 working days after each month, they could face fines, which were detailed in legislation laid before parliament last week. Customs has stressed that it will use a 'light touch' and will focus on helping companies to introduce the procedures rather than on penalising them, at least during the first year. The cost to Customs for implementing the Intrastat system - including the computer equipment, staff time and documentation - during the four years from 1990 to 1994 is estimated at about Pounds 10m.</p>

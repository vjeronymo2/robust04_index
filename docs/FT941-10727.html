			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: US bonds The week before a large auction of new Treasury bonds is a strange time for the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates. On the other hand, bond traders are doubtless grateful that the Fed did not choose to move a week later. If dealers had been stuck with the Dollars 11bn of 30-year debt due to be auctioned on Thursday, the fat bonuses paid at Christmas might have had to be handed back. And with large slugs of three- and 10-year paper also being sold this week, the one-point fall in bond prices since the Fed announcement is probably not sufficient to discount the risks, particularly since the US output gap has all but closed, and inflationary pressures will be harder to absorb this year. Against that, bond yields have risen from 6.25 per cent before the Fed chairman's comments to Congress a week ago to over 6.40 now. The are also well above their low point of 5.75 per cent reached last October. Unless the January inflation statistics produce a nasty surprise, bonds may gather strength around 6.5 per cent. There is also little reason to suppose that the torrent of money flooding into US mutual funds will slow much because of a tiny rise in short rates. Early Fed action to curb inflation may also keep long yields down. Still, now the interest rate cycle has finally turned, bonds will find it harder than equities to make as much forward progress.</p>

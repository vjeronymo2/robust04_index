			<p>BFN     [Text] De Aar April 30 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] officials in the IEC's control room at De Aar  in the Northern Cape on Saturday [30 April] embarked on a sit-in  strike because, they said, complaints about pay had not been  addressed, a SAPA correspondent reports. They said they had  unsuccessfully asked for service contracts and information on  pay scales when employed two weeks ago.    After insisting on these late on Saturday afternoon, they  were provided by the IEC regional office in Kimberley. But the  pay offered was less than they had hoped for and the strike  began. An official said the pay offered was less than that  offered to officials in the main urban centres.    Telephone communications with the control room have been cut  and striking officials are not responding to faxes.    IEC officials at Springbok and Upington are also  dissatisfied  about not receiving service contracts or information on pay  scales.    Vote counting at De Aar was continuing on Saturday night,  despite problems in the control room.</p>

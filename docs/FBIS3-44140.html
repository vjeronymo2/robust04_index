Heavy arms fire echoed across the southern suburbs of  Makelekele and Bacongo throughout the day yesterday. The  American ambassador lives near Bacongo which, like Makelekele,  is a stronghold of opponents of President Pascal Lissouba. An  American diplomat said about 50 bullets hit the ambassador's  residence during fighting between police commandos and  opposition militias. The area has been sealed off by security  forces loyal to Mr. Lissouba for about a week since the  disappearance of a member of the presidential bodyguard.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (3): Exciting but testing times - Alarm signals in Germany heeded GERMANY'S car producers are going through a highly unsettling time at the moment, but the components manufacturers can already tell them what the 1990s have in store. As German labour costs - well above those in any other European country, except Sweden - continue to rise, the automotive industry is under increasing pressure from competitors in cheaper countries such as France and the UK which have made great strides in productivity in recent years. At the same time, these and other countries such as Italy have experienced sharp cuts in their labour forces as the drive for greater efficiency gathers speed. Among the newer car-producing countries, Spain has also developed rapidly, partly with the help of Volkswagen. In spite of the undoubted quality, styling, and environmental appeal of German cars, rising costs and increasing competition have put manufacturers and components producers in a tight corner. An added threat is the highly efficient Japanese production in the UK, with Nissan's plant in Sunderland setting new efficiency standards for the industry. Thus, states Mr Achim Diekmann, managing director of the German motor industry association (VDA): 'Germany's automobile sites could be particularly vulnerable as competition intensifies further.' Productivity has not been rising fast enough, even though vehicle makers have been highly innovative in other ways. 'The German automobile industry's production costs are too high, not just in comparison with Japan, but also with its European rivals'. The components manufacturers have already had to react to these alarm signals. To keep their own costs low, car and truck makers have put pressure on parts manufacturers to supply at ever lower prices. This makes it harder for German suppliers to earn enough profit in high-cost Germany and has forced many of them to shift some output abroad. It has also led to an increasing trend of concentration in the German parts industry, as companies seek wider groupings to enable them to produce more efficiently and on a larger and thus cheaper scale. The needs of the car makers, which increasingly want whole systems developed and delivered rather than single parts, are also met by this trend. The German automotive components industry has an annual turnover of around DM50bn (Dollars 32bn) and is the third biggest in the world after those of Japan and the US. It is also the second biggest exporter. Thus its performance is vital to the success of German car producers. So, too, therefore is its cost structure and its capacity not only to make technological advances but also to finance these. For as the sector comes under a growing cost squeeze and vehicle makers' demands become tougher, the shake-out is bound to become rougher. In a study of the German parts industry, SAC Enterprises of the UK states: 'A period of rapid change should bring with it more rapid restructuring and bigger winners and losers.' This would take place as the industry underwent a speedier selection process  -'selection in the sense of survival of the fittest'. One big German engineering company which is determined to increase its presence in the sector is Mannesmann. Last year, it not only bought control of Boge, a maker of struts and shock absorbers, in a field where it already has one subsidiary, Fichtel und Sachs, it also went on to acquire VDO Adolf Schindling, the instrumentation and controls specialist. More companies are likely to be snapped up in an industry which saw 50 take-overs between the start of 1988 and mid-1991 when the study - called 'The Outlook for the German Automotive Supplier Industry' - was produced. In Germany, unlike Britain and France, medium-sized specialist companies are predominant in the parts industry. But they are having to invest more heavily to meet the demands of the motor industry at a time when financial returns are falling and costs and foreign competition rising. Thus, adds the SAC study: 'Many medium-sized companies in the German components industry appear to be under considerable threat. They have the largest changes to make and face the heaviest demands'. Their customers, the vehicle companies, are increasingly going abroad for their vehicle parts in an attempt to curb costs. So, to compete with foreign parts suppliers, German companies have also started moving outside their home base. This trend is not being followed just to keep costs down, however. Big components companies like Robert Bosch, whose products include anti-skid braking (ABS) and fuel injection systems, have found it necessary to build plants outside Germany to be closer to individual markets. Thus Bosch has built a Pounds 100m plant for alternators in Wales to raise its share of the developing UK market, where Japanese investment has led to a new lease of life. Among the vehicle makers, Mercedes-Benz is also looking towards the UK where it sees the potential to increase purchases of components from local companies offering competitive prices. In addition, a number of German suppliers apart from Bosch, such as Siemens and VDO, have set up units in the UK to sell to the revived car industry there; others are following. The car makers themselves are also finding it increasingly necessary to move abroad if they are to keep up with market developments. Hence the decision of BMW, a rival to Mercedes in the luxury segment, to invest in a new site in the US. So while these may be exciting and fast-moving times for components and vehicle makers, they are also some of the most testing the German automotive industry has been through in the post-war period.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, in a special  meeting this afternoon, received Mr. Van der Stoel, CSCE high  commissioner for national minorities, who is visiting our  country.    During the conversation, which was held in a friendly  atmosphere, Meksi thanked Van der Stoel for his continuous  commitment to Albania and for the objective reports he has  presented. Meksi went on to brief the CSCE official on the  situation of the Greek minority, the advanced standards of  freedoms and rights guaranteed to them, and the activity of  state institutions, which aim for continual perfection. He  particularly informed Van der Stoel about the equal treatment  granted to minority members in all fields and commented on the  special measures that the government has taken to develop their  identity in the fields of education, culture, religion, and  others.    Dwelling on the problem of minorities in a broader  framework,  Meksi stressed that, in our endeavors, we often run across  problems that arise due to the illegal and anticonstitutional  activity of certain minority people instigated by Greek  ultranationalist circles.    Meksi stressed the importance of Tirana-Athens bilateral  relations for the climate in the Balkans and the political  atmosphere in our region. We are for maintaining friendly  relations with Greece, but always by respecting the fundamental  principles of international relations and the reciprocal  interests of other countries.    The CSCE high commissioner assessed positively Albania's  readiness to receive him and create the necessary conditions for  his mission. After each visit, he stressed, I see positive  changes in the Greek minority's position. The most positive  feature is the harmonic, interethnic coexistence between the  Albanians and the Greeks, and that is why I value your policy  for preserving and further consolidating it.    Meksi and Van der Stoel then viewed special aspects of the  minority's position in the fields of education, exercise of  religion, etc. The situation in the region and Albanian-Greek  bilateral relations were other topics on which they exchanged  opinions.</p>

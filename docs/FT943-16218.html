			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: French industrial output rises French industrial production rose by 2.1 per cent in April, giving a year-on-year rise of 3.3 per cent. Output rose a revised 0.5 per cent in March from February. The April rise was mainly because of a 9.4 per cent increase in energy production. Manufacturing output rose 0.5 per cent, after a 5.8 per cent rise in output in the car and land transport sector. Output of semi-finished goods rose 0.5 per cent, while consumer goods fell by 0.3 per cent in the month. Swiss construction sector activity is likely to remain depressed throughout 1994 after a sharp drop in production in 1993, the Swiss Building Industry Group said. Combined turnover for its 18 members declined to SFr3.42bn (Pounds 1.64bn) in 1993 from SFr3.62bn in 1992. Spain's official currency reserves declined Dollars 61m (Pounds 40m) in June from May.

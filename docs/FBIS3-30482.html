			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec gave a news  conference in the Mirror Hall of the Cernin Palace in Prague.  David Stahlavsky was present on behalf of Czech Radio  Radiozurnal.    [Stahlavsky] [passage omitted] Josef Zieleniec does not  believe that the visit by Russian nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy to the Czech Republic is imminent. Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy was invited by the Association for the  Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. The minister is  surprised that Zhirinovskiy, who professed the demise of the  Czech Republic recently and made improper remarks about our  country, could have been invited by anyone. He said he found it  difficult to understand this.    The foreign minister responded also to the Austrian effort  to  block the American guarantees for the completion of the Temelin  nuclear power plant [south Bohemia] and to the Vienna  government's endeavors to stop this construction altogether.    [Begin Zieleniec recording] Our course of action is not only  in line with the law, it is also fair to our neighbors. It is  neither the fault of our nuclear power plant nor of anyone else  that Austria has to cope with the preelection situation. Of  course, we keep in touch with the Austrian Government. We try  to explain to them that these matters create unnecessary tension  in our neighborly relations and that there is no need for such a  spectacular approach. It is a pity. I sincerely regret that  irrational elements emerge in our relations with Austria. [end  recording]</p>

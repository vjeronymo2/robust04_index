			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Mexico's would-be president named Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party has chosen Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the country's social development minister and an economic reformer, as its candidate for next year's presidential election. The PRI, which announced its decision yesterday, has been in power for 64 years, and Mr Colosio is the strong favourite to win next August's election, taking over from President Carlos Salinas. Under Mexico's constitution, the winner will govern the country from December 1 next year until the end of 2000. Mr Colosio, 43, was front-runner for the succession, partly because of his loyalty to President Salinas and partly because of his economic and political goals. He is expected to push ahead with the pro-market economic reforms and cautious political changes which marked the Salinas presidency. Mr Colosio said before he was nominated that he would give more power to the states, traditionally dominated by Mexico City. He said deregulation and economic reform had to be extended if Mexico was to become more competitive and the political system more democratic. As social development minister, Mr Colosio has been responsible for the government's anti-poverty programme and environmental policy. He has travelled the country inaugurating public works projects, and built up an array of local contacts. Critics say he has no clear philosophy of government and may not be able to respond adequately to short-term problems. A minister who has sat with him in cabinet says he made few significant contributions, and few knew what he believed in. Mr Colosio was the only one of the candidates to have held elected office. Supporters say he will provide continuity with President Salinas. Mr Colosio was born in the northern town of Magdelena, Sonora. He went to university in the industrial city of Monterrey, and has a graduate degree in urban development from the University of Pennsylvania. He has become one of the president's most loyal aides, and helped to mastermind the PRI's victory in the 1991 legislative elections. The Mexican state of Yucatan voted for a new governor yesterday in a closely fought election where the centre-right opposition has a chance of snatching victory from the governing party, adds Damian Fraser.</p>

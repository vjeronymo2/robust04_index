			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Dragon looks for re-kindled fire: South Korea is seeking to regain its strength in export markets The Koreans are coming,' warned the cover story of Business Week in December 1985, predicting the imminent arrival of a wave of Korean exports in western markets. Come they did. The next three years saw one of the most dynamic export drives since 1945. Overseas sales of Korean goods, from cars to computers, doubled from Dollars 30.28bn in 1985 to Dollars 60.7bn in 1988. The world was braced for a second Japan. But the second Japan did not arrive. Instead, in the new decade there was a sharp slowdown in export growth and a fall in exports to Japan and the US, Korea's most important markets. Last year, this trend continued. Exports to the US fell by about 7 per cent. Exports to Japan struggled to match levels achieved in 1990. So was Korea's assault on western markets just a flash in the pan? Or is its export machine merely pausing for breath, rebuilding its competitiveness before another surge of dynamic export growth? On both counts the answer is likely to be no. The expansion of the 1980s is unlikely to be repeated. Competition from lower cost Asian rivals such as Malaysia, Thailand and China, combined with difficulties in upgrading the quality of its products, will constrain what was once the fiercest of Asia's 'dragon' economies. However, at the same time, Korea's retreat in international markets may also be nearing an end. The next few years should reverse the trend of declining competitiveness and lay the foundation for a more sustainable, if more moderate, export performance. The difficulties which have stifled the roar of the Korean export dragon are easily explained. The introduction of democracy in 1987 heralded an explosion in manufacturing wages and a wave of industrial unrest as long-repressed workers demanded their share of Korea's economic miracle. Combined with a steady appreciation of the exchange rate, which climbed from Won846 to the US dollar in 1987 to Won666 to the dollar in 1989, the result was a sudden loss of price competitiveness. 'Any one of these factors on their own would have been difficult to absorb,' says Mr Suh Sang Mok, one of the top economic policy-makers in the ruling Democratic Liberal party. 'What really hurt was that these shocks came together.' If the causes were easy to identify, so were the solutions. Most important was the need to increase productivity through investment in automation and new capital equipment and to improve the quality and sophistication of Korea's export products. This would allow exporters to regain their price edge, keep a step ahead of new competitors from south-east Asia and to expand profit margins on their sales in overseas markets. But these adjustments have proved difficult. Part of the problem is that Korean industry has relatively little experience in product development and innovation. This is largely the result of the pattern of its industrialisation, which was achieved through the acquisition of foreign technology and which was started only after the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. 'Weakness in engineering sciences and their application is one of our biggest problems,' says Mr Lee Dae Un, director of advanced engineering at Hyundai Motors, Korea's largest car manufacturer. 'Just one generation ago Korea was an agricultural society.' Management attitudes have also been slow to change from the successful formula of the 1980s. In particular, the large conglomerates which dominate the economy have continued to pursue strategies of diversification and volume production as opposed to increased specialisation in specific industries. 'The top executives of the large business groups are basically merchants,' argues one foreign businessmen in Seoul. 'They built their empires through large-scale production of consumer items and then found markets for them. But that no longer works. They have to be more responsive to the customer and pay more attention to the engineering and design of their goods.' The problems involved in industrial restructuring are compounded by a scarcity of financial resources. Prime lending rates at Korea's commercial banks are fixed at 12.5 per cent. But these loans are restricted, forcing companies to unofficial 'kerb' markets where interest rates are as high as 20 per cent. Yet the worst may now be over. The cost rises of the late 1980s are gradually being absorbed, while there are signs that the declining competitiveness of Korean products is also being reversed. 'We are at a juncture where things are beginning to look up,' says Mr Kim Chul Su, president of Kotra, a government agency which promotes exports. His optimism is supported by some hopeful trends: Productivity increases have caught up with pay increases. The Economic Planning Board, the most powerful economics ministry, estimates that last year, for the first time since 1986, productivity increases outpaced earnings growth. The rate of wage increases, which saw the average manufacturing worker double his earnings between the end of 1986 and the end of 1990, have started to fall. There has been a marked improvement in industrial relations. The number of strikes, which disrupted production so severely between 1987 and 1989, has fallen sharply. Last year, there were fewer than 240 strikes, a sharp decline from the 1,610 in 1989. The exchange rate has been depreciating. From a peak of about Won666 to the US dollar in 1989, the Korean currency has fallen to about 760 to the dollar. With an expanding trade deficit, which exceeded Dollars 10bn last year, further weakening is expected. Industrialists and business leaders say they are starting to see a recovery in motivation on the factory floor. 'After the introduction of democracy in 1987, our work ethic disappeared,' says Mr Kim Chong In, chief presidential economic secretary. 'But now people are beginning to realise the necessity of re-establishing their working morality.' These factors will help sharpen Korea's competitiveness, giving exporters, sandwiched between lower-cost south-east Asian rivals and high-quality Japanese producers, more room for manoeuvre. Several Korean companies have also responded to the challenge of upgrading production. Samsung Electronics has invested heavily in research and development and is now the equal of the Japanese market leaders in the production of D-RAM semiconductors, essential components for most electronic products. Hyundai Motors, previously dependent on Mitsubishi of Japan for key components, last year started to fit its cars with its own-designed engines. A comparison of the Elantra, the stylish new addition to the Hyundai range, and the humble Pony Excel, which launched the company's export drive in 1986, demonstrates the improvement in quality. Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motors are exceptional cases. But improvement is beginning to emerge more broadly. 'After a slow start, there is a mania for developing technology and developing strategic alliances with foreign firms,' says Mr Han Duck Soo, director-general for industrial policy at the ministry of trade and industry. Mr Han concedes that such adjustments will take time. 'The restructuring of Korean industry and a greater capability in technological-intensive sectors cannot be achieved overnight,' he says. Fortunately for Korean industry, some time is available. Korean manufacturers are being given a breathing space by a strong domestic market and by the emergence of new markets overseas. Expansion in Korea's exports to eastern Europe, China and south-east Asia has eased the pain suffered in the US and Japan, and accounted for last year's rise of 10 per cent in total exports. These new markets do not represent an alternative to Japan and the US. They have limited purchasing power and are showing signs of slowing demand. But they do give Korea some leeway as it adjusts to its new role as a higher-cost manufacturer. The consensus among government officials, economists from the ruling party and from the Federation of Korean Industries, the powerful interest group which represents the country's large conglomerates, is that this adjustment will take between two and three years. By then, they predict, export growth will stabilise at annual increases of 10-15 per cent, and the current account will return to balance. Such figures would be welcomed by most of the world's economic ministries, and they are likely to prove more sustainable for Korea's exporters. But after the heady expansion of the 1980s they will represent a mellowing of east Asia's meanest export machine.</p>

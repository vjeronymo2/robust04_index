			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Luis Batista] </F>   [Text] After the "presidential secret" was disclosed, polls  are showing a trend that favors Ruben Blades, while Ernesto  Perez Balladares continues to lose ground. A special election  poll contracted by LA PRENSA with the Dichter and Neira/Lou  Harris consulting firm shows Ernesto Perez Balladares of the  Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) has lost 6 percent, while  Ruben Blades of the Papa Egoro Movement has gained 7.5 percent.    The previous poll conducted by the same firm, which was  published on 15 April, showed Perez Balladres with 34.5 percent  and Blades with 17.3 percent. Now, Perez Balladares has 28.4  percent and Blades has 24.8 percent. Blades is 3.6 percent short  of catching up with Perez Balladares.    At the end of March, Perez Balladares had 39.5 percent of  the  vote, while Blades had 14.4 percent, much less than Ruben Dario  Carles, who at that time registered 20.5 percent.    The new poll was conducted between Friday, 22 April and  Saturday, 23 April. The poll, which was conducted on an random  social cross-section with the participation of 1,209 people who  displayed a willingness to vote, surveyed residents living in  national territory by way of face-to-face interviews. Of the  1,209 people polled, 696 live in urban areas while 513 live in  rural areas.    The specific question asked was: "If the presidential  elections were held today, who would you vote for?" The total  results in order of preference are as follows: Perez Balladares,  28.4 percent; Blades, 24.8 percent; Carles, 16.2 percent; Mireya  Moscoso de Gruber, 14.3 percent; Eduardo Vallarino, 2.3 percent;  Samuel Lewis Galindo, 1.4 percent; and Jose Salvador Munoz, 0.2  percent. Meanwhile, the answers of "do not know," "no one," and  "no answer" total 12.2 percent.    Another trend observed in the last Dichter &amp; Neira poll  is  Carles' decline. At the end of March he registered 20.5  percent; in the middle of April, 18.6 percent; and now 16.2  percent. Meanwhile, Moscoso de Gruber, like Blades, is gaining  in the polls, albeit at a lower level. At the end of March, she  had 10.5 percent, in the middle of April 11.3 percent, and now  14.3 percent.    It can be noted that in Panama Province, Blades has greater  acceptance (28.8 percent) than in the rest of the nation (20.1  percent). Meanwhile, Perez Balladares in Panama Province  registers 30.5 percent, while in the countryside he registers 26  percent.    Another difference can be seen among the various age groups.  Among the younger generation between the ages of 18 and 29,  Blades registers 36 percent while Perez Balladares registers  30.2 percent.  <H5>  After the Video </H5>   It should be noted that this is the first LA PRENSA poll  after the release of the "presidential secret," a videotape in  which the previous regime's "confessions" of corruption appear.  In the video, Tomas Altamirano Duque, first vice presidential  candidate on the PRD ticket, is shown saying that because there  was no money, nationalism had to be touted. Nationalism was the  core of the PRD and the military's propaganda machine in the  1989 elections.    In recent days, Altamirano Duque has publicly declared that  all governments rob and that he had not participated in business  deals with former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, not because  he did not want to but, rather, because Noriega had not asked  him to.    Carles' and Moscoso de Gruber's campaigns have concentrated  on attacking the PRD. Meanwhile, Blades has been calling on the  people to vote for Papa Egoro in an effort not to continue "this  war of insults and accusations over the next five years."    In another turn of events, although the PRD has not changed  the substance of its campaign, it has devoted a good portion of  its television adds to attacking the president's position.  Meanwhile, nearly all of the PRD members who appears in the  video have felt compelled to "explain," in one way or another,  their participation in the previous regime.    President Guillermo Endara was questioned by various sectors  that felt the release of the video comprised direct meddling in  partisan politics. Other sectors, however, contend the  president acted correctly because, otherwise, he would have  become "an accessory after the fact."    After the video was aired, some sectors who opposed the  previous military regime called for civic unity aimed at  defeating the PRD in the 8 May elections. Nevertheless, up  until yesterday, Sunday, nothing specific had been achieved.  Meanwhile, the PRD has said the 1994 elections cannot be won  with the same arguments used in the 1989 elections.    Taking into account the possibility of an alliance among the  civic groups, the last poll posed the following question: "If  there were an alliance, and if the only candidates were Blades,  Vallarino, Lewis Galindo, and Munoz, who would you vote for?"  [sentence as published]    The following is the result: Blades, 38.5 percent; Perez  Balladares, 29.8 percent; Vallarino, 7.3 percent; Lewis Galindo,  4.2 percent; Munoz 0.05 percent; do not know, 6.6 percent; no  reply, 1.9 percent; and none of them, 11.1 percent.    Now, assuming Ruben Carles and Eduardo Vallarino were not  included, when asked the same question, the following results  were achieved: Blades, 31.8 percent; Perez Balladares, 29.2  percent; Moscoso de Gruber, 21.4 percent; Lewis Galindo, 3.2  percent; Munoz, 0.3 percent; do not know, 6.2 percent; no reply,  2 percent; and none of them, 5.9 percent.  <H5>  Struggle Among the Minorities </H5>   What all of the polls conducted in the past few days show is  that there is a struggle among the four minorities: those who  support Ernesto Perez Balladares (United People alliance), those  who support Ruben Blades (Papa Egoro), those who support Ruben  Dario Carles (Change '94), and those who support Mireya Moscoso  de Gruber (Democratic Alliance). The other large group of  respondents comprises those who are undecided ("do not know,"  "no reply," and "none of them"), which totals 12.2 percent.    Over the past weekend, all of the candidates' campaigns  staged caravans, rallies, and street celebrations.    In light of the statistics, the 8 May 1994 elections will  have two candidates with real chances: Ruben Blades, the  composer-singer, and Ernesto Perez Balladares, the businessman.</p>

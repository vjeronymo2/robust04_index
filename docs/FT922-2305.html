			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Viagene wins backing for HIV clinical programme A US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel yesterday voted unanimously to recommend that Viagene be allowed to begin human clinical trials on its HIV-immunotherapeutic treatment, AP-DJ reports from Washington. The panel expressed overwhelming support for the design of the proposed studies by the company and found that, based on previous animal studies, commencement of clinical studies was reasonable and safe. One panel member said Viagene has taken 'an exciting approach and I wish the sponsor well'. The panel suggested certain analyses of data be performed including the development of assays to measure the therapy's effect on cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) counts to increase sensitivity, but the panel felt that most concerns were already being addressed by the company. The company intends to begin trials in the third quarter of 1992. The studies will evaluate the safety of the therapy in HIV-positive patients with a CD4 count greater than 500 who are asymptomatic and between the ages of 18 and 50. The company intends to exclude pregnant women and patients who have undergone anti-retroviral treatments. Assuming the full FDA affirms the panel's recommendation, the next step is to begin phase I studies which evaluate safety of the therapy in humans. If safety is demonstrated phase II and phase III studies will follow to evaluate safety and efficacy. The company said that its ultimate goal was to develop a vaccine that would be used in the HIV-negative population.</p>

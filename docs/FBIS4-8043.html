			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Radoman Bozovic, chairman of the Chamber of </F> Citizens of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia and "head of the  Yugoslav delegation visiting Moscow," by Dusan Cukic in Moscow;  date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Cukic] Mr. Chairman, we are talking here in Moscow  at the conclusion of the Yugoslav assembly delegation's visit to  Russia. This is the first time since the introduction of  sanctions that such a high-level parliamentary delegation is  visiting a foreign country, paying an official visit to such a  big country as Russia.    [Bozovic] This is correct. I would like to believe that  this is not an accident but a result of the knowledge acquired  by the deputies of various political factions in the Russian  Supreme Soviet, where there is complete unanimity among  political factions in understanding our crisis. This  understanding especially came to prominence with the demand for  the lifting of the sanctions against our country. We indeed  encountered complete understanding and full support. This  climate in the Russian Supreme Soviet is of enormous importance  and influence on changes in certain practical moves in Russian  diplomacy. We also learned that from our talks with Mr. Kozyrev  and his deputy Churkin. There is a new quality, I would say,  in the understanding of our situation when it comes to the  Russian legislature and the Russian Government.    Prior to this visit, this understanding had primarily been  expressed by Russian parliamentarians. This time both of them  told us that things are now moving, that events are simply  moving, that these events are being moved by logic, because it  is difficult to find someone here who understands why  Yugoslavia, its citizens, and its economy, should be punished by  sanctions and political isolation, and who could possibly  benefit from this.    Therefore, the visit as a whole, and the talks with Chairman  Ribkin and Minister Kozyrev, as well as a large number of  political factions, have left us with the belief that the  Russian public and Russian politicians have taken a more  objective stand. This is in fact the point of our policy. Our  policy is not to seek the support of Russia in order to punish  others, to punish those who are against Serbian interests in  this chaotic civil war, but to secure the same position in the  peace process for the Serbian side that is being secured for the  other sides.    [Cukic] Mr. Bozovic, you indeed had a very prudent, very  specific, and if I may say, apparently productive program. In  all these talks with all parties, ranging from the Communists to  the Democrats, the parties on the extreme left and the parties  on the extreme right, in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in  contacts with the representatives of the government -- you and  your delegation raised, I think, a new question, not only of the  sanctions being lifted, but also of the return of Yugoslavia to  international politics.    [Bozovic] Yes, this question, these questions are dependent  on one another. The return of Yugoslavia and its reintegration  into the politics of international institutions is of enormous  importance, especially in the further course of the peace  process, so that we are not in the situation of constantly being  put on trial without having a chance to present facts, to  present the truth, or in a way, defend ourselves with the facts.  Therefore, it is important that the peace process brings about  not only the lifting of the economic sanctions, but also the  return of Yugoslavia in international institutions, which was  fully accepted in talks in the Russian Parliament. We raised  this issue in talks with Mr. Minister [not further specified]  and other representatives of the government. It is indeed  difficult to understand that it is necessary to maintain the  blockade on the (?dialogue), the participation of Yugoslavia and  Yugoslav representatives in international institutions.    [Cukic] All in all, if a reporter is allowed to conclude,  the impression is that you are returning from this exceptionally  important political parliamentary visit as an optimist.    [Bozovic] Optimism in politics, especially in the conditions  under which we exist today, is something that is perhaps not  good if there is no reason for it. However, I am an optimist in  the sense that I am returning with the belief that people who  until recently did not have a good enough understanding of the  essence of our crisis understand it better today. Time has also  done its part, and so has, I would say, a principled policy on  the part of the Yugoslav and Serbian sides. The facts are  gradually starting to be important in making political decisions.    Therefore I think that this parliamentary visit is  important.  As you said yourself, this is the first official visit by a  Yugoslav parliamentary delegation since the introduction of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia.    [Cukic] Thank you Mr. Bozovic for this interview for Dnevnik  2 program of the Serbian Television.    [Bozovic] Thank you.</p>

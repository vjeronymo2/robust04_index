			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Lu Zhenkui (0712 2182 1145): "Accurately Find </F> Out the Point of Contact in Shifting Enterprise Business  Mechanism and Establishing Modern Enterprise Systems"]    [Text] "Establishing modern enterprise systems represents  a necessary demand for developing socialized mass production and  the market economy and also an orientation of conducting reform  among the state-owned enterprises in China." The issue of how  to boost the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises is  not only an important task faced by the province but also the  key content of conducting reform throughout the country. Before  1988, the rate of the state-owned money-losing enterprises was  about 10-20 percent. The present rate of state-owned enterprises  that have suffered losses and whose profits are false and losses  are true is 70 percent. However, the rate of state-owned  enterprises that have overtly or covertly suffered losses  actually is more than 80 percent calculated in term of new  accounting systems. The proportion of output value scored by  the state-owned industrial enterprises in the total industrial  output value decreases year after year. The yearly average  decrease in this regard before 1992 was 2 percent, that of 1992  was 4 percent, and that of 1993 was 6 percent. It is thus clear  that if we fail to fundamentally boost the state-owned large-  and medium-sized enterprises, it is impossible for the country  to make success in its reform.    Heilongjiang is one of the provinces that have more large-  and medium-sized enterprises. This represents the province's  glory in its history but becomes a heavy burden that has  perplexed the province's economy.    By judging from the focal points of the province's economic  development strategy, the province has 429 large- and  medium-sized enterprises. Of these enterprises, 409 are  people-owned ones; 17 are collectively owned ones; and three are  of other categories. The province has 17,671 small enterprises  and most of them are privately or individually owned. The  original value of fixed assets owned by large- and medium-sized  enterprises is 68.15 billion yuan and the net value of them is  47.52 billion yuan; as well as that of fixed assets owned by  small enterprises is 17.16 billion yuan and the net value of  them is 12.6 billion yuan. By carrying out comparison among  these values, we may realize that in the structure of the  province's enterprises, the proportion of publicly owned  enterprises in the original value of fixed assets accounts for  about 80 percent and that of net value accounts for about 79  percent. Such high proportions prevailing in this regard in the  province are rare in the country as a whole. This shows that  placing hopes for the province's whole situation and fate of  economic development on the development of privately owned and  township enterprises in an effort to improve the backward  economic outlook seems very unsuitable to the province's  reality. Without the vitality of large- and medium-sized  enterprises and the radiation function exerted by these  enterprises, it is also difficult for privately owned and  township enterprises to achieve great development.    Establishing modern enterprise systems represents a final  way  out for large- and medium-sized enterprises across the province.  However, this also represents an arduous and complicated task.  By no means should we rush headlong into action in this regard  and indulge in formalism. It is imperative to accumulate  experience, to create conditions, and to gradually push the  establishment forward.    First of all we must obtain an accurate and overall  understanding of modern enterprise systems that can meet the  demand for socialized mass production and the market economy.  Those are of new-style enterprise systems with the  standardization and improvement of enterprise corporate system  as the main content and with the limited responsibility system  as the core. Thus, we should understand these systems from the  following several angles:    1. Modern enterprise systems are of microeconomic ones; are  not the systems only with one or two specific contents; and are  the setup of systems which involves various fields in the  external environment and internal mechanism of enterprises.    2. Modern enterprise systems do not refer to the equipment  and managerial levels and managerial methods of enterprises but  indicate the reflection of internal and external production  relations of enterprises. Therefore, by no means should we make  the conclusion that success can be made merely by boosting  enterprise and enterprises can get rid of the possibility of  being eleminated from markets as long as modern enterprise  systems have been established. As a matter of fact, the  nationally famous U.S. Rockefeller Financial Group was sold to  another due to the 51 percent shares held by the Mitsubishi  Financial Group of Japan.    3. Although modern enterprise systems have cropped up along  with the development of the market economy and there is common  character between systems and the market economy, we must find  out the point of contact which is suitable to our reality in  conducting the reform of modern enterprise systems on the  premise of observing the common character. Meanwhile, it is  imperative to integrate the experience scored by China in  conducting enterprise reform in the past and the method of  creating something new with the international convention and  feasible methods and to establish in a creative way modern  enterprise systems suitable to Chinese history and culture and  to the characteristics of the age.    4. Whether enterprise can establish modern systems cannot be  decided by their ownership. This means that all enterprises may  take up the establishment in this regard. The state-owned  enterprises may exercise mixed ownership in carrying out  company-style reorganization. As for whether hold-shares can be  decided by the character of enterprises and by the social and  economic position and role played by enterprises -- meaning that  "whether the proportion of the state share right in the company  is relatively adequate," we may handle the issue in line with  the difference of industries and trades and according to the  scattered extent of share right.    Lastly, we must push forward the reform in various fields in  a coordinated way to ensure the smooth progress of "shifting the  enterprise business mechanism and establishing modern enterprise  systems" because having the state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises to "shift their business mechanism and establish  modern systems" represents a complicated and systematic project.  In enforcing the project, a slight move in one part may affect  the situation as a whole. The present burdens undertaken by the  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises for the  retirement and convalescence leave of staff members and workers  are very serious. According to statistics, 20-30 percent of  on-the-job personnel in the state-owned large- and medium-sized  enterprises across the country are surplus ones. In addition,  the number of staff members and workers who are going to retire  from their posts accounts for more than 20 percent in the total.  By putting the two figures together, the state-owned  enterprises in the country are shouldering the burden of  50-percent surplus personnel and so doing the large and  medium-sized enterprises throughout the province. For this, we  must further accelerate the reform in the systems of social  security and establish or improve the social security setup.  Meanwhile, we must adopt the method of "gradually being  stripped" to handle the financial burden the enterprises have to  bear in supporting social undertakings.</p>

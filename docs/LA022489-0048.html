			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'BABY MARCOS' GUARDIAN TIED TO CRIMINAL PAST  </P> <P> The paternal grandfather and legal guardian of "Baby Marcos" has a lengthy  arrest record and has used at least six aliases over the years, an Immigration  and Naturalization Service spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> INS spokesman Rudy Murillo said that Rene Herrera Perez, 37, of Tijuana, who  was awarded custody of the U.S.-born child in January after an eight-month  search for the boy's parents, has an arrest record going back to 1969.  According to Murillo, Herrera has been arrested many times for illegal entry  and is known to the INS as a member of the "Frequent Crosser Club."  </P> <P> Baby Marcos, whose real name is Marcos Antonio-Herrera, was discovered in May  in a car with two Mexican smugglers who were attempting to bring a group of  Uruguayans illegally across the border. When his identity became known in  January, he was handed over to his grandfather, who works as a tile setter in  Tijuana. The adoption was approved by a Mexican social service agency.  </P> <P> The boy's father was identified as Marcos Antonio Herrera Perez, 17, who is the  elder Herrera's son. Both father and mother were identified as drug users by  the INS. The younger Herrera was said to be an undocumented worker living in  San Ysidro and the mother was said to live in Mexicali.  </P> <P> Murillo said the INS had "suspicions" about the grandfather before he was  awarded custody of the boy. However, it was not until he was arrested Monday in  San Ysidro on charges of illegal entry that those suspicions were realized,  Murillo said.  </P></p>

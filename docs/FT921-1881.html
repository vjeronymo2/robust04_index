			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Despatches: The lords of the dance DAY THREE of carnival and all sense of normal waking hours has long been suspended along with even the slightest notion of reality. Five phantoms and a transvestite walk past and a carnival queen lies snoring inelegantly on the next table. My tutu is slipping and the delicately etched rose design on my right cheek has become an unseemly smudge of red and black. The moment seems opportune for drifting off in a daze induced by cachaca, the local sugar cane spirit not completely dissimilar to methylated spirits. But it is not to be. Down the narrow cobbled street comes a battery of drummers heralding the approach of six huge figures with inanely grinning plastic doll faces, twirling brightly coloured miniature umbrellas. The carnival queen jerks awake, leaps off the table and rejoins the throng. All around people are starting up again like clockwork toys that have suddenly been activated. In the trees a confused flock of birds restart the dawn chorus. Carnival in the north-eastern Brazilian town of Olinda is not for those without stamina. The festival lasts two weeks and proceeds at a relentless pace. The frevo beat is far faster than samba and combines an unnatural amount of hipswaying with violent martial art kicks. Locals talk admiringly of the old man who died inside one of the papier mache dolls, dancing until the end. While Rio's more famous carnival has become a multi-million dollar spectacle with samba schools trying to outdo each other with stunning costumes, high-tech floats and laser displays, in Olinda it remains a carnival of the people where no-one can avoid joining in. The costumes are homemade and choreography is an unknown word as numerous blocos (groups of dancers and drummers) crowd into the streets for days on end. In the Rio Sambadrome locals are discussing the relative merits of twice champion samba school Mocidade's depiction of dreaming. In Olinda disorganisation reigns. At the town's Four Corners crossroads a parade of clowns and Charlie Chaplins crash into a huge spider on sticks and a group of transvestites doing aerobics. In spite of its shoestring budget carnival in Olinda is far more picturesque than Rio's more artificial affair. The old colonial town, founded in 1535 and put under a Unesco preservation order, is the perfect setting with its ice-cream pastel painted Baroque architecture, pink stucco houses, numerous palm trees, palaces and churches on a hill overlooking the sea. The winding streets are festooned with paper streamers, lanterns and carnival masks. Everyone is drinking, dancing and falling in and out of love. Forget about 25 per cent a month inflation and the third year of recession. Ignore the four-figure notes now needed to buy a beer. This is when Brazil comes into its own as what has been described as the last happy nation on earth. Brazilians know how to party better then anyone on the planet and, while the country's football no longer gives any reason to celebrate, carnival is the perfect excuse to release all the tension in a yearly blow-out. Brazilians love to tell the tale of an IMF mission arriving during a recent carnival expecting to find the nation in gloom and instead, seeing all the festivities, thinking they must have got the wrong place. Frivolous it may sound but many sociologists believe the reason that the country with the world's largest income gap and one of the highest inflation rates has not exploded in revolution is this very ability to revel at will. Olinda is the perfect example. While Brazil's south became industrialised and grew rich, the north-east has become synonymous with poverty and backwardness. Its health indicators have earned it the name Brazil's Ethiopia. Its people continue to be exploited by sugar barons. Real income dropped 17 per cent over the last year and the health minister has admitted that there is cholera in the region. This misery has provided a fertile source for colourful legends and carnival brings this to the fore. Many of the blocos are based on maracatu which mixes religious figures with circus characters. Others are heavy with Indian and African heritage, the dancers clad in paint and feathers. The umbrellas used for balance are thought to be a throwback to the canopies used to transport African kings. Many are dressed as half man half horse, to symbolise Lampiao, a local rebel leader, or the colourfully decorated cow Bum Meu Boi. Mingling among it is like being part of a cast for 20 different operas all taking place at the same time. A more recent addition to the festivities is the 'trio eletrico' - flat topped trucks from which bands or speakers blare out frevo music to add to the general frenzy. Even the military police have converted their vehicles for the occasion. But then it is carnival time and nothing is quite what it seems. The bahias, women in huge hooped skirts and white embroidered turbans, on closer inspection turn out to be men, betrayed by their hairy legs. In fact many macho males seize the opportunity to put on women's clothing and make-up. There are always more discoveries to make if one is prepared to venture further underground to the heart of neighbouring Recife. On the Monday night of carnival, in the innermost alleys of the city, one of Brazil's oldest and most traditional parades takes place - the Night of the Silent Drums - in honour of dead ancestors. The drums are not silent in spite of the name but are accompanied by religious chanting and the ringing of cowbells. On the few occasions the locals stop their frenetic activity it is usually for feijoada - a stew of black beans and every conceivable part of pig from trotters to ears. Not for the squeamish, this local dish originated as slave food using parts of the pig that the masters had discarded. If the hedonism becomes too intense and one can take no more of the rhythms and colours of Brazil, there is the perfect antidote in the form of the nearby beaches on the prison island of Itamaraca. Lie on the silvery sand of Fort Orange under a tall coconut palm and let small boys cook freshly caught lobster and pour ice-cold beer. For intellectual exercise one can ponder on the strategic logic which prompted the Dutch to position their fort front of a sandbank - making it impossible to view enemy ships entering the bay. I concluded it was a fortuitous decision - had they not done so the Portugese invasion might not have been successful and we would have been doing clog dances instead of frevo.</p>

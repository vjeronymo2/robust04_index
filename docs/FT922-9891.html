			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / A revolution, step by step: Mr Major's legislative programme, to be revealed tomorrow, promises fundamental, if gradual, change Mr John Major is in exuberant mood. It is not just that his general election victory has handed him control of his political destiny. As he contemplates the next five years in Downing Street, the prime minister believes that few have appreciated the scale of the opportunities presented by his victory on April 9. He will begin to spell out his programme in tomorrow's Queen's Speech, translating into legislative form the first batch of his manifesto promises. There will be few fireworks and few surprises. Mr Major remains a politician who believes in incremental rather than explosive change. He is fond of telling colleagues that before climbing a ladder it is sensible to make sure that it has sturdy rungs. The impatient and the incautious are reminded that the poll tax is an example of what happens when the rule is ignored. But change there will be; and the eventual impact of the prime minister's prospectus will be far more profound than implied by the quiet manner of its implementation. It is not hard to explain Mr Major's good humour. His first term as an elected prime minister has begun at just the right point in the economic cycle while the opposition is in disarray. Mr John Smith's expected victory in the Labour leadership battle will not easily repair the severe damage done to the opposition by the less than edifying manner in which the contest has been conducted. The current deliberations of the Boundary Commission will be speeded up. The resulting demarcation of constituencies could deliver to the Conservatives another 20 seats at the next election. As Britain prepares to assume in July the presidency of the European Community, a glance in the direction of Bonn, Washington or Tokyo does nothing to dispel the impression that Mr Major is more secure in office than any of his counterparts on the international stage. Germany's troubles and the internal preoccupations of the socialist government in France have combined with the turbulent legacy of the former communist regimes in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to give unexpected credibility to Britain's vision of a wider, decentralised European Community. Mr Major will spend much of the next two months putting into law the treaties on monetary and political union agreed at Maastricht But his European partners are less sure of the federalist vision that inspired the treaties. At home, those elusive green shoots of recovery appear at last to be pushing through the permafrost of recession. It will not be a spectacular recovery; and it might yet be further delayed. The debt burden loaded on to individuals and companies by the 1980s boom has been eased not eradicated. Beyond the  1/2 -point cut now in prospect, the intensification of Germany's economic problems has stifled hope of a significant reduction in the historically high level of British interest rates. Unemployment, and with it the government's budget deficit, will continue to rise. Warnings from the Treasury that this year's public spending round will be the toughest in recent memory represent more than the ritual sabre-rattling. Mr Major's optimism does not hinge on the short-term outlook. He does not anticipate an immediate surge in output. By temperament, the prime minister prefers the steady to the spectacular. It is too early to judge whether he is right, but the prime minister is convinced that the disinflation wrought by the recession and by sterling's place in the exchange rate mechanism does offer the prize of non-inflationary growth. His commitment to curbing inflation is too frequently under-estimated. Mr Major is dismissive of suggestions that he should consider devaluing sterling against the D-Mark to loosen the constraints applied by high German interest rates. Mrs Thatcher may cavil at her successor's willingness to tolerate high public spending and borrowing but he is determined that he will deliver the permanently low inflation that eluded her. With the economy at the bottom of the economic cycle, the resumption of economic growth of 2.5 to 3 per cent would not undermine that ambition. It is a background that Mr Major is convinced will allow him to deliver on his manifesto promises. There is no grand philosophical design. But the gradualism does not exclude more sweeping ultimate ambitions. If the constituent elements of Mr Major's programme are unexciting, the sum of those parts may prove surprisingly radical. The glue which binds them together is an instinct which tells him that many more decisions taken by the state  - be it represented by Whitehall or by local authorities  - should be devolved to individuals and families. Ownership, choice and opportunity are the words he uses most frequently to outline his objectives. Low taxation, privatisation, the citizen's charter, incentives for home and share ownership, hospital trusts and grant-maintained schools all reflect a presumption in favour of individual empowerment. He is committed to a welfare state but not to the monolithic structure established in 1945. He sees government as the purchaser rather than the provider of the public services for which at present it has responsibility to deliver as well as finance. On one level Mr Major plans further absolute shrinkage in the size of government. The Queen's Speech will signal his determination to privatise British Coal, British Rail and the remaining publicly-owned bus companies. Alongside such direct sales, he foresees wholesale contracting out to private enterprise. Further large chunks of Whitehall will be hived off into free-standing agencies. Competitive tendering will be extended to the core of local authorities' white-collar functions. Where the state retains a near-monopoly  - health and education are the best examples  - the aim is to establish a much more direct relationship between suppliers and consumers, a relationship regulated by the citizen's charter. With the uncertainties of the election removed, Mr Major expects hospital trusts, family doctor budgets and grant-maintained schools to become the norm rather than the exception. The approach is not uniform. Colleagues point to his post-election housing policy as a microcosm of a political strategy tailored to realities as well as long-term goals. The basic aim is to widen ownership. Local authority tenants who cannot afford to buy their homes outright will be offered gradualist routes through rent-into-mortgage and part-ownership schemes. But those who choose or are forced to remain in the rented sector will be nudged anyway into accepting more active responsibility for their properties. Privatisation of estate management, property transfers to housing associations and an extension of housing action trusts will deprive local authorities of their role in housing provision. In the public sector such change does not come cheap. Mr Major has no philosophical objection to spending taxpayers' money if he is sufficiently persuaded of the results. The size of the public sector deficit will ensure that the public spending round is unusually tough. But the commitment to an eventual return to budget balance is elastic. Whitehall is working on a re-definition of policy which would admit the reality that a return to debt repayment is a distant dream. Mr Major's tax-cutting ambitions are modest, directed at helping the 'industrious and the thrifty' on avarage or below-average earnings. They involve a gradual widening of the 20p lower rate band of tax, some new incentives to encourage personal savings and an increase in the threshold for inheritance tax. He is unmoved by calls for reductions in the top rate of income tax. It does not add up to a seamless whole. Much of Mr Major's approach to policy is driven by a careful balance between his deep-rooted personal instincts and his careful political pragmatism. There are obvious tensions. The prime minister insists that Britain is 'over-governed' yet he wants his government to act as a powerful agent for social as well as economic change. His choice of Mr Michael Heseltine to run the department of trade and industry is a signal that the government will be more active if not interventionist in its relationship with industry. Mr Peter Walker's stewardship of a new urban regeneration agency points in a similar direction. Pragmatism has left Mr Major committed to a universal system of state pensions and child benefit which runs against the grain of his emphasis on individual responsibility. Gradualism and pragmatism carry their own risks. At times they can too easily be mistaken for drift. At others they can obscure the fundamental implications of piecemeal policymaking. Senior ministers admit that little attention has been paid to the far-reaching consequences for local democracy of the planned changes in the structure of local taxation and in education and housing policies. Mr Major's interest has focused on a plan to simplify local government by removing one of the present tiers. But the erosion of its role could actually concentrate more power in Whitehall rather than disperse it to individuals. Nor can the prime minister expect the modest improvement in the Conservatives' electoral performance in Scotland to reverse a decade-long process of alienation from political rule from London. This is acknowledged in his plans to revive the select committee on Scottish affairs at Westminster and to nurture the role of the grand convention in Edinburgh. But the approach leaves a suspicion that the government has not looked beyond the next one or two steps. There are some in Mr Major's own administration who admit that the question of how Britain should be governed in the next century cannot be answered simply with reforms in the welfare state designed to enhance the role of the individual. But for the moment the prime minister can be forgiven for brushing aside such dilemmas. He has proved himself a consummate politician. He has a mandate for a programme more radical in its intent than has been generally realised. He has the right economic and political environment in which to deliver it. Who wouldn't be smiling?</p>

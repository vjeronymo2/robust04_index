			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jeremy Laurance, Health Services correspondent: </F> "Epileptics `Suffering From GP Ignorance'"]    [Text] Up to 50,000 people are suffering from epileptic  seizures which could be prevented if family doctors prescribed  modern drug treatments, specialists said yesterday.    Ignorance of the condition, which affects 350,000 Britons,  is  widespread among GP's, who ignore sufferers or refer them to  hospital. Nearly 100,000 people suffer seizures at least once a  month but half could be eliminated with the right treatment, Dr  Tim Betts, consultant neuropsychiatrist at the Queen Elizabeth  Hospital, Birmingham, said.    Launching a survey of public attitudes to epilepsy, Dr Betts  said sufferers were still stigmatised as unstable. One in four  of the 1,000 respondents said they would not feel comfortable  about letting their child play with a child who had epilepsy.    Seizures can affect a sufferer's job prospects,  relationships  and quality of life. In 80 per cent of sufferers the condition  is fully controlled with drugs or surgery but they are still  barred from jobs in the police or armed services and may have  difficulty following other careers such as primary school  teaching.    One in 200 of those who continue to have seizures die each  year in accidents, by suicide or directly as a result of their  condition. Suicide is five times more common among epilepsy  sufferers.    "Whole areas of the country have no epilepsy service at  all,"  Dr Stephen Brown, chairman of the Epilepsy Task Force, said.</p>

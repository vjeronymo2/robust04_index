			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> EMPEROR OF THE AIR Stories by Ethan Canin (Harper &amp; Row: $7.95)  </P> <P> This collection of short stories, Ethan Canin's first, laudably runs counter to  the current trend of minimalist prose by writers in the younger-than-30 set.  His symbols, laden with relevance, are woven into the text, at times  overburdening the narrative.  </P> <P> In the title story, a 69-year-old retired astronomy teacher refuses to cut down  his 250-year-old elm tree, although it is infested with insects. When the  narrator receives a note from his neighbor, Mr. Pike, that the city will do the  cutting, he seeks revenge: He collects a bottle full of the offending pests,  and crawls into his neighbor's yard to share the infestation.  </P> <P> But, before he opens the jar, Mr. Pike and his son come into the yard. The  father, assuming a tone of knowledge, is pointing out the constellations but  inventing their names: the Mermaid's Tail, Mount Olympus, the Emperor of the  Air. Somehow this scene stirs a change in the astronomer-narrator.  </P> <P> Canin's "epiphanies are first-rate," Richard Eder wrote in these pages. "They  are also everywhere. They do not transform the stories; they virtually are the  stories."  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Treuhand to seek more cuts in steel output Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency is likely to push for further cuts in steel capacity in eastern Germany in a bid to persuade the European Commission to accept the sale of Eko Stahl, the last of the East German steel mills, to Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producers. Mr Hans Schwarz, head of the workers' council at the Hennigsdorf steel mill in the eastern state of Brandenburg, said the agency might buy back a part of the mill in order to close down one of the hot-rolling complexes which is under-utilised. Hennigsdorf, which is owned by Riva, the Italian privately-owned steel group, produces about 700,000 tonnes of steel a year, but its capacity could increase to 1m tonnes when its hot-rolling operation is complete. The agency's policy could have the affect of keeping overall capacity levels in eastern Germany down if Cockerill buys Eko Stahl, but could also mean further job losses in the industry. Under the terms of the European Union steel levels agreement, Eko Stahl must not produce more than 900,000 tonnes until 1999, when production can then rise. Mr Scharwz said the 850-strong work force at Hennigsdorf would be reduced by nearly a sixth if the plans went ahead.</p>

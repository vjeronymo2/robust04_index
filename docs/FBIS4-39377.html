			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said  at a news conference, which he gave before departing from  Tallinn today, that he is very pleased with the present  atmosphere of talks and that goodwill on the Estonian side was  much in evidence. In addition to talks with Raul Malk, the  Estonian Foreign Ministry's deputy chancellor, Churkin had a  meeting yesterday [7 June] with President Lennart Meri and  Foreign Minister Juri Luik.    Churkin opined that both parties genuinely wish to resolve  all the problems as quickly as possible in order to close a  chapter in Estonian-Russian relations and open a new one.  Taking into account the agreements reached in the course of  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Tallinn at  the end of May, Churkin thought that talks are nearing the  finishing line.    The next meeting between Churkin and Malk will evidently  take  place next week in Moscow.</p>

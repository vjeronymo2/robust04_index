			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: New managing director at Monte dei Paschi di Siena MONTE dei Paschi di Siena, the oldest bank in the world and once a byword for conservative lending and low profile finance, has appointed a new managing director, a month after four executives were implicated in corruption allegations. The election of Mr Vincenzo Pennarola, a long-standing manager, marks the latest step in a drama which has shaken Siena and cast new doubts on the cosy relationships between bank executives, the town council and the wider world of Tuscan finance. Matters changed when police arrested members of the bank board on corruption charges last month. The detentions were soon followed by warnings to Mr Carlo Zini, chief executive, that he, too, was under investigation. Mr Zini announced his readiness to step down earlier this month. As his successor has to be chosen by the Italian treasury - headed, ironically, by the bank's former chairman, Mr Piero Barucci - the sense of expectation rose pending an announcement. Last week, the government committee responsible publicly passed the buck to Siena itself. Monte dei Paschi has an unusually close relationship with its home town, based on the fact that it is indirectly controlled by the city and deeply rooted in urban tradition.</p>

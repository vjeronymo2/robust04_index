			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Spar buys 221-store chain from Treuhand SPAR, one of Germany's main retailers, has acquired eastern Germany's former state-run store network from the Treuhand privatisation agency. The 221 outlets, the largest block sale of retailing outlets by the Treuhand, are likely to consolidate Spar's position in eastern Germany when retailers in the cities are trying to win back consumers from the giant shopping centres built on greenfield sites. The Treuhand would not disclose the selling price. The outlets were part of the state-owned Handelsorganisation (HO) chain of food and department stores, which totalled 642, and which were placed under the Treuhand in late 1990. Spar intends to invest more than DM35m (Dollars 20.7m) and had already invested DM50m in HO outlets after renting many of them from the Treuhand. The agency has only recently been able to sell the outlets after resolving outstanding property and restitution claims.</p>

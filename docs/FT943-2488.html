			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Britain and US propose IMF support for poorer members Britain and the US have launched an initiative to allow the International Monetary Fund to boost the official reserves of former communist states and other less prosperous member countries. The treasuries of the two nations are working on a compromise package that would break many years of deadlock and enable the IMF to issue up to Dollars 23.44bn (Pounds 15.1bn) worth of its own reserve asset, known as the special drawing right (SDR). The main purpose of the issue would be to strengthen the finances of those IMF members which have joined the fund since the last SDR issue was made in 1981. It is understood that the two countries have suggested the issue of between SDR12bn (Pounds 11.3bn) and SDR16bn should be aimed at overcoming the unfair treatment of 37 'late entrants' into the IMF, including Russia and most of the other members of the former eastern block. The details of the Anglo-US initiative are unclear. But it would have to satisfy those countries which have backed Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, in his campaign for a general SDR36bn allocation among all the fund's members, and a minority of IMF member states, led by Germany, which have been reluctant to countenance any SDR issue. Germany will play a pivotal role in any agreement. The Bundesbank, which holds Germany's reserves, has long opposed a general SDR issue on the grounds that it could be inflationary and that there is no reason for such a boost to global liquidity. More recently, however, the Bundesbank has indicated that it might support a 'one-off' issue of SDRs, provided it was directed at solving the problem of the unfair treatment of recently joined IMF members. For the Bundesbank, one attraction of such a selective 'equity' issue of SDRs is that it would have to be agreed by 85 per cent of the IMF membership and be the subject of legislative change and ratification by member governments. This difficult procedure would prevent setting a precedent for global money creation by the IMF without legislative hurdles. A general SDR increase, such as that being proposed by Mr Camdessus, would require only the backing of the fund's executive board of countries, representing 85 per cent of the voting rights. Mr Camdessus says an SDR issue is necessary to help meet an estimated need for SDR400bn of extra liquidity over the next five years to finance growth of world trade.</p>

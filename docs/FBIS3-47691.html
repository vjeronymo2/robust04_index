The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula has been raised  since the United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea  against the DPRK and it has become all the more grave matter  with continued nuclear threat to the Korean people from the  ground, sea and sky with South Korea as the largest nuclear  forward base in the Far East, the paper points out, and  continues:    The United States is the very one who creates nuclear threat  on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK is the victim who is  exposed to the nuclear threat for scores of years.    The DPRK and the United States are the parties concerned who  are mainly responsible and have authority to settle the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula. This matter, therefore, can be  solved through dialogue and negotiations between the United  States, maker of nuclear threat against us, and the DPRK, a  victim.    At the first round of the talks, both sides discussed and  agreed on the matters of principle in the solution of the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and made public a joint  statement, and at the second round of the talks, the sides  discussed practical steps to implement the principles agreed  upon in the joint statement. But the third round of the talks  has been long deadlocked by moves of the Western insound [as  received] forces and their followers.    Out of the desire to fundamentally solve on an equal and  fair  basis the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, the DPRK side  put forward a formula of package dealing and has consistently  made efforts for an agreement at working-level contacts between  both sides.    At the 18th DPRK-U.S. contact held on December 29 last year,  the sides agreed to discuss in a package deal the issues for a  fundamental solution of the nuclear problem.    The DPRK-U.S. contacts show that the nuclear problem on the  Korean peninsula can be solved in a fair and peaceful way when  both sides display the spirit of mutual understanding and  cooperation.    A fair solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula favours the interest of the U.S. itself.    The lesson of the DPRK-U.S. contacts since the second round  of the talks is that the matter can never be untangled by means  of resorting to delaying tactics or putting pressure, placing  unreasonable precondition and, moreover, the threat and hostile  act infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the partner  of dialogue will lead the situation to a catastrophe.    If the principles already agreed upon between the DPRK and  the United States are observed and implemented, the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula would be solved fairly.</p>

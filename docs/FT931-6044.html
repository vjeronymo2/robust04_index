			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Abbey National aims to set up insurance subsidiary A SHAKE-UP in the housing insurance market was predicted yesterday after Abbey National, one of the biggest mortgage lenders, rejected insurance companies' attempts to set higher premiums to compensate for more than Pounds 2bn of losses. Abbey said it was trying to establish an insurance subsidiary to provide its own mortgage indemnity insurance. It emerged separately that at least 11 large mortgage lenders are considering breaking with general insurers. Home buyers now face substantially higher premiums to pay for mortgage indemnity policies, which cover lenders against a portion of losses on sales of repossessed properties. But Abbey's move could lead to competition between lenders and insurers to provide buildings and contents insurance, as lenders may use new subsidiaries to underwrite household insurance. Mr Dane Douetil, a specialist in mortgage indemnity business with brokers Special Risk Services, said his group was negotiating with 11 of the country's largest lenders about similar self-insurance schemes. Although building societies are currently barred from owning more than 15 per cent of a general insurance company, societies are pressing the Building Societies Commission to relax this rule. Mr Michael Coogan, deputy secretary of the Building Societies Association, said several large lenders had been examining the possibility of establishing their own 'captive' insurers. Two centralised mortgage lenders - Household Mortgage Corporation and The Mortgage Corporation - have already set up their own subsidiaries to insure indemnity risks. Abbey said the terms it was offered by Legal &amp; General, Royal Insurance and Commercial Union were not acceptable. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said the company was negotiating with re-insurers. He said it had no cover for new mortgages at the moment, but would achieve new cover by mid-year. Talks between insurers and lenders have been underway for over a year. In September, insurers established new standard contracts limiting their liability to the section of loans above 75 or 80 per cent of the value of properties. Any losses within this limit will be split between insurers and lenders, with insurers bearing 80 per cent of the loss. Insurers have also restricted the types of properties on which they will insure mortgages. The insurers made estimated losses of Pounds 1.38bn on mortgage indemnity policies in 1991, and more than Pounds 800m last year. Abbey National results, Page 21 and Page 24</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO CUT ALL FUNDS FOR SCANDAL-PLAGUED HUD PROGRAM  </P> <P> Reacting to scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a key  House appropriations subcommittee has voted to eliminate all funds on Oct. 1  for a controversial low-income rent subsidy program, it was disclosed  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The panel "zeroed out" money for the troubled Section 8 moderate rehabilitation  program, which got $323 million in federal funding for the current fiscal year.  The cut was voted Tuesday despite Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's attempt to  revise the program to eliminate influence peddling to obtain the grants.  </P> <P> But testimony before congressional committees in recent weeks has dramatized  how such well-known Republicans as former Interior Secretary James G. Watt and  a half-dozen former HUD officials have cashed in on political connections as  consultants to benefit from a program intended to help poor people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Housing Construction  </P> <P> The subcommittee in charge of housing appropriations also decided to use some  of the money that otherwise would go to the moderate rehabilitation, or "Mod  Rehab," program to authorize construction of 7,500 public housing units in the  next fiscal year -- an increase of 2,500 from the current figure.  </P> <P> In another move to block favoritism in HUD awards, the subcommittee adopted a  requirement that all deputy assistant secretaries at the agency be career civil  servants and not political appointees.  </P> <P> Kemp was told of the developments as he testified Wednesday before the housing  subcommittee of the Housing, Banking and Urban Affairs Committee. He objected  to the reduction in the number of political appointees but told the panel that  he had taken a separate step toward limiting the power of political appointees  once they leave office.  </P> <P> More specifically, he said that he had asked the Office of Government Ethics to  bar all top-level HUD employees from lobbying his department for at least a  year after they leave their jobs.  </P> <P> Kemp reacted calmly to the elimination of subsidy funds for the Mod Rehab  program. However, he objected strongly to the subcommittee's action requiring  career employees in the deputy assistant secretary posts.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration did not ask for any funds for Mod Rehab, which was  manipulated by HUD officials in the Ronald Reagan Administration, according to  congressional testimony.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the housing subcommittee, told  Kemp at Wednesday's hearing of the appropriations panel's decision to chop all  funds for the Mod Rehab program and the civil service requirement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'News to All of Us'  </P> <P> "It's news to all of us," Kemp said. "I would be terribly disappointed if  deputy assistant secretaries at HUD were required to be career positions. . . .  It would limit what the (HUD) secretary could do. . . . It's a pernicious  idea."  </P> <P> Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J) asked for Kemp's reaction to zero funding for the  rehabilitation program.  </P> <P> "It wasn't in the budget request that came from HUD," Kemp replied. "We thought  we could negotiate a better program with the Congress."  </P> <P> While Kemp has said that he did not want to use the recent scandals as a  subterfuge to eliminate housing programs intended for the poor, he has  criticized the Mod Rehab program on grounds that it was too costly and gave  excessive profits to developers.  </P> <P> If the appropriations subcommittee's decision is upheld in the full committee  and in the House itself, HUD would be able to carry over funds from the current  fiscal year that were not spent before it ends on Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Kemp canceled applications under the program and ordered new applications by  public housing agencies in cities and states to be selected under a new formula  designed to eliminate any possibility of political favoritism.  </P> <P> In a June 2 announcement, however, he said that the program was "back on track"  with awards to be made before Sept. 30, using the new criteria. While Kemp said  that there was still about $225 million left to spend, a spokesman for the  House appropriations subcommittee that deals with HUD's budget said the amount  is only $170 million.  </P> <P> Kemp's steps on lobbying by former officials of the department might help  bolster confidence in HUD.  </P> <P> Departing from the practice of his much-criticized predecessor, Samuel R.  Pierce Jr., Kemp proposed to add 54 key political and career positions to the  list of those subject to the post-employment curbs.  </P> <P> In the past, these 54 posts were exempted by Pierce from rules that forbid  senior officials from lobbying HUD for one year on any matter and for two years  on any matter that they were substantially and personally involved in deciding.  </P> <P> Congressional testimony has shown that many top officials left HUD and became  consultants on housing issues, lobbying their former colleagues for favorable  decisions on multimillion-dollar grants.  </P> <P> In a statement, Kemp called it important to expand coverage of the lobbying  restrictions "if we are to make it clear to the American public that the  revolving door at HUD has been closed."  </P></p>

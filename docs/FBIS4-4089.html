Gao Changli, deputy secretary of the leading party group of  the Supreme People's Court and executive vice president; Xie  Anshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court and  chairman of the political department; Liu Fahe, head of the  discipline inspection group of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission stationed in the Supreme People's Court; and  responsible comrades of higher people's courts of various  provinces, cities, and autonomous regions attended the  conference.    On behalf of the municipal party committee and the municipal  government, Gao Dezhan extended warm congratulations to the  conference and warm welcome to responsible comrades of courts  attending the conference from all parts of the country.    He said: At present, China's reform, opening up, and  modernization drive have entered a new development stage.  Convening this conference under the new situation is of major  and practical significance in raising the political quality of  court contingents and strengthening political work, party style,  and administrative honesty. During recent years, under the  guidance of the Supreme People's court, courts at all levels  across Tianjin acted in close connection with the central task  of economic construction, submitted their work to and served  this central task, and achieved great achievements in judicial  work and building contingents. The convocation of this  conference in Tianjin is a very good chance for this  municipality. It is necessary to learn from comrades from all  localities, exchange views with them, conscientiously implement  the conference guidelines, enhance the court work of Tianjin to  a new height, and make greater contributions to reform,  development, and stability.    In his speech, Xie Anshan pointed out: At present and for  some time to come, the major tasks of courts across the country  in carrying out political and ideological work are to take the  guidelines of the 14th party congress as the guidance, to arm  the broad masses of cadres and policemen with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the great pioneering spirit, strive to  improve their political and professional quality, fully mobilize  their work enthusiasm and initiative, intensify their awareness,  steadfastness, and creativity in implementing the party's basic  line, and ensure that laws will be strictly enforced in an  effort to provide a strong ideological guarantee for  comprehensively fulfilling all work tasks of courts. He  stressed: At present, special efforts should be made to solve  the issues on the understanding, basic ideas, and methods for  successfully carrying out political and ideological work under  the market economic conditions. It is necessary to create a  brand-new situation in the political work of the people's courts  and make new contributions to building a court contingent with  strong fighting capacity that can be greatly trusted by the  party and the people and guaranteeing the comprehensive  fulfillment of all work tasks of courts.    At the conference, Liu Fahe worked out plans for carrying  out  the 1994 anticorruption tasks of courts so as to guarantee  honesty and fairness in enforcing laws and to deeply conduct  anticorruption struggle among courts, and proposed measures for  courts and discipline inspection and supervisory organs to  strengthen self- development in the course of launching  anticorruption struggle.</p>

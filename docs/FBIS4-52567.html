			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, 10 May, at the National Assembly  office, Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly of  the Kingdom of Cambodia, and a number of MP's granted an  audience to His Excellency [H.E.] Yuriy Mirkotnykh, Russian  ambassador to Cambodia, who came to pay a courtesy call and bid  farewell to them.    On that occasion, the Russian ambassador thanked Samdech  Chea  Sim for allowing him to come and bid farewell before returning  to his country on 8 May 1994, after the completion of his  mission in Cambodia. The ambassador expressed his regret and  nostalgia over his departure from Cambodia, where he had been  working for 24 years in close bilateral cooperation to reinforce  and expand the relations in all fields, especially in the  process of seeking peace, national reconciliation, and national  compromise to put an end to the Cambodian war. This process  remains unsuccessful due to the Party of Democratic Kampuchea's  intransigence and refusal to join the Royal Government of  Cambodia [RGC]. Anyway, the Russian envoy emphasized that even  though he was to undertake his task in another place, he would  continue his endeavor to seek peace for Cambodia.    In his reply, Samdech Chea Sim thanked Russia for its  assistance to Cambodia and for the success resulting from its  good bilateral cooperation with the country. He expressed hope  that Russia would further its diplomatic cooperation with  Cambodia after the departure of H.E. Yuriy Mirkotnykh.    Again the Russian ambassador said Russia would make  arrangements for welcoming Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut,  deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of the  Kingdom of Cambodia, who will soon visit Russia to sign a number  of agreements on international cooperation between the two  countries. He added that Russia would always support the RGC  and National Assembly.    Samdech Chea Sim thanked Russia for its support for the  National Assembly and RGC, saying he hoped that in the  cooperation between the two countries' assemblies there would be  exchanges of visits by various assembly committees to strengthen  and promote the process of rehabilitating and rebuilding the  countries toward prosperity.    On that occasion, the Russian ambassador asked Samdech Chea  Sim about the roundtable meeting between the RGC and the Party  of Democratic Kampuchea. Commenting on this issue Samdech Chea  Sim said the RGC has exerted its all-out efforts in this  problem, but the Khmer Rouge side refuses to meet in Phnom Penh  under the pretext that the city is not neutral and that there is  no security for its delegation, although the RGC has already  made all kinds of guarantees. The samdech also pointed out that  the roundtable meeting had not been held yet and that it can  take place only if a cease-fire is implemented beforehand.    On the issue of reorganizing elections proposed by His  Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk -- who has said that if the Khmer  Rouge are real patriots, he will propose new general elections  to be organized by Cambodian parties without the participation  of the United Nations -- Samdech Chea Sim said the Khmer Rouge  side has not yet given its answer to this proposal and that the  Cambodian National Assembly is currently considering it and  awaiting a decision from the RGC. The samdech stressed that if  polls are to be reorganized, the Constitution should be changed,  and the RGC and National Assembly should be dissolved. This  move, he added, appears to be beneficial to the Khmer Rouge.    The Russian ambassador also wanted to know about the RGC's  decision to outlaw the Khmer Rouge. On this issue, Samdech Chea  Sim said this move has been put aside and that the RGC and  National Assembly have not discussed it yet. He further said  that next week, the National Assembly will continue its session  to discuss the appointment of new MP's to replace the old ones  and debate diverse laws as planned in the agenda.</p>

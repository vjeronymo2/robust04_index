			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Banks queue to buy Sweden's Gota THE SWEDISH government said yesterday that around 20 domestic and international banks had shown 'serious interest' in buying Gota Bank, which was taken over by the state in the face of mounting losses last December. The news came as the government removed six Gota board members to signal a clear break with the management who were in charge when the bank ran into difficulties. The bank's chairman, Mr Dan Wersen, and managing director, Mr Per Lundberg, both of whom only took up their positions towards the end of last year, were the only board representatives to survive the clear-out. The government wants to move quickly to return Gota Bank to the private sector and believes a solution, which may involve one or more purchasers, can be found by the end of the year. Credit Suisse First Boston is assisting the government with the sale. Potential purchasers are not being identified at this stage although talk that Deutsche Bank had agreed to buy part of Gota was firmly denied by the Swedish government and the German bank yesterday. It is likely that any purchaser will only buy the bank's healthy assets, which carry a value of some SKr50bn (Dollars 6.76bn). Its problem loans have already been transferred to a separate 'bad bank' - following a model adopted by other Swedish banks - although they are still formally under the bank's ownership. So far the government's assistance to the bank amounts to a SKr10bn guarantee which it provided in January. Gota Bank is due to report first-quarter figures on Wednesday. Last year, its operating loss deepened to SKr2.4bn from SKr1.9bn in 1991 after credit losses more than tripled to SKr12.5bn from SKr3.7bn. The loss would have amounted to SKr12.9bn without SKr4.5bn in financial insurance and SKr6.0bn in state guarantees. Five new members have already been appointed to the board, including a representative from the finance ministry.</p>

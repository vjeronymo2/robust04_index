			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GREENPEACE PLANS TO BLOCK MISSILE TEST  </P> <P> Leaders of the international environmental group Greenpeace said Thursday they  would sail two vessels into a military test area off Florida in an effort to  disrupt a test launch of a Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine, which  they said is scheduled for today.  </P> <P> The first submarine launch of a three-stage, 126,000-pound Trident 2 ended in a  spectacular failure in March when a malfunction in the missile's nozzle system  sent the $26.5-million rocket cartwheeling out of control seconds after launch.  </P> <P> The Navy does not discuss such tests, typically conducted about 50 miles east  of Cape Canaveral, before they take place.  </P></p>

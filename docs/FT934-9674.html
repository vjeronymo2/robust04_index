			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Beijing to back sweeping reforms CHINA'S TOP policy-making body, the Communist party Central Committee, will meet this week to endorse sweeping reforms of taxation, banking and trade. Chinese officials are describing this plenary session as the most important since the history-making Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of 1978 at which the reform drive was launched. Confirmation that the Central Committee would convene on Thursday came in an article in a Beijing-affiliated Hong Kong newspaper, Wen Wei Po, which forecast Chinese leaders would 'take important and breakthrough reform measures'. This latest Central Committee session coincides with an intense debate within the leadership over steps to cool an overheating economy which is expected to grow by about 13 per cent this year, the same as last year. The session is certain to feature spirited discussion between those advocating continued stern measures to combat inflation, and others wanting more liberal credit policies to save faltering state industries further hardship. Taiwan yesterday refused to concede its right to prosecute suspected hijackers from mainland China, despite pressure from Beijing to send hijackers immediately back for trial under mainland Chinese law, Dennis Engbarth reports from Taipei. A Zhejiang Airlines Airbus 300 turboprop airliner was hijacked to Taiwan yesterday, the second act of air piracy in less than three days and the sixth this year. Paradoxically, the two latest hijackings took place as talks were under way in Xiamen between nominally unofficial representatives from Taiwan and China which are aimed at resolving a series of disputes.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Bovin, Russian Federation </F> ambassador to Israel, by Valeriy Dzhalagoniya and Aleksandr  Zhudro in Tel-Aviv; date not specified: "Will We Live To See  Democracy?" ]    [Text] The ambassador of the Russian Federation in  Israel, Aleksandr Bovin, is sitting deeply submerged in a  leather arm chair under a large portrait of Boris Yeltsin. On  the pier of the office there is a smaller photograph: A laughing  boy, who is fated to play a certain key role in our discussion.    Bovin, whom not so long ago we regularly saw on television  as  international commentator and read in the pages of IZVESTIYA,  after having become a diplomat, has retained a striking  resemblance to Balzac. A dashingly twirled moustache, hair to  his shoulders, red suspenders. And, as before, he makes do  without a tie. The wide-open collar does not violate protocol,  since Israeli politicians also dress rather informally.    Having made the arrangements for the interview, we submitted  our questions in written form, but we agreed that, when meeting  in person, we can add to them. So that the interview took place,  as it were, on two levels.    [EKHO PLANETY] You, Aleksandr Yevgenyevich, have always been  known as a journalist with an opinion of his own, which  frequently does not coincide with "the directions from  above"--in a certain sense, a forerunner of glasnost. And here,  when the Russian press received unprecedented freedom,  diplomatic work tore you away from journalism. Do you regret  this? Are you planning in time to return to the pen? And how do  you assess from the sidelines, now already as a reader, the  contemporary level of our press, and its place in the present  unusual situation?    [Bovin] I have no regrets. It is difficult to be engaged in  one and the same thing for 20 years. The freshness of perception  is lost and the routine becomes oppressive. A change of  occupation is like the departure for a new and unknown world.  Moreover, in this case--into a world of interesting and  attractive work.    I don't have to yearn for the pen. I am writing more  frequently than in IZVESTIYA. Only the audience is a different  one. Not 10 million, but 10 persons.    I do not intend to return to journalism. At my age, "in  time"  does not sound very optimistic.    I will not undertake to give an assessment of the Russian  mass media, since I do not read all of them and not regularly. I  try to follow the most interesting materials from IZVESTIYA,  LITERATURKA [LITERATURNAYA GAZETA], NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, and  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. It seems to me that in "the present unusual  situation" these publications have found their unusual place.    [EKHO PLANETY] Millions of Russians and Russian-speaking  people have in recent years found themselves outside the  boundaries of Russia; moreover, it is by far not always able to  protect their interests. This problem exists most acutely in the  "near abroad", but, apparently, in its own way, it is no  stranger in Israel. Who for you are Russian-speaking Israelis? A  self-supporting person [as published]? Compatriots in need of  assistance? A part of our Homeland, transferred to Israeli soil?  And how do the emigrants regard you, the ambassador of Russia?    [Bovin] However strange it may be, but the people who were  thrown out by Soviet society, driven out from the USSR, more  correctly, by the circumstances reigning in it, who were  slighted, insulted, and were called "traitors," and who turned  up in Israel, in a country which for a quarter of a century has  served as as "whipping boy," these people yearn for their, as  they say here, "prehistoric Homeland," avidly follow the news  from Russia, and support us. A great many retain Russian  citizenship, and those who were deprived of it are trying to  restore it. Hence--the relation to the ambassador of Russia, to  the Russian embassy.    The growing into new soil, a new environment, is proceeding  with difficulty. painfully, and slowly. One has to encounter  dramas and sometimes also tragedies. Assistance, it goes without  saying, is necessary. But these are already not so much the  problems of the Russian ambassador as they are the problems of  the Israeli government.    The embassy sees its task not in pushing aside, in cutting  off, in chopping off, etc., but in preserving and strengthening  the threads connecting "Russian" Jews with Russia. This  corresponds to the principles of democracy and humanitarianism.  This also corresponds to the interests of Russia, for it helps  us to occupy stronger and more stable positions in Israel, and  thus in the Near East as a whole.    [EKHO PLANETY] The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  been reproached for the lack of a firm policy in regard to the  rights of the Russian population abroad. While an attempt to  formulate such a policy has been made, this by no means pleased  everyone. How do you perceive the attitude of the new Russia to  the Russian-speaking population?    [Bovin] First of all, what we need is not a firm policy, but  a sensible one. More precisely, a sensible [policy] (always) and  a firm one (when necessary). Secondly, the development of such a  policy is difficult and takes a long time. Not everything turns  out at once, in the beginning vacillations and blunders are  inevitable. Thirdly, our policy must, above all, please Russia  and correspond to the interests of Russia. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, as far as I can judge, is actively developing  such a policy.    Incidentally. If we can learn anything from the Americans,  it  is, above all, their attitude to their compatriots abroad. For  the United States administration, every American is a "separate  commodity" [shtuchnyy tovar], and every [American] can count on  the fact that, at a difficult moment, "Uncle Sam" will come to  his assistance.    Every citizen of Russia, every Russian person who is outside  the borders of Russia, if he has not intentially harmed his  country, if he has a clean conscience, must be convinced that he  has a "strong home front." Some day this is how it will be. . . .    [EKHO PLANETY] After the sensational handshake of Yitzhak  Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue all  the same is moving with difficulty. Support for the agreements  on the part of both Israelis and Palestinians is weakening. What  is this--temporary difficulties, or signs of the possible  failure of the entire peace process in the Near East? What is  your Near East prognosis? Are you skeptical in regard to the  possibility of a quick settlement in the region?    [Bovin] From a historical viewpoint, there are no permanent  difficulties; all difficulties are temporary ones. And,  therefore, sooner or later, the present difficulties will be  overcome. And in this case, if we are talking about an  all-encompassing, just, and stable settlement of Near East  affairs, more likely later than sooner.    The movement along this long path will not be even. There  will be break-throughs, understandings, and agreements. Already  long ago, there was an agreement between Israel and Egypt. Soon  a provisional agreement with the Palestinians will be signed. An  agreement with Jordan is approaching. Even Syria has started to  talk about peace. So that positive changes and great changes may  come "sooner."    But when I think about Jerusalem, about the fate of the  Golan  Heights, and about the future of the 140,000 Jewish settlers  living in the territories seized by Israel as the result of wars  with its neighbors, when I think about the wall of hatred  dividing Jews and Arabs, which is stronger and higher than the  Berlin Wall, I cannot allow myself to remain within the confines  of short-term and even medium-term prognoses. The difficulties,  even if temporary, are enormous. One cannot but admire the  courage of Yitzhak Rabin and the persistence of Shimon Peres,  who, in spite of loud cries of protest, demonstrations, and  appeals for active resistance, decided to break the course of  history and to lead Israel out of the period of enmity,  confrontation and war. The cause which they have begun are now  engaged in will be brought to completion by the next generations  of political leaders. But it is important to begin. . . . "Only  that day dawns to which we are awake," said Henry [David]  Thoreau.    [EKHO PLANETY] While in the Near East the hope appeared of  disentangling the most protracted regional conflict, the  relatively "young" conflicts in Karabakh, Abkhasia, and some  other regions of the former Soviet Union stubbornly refuse to  yield to a settlement. Shevardnadze, who did a lot to extricate  the USSR from the Afghan quagmire, is unable to find a way out  of the situation in his native Georgia. Are the methods and  solutions approved by international practice applicable in  general to the "hot spots" in the post-Soviet space?    [Bovin] There is very little practice in the "disentangling"  of conflicts in the post-confrontation space. The first steps  are being taken. And the steps are not always successful. I will  recall only Somalia and Yugoslavia. And all the same, in  studying the "hot spots" in the post-Soviet space, we have to  look closely at the experience which the international community  has gained. Remembering in so doing, it goes without saying,  that our chief riches are not the bruises and bumps which the  Americans inflicted on themselves in Somalia, for example, but  those which we inflicted on ourselves in Karabakh or Abkhazia.  No one will teach us if we ourselves do not want to learn.    [EKHO PLANETY] You have already studied Israel sufficiently  well--a country where, to a certain extent, it proved possible  realize the seemingly hopelessly utopian Zionist idea. What in  the Israeli experience, positive as well as negative, could  prove to be useful for Russia?    [Bovin] I am not very convinced that the founders of Zionism  would perceive modern Israel and its way of life as the  embodiment of the "Zionist idea."    As far as the "Israeli experience" is concerned, its  positive  aspects are connected with democracy and the socially oriented  market economy. Towards which we are going, I hope. And the  negative aspects are rooted in the domination of the  bureaucrats, in the aspiration of the bureaucratic machine to  influence all aspects of social life. Which, I hope, we are  leaving behind us...    [EKHO PLANETY] With this, the "written" part of the  interview  came to an end; our subsequent discussion went on "live."  Wanting to verify the correctness of our observations in Israel,  one of the authors of this material, who had come in the rank of  "guest from Moscow," put a number of "solo" questions to the  Russian ambassador.    [EKHO PLANETY] In its time, the Soviet Union played a  considerable part in the creation of the Israeli state, but then  followed decades of unconditional support of the Arabs and an  uncompromising struggle against Zionism. . . . Have both of  these periods been retained in the historical memory of Israel,  or only the second one?    [Bovin] Undoubtedly, both. But in current politics, the  present nevertheless beats out the past.    [EKHO PLANETY] Including the negative past? Or has the  syndrome of distrust among Israelis nevertheless remained?    [Bovin] The negative [past], too. But as to the syndrome of  distrust, if it does exist, it is somewhere deep. On the level  of current politics, I repeat, the events of the past few years  have a greater effect, and not what was, for example, 25 years  ago. Although on the whole, if we, let us say, write a book  about this, both aspects need to be kept in mind.    [EKHO PLANETY] When you began work in Israel, the USSR, an  enormous, great country, existed--at least this is what it was  called. But now Russia, although in contrast to its historical  forerunner it has become a democratic country, but....    [Bovin] I hope that it will become a democratic country.    [EKHO PLANETY] An essential amplification.... But, on the  other hand, it has suffered an appreciable loss of its former  influence. Do you feel these changes on yourself as the  plenipotentiary of Russia?    [Bovin] My partners here are very delicate people, and they  do not give me this feeling.    [EKHO PLANETY] During the week that I have been in Israel, I  have had occasion to have a lot of contact with immigrants from  our country. It is striking that in the majority of cases they  occupy an extremely tough position on the question of  territorial concessions to the Arabs in exchange for peace.  There was even a conference in Jerusalem on this this question,  at which the sentiment held sway: "We will not give an inch...."  How do you explain such intransigence?    [Bovin] You are incorrect in your initial statement.  According to my observations, in no circumstances can one think  that the majority of aliyah [people who want to become citizens  of Israel] from Russia takes that position. But here there is  one circumstance. When the government of the Likud Party was in  power and there were large problems with the absorption (the  implantation of repatriates in Israeli society--Author's note),  the majority of the ethnic Russian [russkuyu] aliyah came out  against it. In essence, this government was thrown out through  "Russian" votes. But since the current government of Rabin is  not carrying out its program demands in regard to absorption  (although enough is being done), now the critical shots are  aimed at it. Above all, in regard to the problem of absorption,  but, of course, encompassing also a broader range of questions,  including military policy. You recalled the conference "Aliya  for Eretz-Israel [Aliyah for the Land of Israel]." However, it  seems to me, that the people who were present there represent by  far not the entire Russian [rossiyskuyu] aliyah. Perhaps the  more active part of it, but the smaller one.    [EKHO PLANETY] And all the same, I sensed a deep-seated  distrust of the Arabs in the hearts of our former fellow  citizens. It is possible that for many immigrants the memories  of the night bombardments of Tel-Aviv by Iraq during the Persian  Gulf crisis created a negative emotional background. This  coincided with the most massive influx from our country.    [Bovin] Yes, there really are such sentiments. Although I  was  frequently told: On the screens and in the newspapers all this  looked much more acute than in reality.    [EKHO PLANETY] And still one more, very fresh observation.  In  all homes where I had the occasion to be, people literally  cannot tear themselves away from the TV screen when there are  programs from Moscow. But yesterday I was in a home where they  consciously do not turn on TV on Russian wavelengths since this,  as the hosts believe, can interfere with integration in Israeli  society. The opinion was even expressed that for this reason  Israel has no need for either Russian-language radio or  Russian-language newspapers. It is necessary to forget once and  for all everything that was in the former life and start a new  one.    [Bovin] In the long term, the connections of the immigrants  with Russia will gradually die down, this is historically  inevitable since the pot is boiling and a new nation of  Israelites or Hebrews, as you like, is being formed. But for the  time being, such sentiments are individual. Moreover, here is  what is interesting--people consciously convince themselves: "It  is not necessary to watch television from Moscow, it is not  necessary to listen to the local Russian radio "Reka" [River].  We chop off all these roots, we live here, we breathe this air,  and we speak in this language." On the level of reason they  understand this, but on the level of emotions, they will  nevertheless read, listen, and watch everything Russian. The  departure from the past is an inevitable but long period. This  is so everywhere.    [EKH0 PLANETY] Do you think, everywhere? Is there not a  typically Russian syndrome here: We have come from a country  that has become impoverished and has collapsed, we will forget  it, like a bad dream. . . I cannot imagine that, let us say, an  American Jew, having come here, would try to forget as soon as  possible what is happening across the ocean. . . . Or any  European. . . .    [Bovin] Only between Israel and Russia the difference is  much  greater than between Israel and America. This, first of all.  Secondly, the abandonment of America and the abandonment of  Russia--these are completely different processes. In the second  case, there are incomparably more feelings. For this reason, it  is difficult to make comparisons here, these are different  things.    [EKHO PLANETY] And nevertheless I hope that, when Russia  becomes a normal, moderately prosperous and democratic country,  of which one does not have to be ashamed, people will not put it  out of their memory. . . .    [Bovin] I assure you, no one here is ashamed of Russia.  People love it precisely as it is now--poverty-stricken,  disorderly, in the midst of chaos. I do not recognize such  logic: When Russia becomes prosperous and democratic we will  begin to love it more. Nothing of the sort! Precisely by that  time, these people, possibly, will love it less. Up to 90  percent of them will become Israelites, there already will not  be the former acuteness of emotions.    [EKHO PLANETY] And the last thing. Your prognosis: When will  Russia become democratic? When working in journalism, you made  rather accurate prognoses.    [Bovin] I never made accurate prognoses.    [EKHO PLANETY] But why, the readers of the 1970's and 1980's  well remember your analytical surveys with a calculation of the  possible variants of the development of events. And now?    [Bovin] Do you see the photograph? It is my grandson. When  he  reaches the age of our junior colleague (a gesture toward  Aleksandr Zhudro), Russia, I hope, will become democratic. But  such a "danger" does not threaten you and me. This is not a  question of pessimism or optimism. Simply Russia is such a mass  that to change its course and direction is impossible in a year,  in 5 years, or in 10 years. The situation of chaos can be  eliminated, the standard of living can be made tolerable, and  one can patch the hole, as the sailors say. All this can be  done, probably, even in the time that depends on us. But to  transform Russia into a democratic, prosperous country a much  greater period of time is required. This is what I think. . . .    For information: The correspondent of ITAR-TASS (and our  journal) in Tel-Aviv, A. Zhudro, will be 40 years old this year.  The grandson of the ambassador of the Russian Federation, Makar,  will be 6 years old. So count.</p>

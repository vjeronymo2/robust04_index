			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey's Air Attack on Zeli Camp </F> in Iraq"]    [Text] The ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY has reported that Turkey's  military aircraft carried out 52 sorties against the Zeli Camp  in northern Iraq, which is 110 km from the Turkish border.  According to the news agency, the objective of the air attack  was to completely destroy the Zeli Camp, in which 1,600 Kurdish  opponents of the Turkish Government were sheltered.    Considering the fact that, in the past, Turkish aircraft had  hit targets up to 20 km into northern Iraq at most, this was the  first time they penetrated to bomb positions of the Kurdish  Workers Party [PKK] deep inside northern Iraq. Referring to the  latest operations against the PKK, Turkish Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller said: As far as the struggle waged against the PKK is  concerned, 1994 is an important year.    Political observers believe that Ankara has launched a new  phase in Turkey's operations against the PKK militants.  Although, similar operations were carried out against the PKK  in the past, Ankara's move to intensify the Turkish cross-border  operations indicates that it is mostly worried by the  developments in northern Iraq. However, several political  observers are convinced that Ankara is more worried about the  overt and covert policies of the European countries. They are  also convinced that the fact that European countries give  support to the Kurds in Iraq while remaining indifferent to the  Turkish Government's suppression of the Kurds in Turkey accords  with the policies of those Western Governments. The same  observers believe that, considering the fact that the United  States and the European countries act according to their own  political interests, the Turkish officials are seeking several  guarantees from the Western countries. The banning of the PKK's  activities by the Bonn and Paris governments is regarded as in  accord with Ankara's wishes.    However, the Turkish officials are still believed to be  worried by the activities of the Kurds, who are opposed to the  Turkish and Iraqi Governments. Considering this state of  affairs, several political observers are convinced that the  Ankara Government's military moves against the Kurds will not be  successful. Therefore, they believe that political talks will  be the most effective means of resolving the PKK problem.  Undoubtedly, the Turkish Government's cross-border operations  against northern Iraq violate the territorial integrity of Iraq,  which is an independent country. Furthermore, if such operations  continue, they may harm security and stability in the region.  In view of this, the settlement of the problems in the region  through cooperation among the regional countries without foreign  interference would promote security in the region.</p>

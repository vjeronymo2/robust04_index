			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Russian budget comes under further strain THE struggle to keep the Russian budget deficit within reasonable limits was further weakened yesterday. Ministers admitted that state spending would have to rise while some taxes would be cut to protect living standards, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. At the same time huge sums are being lost through the non-collection of taxes. The battle for budget containment, if lost, will have a serious effect on Russia's attempt to obtain Dollars 5bn-Dollars 6bn (Pounds 2.8bn-Pounds 3.4bn) from the west to stabilise the rouble. The two main contributors to such a fund - the US and Japan - point to continuing financial indiscipline in Russia as a reason for waiting to give support until Russia is granted IMF membership - probably in May or June. The Russian authorities are now showing signs of strain, even of panic, in face of relentless price rises. There are also, as yet, few signs of increased production and supply - though ministers insist shops are becoming better stocked. Mr Genady Burbulis, the first deputy prime minister of Russia, last night told a group of Russian deputies that a new party must be formed to support President Boris Yeltsin and sustain the reform process. His speech appears to open a campaign to rally organised support for the Russian president. Opposition demonstrations are planned in Moscow this weekend. Mr Burbulis's call, made to the party led by Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, who has been critical of Mr Yeltsin, appears designed to rally the centrist forces in the Russian parliament around the president at a time when the new political parties are in disarray and the banned Communist party is seeking a come-back under a variety of guises. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper concluded yesterday that 'the president (Mr Yeltsin) is frightened by the decrease in his own popularity and is taking steps to head off the reform. Next step will be to head off the government'. In a harshly realistic survey of the reforms so far, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of social affairs, yesterday said it would be 'very hard to resolve the dilemma' posed for the budget by a mass of cuts in its revenue and demands for further payments. These include an estimated cut in revenues of Rbs25bn-Rbs30bn resulting from a decrease in the value added tax from 25 to 15 per cent on a range of foodstuffs, and the abolition of VAT on most canteen meals. There will also be increased spending of at least Rbs15bn for pensions, students stipends and other state wages to cover price rises. Mr Shokhin said that prices had risen by 3.5 times in January, compared with government forecasts of 2.5 times. The wage needed to sustain a basic standard of living had risen to Rbs550 a month, but the present minimum pension is Rbs342. Ukraine's parliament voted yesterday to create a special debt repayment fund by taxing the hard currency profits of exporters, Reuter reports from Kiev. Exporters will pay between 15 and 70 per cent of hard currency profits to the fund. A further 5 per cent will go to local governments. Ukraine has offered to take responsibility for 16.37 per cent of the total former Soviet foreign debt, estimated at Dollars 70bn.</p>

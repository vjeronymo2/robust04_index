			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Insolvency firms attack 'aggressive' watchdog Leading insolvency practitioners have been putting pressure on their regulatory body to dilute the tough approach planned for inspections of their firms. Board members of the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit, the self-regulating body which begins full operation next Monday, debated possible changes to its approach at a meeting earlier this month. They discussed concerns over the tone and nature of the information sought by the unit's inspectors, which they believed to be excessively aggressive. Their demands included requirements in 'pre-visit questionnaires' issued to firms before inspection that they list any failures to comply with regulations - which some firms believed could be self-incriminatory and could breach concerns over confidentiality. Mr Malcolm London, president of the Insolvency Practitioners' Association and a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said yesterday: 'This was not the sort of monitoring we were anticipating.' 'We are more concerned with assisting our members to get themselves properly organised to comply with the rules,' he said. 'Our main concern is not to discipline them.' Ms Kay Linnell, chief executive of the unit, said: 'We are not modifying anything. There is no point in us going in firms with a blindfold on. 'This is an overreaction by quite senior people in the profession. We are human beings and will use a light touch. Practitioners have got to realise they are getting a free independent peer review.' She said firms' internal control systems ought to be able to pick up compliance breaches. She added that a number of larger firms had 'so many layers of management' that they were unable to provide comprehensive information even on their current workload. She said she had prevented the firms trying to influence which consultants temporarily hired from their competitors would be allowed to conduct inspections. Mr London said of Ms Linnell: 'She is quite single-minded and strong-minded and not easily persuaded to change her mind.' The Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit was set up under pressure from the Insolvency Service at the Department of Trade and Industry, because the Insolvency Service did not believe there was adequate supervision of members of the insolvency prof-ession. It submits reports to the licensing bodies of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, its counterpart in Scotland and the Insolvency Practitioners Association. It is these bodies that determine any disciplinary action of the practitioners they represent.</p>

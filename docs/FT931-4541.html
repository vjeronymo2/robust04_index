			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (3): Brinkmanship is not enough  -Guide to procedure BORROWING dulls the edge of husbandry, and lending is fraught with risk too. But Polonius was only half right when he warned against both. Good credit management is about following rules. It is not expensive or complicated. Nor should it stifle a company's wish to be creative and flexible, within limits. It can allow a company to borrow and lend, oil the wheels of the business, and emerge unscathed. Striking a balance might seem hard: go easy on creditors and you could be taken for a mug. Hire a couple of heavies to pick up a debt, and you may lose a valued customer. Pay your bills late too often and you will get a bad name, and risk losing discounts and after sales service. Essentials for a credit manager are persuasion skills and brinkmanship, says Mr Burt Edwards, fellow of the Institute of Credit Management. You must press for payment according to agreed terms, but must back off if there is a genuine dispute If you are about to start up, seek expert advice on the law and best trade practice. But there are rules any company can follow to improve internal procedures. The Confederation of British Industry offers the following guidelines to improve credit management: have a written contract, stating your terms and conditions. In particular, it should give clear terms of payment, agreed and understood before you trade. Payment periods should be compatible with cashflow. check creditworthiness. Limit risk by running a customer through credit rating agencies. 'No-one in their right mind would buy a house without a survey,' says Dr Ian Peters, a CBI deputy director. personal contacts. Get to know the people in the accounts or sales departments. Know who to speak to if payment or delivery is late. employ someone solely responsible for credit management. 'It is the Cinderella of small business management,' says Dr Peters. 'Yet it can make or break a company. It is at the heart of business survival but it is often seen as a clerk's job.' set down a time limit for payment beyond which you cannot go. If a buyer wants terms which your company cannot finance, say No. 'A good manager knows how far the company can go in being flexible,' says Dr Peters. 'But it is important to set out the parameters.' have a clear and consistent system for chasing payment. It might go like this: a reminder is sent out, automatically, the day after a payment date has passed. Further written reminders may follow although it is probably better to get on the phone if no payment is made after repeated reminders. Telephone the company or go in person. If payment is still not made, it may then be appropriate to send a solicitor's letter, threatening court action. Do not be reluctant about recourse to the law, but use your judgment on when it is appropriate. procedures between customers and suppliers should be compatible. Most large companies use a computer system and standard invoices. Quote reference and order numbers. Get the numbers right, address invoices correctly and send them to the right person. A company might benefit from handing over credit management to someone else, such as a factor. 'This can speed up payment and provide security,' says Dr Peters. But you should consider the cost and whether it is appropriate. 'If your supply network is straightforward you probably don't need one, but you might if you're in a tricky area. The cost of factoring could be a price worth paying for peace of mind.' Much depends on consistency, thoroughness and an understanding of when to be flexible. Beyond this, you should know something about business law. Few companies bother to draw up detailed terms and conditions, fewer still read them, but they can put you ahead of the game. First, ensure that your terms and conditions apply, says Mr Simon Rawlins of London solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett. Terms and conditions must be incorporated into the contract at the outset when agreeing an order, otherwise you will be unable to make any of your terms stick in a dispute. If you are agreeing a deal by telephone, specifically mention that the contract is subject to your terms. Confirm this by sending an acknowledgement of the order with your terms on the back. A few well-chosen clauses could help to improve your legal position. Mr Rawlins suggests the following: retention of title. This means the seller retains legal ownership of the goods until they are paid for. It will help get your goods back if a customer goes into receivership. limit your liability. In the unlikely event of your goods proving to be defective, your liability should not be open-ended. allow flexibility in your delivery dates. A clause could set out, for example, that you are entitled to deliver on the agreed date, or in seven days. interest provision. Include a charge for interest on late payment. 'It is worth having the option to charge interest even if you do not always use it,' says Mr Rawlins. Mr Rawlins's final tip on legal protection: keep written notes of all stages of a contract, including phone conversations. 'Courts like pieces of paper. If a dispute arises, a court will want to know whether there is any evidence in writing which you can point to to support your case. If you do, you have a much greater chance of judgment in your favour.' And it could greatly speed settlement. 'It is getting the simple things right every time,' says Mr Rawlins. 'Have a credit policy, have a set of terms and conditions, know when and how to incorporate them into a contract and ducument your transactions as well as possible. Beyond that, everything else is a commercial risk, but getting all that right will keep the risk to acceptable levels.'

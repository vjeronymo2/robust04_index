			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 18 (AFP) -- French police and Danish  officials stepped up security around Danish interests in Paris  on Wednesday in the wake of a blast against a travel agency  specialised in trips to Denmark, Danish embassy sources said.    An anarchist group calling itself the "Revolutionary Cell"  claimed responsibility Tuesday for an explosives attack on  Selectours, in southern Paris, saying the blast was to express  solidarity with a prisoner in Denmark.    The typewritten claim sent to AFP said the attack was  carried  out "on a travel agency specialising in Denmark and recommended  by the embassy" out of solidarity with Marc Rudin, held in  Denmark "in very tough conditions."    The agency was slightly damaged by Monday's blast.    Besides the embassy, there are several Danish companies in  Paris as well as a complex on the Champs Elysees including  restaurants and a cultural centre.    "We shall attack Danish interests as long as the claims of  our comrades in Denmark are not satisfied," the text said  without elaborating.    Rudin, a 48-year-old Swiss national, was sentenced to eight  years in jail in 1993 by a Danish court for belonging to an  extremist leftwing group that staged several armed hold-ups in a  crusade to finance international liberation movements. A  policeman was killed in one of the attacks blamed on the group.    He has also been accused of taking part in attacks in  Switzerland against the International Monetary Fund and the  Spanish embassy. He was believed to have fled to Syria and was  arrested on the border between Turkey and Syria in 1991.</p>

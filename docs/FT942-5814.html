			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenya's pyrethrum dominance challenged - Prospects for the major producer of the only true organic pesticide A record Kenyan crop of pyrethrum, a vital ingredient in many insect-control formulations, will more than compensate for losses arising from the cataclysm in Rwanda, formerly the world's third largest producer of this natural pesticide. But the further concentration of supplies in a drought-prone region with its own record of recent ethnic violence is cause for concern among the product's few big buyers. Pyrethrum first surfaced commercially in Dalmatia and Japan before being transplanted in the 1920s to the Kenyan Highlands, where it is grown as a cash crop by over 40,000 small-scale farmers. Since then, Kenya has regularly produced 60-70 per cent of annual world demand of 20-22,000 tonnes, processing it for export into powdered or liquid concentrates at a refinery in Nakuru on the edge of the Rift Valley. Despite a nation wide failure of the rains earlier this year, the state-controlled Pyrethrum Board of Kenya (PBK) has reported a harvest of 18,000 tonnes of dried flowers, 45 per cent up on the previous season's 12,400 tonnes. 'To have a stockpile puts us in a position of being able to promote pyrethrum and its level of usage,' says Mr Job Wainaina, PBK's chief executive. With prices remaining firm at Dollars 60 per kilogram of extract, the new crop gives Kenya a commanding 80 per cent share of world production. The existence of this daisy-like flower lends support to the belief that the divine plan, with its generous provisions for cockroaches, mosquitoes, house flies and fleas, may have been subject to later, more thoughtful revision. For processed pyrethrum yields the world's only truly organic pesticide, a quick-acting, bio-degradable powder that is non-carcinogenic, non-toxic to humans and animals and has no history of insect resistance. Ninety per cent of all pyrethrum is used in the control of these four main pests, usually through aerosol formulations. But pyrethrins, the active ingredient, are deployed wherever human or animal health are more important considerations than kill ratio; the protection of stored grain, beverages and fruits; food preparation and canning; pest control in kitchens, gardens, restaurants and airplanes; and in a variety of veterinary applications. But where pyrethrum falls fatally short, in scientific and commercial terms, is that it has no staying power, breaking down rapidly under ultra-violet light. With the growth of a mass market for household insecticides in the 1950s there came a demand for the development of cheaper, long-lasting alternatives to pyrethrum. There are now over 40 synthetically-produced substitutes. With Kenyan independence a second reason for diversification emerged: the fear that political instability or poor management would choke off deliveries from the world's largest producer. 'If it were not for doubts over the regularity of supplies, I think the invasion by synthetic pyrethroids would not have been as intense as it has become.' says Mr Wainaina, As it is, the PBK will be lucky to lift exports beyond last year's Pounds 10m, in spite of the record crop. Pyrethrins touch the lives of everyone but 80 per cent of the trade is controlled by a handful of large insecticide manufacturers - among them Johnson and Johnson, Roussel, Bayer, Sarah Lee and Sumitomo. As the producer of a raw material which can be utilised or omitted as they see fit, the PBK has an almost apologetic relationship with the buyers, aware that they need its unique product but conscious too that they will cut and run as soon as proprietary substitutes can be found. Until recently, shoppers for pyrethrum had little alternative but to troop up to Nakuru, the Kenyan market town at the heart of the industry. The cool, surrounding highlands allow flowers to be picked for nine months of the year: elsewhere they yield just a single bloom. The PBK headquarters has a down-at-heel, faintly academic atmosphere not inappropriate to a colonial institution that has mysteriously survived into the present day. With a 90 per cent recovery rate, no fresh investment is envisaged in the existing processing technology. Two factors have now come to disturb this complacency. For the past 18 months, the Rift Valley has been the scene of a low-intensity range war in which Kalenjin and Masai people, loyal to President Daniel arap Moi, have driven Kikuyu supporters of the opposition from their farms and businesses. Though the violence clearly did not effect this year's crop, it has had an impact upon growers in the Mau Escarpment. A greater challenge to Kenyan pre-eminence is emerging on the other side of the world in Tasmania. In collaboration with large-scale farmers, Commonwealth Industrial Gasses (CIG), a British Oxygen Group subsidiary, 15 conducting field trials on the viability of intensively-produced pyrethrum, using high-quality clones on irrigated land. The acreage is still small and the climate not as suitable as Nakuru's, but Tasmania is already in a position 'to influence the supply', according to Mr Wainaina. If trials show that, despite the shorter season, mechanised farming can be profitable, nothing would then prevent pesticide manufacturers from bringing pyrethrum-growing back to Europe where it started more than 150 years ago. EC regulations on 'set-aside' land already permit the cultivation of crops with an industrial, non-food end-use.</p>

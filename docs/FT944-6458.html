			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market in good shape ahead of Budget - Market report The London market continued its rehabilitation process yesterday, and was supported by renewed steadiness on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial Average built on Friday's good performance. Aiding the domestic market's confidence was a growing feeling that the government would comfortably get its EU contributions bill through the House of Commons last night. And with the political wind said to have shifted in the prime minister's favour, there was also a better feeling around the markets in terms of the Budget. Dealers were taking the view that the market's recovery boded well. 'Although you can never be sure, it seems unlikely that there will be many downside shocks in the Budget, judging by the market's performance today,' said one. The FT-SE 100 Index ended only marginally below the day's best and a net 13.6 up at 3,047.1. There was a similarly strong showing from the market's second-line issues, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index settling 9.7 firmer at 3,490.0. One area of disappointment was the level of business in the market, which remained depressed after the recent heavy losses and amid persistent fears of further big retreats by the market. Turnover, although boosted by at least two programme trades, one very small and the other of medium size, reached 560.6m shares. Non-Footsie turnover accounted for 350.8m, or 63 per cent of the total. The Stock Exchange revealed that customer business last Friday just about crept over the Pounds 1bn level. The Footsie began the session on a firm note, up 6.4, and moved ahead steadily as some of the more optimistic fund managers picked up what they perceived to be cheap stock ahead of the Budget. Marketmakers, still traumatised by last week's steep falls, were said to have been running level to short books and were quick to lift their dealing levels at the appearance of any meaningful demand. The early wave of buying interest drove the Footsie up to the day's high, 3,049.8, over lunchtime, but interest subsided thereafter, as dealers began to manoeuvre their trading books to mostly level positions in front of the Budget. Wall Street extended last Friday's recovery trend, moving quickly to record a 30-point gain on the day, before slipping off to show a rise of 20 points an hour and a half after London had closed. Although preoccupied with the Budget, equity traders in London will have to keep a weather eye on Wall Street, which has to deal with a long list of important economic data this week. The numbers include a final revision of third-quarter gross domestic product, expected tomorrow, the highly regarded National Association of Purchasing Management index, due on Thursday, and Friday's employment report. Strategists said that any rise much in excess of an expected increase of 225,000 in US non-farm payrolls could bring renewed pressure for a further tightening of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, which was seen as the main cause of big falls across international stock markets last week. The ever-present threat of a windfall profits taxation continued to unnerve some investors in the utilities areas. There was, however, good support for some of the electricity stocks, with one of the big European securities houses chasing issues such as Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electricity. NatWest Securities sounded a note of caution ahead of the Budget. In its latest Equity Market Commentary, the stockbroker noted that equities have moved in the opposite direction to gilts over the last week, and pointed out that this suggested that markets are worrying about the outlook for growth. 'In this context,' NatWest said, 'it is worrying to see downgrades outnumbering upgrades in November - for the first time since February.'</p>

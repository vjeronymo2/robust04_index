			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rifkind rejects UN combat role UN FORCES should not be made to adopt a combat role in Bosnia, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, insisted yesterday. He was responding to suggestions the rules of engagement for British troops in UN humanitarian operations might have to be changed to allow for the task of protecting civilians. He said: 'We do not believe that the current rules of engagement need to be changed in order to assist nations in their humanitarian efforts. Clearly if any new mandate was to be considered, it would open the question as to whether the rules were appropriate.'</p>

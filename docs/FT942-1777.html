			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: High freight costs floor Russian coal exports Russian coal producers and exporters are waiting despondently for the first anniversary of a bizarre government measure that has catastrophically damaged the whole industry's export efforts. Without warning, last August the transport ministry lifted the charge for carrying coal to levels that virtually brought exports to Europe to a standstill. Although some higher grade coals have managed to find their way on to house coal markets, a year later the damage to exports is profound, with a Dollars 30 rail charge in place for movements from the Kuzbass, Russia's biggest coal producing region, to the Baltic. With fob prices on the Baltic of around Dollars 2,600 for steam coal, the effect on the export business has been total. Pressure for the producers to get the rail rates reduced to levels at which they can undertake their business profitably has brought little response from the authorities, save for the setting up of a coal transport company, Transugol, whose activities most of the producers puzzle over, 'They've done nothing; they have been invisible,' one of the producer representatives said last week. The benefits to the rest of the world's coal producers, particularly for those who supply the spot steam coal market, has been immediate, with a steady recovery in spot prices since August last year. At that time, some South African business was being conducted at about Dollars 19 fob Richards Bay, a price that has risen to Dollars 28 this month and that most traders and producers predict will recover throughout the year. If the Russian transport authorities relent and return rail charges to levels at which their exporters can once again compete, the risk is that much of the additional tonnage will be restricted to the spot steam coal market once again. So large is the potential tonnage that could become available that it might once more overwhelm the capacity of the market and drive down prices. At a time when the world is becoming extremely short of coal and demand is growing in Asia the potential of the Russian exporters to capitalise on the situation should be substantial. But they can only achieve this with some show of goodwill and assistance from the government. And this, so far, is not forthcoming.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENDING OUR OWN GARDEN IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FINGER-POINTING AT MARXIST  ECONOMIES  </P> <P> Regarding Allan H. Meltzer's Times Board of Economists column on Jan. 8, "The  Model is Market, Not Marxism":  </P> <P> While it is certainly true that in many respects capitalism "has worked, not  perfectly, just better than any alternative," this is hardly a justification  for the questionable assertions made and self-congratulatory tone struck by  Meltzer throughout his essay.  </P> <P> First, Meltzer repeatedly refers to the "Marxist system" and applauds the fact  that it is now in seeming decline -- at least in the nations he chooses to  discuss. But what does he mean by the "Marxist system?"  </P> <P> If he means simply "planned economies," then why does he not speak of the  Danish, French, Norwegian and Swedish economies? Why not speak of Japan and its  systematic integration of government agencies with investment banks and export  industries? Aren't these all examples of planning?  </P> <P> The point here obviously is not that Soviet-style planning hasn't been a  failure in many cases. It certainly has. But how can one generalize from that  experience to all other planning efforts, as Meltzer tries to do?  </P> <P> Second, if the economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea have been such  successes relative to East Germany, North Korea, and Poland, among others, does  Meltzer seriously wish to suggest that those successes have not, in many cases,  also involved enormous human costs? If the workers of Hong Kong have incomes 20  times higher than their counterparts on the mainland, why does Meltzer not  point out how those incomes compare to those achieved, say, in France, Japan,  Sweden or even the United States?  </P> <P> Why so heavy on the self-congratulations and so fast to condemn? Why not spend  more time tending our own gardens and dealing with our own problems, rather  than pointing the finger at others who are often doing the best they can?  </P> <P> MICHAEL A.

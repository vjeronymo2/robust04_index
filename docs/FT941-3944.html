			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Arts: Glorious Lulu - Opera Nothing less than a sensational performance can do justice to Alban Berg's great opera Lulu, for it is an intrinsically sensational work. So much so, as you may remember, that his widow Helene did her puritanical best to prevent anyone from completing his next-to-last sketches for Act 3: Friedrich Cerha had to carry out his faithful labours in conditions of secrecy. Without that, Lulu would have remained an exciting torso, a very black sex-comedy with a whiff of tragedy. The complete version is, as it ought to be, an overwhelming experience. In the Royal Festival Hall on Friday (and no doubt at Birmingham on Sunday too), Lulu was sensational and overwhelming. Nobody who heard it will forget it for a long time. With the BBC Symphony and a superbly chosen international cast, Andrew Davis led a scarifying performance. Billed as a 'concert performance', it was much more than that. Most of the singers were veterans of staged Lulus. Not only could they do without scores, but they acted their roles to the hilt without props  - well, just one pistol - in the long, narrow space in front of the orchestra, something like an allotment planted with microphones at every turn. Somehow Davis managed to keep them vividly audible, while taking full advantage of his exposed band to render Berg's intricate score more transparent than is ever possible from an orchestra-pit. It sounded glorious: opulent, intensely expressive, horribly affecting. And without stage paraphernalia, we even seemed to see the opera with new clarity, unhampered by any producer's 'concept'; the gestures and physical interplay were enough. At the centre of it all, of course, was Lulu herself, miraculously incarnated by the American soprano Patricia Wise. She had everything: liquid silver at the top of the voice (where Berg's demands are almost unnatural), a gleefully indecent gown, the practised manners of a sex-kitten and a subtle way with phrases - but also a mature, comprehensive insight into the role. Though sex-kitten victims are common enough, it is a rare Lulu who can pronounce herself to be nothing more than what men see in her with such poignant, unwinking candour. The role is cruelly taxing, and most Lulus try it on for only a few years; I pray that the Royal Opera will revive its excellent production for Miss Wise with all possible haste. There were no weak links among the other principals, too numerous to praise as deserved - Wolfgang Schone dignified and tortured as Lulu's 'protector' (and monstrous as Jack the Ripper); Ryszard Karczykowski, Theo Adam and Robin Leggate well-seasoned as luckless Alwa, creepy Schigolch and the ruined Painter; a warm, sad lesbian Countess from Jane Henschel and an ebullient Athlete by Lenus Carlson. The supertitles were patchy and erratic, so it was doubly a pity that the Hall ran out of programmes before the start  -Wedekind's plot is too complicated to guess at.</p>

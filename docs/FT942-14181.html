			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Observer: Euro-turtle Why should long-suffering British commuters expect the trains to run on time? Just lie back and enjoy Eurotunnel's on-going farce. Of course, it's less fun for shareholders. In place of profitable train schedules they have had to accustom themselves to weighty volumes of speculative traffic projections, the latest litigation news and calls for funds. But - miracle of miracles - a revenue stream is now in prospect. Admittedly it does not derive from a train; nothing so prosaic. Instead, immediate cash hopes are being pinned on mugs, picture books, key-rings and bone china thimbles, as Eurotunnel discovers merchandising. Let's hope it doesn't go the way of mutant ninja turtles; very big indeed - for a day or so.</p>

The statement was in response to Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev's remarks that Russia would keep a military  presence in the former Baltic republics.    The statement said that international law prohibits one  country sending troops into another for the purpose of  guaranteeing its own strategic interests.    The announcement also said that Russia should quickly and  completely withdraw its troops from Estonia, Lithuania, and  Latvia according to the resolution of the 1992 meeting of the  conference on security and cooperation in Europe.    According to the statement, Estonia will continue to  negotiate with Russia, and urge the withdrawal of its troops at  an early date.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Brussels reports stronger recovery Economic recovery in the European Union is gathering in strength as confidence grows in the industrial and construction sectors and among consumers, the European Commission reported yesterday. The preliminary results of its business and consumer survey for October disclosed a sharp improvement in industrial confidence last month and a recovery in capacity utilisation in manufacturing industry to the average of the past 11 years. The Commission said its October survey showed that capacity utilisation, which is measured every three months, jumped to 81.5 per cent among manufacturers in the 12 member states, from 80.4 per cent in July. Utilisation was up 4.1 percentage points from the 77.4 per cent level of October 1993 and half way between the most recent 77.2 per cent low of July last year and the most recent high of 85.8 per cent registered in the late 1980s. Britain, according to Commission estimates, had the highest level of capacity utilisation at 85.3 per cent and was narrowly ahead of the Netherlands and France. Ireland and Spain had the lowest levels of capacity use in the EU. However, the improvement in manufacturing activity will not lead to higher employment in the EU. Only in Denmark did the number of manufacturers saying they expected to boost employment exceed those expecting to shed labour. The survey revealed that the EU's industrial confidence indicator, which is compiled from business peoples' replies on a number of issues such as order books and selling price expectations, improved to plus three in October from zero in September and minus 14 in the first quarter of this year. This indicator is now close to the recent high of plus six recorded between 1988 and 1990 and well above the minus 28 level registered in the recession between 1991 and 1993. The index of consumer confidence, which collates the views of households about their financial situation, the general economic situation and their inclination to make large purchases was less buoyant. It registered minus 10 last month for the EU as a whole, although this was an improvement on September's level of minus 12 and the 1991-93 low of minus 26. The highest level reached by the EU's consumer confidence indicator between 1988 and 1990 was minus three.</p>

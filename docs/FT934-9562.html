			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dairy origins of Sainsbury Sir, David Richardson in 'Farmer's Viewpoint' (November 9) refers to 'the small butcher's shop of the original Mr Sainsbury'. The shop which was opened by my grandparents, John James Sainsbury and his wife Mary Ann, was a dairy shop, not a butcher's. It was this shop, which they opened in 1869 at 173 Drury Lane, that began the family business which flourishes today. Sainsbury, Stamford House, Stamford Street, London SE1 9LL</p>

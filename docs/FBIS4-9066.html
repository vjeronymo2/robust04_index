			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The  states whose presidents met at the Litomysl summit do not feel  they are a political or geopolitical body that should play a  role or even be a link between Eastern and Western Europe,  President Vaclav Havel said today.    The seven Central European presidents met because their  countries shared many concerns, but because they wanted to be  considered as distinct from other parts of Europe, he said at a  press conference at the end of the summit. [sentence as received]    Havel said the presidents should meet as frequently as  possible, though not necessarily all of them together.  Groupings could depend on the matter discussed, he proposed.    If it was felt that some president who should have  participated was overlooked, "we shall see him next time we  meet", Havel said, probably in an allusion to press comment that  the Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro should have been  invited.    Havel informed reporters Austrian President Thomas Klestil  had invited to a future meeting in Alpbach which the Swiss  President Otto Stich might also attend.</p>

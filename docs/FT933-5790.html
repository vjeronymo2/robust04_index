			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD price yesterday climbed back above the support level that was breached last week but dealers were not expecting an early break above the Dollars 375-a-troy-ounce level that has been the markets ceiling for the past two weeks. As the London bullion market price gained Dollars 2.35 to Dollars 371.55 an ounce at the afternoon fixing traders said the market had been aided by buying in New York. But renewed selling trimmed 20 cents off by the close. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices fell away from their highs during late afternoon trading and ended little changed. As traders jockeyed for position ahead of tomorrow's September traded option declarations the cash premium over the three months delivery position narrowed by Dollars 10 to Dollars 28 a tonne, with the three months price closing Dollars 12 up on the day at Dollars 1,943.50 a tonne. The NICKEL market staged a modest rally following the recent fall to 6-year lows. The three months price closed at Dollars 4,600 a tonne, up Dollars 55. London COCOA prices surrendered modest early gains after the New York market opened lower. The December price closed at Pounds 832 a tonne, up Pounds 1. Compiled from Reuters</p>

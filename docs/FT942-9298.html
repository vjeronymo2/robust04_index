			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Surcharge on council 'may hit Pounds 55m' The controversy surrounding Westminster City Council intensified yesterday as Labour members alleged that Conservative councillors and officers could be forced to repay as much as Pounds 55m in surcharges. A BBC Panorama documentary also attacked new aspects of the borough's alleged 'gerrymandering' policy. In January the district auditor made a provisional finding that 10 councillors and officers, including the former leader of the council Dame Shirley Porter, should pay Pounds 21.25m in 'sur-charges'. He held that the borough's designated council house sales policy, which had targeted house sales in marginal wards, was 'gerrymandering' for a 'disgraceful and improper purpose'. The Panorama programme presented in detail claims that the 'gerrymandering' covered the council's planning policies, environmental work and professional 'dirty tricks' campaigns, as well as housing policy. All fell under the rubric of the council's Build-ing Stable Communities policy. Documents printed in 1987 and obtained by the Financial Times find references to the 'target wards' in policy documents on 'pavement trouble spots' and 'zoned improvement patrols' to target specific problems in individual wards. Mr Peter Bradley, Labour's deputy leader on the council, said the new Pounds 55m estimate took into account money spent on designated sales from 1989 onwards as the auditor's report only covered the period between 1987 and 1989. It also took into account other Building Stable Communities policies. Mr Bradley said: 'We believe these will be proved to be unlawful policies in all departments.' He also attacked the BBC for postponing the Panorama broadcast until after the local elections on May 5. He said: 'It is dis-graceful that the BBC should have succumbed to pressure in suppressing this programme until after the local elections just 10 days ago.'</p>

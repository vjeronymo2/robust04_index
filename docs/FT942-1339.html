			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Trans World/Emap The directors of Trans World Communications yesterday said that the offer of 181p per share from Emap - which now speaks for 51.7 per cent of Trans World's equity - did not represent an adequate premium for control of the company. The board said it was also unable to satisfy itself that Emap's proposals were above legal challenge. The Guardian Media Group, which owns 20 per cent of Trans World, has signified its agreement with the Trans World board's conclusion and is seeking leave to apply for judicial review of the Radio Authority's decision not to object to it. The Trans world board reiterated its rejection of the offer and advised shareholders to take no action.</p>

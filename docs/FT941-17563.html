			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / 2m new jobs seen in US this year US companies will create 2m jobs this year, Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, predicted yesterday as another batch of statistics confirmed that the economy ended last year on a strong note. Spurred by increases in new orders, the purchasing managers' index - a closely watched barometer of the health of manufacturing industry - rose from 55.7 per cent in November to 57.9 per cent last month, the highest level for nearly a year. Readings of above 50 per cent indicate the manufacturing sector is expanding. Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction spending rose 1.8 per cent between October and November, a larger increase than most analysts had expected. Construction spending was up nearly 11 per cent in cash terms from the same period in 1992, having risen for seven consecutive months. Speaking on ABC television, Mr Reich said that most of the jobs created this year would be in service industries, with the bulk in managerial and professional services. There would also be lower-paid openings in restaurant and hotel services. A net increase of 2m jobs would represent an increase in employment of a little less than 2 per cent, roughly in line with job creation last year, which was also concentrated in services. Mr Reich said that, although jobs would be in 'abundant supply', growing disparities in skill levels would prevent many workers from taking advantage of new opportunities. Encouraging job training would be a priority for the US administration this year. Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, said that the gain in the purchasing index reflected a strong rise in new orders. The index for new orders rose to 66.7 per cent against 64.8 per cent in November, one of the highest readings in 10 years. However, Mr Bretz warned that continued rapid expansion in manufacturing was not assured. It would be 'challenging to sustain current growth rates, let alone exceed them'. Yesterday's figures followed other robust data indicating economic growth accelerated in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 4-5 per cent. However, many economists expect growth to moderate to a more sustainable 3 per cent this year because consumer spending has outstripped personal incomes. Mr George Eads, chief economist at General Motors, yesterday warned the Federal Reserve not to 'overreact' to signs of faster growth by raising interest rates. The rapid increase in car production between the third and fourth quarters of last year, which gave the economy a big boost, was unlikely to be repeated in coming quarters.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Money 'no problem' for population policies: World Bank chief says meeting the Dollars 17bn UN target is 'not the main issue' The World Bank has dismissed fears that lack of funding will prove a serious obstacle to the policies agreed at the global conference on population and development in Cairo. As delegates become optimistic about reaching consensus on abortion, the issue which has dominated proceedings, their concerns are switching to the question of money. Mr Lewis Preston, the bank's president, said that meeting the United Nations target of Dollars 17bn (Pounds 11bn) a year by 2000 was 'not the main issue'. Better use of resources and improving women's education were greater problems, he argued. Last year the bank spent Dollars 2bn on women's education, and Dollars 200m on family planning. It expects to spend 50 per cent more on family planning over the next three years. Mr Preston warned that developing countries would probably have to find two-thirds of the Dollars 17bn total themselves, as the UN's draft policy document recommends. This implies that developing countries' current level of spending on family planning - some Dollars 5bn a year - must more than double by 2000. Although Mr Preston argued that Dollars 5bn amounted to less than 5 per cent of military spending in developing countries, the likelihood of a sharp increase in spending on family planning has been greeted with scepticism by women's groups. 'It is unrealistic to think that these governments will prefer to spend money on women's education rather than the latest aircraft technology,' said one woman from a Moslem country, who asked not to be named. 'They even find it humiliating to have someone suggest that they can't afford the latest western military gadgets because they still have all these ignorant women running around,' she added. Against a background of such concerns, developed countries have announced sharp increases in spending. Germany has indicated it may spend some Dollars 2bn by 2000. Mr Yohei Kono, Japanese foreign affairs minister, also told the conference Japan would provide funds for family planning 'towards a targeted sum' of Dollars 3bn between 1994 and 2000. He said this would be co-ordinated with the Dollars 9bn he expected the US to spend in that period. However, Mr Brian Attwood, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, said 'this is not a pledging conference' and that talks of precise sums was inappropriate. The US will spend Dollars 585m in the year to September 1995 - a sharp increase from spending on family planning under the Reagan and Bush administrations, which were determined that US funds should not be in any way connected with programmes involving abortion. In Japan's case, the increase reflects its sensitivity to allegations it has in the past contributed relatively little to international development programmes. UN agencies such as the UN Population Fund and the World Health Organisation  -now headed by a Japanese - have found themselves grateful recipients of increases in Japanese contributions while other industrialised countries have cut back. About 10 per cent of US and Japanese spending on family planning will be diverted through UN agencies, delegates said.</p>

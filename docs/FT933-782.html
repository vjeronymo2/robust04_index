			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Eta deaths in custody are blow to peace ONE OF the most promising advances in a decade in efforts to swing Basque public opinion decisively against the terrorist activities of the Eta separatist movement has been shaken by the deaths of two Eta suspects in police custody and medical evidence alleging the severe bruising of a third. Mr Jose Luis Corceura, the interior minister, is scheduled to make an emergency appearance in parliament in Madrid today to explain the background to a series of incidents which are worrying the Spanish public. Eta supporters have been quick to accuse the Spanish civil guard and the Basque police force, the Ertzaintza, of torturing Miren Gurutze Yanci, who died of heart failure while in custody last Friday, Xabier Galparsoro, who died on the same day after falling from the second floor of a police station, and Maria Jose Lizarribar. All three were arrested early last week in a police sweep.</p>

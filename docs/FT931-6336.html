			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Observer: Far East pioneer When it comes to finding well-paid retirement jobs for ex-British ambassadors to Japan, demand seems to exceed supply, judging by the speed with which Sir John Whitehead has been picking up jobs lately. However, it seems that there may also be an untapped demand for retired Japanese big-wigs. Shijuro Ogata, former deputy governor of the Japan Development Bank, is on Barclays' board, but there are precious few other examples. Full marks then to Foreign &amp; Colonial which has recruited Kazuo Chiba, Japan's man at the Court of St James until 1991, on to the board of its Far Eastern flagship Foreign &amp; Colonial Pacific Investment Trust. Chiba, with his impeccable English and considerable cultural versatility, was a big success in London. F&amp;C's Eric Elstob says he got the idea of recruiting Chiba after he 'popped up this winter giving a seminar at the LSE in Far East international relations'. The fact that Chiba will be sitting alongside Sir Hugh Cortazzi, Britain's man in Tokyo between 1980 and 1984, may have helped. Even so F&amp;C seems to be living up to its pioneering reputation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Odessa, 26 Jun -- The "Ukrayina" Oblast Electoral  Committee has received telephone calls about violations of the  Electoral Law. For example, at most polling stations in  Suvorovskiy, Kievskiy and Ilyichevskiy rayons of Odessa, the  election posters of Vladlen Ilyin, representative of the  president in Odessa oblast and candidate for the post of oblast  council chairman, were removed, while posters of his rival,  Ruslan Bodelan, were prominently displayed at all polling  stations.    There was open electioneering for Lev Vershynin, candidate  for deputy to Odessa town council, and Leonid Kuchma, candidate  for president of Ukraine, at polling station No. 18 of central  electoral district 366 of the town of Odessa. When an observer  remarked on this, the response was a threat to call the militia.</p>

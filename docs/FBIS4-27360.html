			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Kenichi Sugano] </F>   [Text] With an eye on the advent of the multimedia era,  NEC's software business is getting serious. It has decided to  cultivate as an external sales enterprise the software business,  which previously had been kept to a minimum and was centered on  that for the group. It has also begun to put effort into  scouting overseas software. Moreover, the fully financed NEC  Home Electronics (NEC-HE) will jointly own software for  high-performance game machines that will go on sale at the end  of the year along with the NEC personal computer "PC 98," and  support establishment of the external sales business of the  software itself. While the poor earnings rate of hardware  continues, the NEC group plans to expand the software business  of the whole group from the two sections of personal computers  by the main company and game machines by NEC-HE.    NEC established the "C&amp;C Multimedia Business Promotion  Division" on 25 April to develop the multimedia business for the  whole group, citing the slogan, "Multimedia NEC." (President  Tadahiro Sekimoto) The "Personal Software Business Division"  that was established on 8 April will be in charge of the  software business. The policy is to cultivate external sales of  software of about several billion yen in the first fiscal year  and about 30 billion yen after three years.    However, the personal computer has a low popularity of 12  percent and users are limited. For this reason, NEC-HE, which  has been selling game machines for home use since 1987, "has  increased in the importance it occupies in the multimedia  strategy of all NEC" (Seiji Nakano, NEC-HE director).    Under these conditions, NEC-HE will put on sale in the  latter  part of November the high performance game machine "FX  (tentative name) carrying a 32-bit MPU (microprocessing unit).  The company was the first in the industry to put on sale a  CD-ROM (read-only memory using compact disks) game machine in  1988, but it was not compatible with the personal computer "98  Multi" previously carrying an NEC CD-ROM drive and its software.  That is considered "a link in the all NEC multimedia business"  (NEC-HE president Tomoo Miyawaki) with the FX, and software for  the FX can also be used on the PC 98. "We plan a multiplier  effect by promoting development and sales of software from the  business aspect for NEC proper and from the games and other  personal user side for NEC-HE." President Miyawaki, who is  concurrently appointed to managing director in charge of the NEC  Personal C&amp;C Business Group, thus relates the aim to promote  fusion of the FX and PC 98 series.    In addition to being able to use it on the PC 98, software  for the FX can be connected as a CD-ROM drive device of the 98.  Behind compatibility for FX software is the intense 32-bit game  machine sales war. Matsushita Electric Industrial already has  put on sale the "Real." In the same time period as NEC-HE, Sony  will put on sale the "Play Station," and Sega Enterprises, the  "Saturn (tentative name)," respectively. For that reason, there  is a sense of crisis that "we must make effective use of the  market for the PC 98 which has about 7.67 million machines  distributed" (Director Nakano).    Furthermore, since it takes money and time to produce 32-bit  CD-ROM software, software companies look at the state of  popularity of the manufacturer's hardware. For this reason,  being able to jointly own the best-seller personal computer 98  and software is a strategy that will promote software production  by "making it a plus for software company earnings" (President  Miyawaki).    President Miyawaki always asserts that "if a game character  can be skillfully incorporated into software for the personal  computer, it will sell." For this reason, by having  compatibility between FX software and the 98, they expect it to  be linked to increases in external software sales of NEC proper,  and not just the FX.    Along with the importance of the software business being  greater than ever in the multimedia era, its multiple  applicability will be necessary. The framework for the system in  charge of development and sales within the group has already  been created. Moreover, NEC Avenue (Kawasaki; president, Seiji  Nakano) has embarked on strengthening game music CD's. With the  FX on sale, and personal computers and game machines, a system  will be provided enabling use of software on three types within  the group.    How this organization operates in the future will hold the  key to the success of the software business for the whole group  and the realization of the ideal that "the sales ratio of  hardware and software inherently should be one to one"  (President Miyawaki).</p>

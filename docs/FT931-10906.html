			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Japan While the 0.75 percentage point cut in Japan's discount rate was no surprise, the authorities must be disappointed that the stock market actually fell on the news. Shares had rallied ahead of the announcement, but the equity market's lack of enthusiasm reflects more than cynicism over a stage-managed event. The recession has prompted a larger cut than the Bank of Japan previously wanted. Yet given the debt overhang from the 'bubble' years, lower interest rates will take a long time to revive the economy. Even the expected second supplementary budget in May may not have much immediate impact. With the Nikkei trading at around 55 times this year's earnings, shares look expensive. The market is trapped in a narrow range with government-sponsored pension fund purchases on one side and almost everyone else on the other. There is little to break the impasse, though the approach of the financial year-end in March may tempt those companies with long term shareholdings to flatter this year's profits with some judicious sales. If the government does manage to hold the line, few will be tempted into the stock market. Individuals are still nursing large losses; institutions are seeking yield and security. Those prepared to look beyond the current recession see a period of slower growth in Japan. As Japan's economic prospects start to mirror the rest of the industrial world, its share ratings may have to follow.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Research agencies recommended for sell-off Two Whitehall research agencies have been recommended for privatisation in a report published by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit yesterday. The report on government research establishments recommends privatising Adas, the farm advisory and research agency with a large agricultural consultancy practice. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is reviewing its future. Adas was identified as a candidate for privatisation when it became an agency in 1992. The report also recommends privatising elements of the Building Research Establishment, the environment department agency that carries out research on the design, construction and performance of buildings. If the government accepts the report's recommendations, laboratories accounting for almost 50 per cent of such spending will be in line for privatisation. The 50 establishments employ some 31,000 staff and cost about Pounds 1.3bn a year to run (some of which is earned in fee income). Research establishments not ready for privatisation should be considered for transfer to universities or to private-sector companies, the report recommends. It also proposes reorganising about 30 life sciences research laboratories into new agencies, with two options: A geographical split, one agency for Scotland and the other for England and Wales, with some smaller establishments being transferred to research councils. A four-way 'market sector' split, with agencies for marine resources, non-marine environment, biotechnology and biological science, and food and agriculture. Mr William Waldegrave, science minister, said: 'I am determined to ensure that government resources are spent to the maximum extent possible on science rather than administrative overheads.' The privatisation of Adas and the BRE would mean seven research agencies are still in line for privatisation. The others are AEA Technology, National Engineering Laboratory, Laboratory of the Government Chemist and the Transport Research Laboratory. The National Physical Laboratory is to become a government-owned, contractor-operated agency. The report was drawn up by a team of five civil servants and a part-time member seconded from Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare group.

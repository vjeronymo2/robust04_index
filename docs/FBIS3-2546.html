The meeting studied and arranged the issues on how to  further  strengthen the improvement of leading bodies' thinking and work  style and to ensure the elevation of the economic construction  to a new height under the socialist market economic conditions.    Sun Weiben, Shao Qihui, Zhou Wenhua, Ma Guoliang, Tian  Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Meng Qingxiang, and Qi Guiyuan attended  the meeting.    At the meeting, Sun Weiben made a speech entitled: Leading  Cadres Should Take the Lead in Waging an Arduous Struggle.    He said: In 1994, there are many difficulties that we should  overcome and there are many new contradictions and problems that  we should solve. So, the leading cadres at various levels are  required to take the lead in waging an arduous struggle in an  effort to create a situation of waging an arduous struggle and  cooperatively pioneering the great undertaking.    He pointed out: In the new stage of reform, opening up, and  modernization, the spirit of arduous struggle means unswervingly  implementing the basic line of the party and organically  combining hard labor with creative labor. We should strive to  create concrete work achievements. We should concentrate energy  on economic construction, try every possible means to overcome  the difficulties cropping up in the course of development, and  strive for a faster development speed. We should persist in the  mass line, share weal and woe with the masses, do more concrete  deeds for the masses, and establish close contacts between the  party and the masses. It is necessary to resolutely resist the  influence of the corrosive ideas of the capitalist class, to be  diligent and honest in performing official duties, to encourage  frugality, and to promote a social practice of healthy progress  and opening up in a civilized way.    Sun Weiben stressed: Setting up the new socialist market  economic system is a completely new and arduous task. Thus, the  leading cadres at various levels are required to bravely blaze  new trails, keep forging ahead, and fundamentally persist in the  three-conducive standards. Instead of simple and indiscriminate  imitation, we should creatively implement the higher-level  arrangements according to our actual conditions. We must not  adopt the attitude of dodging or shifting responsibility onto  others when coming across [words indistinct] problems in our  work. On the contrary, we should carry forward the spirit of  having the daring to do pioneering work, trying and risking; and  advancing despite difficulties.    Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, made an arrangement for further strengthening the  improvement of leading bodies' thinking and work style.    He said: We should regard that whether or not the basic line  of the party is successfully implemented and whether or not the  role as the core in conducting reform and developing the economy  is better played as the fundamental standards for assessing the  leading bodies' performances so as to noticeably strengthen the  improvement of their thinking and work style. The leading  bodies at various levels should undertake the heavy task for  reform, become powerful collectives to guide the people of the  province to develop the economy, arm the thinking with Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, strictly implement democratic centralism, bring  into play their overall functions, strengthen the improvement of  administrative honesty, foster a good image, work solidly, and  [words indistinct].</p>

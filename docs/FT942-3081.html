			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Observer: False note Hoots mon, here's a rum do - bagpipes that can't play a note. It seems that enterprising Pakistanis have spotted an unusual marketing niche. They are manufacturing cheap versions of Scottish bagpipes, those peculiar instruments shaped like a battered carpet-bag which emit sounds like a banshee, much to the delight of some Scots. Stuart Mackay, of Forfar-based (authentic) bagpipe manufacturers Gillanders and McLeod, says that 'Pakistanis are definitely targeting our market. It's a real cheek. The workmanship is terrible, they hardly produce a note - and tourists who have bought these things in Edinburgh come in and ask us to make them playable]' The silent bagpipe - now that really would be a usp.</p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS  </P> <P> Christmas, celebrating the birth of Jesus, is observed Dec. 25 by most of  Christendom. But because different calendars are used to determine when the  holiday occurs, most Armenian churches celebrate the holiday Jan. 6 and certain  Eastern Orthodox churches -- Serbian, Coptic and old Russian -- observe the  holiday Jan. 7  </P> <P> TRADITION: The earliest evidence of the observance of Christmas is from  4th-Century sources.  </P> <P> In Rome, sometime before the year 336, the church celebrated the holiday Dec.  25. In the Eastern churches, Jesus' birth and his baptism were celebrated  together on Epiphany in early January. But before the end of the century most  Eastern churches moved the observance to Dec. 25. Historians note that the  Christian holiday thus competed with holidays in the Roman world -- the  Saturnalia (Dec. 17), one of merrymaking and gift exchanges; the birth date of  Mithra (Dec. 25), an Iranian mystery god with a popular following, and the  Roman New Year (Jan. 1), when houses were decorated with greenery and lights.  </P> <P> OBSERVANCES: Although the gift-bearing Santa Claus and other secular lore mixes  freely in popular celebrations, churches focus on the Nativity accounts found  in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and Luke. Manger scenes depict a humble  birth and often combine distinctive elements from the two stories -- shepherds  from Luke and the Magi, or "wise men," and the Bethlehem star from Matthew.  </P></p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK Company News: Brent Walker expected to transfer Trocadero stake BRENT WALKER, the troubled leisure conglomerate which underwent a major refinancing last autumn, is expected to hand over its 50 per cent stake in the Trocadero in London and in Blackpool's Tower shopping centre, in an effort to reduce its high level of borrowings. The group is expected to announce today that it is transferring its shareholding in the two sites to Power Corporation, the Irish property developer, in exchange for total ownership of the island site adjacent to the Trocadero. Power Corporation is joint partner in both projects through Walker Power, the joint venture company in which the two groups each own a 50 per cent holding. The move will enable Brent Walker to reduce its Pounds 1.4bn of debt by taking its share of the Trocadero's Pounds 170m of borrowings off its balance sheet. This is the amount that has so far been drawn down from a Pounds 270m facility provided to the Trocadero project. Brent Walker is also likely to move quickly to dispose of the island site, which consists of a number of separate properties and has a value of about Pounds 75m, less unspecified borrowings. While the site was jointly owned, it was unlikely that Power would have agreed to sell the properties on it at current depressed prices. Last year, Brent Walker had been prepared to consider a proposal of between Pounds 325m and Pounds 350m for the Trocadero, but this was turned down by Power. The Trocadero development, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, was valued at between Pounds 300m and Pounds 350m. On completion, it is expected to bring in Pounds 16m in rental income and, together with rent renewal income, is thought to have an estimated rental value of Pounds 22m to Pounds 23m. The borrowings of Walker Power are off balance sheet as far as Power Corporation is concerned.</p>

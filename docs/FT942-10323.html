			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competitiveness matters in the real world Sir, As someone who has done as much as anyone to awaken interest in Europe's competitive difficulties, I find it unfortunate that your leader, 'Jobs agenda for Europe' (May 9), repeats uncritically the assertion by the economist Paul Krugman that European competitiveness 'is not the burning issue'. Since 1980, European economic growth has averaged 0.4 per cent per annum less than the OECD as a whole. Few forecasters, if any, expect any catching up in the near future. Over the same period the European Union's share of the world non-commodity exports (if trade within Europe is excluded) has fallen by more than a quarter. European investment in innovation as a percentage of gross domestic product is running 25 per cent lower than that in the US and 30 per cent lower than in Japan. As a result, it is not surprising that the proportion of European industry described as 'high technology-based' in 1990 was only 14.5 per cent, compared with 19 per cent for the US and 20 per cent for Japan. One of the causes of those problems is lack of profitability; OECD figures show that the real return on capital in the business sector from 1981-91 was 15.4 per cent in the US, 14.3 per cent in Japan and 12 per cent in Europe. This is partly because European hourly labour costs are about a fifth higher than those in the US, while industrial productivity is about a quarter lower. Moreover, the economic difficulties resulting from Europe's competitive problem of being a high cost economy with only medium levels of skills and technology will be exacerbated in coming years by the likely pattern of world economic development, especially in Asia and South America. Because Europe's problems go beyond labour markets, the overhaul of labour market regulations and of labour taxes and benefit systems which your leader correctly recommends is unlikely to be sufficient on its own to solve Europe's jobs problem. In addition, deregulation, privatisation, lower levels of taxation generally and the ending of the subsidies and protectionism that preserve inefficient industries in Europe will also be required. Even then, reversing Europe's declining ability to create jobs may take a generation to achieve. Your leader's assertion that the concept of competitiveness 'in relation to an entire economy . . . lacks much meaning' is based on the academic notion that exchange rates can always adjust freely to handle competitive imbalances. But in the real world devaluation normally adds to inflation and worsens the terms of trade. This is why competitive problems are just as likely to result in deflation, leading to loss of jobs, as devaluation.

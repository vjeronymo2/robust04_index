			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRYER IS A SHOOTING STAR TRYING TO BE SEEN;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: FORMER LOYOLA MARYMOUNT GUARD IS BACK HOME TRYING TO IMPRESS THE  NBA SCOUTS AT ROOKIE CAMP.  </P> <P> Jeff Fryer is buzzing through town again this week.  </P> <P> But this time around he's pulling back the throttle so everyone can take a good  look.  </P> <P> Fryer, the former Corona del Mar High School standout who was Coach Paul  Westhead's "hired gun" at Loyola Marymount the past four years, is back at  Loyola's Gersten Pavilion this week playing for the Houston Rockets in the  Summer Pro League.  </P> <P> He's one of hundreds of free agents -- former college standouts and drifters  from the fringes of professional basketball -- trying to impress the scouts and  coaches who have gathered at Loyola.  </P> <P> Fryer hopes to land a spot on Houston's roster.  </P> <P> He averaged 22.7 points per game at Loyola last season and set an NCAA record  with 363 career three-pointers. He was one of 13 players invited by Houston to  play in the summer league.  </P> <P> If the Rockets and Coach Don Chaney are impressed, Fryer could find himself  with an invitation to the team's veteran camp next month.  </P> <P> "It's definitely a new environment," Fryer said. "But I feel I'm competitive at  this level, and hopefully I can earn a spot."  </P> <P> Most former college players have to shift into a faster gear when they come  into the Summer Pro League. But in order to catch on with the Rockets, Fryer is  trying to back down from Westhead's version of the game -- in which the coach  was upset when Fryer didn't shoot the ball.  </P> <P> "I'm actually having to slow my game down," Fryer said. "I can't shoot it every  time I get my hands on it. I've got to feed it in to the big guys more often  and be a little selective."  </P> <P> He has adjusted quickly. With the Rockets, Fryer is running the same lanes --  with the guards often trailing the fastbreak -- as he did at Loyola.  </P> <P> But he's learning that he has to do more to play in the NBA -- like guarding  bigger, quicker players.  </P> <P> "It's a lot more physical," Fryer said. "I'm having to play defense harder. At  Loyola, our defense was real helter-skelter with all our shooting and driving.  Here, all these guys were college all-stars, and they're tougher to guard."  </P> <P> Bo Kimble, Fryer's teammate at Loyola, was the eighth pick in this year's draft  when the Clippers selected him. Fryer was not drafted, but that doesn't mean he  lacks pro qualities.  </P> <P> Fryer has a special kind of toughness. He showed it this spring in the way he  and Loyola's players weathered the death of teammate Hank Gathers and then  became the nation's darlings in the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> Fryer set a tournament record against Michigan in a second-round game with 11  three-pointers in 15 attempts. He burned the Wolverines with 41 points --  several of them from well beyond the pro three-point stripe, and many times  shooting without a teammate or an opponent anywhere near the basket.  </P> <P> And he's up to it again.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, in Houston's 128-112 summer league victory over the Boston  Celtics, Fryer connected three times from three-point range.  </P> <P> The first came from a yard past the top of the stripe. The second time, Fryer  got loose off a screen and unloaded from the wing over Mark Stephenson, the  10th-leading scorer (27.2 ppg) in the nation last season at Duquesne.  </P> <P> He capped it off by hitting a three-pointer over former UC Santa Barbara star  Carrick DeHart.  </P> <P> In all, Fryer scored 12 points in 18 minutes.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of guys who need playing time here, so I'm just trying to make  the most of my opportunities," Fryer said. "I know I'm going to get the ball,  and when I do, I've got to do what I do best."  </P> <P> If Fryer winds up on an NBA roster, it will be because that team is in need of  a raw shooter.  </P> <P> Don DeJardin, Fryer's Pasadena-based agent, has arranged three rookie camps for  his client. Fryer was in the Phoenix Suns' camp two weeks ago, but he and the  team agreed to a mutual release so that Fryer could keep his commitment to the  Rockets.  </P> <P> He also has tentative arrangements to join the Celtics' camp from Aug. 15-17.  Things also might still work out with the Suns.  </P> <P> One key to Fryer's fate may be held by Dave Jamerson, the Ohio University guard  who set the NCAA record for three-pointers in a game this season with 13 but  has yet to sign a contract with Houston.  </P> <P> Fryer and Jamerson -- a first-round draft selection -- are similar players. At  6-foot-5, Jamerson has a three-inch height edge on Fryer, but Fryer is a step  quicker.  </P> <P> "I guess we'd go one-on-one if I get invited to veteran camp," said Fryer.  </P></p>

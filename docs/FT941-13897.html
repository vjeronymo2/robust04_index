			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Travel: Quiet times for Egypt's King Tut tat sellers - The best time to see Egypt's temples may have been now Hearing where we spent the new year, people look at us with the kind of respect due to someone who has come back from Bosnia. 'You went to Egypt] Wasn't that dangerous?' We demur. Ten days in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan were fascinating and unforgettable. Yes, we would go back like a shot. Not that this is the happiest phrase, given the prevalent view of Egypt as a country in the grip of bearded fanatics who shoot anyone in a swimsuit. It has been a disastrous period for tourism, Egypt's second most important currency earner. On December 27, while we were there, the most serious attack on tourists to date took place when Moslem extremists bombed and fired on a coach carrying Austrians in old Cairo. Meanwhile, we were at Aswan, congratulating ourselves on our prescience. At the new and comfortable Ibis Island Hotel, hovering waiters outnumbered sunbathers. It was the same at Luxor, where in the heat of the afternoon barely a handful of sun-worshippers lay beside the Winter Palace's pool. The moon was full, but there seemed to be no honeymooning couples under the royal palms which once witnessed King Farouk's indiscretions. For a century, tourism has been the life-blood of a town such as Luxor. Now there is little for the sellers of King Tut tat to do but draw on their waterpipes. The mood is one of dejection and, so far as one can tell, anger. When we took a sail in a felucca, the captain made mint tea on his primus stove. Suddenly he stood up and announced that if he found the 'bad men' who had scared away the tourists, 'I will catch them and eat them with my teeth]' Luxor and Aswan have foreign-run luxury hotels to suit all pockets, although for elegance and architectural distinction the Old Cataract Hotel at Aswan is unsurpassed. Whether hotels have one star or five, though, they are all short of guests. Ask the price of a room and managers say they are negotiable. Winter is peak season and, even now, Karnak, Thebes and the Valley of the Kings are far from deserted, especially if you dawdle in the morning or coincide with a cruise ship. The best plan, for mature travellers with a sense of humour, is to reject organised tours and travel independently. From Luxor, Cairo and Aswan, it is possible to do all the major sites with guides hired through local companies, or to do the sites alone. For around Pounds 25, you can hire a taxi from 7am to 7pm. After two centuries of tourism, it is almost banal to enthuse about the monumental remains of the pharoahs, Ptolemies and Romans. In the Cairo suburbs there are the Giza pyramids with the astoundingly elegant Barge of Cheops - often skimped by tour companies. There is Memphis and the majestic stepped pyramid at Sakkara. In Upper Egypt, there is Luxor where, last October, to boost falling revenue, Tutankhamen's tomb was reopened in the Valley of the Kings. Then there are the temples of Karnak, Luxor, Abydos - where the head of Osiris was said to rest - Dendera, and yet others. Aswan is a prettier, less pressured town than Luxor, and the place you go to for visiting the temples rescued from the waters of the Aswan high dam. Philae is small and, even now, uncomfortably crowded. At the other end of the dam, few people go to New Kalabsha where a family of tame sand foxes plays in the sanctuary of Marul. Further upstream, reached by bus or aircraft, lies Abu Simbel. It is only possible to imagine what the ancient mystery cults might have been like when there is silence in the huge temples. Peace reigns in the huge Ptolemaic temple of Hathor at Dendera, where for centuries people went from all over Egypt for the new year festivities. Figures appear from the shadows, muttering the names of deities until paid off with a note or two. On the temple's massive roof, it is completely quiet and one sits for an hour or so, just gazing at the panorama with its contrast between barren desert and cultivation. In his book, Egypt, Land of the Valley, Robin Fedden described the Nile as 'like East Anglia with the form and tone of Provence'. It is a richly beautiful landscape, utterly engrossing to watch. Egrets slowly criss-cross the fields and hoopoes perch on the lemon trees. There are palm trees and pigeon roosts, water buffalo and camels which sway past laden with sugar cane. Village houses are made of mud or bricks fired in kilns beside the road. If their owners have made the pilgrimage to Mecca, they paint scenes from the journey on the external walls. Electric pumps send Nile water gushing into the clover and sugar cane, but the shaduf (buckets on pivots) and Archimedean water wheel are still used. The average fellahin family has six children, which explains why there are so many people. Women squat outside washing clothes and making bread. Children jog past, two or even three to a donkey, waving at tourists and often darting into the road. Driving is best left to the Egyptians, particularly at night, when the practice is to switch off headlights and then flash them wildly at oncoming traffic. The contrast between upper Egypt and Cairo, traffic-choked, squalid and chaotic, could not be greater. Yet Cairo also has to be seen, and we found four days too short. Its medieval heritage is one of the most impressive of any city in the world, although shamefully neglected by the authorities. Its principal Islamic monuments are architectural gems: Ibn Tulun, the exquisite Madrasah of Sultan Hasan and the noble mausolea of the Mamluks in the North Cemetery. Egyptians appear totally relaxed about non-Moslems in mosques, providing they are modestly dressed (no shorts) and remove their shoes. I would always cover my head, too, although many Arab women did not. Even in seething Cairo, it was obvious how blessed a time it was to be sight-seeing. At the Great Pyramid on a Friday afternoon, foreigners were outnumbered by Cairenes picnicking in their best clothes. More extraordinary still was our visit to Cairo's Egypt Museum. By lunchtime, the Japanese and Arab visitors had gone, giving a parting caress to the statues they passed. That left us almost alone in the upper galleries, where case after case displays the Tutankhamen finds, his war chariots, sandals, linen, furniture, throwing sticks and perfume jars. It may be that our persons were at marginally greater risk in Egypt rather than in rain-sodden London. (It last rained in Aswan four years ago.) Our choice, however, was to believe people living or doing business in Cairo who insisted on Egypt's reputation as an unusually safe place for foreigners. Strolling in the evenings we felt completely safe. We succeeded in avoiding gastric misery by eating conservatively and only in first-class restaurants. The most unpleasant experience was a glass of Omar Khayyam rose - Egyptian wine can be lethal. All the guidebooks comment on Egyptians' warmth and kindness towards foreigners, and they are right. The commonest word one hears is 'welcome'. One of the next commonest is 'baksheesh' from children in the street. Part of the scene is the begging, the need to be for ever tipping, and the street hassling. Instead of letting these customs get under your skin, it is better to ignore them as an inconvenience more than compensated for by the Egyptians' good manners and love of a joke. After all, it is Egypt's Islamic traditions which make a holiday there such a rich experience. Inshallah - as pious Egyptians frame every future wish - I will return to the Nile. As for the temples, the best time to be there may have been now. Patricia Morison's trip was organised by the Egyptian State Tourist Office: 168 Piccadilly, London W1. Tel: 071-493-5282. She flew Egypt Air to Cairo, Luxor and Aswan, and in Cairo stayed at the Rameses Hilton, which is quiet and central. Sight-seeing and shopping are aided by using the three Tour Maps of Islamic Cairo, available (Pounds 3 each) from the Travel Bookshop at 13 Blenheim Crescent, London W11, tel: 071-229 5260.</p>

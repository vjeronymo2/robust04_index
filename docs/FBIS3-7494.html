			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Japanese Government  announced Tuesday [29 March] it will abolish a voluntary cap on  car exports to the United States for fiscal 1994. Continuation  of the decade-old trade practice will not serve the interest of  either Japan or the United States, International Trade and  Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference.    Kumagai explained that U.S.-bound Japanese auto shipments  have been dwindling and stayed below annual ceilings in recent  years.    "The step has lost its originally intended function of  easing  trade friction between Tokyo and Washington," Kumagai said.    The step is also against new trade frameworks established  under the recently concluded general agreement on tariffs and  trade (GATT), Kumagai said.    Kumagai said Japan's auto exports to the U.S. are on the  decline due to increased production by Japanese makers at their  U.S. plants in the wake of the yen's appreciation against the  dollar in recent years.    Improving performances of U.S. carmakers have also helped  prevent robust sales in the U.S. of Japanese cars as seen 10  years ago, Kumagai said.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  introduced annual ceilings on U.S.-bound Japanese car shipments  in fiscal 1981 as a tool to correct huge trade imbalance  lopsidedly in favor of Tokyo.    In the first six years, export records totaled exactly the  same amount as respective year's ceiling that was set at 1.68  million vehicles in the first year, reflecting brisk sales of  Japanese cars in the U.S. But exports began dropping in fiscal  1987, affected by successive launches of local production by  Japanese makers via transplants.    As a result, shipments have been below set limits in the  past  six years, despite a cut to 1.65 million vehicles in ceilings in  fiscal 1992 compared with a peak ceiling of 2.3 million vehicles  during fiscal 1985-1991.    In fiscal 1992, exports totaled 1.57 million vehicles  against  the 1.65 million ceiling.    For the current year, shipments are expected to stand at  1.39  million units, also falling short of the 1.65 million ceiling,  MITI said.    The current voluntary restraint arrangement expires  Thursday.    Kumagai said the MITI decision is in line with the global  trade accord calling for terminating practices such as voluntary  export restraints within four years.    Under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks  concluded  in December, GATT member countries basically agreed to regard  voluntary export restraints as "gray areas" under GATT  provisions and scrap them eventually.    Industry sources said the MITI decision reflects the  ministry's judgment that Washington sees no further need for  auto export restraints.    The sources pointed to remarks recently made by U.S.  Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, who said it would be  "a waste of time" for Tokyo to think that keeping the restraints  would appease Washington in trade disputes.    The Japanese voluntary auto export restraints began in 1981  at the request of Washington at a time when U.S. automakers were  experiencing strong competition from Japanese makers that  shipped a flood of small cars to the U.S. market in the wake of  the outbreak of the first oil crisis in 1978.</p>

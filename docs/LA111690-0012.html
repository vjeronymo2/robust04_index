			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THURSTON ROSS; PROPERTY APPRAISER AND ECONOMIST  </P> <P> Thurston H. Ross., a real estate appraiser and economist who flew for the  Signal Corps during World War I and served as a strategist for the Joint Chiefs  of Staff during World War II, died Sunday in Battle Ground, Wash., where he was  living with his son.  </P> <P> The pioneer teacher, expert witness and government and commercial property  appraiser was 96.  </P> <P> Born in Indiana, he earned undergraduate degrees at Otterbein College in Ohio  in 1917 and then enlisted in the Army Signal Corps, where he learned to fly, an  avocation he pursued through much of his life.  </P> <P> He came to Los Angeles after the war, earned master's and doctorate degrees at  USC and also taught there. In 1927 he established USC's first course in real  estate appraisal and wrote extensively on the subject for the rest of his  career.  </P> <P> He had first started his appraisal business in Los Angeles in 1921 and grew up  with the city, recalling over the years how some downtown properties in that  era had as many as a dozen mortgage-holders.  </P> <P> At USC, Ross had achieved a partial integration of the Colleges of Commerce and  Engineering and had become knowledgeable about the burgeoning ship and aircraft  industries of Southern California.  </P> <P> Partially as a result of that experience, he was asked to join the Navy at the  outset of World War II and became a lieutenant commander assigned to the Chief  of Naval Operations in Washington. He became a member of the Joint Military  Transportation Committee and the Combined Military Transportation Committee and  attended the conferences of world leaders at Yalta, Tehran, Cairo and Malta as  well as those between Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Lord Mountbatten in the  India-Burma theater.  </P> <P> At war's end he returned to teaching and his appraisal business, and in 1948  began what was to become a four-decade relationship as a director for Home  Savings and Loan Assn., then a relatively small institution but now the largest  in the nation.  </P> <P> He continued to appraise properties for institutions as diverse as the state of  California, the city of Beverly Hills, supermarkets and malls, the New York  Life Insurance Co. and the Bank of America.  </P> <P> Among his many honors was the Louise and Y. T. Lum Award from the California  Real Estate Assn. for distinguished service.  </P> <P> Survivors include his son, Thurston Jr., three grandchildren and three  great-grandchildren  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. at Forest Lawn Memorial  Park, Glendale.  </P> <P> In lieu of flowers, contributions are asked in his name to the American Society  of Real Estate Counselors, 430 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago 60611.  </P></p>

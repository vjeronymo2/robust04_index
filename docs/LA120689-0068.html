			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEATING DONATION  </P> <P> In regard to the article (Nov. 23) detailing the donations by Charles Keating  to various politicians: It seems incredible that Sen. Cranston and this group  of recipients can stand there and look the taxpayers in the eye and say, "This  money belongs to me, not the depositor or the bond holder."  </P> <P> As I surmise the situation, the recipients of Mr. Keating's largess, have  received stolen property, and it should be returned immediately.  </P> <P> GEORGE MOFFAT  </P> <P> La Habra  </P></p>

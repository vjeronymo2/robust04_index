			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government pressed over Bosnia troops THE MINISTRY of Defence believes Britain's contribution to any United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia could be met from existing UK troop levels - in spite of concern from a senior army general and MPs' pleas for defence cuts to be reviewed. However, ministers are expected to push at the UN for a commitment to troops from the participating countries being rotated accord-ing to a pre-agreed timetable. Adding to the pressure on the government, General Sir David Ramsbotham, the Army's top personnel officer, said yesterday: 'I don't believe we can support continuous deployment (in the former Yugoslavia) without seriously overstretching our resources. . . We will have to cope but I frankly believe we have to be very careful about committing that number of people.' Mr John Major, the prime minister, last night said 'I'm sure we can cope with any question that arises.' He was speaking after meeting Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, in London. Separately, Tory MPs, led by Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, chairman of the party's backbench defence committee, are pushing for the role of reserve troops to be enhanced if large numbers of British soldiers are sent to Bosnia. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, believes a rotation scheme would encourage other countries to take part in a UN operation, easing fears of being sucked into an open-ended commitment. Such a deal would also be easier for the government to sell to Tory MPs nervous about any escalation in Britain's military involvement. The weekend announcement by the US administration that it would contribute troops to a UN operation enforcing an agreement to the peace plan of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen has triggered speculation that Britain may be asked to provide as many as 10,000 ground troops from a total army strength of some 136,000. The government refused yesterday to comment on numbers, saying decisions would be not be made until Britain was asked to contribute. However, a MoD official said a UK contribution to a ground force could be met 'from existing resources'. About 2,500 UK soldiers are already serving in Bosnia on humanitarian work and Downing Street expects the cost of any additional peace-keeping to be funded by the UN. Colleagues of Mr Rifkind pointed out that he has already responded to changed circumstances by deciding in February to restore 3,000 army posts and to cancel two regimental amalgamations, watering down the government's 'options for change' plan. Further reprieves are not envisaged, they said. However, some MPs remain concerned that Options for Change's impact on equipment and troop numbers will restrict Britain's military capability.</p>

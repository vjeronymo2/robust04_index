			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 15  February.    Sergio Corrieri, the president of the Cuban Institute of  Friendship With the People, has announced that Cuba has received  approximately $50 million in donations through his organization.  Donations were mainly in the form of powdered milk, school  supplies, and medicine. Aid came from 72 countries, but more  than the value of the merchandise itself, Corrieri stressed that  it is the aid's "symbolism" that matters. (Madrid EFE in Spanish  2146 GMT 8 Feb 94)    The Central Drilling and Extraction Enterprise has reported  record production for the month of January. The company pumped  113,346 tons of crude oil of its annual goal of 888,000 tons.  The year's total nationwide projection is for the production of  1.2 million tons of crude, 100,000 tons greater than last year.  Meanwhile, the government has opened bidding in Great Britain  and Canada to allocate drilling rights for several offshore and  inland sights. The British Premier Corp. will explore 2,990 km  and the French Geopetrol company will explore 1,600 km.  (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1911 GMT 14 Feb 94)</p>

Although, in principle, the appointment could have been  regarded as a fait accompli and, therefore, was not included in  the agenda of the session, figuring only as the speaker's  announcement, it triggered a stormy debate in the chamber today.  This is explained by the fact that Andrey Voykov had so far  held the post of assistant head of the presidential  administration and this determined the attitude of some deputies  to his candidature.    In the course of the debate, triggered by the speaker's  announcement, it became clear that representatives of the  factions of the Agrarian Party, the Communist Party, and the  Liberal-Democratic Party were in principle against this  candidature. Finally, however, the right to make the final  decision was left to the speaker. Most deputies, attending the  session, voted against Rybkin presenting the new head of the  Duma apparatus to them today.</p>

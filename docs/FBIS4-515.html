			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 8 SAPA -- The SA Chamber of  Business [SACOB] has alerted its 40,000 member enterprises to  set up contingency plans in the run up to and after the April  elections, SACOB legal affairs Director Ken Warren said on  Friday [8 April].    Speaking in Johannesburg, Mr Warren said businesses should  plan for a "worst case scenario", in view of the social turmoil  and violence which has gripped the country ahead of its first  all race polls. SACOB tentatively defined the worst case as a  scenario in which the level of violence rises to a point that  damages business property and the security of staff.    The chamber sent in early March a circular advising all its  members to bolster and check their provisions with regard to  security, fire-fighting equipment, communication networks and  the supply of essential production materials.    Mr Warren said business had also set up day-to-day  communication channels with the civil protection authorities in  each area to monitor potential flashpoints.    Violence has escalated, specifically in Natal-kwaZulu, ahead  of the poll scheduled for April 26-28. More than 130 people  have been killed in Natal-kwaZulu since the imposition of a  state of emergency in the province on March 31.    More than 50 people were killed in central Johannesburg and  neighbouring areas in late March in confrontations during a Zulu  protest march, disrupting many companies and threatening the  safety of staff working in the central business district. An  accountant died after being hit by bullets while working on his  personal computer in his downtown office. The pc had been  situated near a first floor window.    The turmoil has raised fears in the business community that  plant, equipment, raw materials and products could be damaged or  destroyed, as well as employees wounded or even killed.  "Planning and precautionary measures should commence  immediately... Great care will have to be taken to prevent or  minimise unnecessary anxiety or panic among employees," the  SACOB circular advised.    It recommended that plans be implemented to ensure the  safety  of employees travelling to and from work, and it could be  necessary to house key personnel on the business premises.  "Vehicle hijacking can be expected to increase, with freight  vehicles and combis as likely specific targets, as a result of  inter alia, pressure to transport voters to polling booths."    In addition, the chamber urged enterprises to plan for power  disruptions, and the provision of essential supplies of water,  raw materials, food and fuels.    Mr Warren said SACOB hoped a worst case scenario would not  arise, but it made prudent business sense to be prepared for any  eventuality.</p>

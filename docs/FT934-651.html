			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: P&amp;O in Pounds 117m HK disposal - Sale is part of company's realignment of activities in China Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation has sold a 9.47 per cent shareholding in Modern Terminals for about HKDollars 1.35bn (Pounds 117.4m). The shares, bought for Pounds 8.4m, have a current book value of Pounds 74m. P&amp;O maintains a 5 per cent stake in MTL, the six-berth facility at Hong Kong's Kwai Chung Container Terminal where P&amp;O is an important user. The disposal is in line with P&amp;O's policy of trimming its interest in operations it does not manage. The sale comes a month after P&amp;O announced its first large commitment in China since 1949 - the acquisition of a 25 per cent stake in the HKDollars 615m Shekou Container Terminal - as part of a series of deals involving Pounds 500m in the region. Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, said the group's commitment to China made listings on the mainland's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, inevitable. P&amp;O obtained a secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange in September 1991. Within a fortnight of the signing of the Shekou terminal deal, P&amp;O bought into Zhangjiagang-Win Container Terminals, near Shanghai, which involved the investment of an undisclosed sum into Win Hanverky Investments, which holds 51 per cent of the terminal. Lord Sterling said this project was another step in the company's plans to develop in transport related activities in the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Corridor and north-east China. The Shekou facility began operation in August 1991 and has an expected throughput of between 80,000 and 100,000 20-foot equivalent units for this year. P&amp;O takes up management of the terminal from the beginning of next year.</p>

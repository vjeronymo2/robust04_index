			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER VIRUS SET TO ATTACK IN MONTH, GROUP WARNS  </P> <P> A harmful but rare computer virus is set to attack IBM-compatible personal  computers after Oct. 12, experts in computer security said today.  </P> <P> The virus cripples personal computers' hard disks, where programs and data are  stored, by wiping out the directory sections known as the partition table and  file allocation table.  </P> <P> "It's like taking away the index from the library," said John McAfee, chairman  of the Computer Virus Industry Assn. in Santa Clara, Calif. The industry  association says it has created a program that will detect the virus and  another one that will eradicate it. Both are available free from computer  bulletin boards or from the association itself.  </P> <P> But McAfee said the virus, while unusually harmful, is so rare that most PC  owners do not need to be overly concerned.  </P></p>

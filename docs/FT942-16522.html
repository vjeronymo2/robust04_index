			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Utilities One of the first of British Gas's businesses to feel the heat of competition is its high street chain, which is being cut almost in half to 240 shops. The division aims to become a pure appliance retailer, in direct competition with other household goods shops. It does not intend to perform services for other parts of the group. Whether British Gas can ever make an acceptable return in the fiercely competitive world of appliance retailing is a moot point. On a fully costed basis the chain probably loses money at present. Out-of-town competitors may well offer larger ranges and lower prices. Gas's attitude is also in marked contrast to other utilities - notably some regional electricity companies and BT - which are expanding their chains. They argue that intangible benefits justify running the stores even if they lose money. The water companies have hardly bothered to be in the high street at all. Retailing is unlikely to prove a sensible business for utilities. Even experienced specialists struggle to make money in hardware sales and many other providers of services are looking away from the high street. Banking and insurance, for example, are increasingly done by telephone. Direct Line and First Direct's brands are strengthening as a result. It is particularly ironic that BT, one of the first companies into the virtual world of computerised networks, should feel the need for a high street presence. Smallish losses may mean that shareholders do not object, but flagships on the high street add little value.</p>

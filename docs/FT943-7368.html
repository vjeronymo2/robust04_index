			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Republicans to be investigated German interior minister Mr Manfred Kanther yesterday ordered the German domestic security agency, the BfV, to monitor the far-right Republicans to see if the party should be listed as group opposed to the constitutional. This follows the Republicans' announcement of an alliance with the nationalist German People's Union (DVU). Mr Franz Schonhuber of the Republicans and Mr Gerhard Frey of the DVU announced they would work together to unite nationalist forces before the October 16 general election. Reclassifying the Republicans as anti-constitutional would not bar them from elections, but they would be under constant surveillance. The two party leaders, previously rivals, are united in opposition to proposals to liberalise German citizenship laws to allow dual nationality.</p>

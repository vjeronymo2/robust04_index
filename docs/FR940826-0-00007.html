Authorization of this budget enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Britthany Beadle, Marketing Order Administration Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O.

The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, Tokay grapes grown in California are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable Tokay grapes handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, beginning April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 3 handlers of Tokay grapes regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately 15 Tokay grape producers in San Joaquin County, California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Tokay grape marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable grapes handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are grape handlers and producers. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments of grapes. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met on April 29, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenditures of $5,150 with an assessment rate of $0.07 per carton for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the expenditure amount and the assessment rate are remaining unchanged from the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $4,500, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim final rule was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [59 FR 30872, June 16, 1994] and provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing order covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rate to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the program began April 1, 1994. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment apply to all assessable grapes handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as an interim final rule. No comments were received concerning the interim final rule that is adopted in this action as a final rule without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 926  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grapes, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 926 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 926_TOKAY GRAPES GROWN IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY, CA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the interim final rule amending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR Part 926 which was published at 59 FR 30872 on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 16, 1994, is adopted as a final rule without change. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: August 22, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Eric M.

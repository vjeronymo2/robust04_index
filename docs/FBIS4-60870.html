			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Georgia: Resolving the Fate of </F> Refugees"]    [Text] Judging by many reports in the local press, the  mechanism for returning refugees to their native regions and  guarantees of their safety have become a bone of contention at  the Georgian-Abkhazian talks which are being conducted with  Russian mediation and under the auspices of the United Nations.  Putting forward the Georgian plan to resolve these problems,  Major General Vladimir Chikovani, commander of the republic's  Internal Troops and member of the Georgian delegation at the  Geneva talks, remarked in conversation with an ITAR-TASS  correspondent that the Russian side is taking a constructive  stance in Geneva and showing its committment to bringing peace  to Abkhazia and resolving the fate of hundreds of thousands of  civilians forcibly expelled from their native lands. The  Georgian plan also met with the support of UN representatives at  these talks.    The main thrust of the Georgian plan, the general said, is  the need to monitor the withdrawal of all armed formations with  their weapons and combat equipment from all the lines of active  confrontation in the conflict zone and from all the regions of  Abkhazia to which it is planned to return the refugees.    The Georgian plan is based exclusively on the principles and  provisions of the quadrilateral agreements, and stems from the  logic of the nonresumption of military operations and the  termination of the conflict.</p>

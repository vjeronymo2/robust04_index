			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Jobs cut in TUC survival scheme A 20 per cent cut in the number of staff employed by the Trades Union Congress was confirmed yesterday by the TUC's ruling general council as part of a survival plan to deal with falling membership. About 40 jobs will go across the organisation through early retirement and voluntary severance - no compulsory redundancies are likely. The equal rights department will amalgamate with the social and environmental department, although jobs related to race and sex equality are likely to be protected. Offices in the south-east and East Anglia will be amalgamated, as will those in the east and west Midlands. The general council also agreed in principle to link rises in affiliation fees more closely to rises in unions' own charges to their members. The move is designed to stabilise income and enable a greater degree of forward planning. Deficits of Pounds 250,000 during this calendar year, Pounds 1m in 1993 and Pounds 1.5m in 1994 were projected if the job cuts had not gone ahead. Overall union membership has dropped from a peak in 1979 of 12m to a current figure of 8m, the lowest since the early 1950s. The move has caused internal dissent and staff have passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Norman Willis, the TUC's general secretary, over the handling of the cash crisis. There has also been strong criticism from equal opportunity lobby groups and internal regional interests. At the same time, the role of the TUC is increasingly being called into question, particularly by some of the larger unions, which are calling for greater value for money from their substantial affiliation fees. The formation of 'super unions' through amalgamations is also diminishing the TUC's central role.</p>

According to Chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL)  Peter Weiss, the opposition is hesitating to vote out the  premier because a new cabinet would not have a definite stable  majority in parliament and its ideas would sometimes differ from  those of Hungarian deputies.    "Don't let them make excuses about us. The opposition has  enough votes to recall the premier even without us. If such a  proposal is made, the Hungarian coalition will vote for it,"  Harna said today.    He added that the Hungarian parties had not formulated  demands concerning a possible new government, because they had  not been invited to. "No one has talked to us yet about the  formation of a new cabinet," Harna said.    "We do not agree with the opinion of the opposition parties  that it would not be suitable for the Hungarian coalition to  take part in the creation of a new government because we would  be allegedly adding grist to the mill of Meciar's nationalists.  We cannot agree with this, because we are just as much citizens  of this state as other people," Harna said.    "We are absolutely not against a vote of no confidence being  made in Meciar's government. The creation of a new government  is a matter for further negotiation," the deputy chairman of  Egyutteles said.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> GYPSY BOOTS PUTS ON A SHOW FOR HIS 80TH  </P> <P> For Gypsy Boots, good-health guru of Camarillo, another day became another  decade as the garlic-munching, football-tossing free spirit pronounced his 80th  birthday a week early.  </P> <P> "I'll always be a child," Boots said Saturday, sporting hot pink socks and  sandals. He fielded football passes at Camarillo City Hall to prove how  energetic he still is and proclaimed, "I love life, and I love people."  </P> <P> Boots garnered unconventional fame as a regular on the early 1960s "Steve Allen  Show," for which he was billed as the vegetarian Nature Boy. He still appears  regularly at Los Angeles sporting events.  </P> <P> Born Robert Bootzin in San Francisco in 1910, the soon-to-be octogenarian says  he has always been a little ahead of his time. In fact, he is about eight days  ahead; the actual date of his birthday is Aug. 19. But his birthday bash was  Saturday.  </P> <P> On Aug 19, he intends to have a party for his fans in Los Angeles. But to prove  to his Ventura County friends that he is not going to neglect them, he decided  to have two.  </P> <P> What does a Nature Boy do on his birthday? He takes a one-mile jog to prove  he's not about to give up, then eats a meal of fruit and carrot cake. About 15  well-wishers gathered in a shopping center parking lot to greet Boots and share  in the celebration.  </P> <P> Kristin Anderson, 21, of Santa Barbara was one of four young women who  accompanied Boots as he jogged briskly on a city street. Anderson said she and  a friend met Boots on a beach and decided "he's quite a guy. "We were impressed  with his whole energy."  </P> <P> Boots was surrounded by a bevy of energetic female fans, a few in their 20s and  some in the over-40 crowd. They watched him take a twirl with a belly dancer.  </P> <P> "I'm 65, and he's 80, and he's in better shape than I am," said longtime friend  Joann Brentley of Camarillo.  </P> <P> Boots says the key to longevity are daily doses of garlic, baths in a cold  stream and daily exercise. His constant smile proves that he is a truly happy  man, he says.  </P> <P> "People say to me, 'Don't you get old?' " Boots said. "I say, 'Yeah, I can't  wait to be 1,000.' " PSYCHE PASCUAL  </P></p>

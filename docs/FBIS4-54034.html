Speaking to the  local people and officials, Comrade Vu Oanh welcomed Vinh Phu  party committees for their good implementation of resolutions  from the central level in socioeconomic development and  improving people's life.    Vinh Phu is a province that initiated the agriculture  contractual system. Entering the new era of national  industrialization and modernization, Vinh Phu needs to continue  its renovation undertaking to create a driving force in  production to further improve productivity and quality. The  province should mobilize more capital from the public and  provide guidance to the people so that they can use their  capital efficiently to increase production and generate more  jobs for the working people. With its potential, the province  needs to quickly cover empty land and barren hills with greenery  and plant more fruit trees and trees of high economic value.

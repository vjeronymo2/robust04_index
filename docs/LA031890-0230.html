			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY STUDENTS MISS THE CUT IN JUNIOR HIGH MATH COMPETITION  </P> <P> The pencils were down, the tests collected and eighth-grader Laura Dietz sat  recovering Saturday afternoon from Mathcounts, an all-day mathematics  competition for California junior high school students.  </P> <P> "I don't think I'm doing so well so far," said Laura, who attends Serrano  Intermediate School in El Toro. "It's like, two things in a question and if you  mess up on one, you're dead. They're real hard."  </P> <P> She and 146 other junior high students from Southern California took several  tests Saturday at Cal State Fullerton to find the top math student in the  state. An identical competition was held simultaneously at St. Mary's College  in Moraga for Northern Californians.  </P> <P> When the winners were announced later in the afternoon, none of the 13 Orange  County entrants had placed in the top four to garner a place on the state team.  </P> <P> Robert Shih, 12, from Malaga Cove Intermediate School in Palos Verdes, placed  No. 2 in the statewide competition, making him the only student from Southern  California to qualify for the team that will go to the nationals. The three  other top scorers were all from Northern California schools -- first-place  winner Sean Trekhler from Palo Alto, E. Frey from Oakland (tied with Shih for  second) and Arthur Shek from Carmichael (third place). The California team will  go on to compete May 18 in Washington.  </P> <P> Mathcounts, sponsored by the National Society of Professional Engineers, is  aimed at showing students that math can be fun, said Cliff Ishii, a Cypress  engineer and state director of the competition. The sponsors hope that by  getting junior high students interested in math, they will continue taking math  and science in high school and college and become engineers.  </P> <P> Before the final scores were announced, Eric Weiss, an eighth-grader from  Rancho San Joaquin Middle School in Irvine, said he hoped he wouldn't score in  the top 10. Top scorers had to go one-on-one in a videotaped quiz round with  the other top students.  </P> <P> "I'm getting sick thinking about it," he said, shortly after eating a  hamburger.  </P> <P> The Orange County students competing Saturday qualified for the statewide event  after winning a countywide contest in February. Four-member teams from Serrano,  Rancho San Joaquin and La Paz Intermediate in Mission Viejo outscored all other  county schools.  </P> <P> An eighth-grader from Los Alisos Intermediate School in Mission Viejo, Jae Lee,  14, participated Saturday as an individual because he was the top-scoring  student in the county.  </P> <P> During the competition, students received questions in a series of rounds. The  first round hit them with 30 questions that had to be completed in 40 minutes.  The second round subjected them to questions given in pairs with eight minutes  to solve them.  </P> <P> The questions were designed to test knowledge that junior high math students  would typically be exposed to, said Joan Gell, a math teacher at Palos Verdes  High School who helped write the test, which is being used by all students  across the country.  </P> <P> A sample question: Jack and Jill are siblings. Jill has twice as many brothers  as sisters. Jack has the same number of brothers as sisters. How many children  are in the family?  </P> <P> As each round began, competitors flipped over test booklets at speeds  approaching Mach 1. Then brows furrowed and erasers were chewed as the  basketball game timer on the wall ticked away the seconds remaining.  </P> <P> "One careless error and you get a handshake instead of a trophy," said Beverly  Mairs, the coach from Malaga Cove Intermediate School.  </P> <P> The contest is meant to be competitive, Ishii said. But the real goal of the  event, besides having fun, is to increase the number of engineers in the  country, he said.  </P> <P> His company recruits about half of its engineers from outside the United  States, he said, mostly from Korea.  </P> <P> "We're not seeing the kids (in the United States) take the math at the level  they need," he said. "We need to encourage them because we need more home-grown  talent."  </P> <P> After the contest was over, Michael D. Cowan, chairman of the Orange County  chapter of Mathcounts, posed a final math question to all those within earshot:  </P> <P> "How do 147 kids go through 200 hamburgers and 236 candy bars when they were  allowed only one each?"  </P> <P> Carole Jackson, the math coach for Irvine's team, beat him to the punch line.  </P> <P> "They have two hands," she said. "That's an easy one. Ask any junior high  school teacher."  </P></p>

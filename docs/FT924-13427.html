			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (20): New window of opportunity - Satellite earth stations ASKED what was the most important factor affecting their investment decisions in eastern Germany, most German businessmen in a newspaper poll this summer said it was the availability of good telecommunications links. A follow-up question might have been along the lines of 'how easy is it to get hold of good telecommunications links in the region?' The answers would have ranged from 'not very easy' to 'almost impossible.' It is not that Deutsche Telekom has neglected its responsibilities. The state-owned German company is investing massively in the old GDR. By 1997, it will have ploughed DM70bn into the modernisation of the east German network in just seven years. And, by the turn of the century, telecommunications links will be equally good in east and west Germany. But for German businesses who have had to cope with an overloaded, antiquated telephone service since unification in 1990, the promise of better telecommunications in the future offers little comfort. It is their short-term needs that have given companies like the Hanover-based Teleport Europe the opportunity to sell business communications services using a satellite technology which has been popular in the United States for some time but has failed to make an impact in the UK. The technology is based on small satellite earth stations called 'vsats' (very small aperture terminals). A typical user of vsats would have anything from I0 to 500 earth stations - one serving each part of the network - and each one connected via a central hub or office. Information can then be passed from one vsat to another by bouncing signals off a geo-stationary satellite located some 22,500 metres above the Earth's equator. Vsats provide an alternative to data communications networks based on packet switching technology. These are known as X25 networks, and have been rolled out over much of western Europe. They are currently cheaper and of higher quality than vsat networks. Vsats are also used for video, and while voice communications are possible, there are a number of technical difficulties. The opening of eastern Europe, where it will take years to build up the telephone networks to the standards of western Europe has provided a window of opportunity for vsats. A vsat network is a stand-alone system, so it does not rely on the existence of a modern telecommunications infrastructure. It can also be installed in days, whereas a dedicated terrestrial X25 pan-European network can take months to deliver. Vsats are ideal, therefore, in eastern Europe where fixed telecommunications infrastructures were falling apart at the end of the 1980s, following years of neglect during Communism. A role for vsats was recognised by the German government shortly after reunification, and in 1990, it started awarding licences to private companies to offer vsat services to businesses in eastern and western Germany. Vsat service providers were allowed to offer voice as well as data services - the first time that Deutsche Telekom monopoly in the provision of basic voice services had been broken. In all, 26 licences have been awarded in Germany since 1990. A report by the UK consultants CIT Research, published in July, forecasts that by the year 2001 eastern Europe will account for 51 per cent of installed vsats for two-way business communications services. But vsats are also beginning to find a market in western Europe among multinationals which need networks up and running quicker than would be possible with a dedicated X25 system. Holiday Inn, the US hotel group, is having a vsat network for its European hotels installed by MCI, the US long-distance telephone operator. The German car giant Daimler Benz has its 20 European subsidiaries linked with a vsat network supplied by Deutsche Telekom, while Renault in France is to set up a vsat network connecting its dealers across Europe. The network, which is being supplied by Teleport Europe, will be used for data and business television. Renault considers that vsats could be less expensive and more reliable in the long run than terrestrial X25. Volkswagen and Ford are monitoring the success of the Renault system. Large users in Europe often complain about the high price of vsat systems. But Jon Collins, the managing director of the European office of AT&amp;T Tridom, the US vsat manufacturer, says that 'because the majority of the cost is in the central office, its cost is diluted across the network.' For companies like Renault, therefore, which has thousands of dealers in Europe, vsats could work out cheaper than X25. Installing a vsat network in every European country can, however, be difficult. Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland do not give licences to companies like Teleport Europe to provide business services by satellite. If a company wanted a vsat network in one of these countries, it would have to go to the PTT - if, that is, the PTT is prepared to sell it a vsat network rather than an X25 terrestrial network. The regulatory environment is, however, changing and Collins reckons that at the start of next year, Spain, Italy and Greece will move towards deregulation. Meanwhile, Teleport Europe is managing to supply its customers in France and Germany with Europe-wide vsat networks by negotiating with the PTTs or regulatory authorities in different countries and in some cases, working with the PTT. Regulatory constraints have been one of the main reasons behind the slow growth in satellite business services in Europe. Jon Chaplin, a telecommunications expert at the European Space Agency, estimates that the satellite share of the Ecu 85bn European telecommunications services market is only 0.5 per cent (Dollars 440m). In the United States, satellites account for two per cent of total telecommunications revenue. But CIT Research estimate that by the year 2001, total revenues for satellite business services in Europe will have increased from Ecu 270m in 1991 to Ecu 1bn. CIT is also forecasting that in 10 years time, there will be 130,000 vsat terminals in Europe. Today, it is estimated that there are between 65 and 75 vsat networks in Europe comprising roughly 2,500 individual two-way terminals.

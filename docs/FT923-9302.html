			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew rises to Pounds 66m - Healthcare strength overcomes consumer products weakness SMITH &amp; NEPHEW increased pre-tax profits by 6 per cent in the first half, as growth in healthcare products overcame weakness in the recession-hit UK consumer division. Orthopaedic, arthroscopy and special wound healing products grew at an underlying 11 per cent, while the mainly UK-based consumer division was hit by recess-ion - although it continued to produce strong cash flow. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 27 increased from a restated Pounds 62.5m to Pounds 66m on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 411m (Pounds 384m). Earnings per share crept up to 4.3p (4.2p) and the interim dividend is raised to 1.8p (1.75p). Turnover in the consumer division, where sales of brands such as Nivea and Elastoplast are concentrated in the UK, fell by 6 per cent. Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said the key feature of the results was the accelerating growth in the core healthcare area. That was where the group would focus its sales drive. Growth from that source would be sustained at or above the 11 per cent rate achieved in the first half by greater penetration into international markets, where the company had existing sales networks but small market shares. Smith &amp; Nephew achieved a 15 per cent share of the world healthcare market, which is worth Pounds 4bn. 'Most of our products are used by the over 60s. The market is growing because of the basic human need for better health care.' Mr Robinson said the consumer division would continue to grow a little faster than inflation, but not as quickly as the medical areas and hospital-related businesses. The tax rate paid has risen from 27 per cent to 29 per cent and is likely to rise to at least 31 per cent next year as the company is paying insufficient mainstream UK corporation tax against which to offset Advance Corporation Tax.

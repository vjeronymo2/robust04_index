			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Veba to increase planned cuts in jobs VEBA, one of Germany's largest industrial groups, is stepping up its already extensive programme of job cuts in response to the crisis in the European chemicals industry. The Dusseldorf-based group, active in energy, chemicals and transport, said yesterday that it planned to cut a further 3,500 jobs by the end of next year, bringing the total to 10,000, about 10 per cent of the workforce. Veba, which recently reported half-year pre-tax profits down by 12 per cent to DM782m (Pounds 313m), said it had been suffering considerable losses in the plastics, rubber and petrochemicals sector from the second half of last year. It blamed the domestic economy, combined with severe price pressure caused by a flood of cheap imports from east Europe, for the industry's problems. There was no option but extensive rationalisation, including job cuts, to reduce the cost base, Veba said. Together with other steps, the latest planned job losses would save DM1.2bn a year. Some 3,000 of the extra job reductions will fall on the Huls subsidiary, which makes polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC, taking the total losses there to 8,000, 20 per cent of the workforce. Another 500 will be shed from Veba Oel: the bulk of the cuts will be achieved through early retirement and other voluntary schemes. The dire state of the German chemicals industry has been underscored recently by last month's appalling results from the big three chemicals concerns. Profits at BASF fell by 51 per cent in the second quarter of the year, and Hoechst reported a 31 per cent drop in first half earnings. Bayer predicted a 20 per cent fall in full year earnings. The industry has been hit by low demand, oversupply and falling prices.</p>

Shulepina: "Energy  Systems and Gas Pipelines Are Indivisible"]    [Text] Beating politicians, energy officials were  first to reach agreement on creating an integrated energy space,  which they did two years ago. They serve the Greater Central  Asian Energy Ring. A joint dispatching administration in  Tashkent handles operations--determining station loads,  operating modes, and maintenance schedules. It is subordinate to  a council of energy industry officials of the region's  republics, who meet to agree on who will produce how much and  who will buy it. An agreement has also been reached on  cooperation between gas industry officials.    How are the republics building their relations in the  highly complex fuel and energy complex today? A PRAVDA VOSTOKA  correspondent put this question to Erken Anafin, Kazakhstan's  deputy minister of energy and fuel resources.    We get 600 million kilowatt-hours of Uzbek electricity  annually. More than 3 billion more kilowatt-hours of Turkmenian  and Kyrgyz electricity are supplied to Kazakhstan via  Uzbekistan. For example, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have energy  surpluses, while Kazakhstan has a shortage in winter. And so our  colleagues help us out. We had a difficult situation on our  hands in the spring of this year as well. The Dzhambyl  hydroelectric station was operating a single power unit, while  five others were idled on account of fuel problems. We bought  Uzbek gas on credit, as there was no fuel oil since we had not  received petroleum from Russia.    The Kzyl-Orda Heat and Power Station is powered by Angrei  coal. And another payment problem arose. Energy was cheap in  Kazakhstan until recently, and so the industry operated at a  loss. The tenge dropped in value, and our partners lacked hard  currency too. And so we agreed to keep our mutual accounts in  dollars. But when it came time to settle, we had nothing with  which to pay.    We owe Uzbekistan $98 million for electricity and gas. The  Uzbek side's debt to us is only one-tenth of that. It was a  tough situation. We started looking for solutions. And we took  drastic measures. They were economically warranted and fully in  keeping with the spirit of a market economy. We raised  electricity prices twice in spring, so that the prices were  comparable to production costs.    The gas situation was also resolved in a market spirit. We  cut off the gas to those who had not paid. We cut consumption to  40 percent. Is that a little or a lot? We received 6.2 billion  cubic meters of gas from Uzbekistan via the Gazli-Chimkent gas  pipeline last year. This year we have ordered 4.2 billion, and  we are not even using all of that. We took 1.3 billion in the  first four months, but paid for 400 million. The Uzbek side took  an understanding view of our situation, and said: Take what you  need within the agreed-upon amounts. But we squeezed our  enterprises.    We are in a difficult transitional period. There is no  longer  any rigid state regulation in Kazakhstan. As an experiment we  are introducing the use of bills of exchange to settle accounts.  For example, if you cannot pay in cash, we will take payment in  copper or lead. The legislative basis for this is being created.  The Kazakh president issued an edict in April on securities. The  matter is now being worked out in the Economics and Finance  Ministries.    In the meantime we are trying to utilize clearing  settlements. This is not all that easy. We are unable to fulfill  many of our obligations for reasons beyond our control. What is  the situation, for example, with shipping petroleum products to  Uzbekistan from the Chimkent Refinery? We try to keep on  schedule, but Chimkent began operating at normal levels only in  May. Before that there had been unbalanced relations with  Russia, from which it gets the oil. We finally reached an  agreement with Russia. We are shipping it oil from Mangizstau,  and receiving Tyumen oil in Chimkent via the oil pipeline from  Omsk and Pavlodar. And we are selling part of the oil to Fergana.    The Fergana Refinery supplies us with transformer and  turbine  lubricants for our power stations. Again you have an  interdependence. It is very important to maintain good relations  with our partners. We are dependent in very many areas both on  each other and within the country. Let me return to  clearing-based deliveries and settlements for them. We agreed in  an intergovernmental accord that Kazakhstan will pay for energy  resources with tinplate and iron ore pellets. The products come  from the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant. But Karaganda is  dependent on Dzhambyl, whose hydroelectric station was idle for  virtually the entire month of April.    Uzbek gas is extremely important to us. We lease the  Gazli-Chimkent gas pipeline, which runs through Uzbek territory.  And the Uzbek side cannot do without the Poltoratskoye  underground gas storage facility, in the vicinity of Chimkent.  Its reserves guarantee vital services in Tashkent. And here the  Uzbek side leases from us.    We also have problems with operations. This used to be  handled in Central Asia and Kazakhstan by Sredazgazprom [Central  Asian Gas Industry Association]. Since the Soviet Union broke  up, we have divided its facilities and equipment. We established  the Kazakhgaz [Kazakh Gas] State Holding Company. The gas  pipeline is operated by a subsidiary know as Dzhetisugaz. The  gas pipeline is 312 kilometers long. Our specialists have  experience in operating such installations, as we used to  service the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline and its compressor  stations. But here we have dual responsibility. We have to  ensure the gas pipeline's operation on foreign territory. Our  lease agreements provide for mutual control and inspections. We  undertook to deal with any accidents that might happen. But it  is important to prevent them!    Now we are running into the problem of rising water tables  in  the pipeline's vicinity. This problem has to be solved with the  local Ministry of Water Resources, which has to raise the dams  and lower the groundwater level.    In general, the ties have remained strong at bottom level.  All of us power- and gas-industry workers have worked together  for many years. And today too we help each other whenever we  can. We began producing fittings and oil-field equipment at  converted enterprises in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Petropavlovsk, and  Almaty, and we immediately informed our Uzbek colleagues.  Partners in Pavlodar used to supply caustic soda. But last year,  on account of environmental concerns, the enterprise was closed.  And not only for us, but also for our neighbors. The situation  is the same with lubricants, which no one in the region  produces. For example, for 300-megawatt units. So we bought them  abroad for energy workers throughout the region.    Our outlook? The economy will get on its feet. And our task  is to maintain our fuel and energy potential and expand it.</p>

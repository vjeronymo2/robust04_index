			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PLUMMETS ON NEWS OF BUSH OVERTURE TO IRAQ  </P> <P> President Bush's offer to initiate diplomatic contact with Iraq fueled optimism  on world markets Friday, prompting oil prices to plummet more than $4 a barrel  in the second-largest one-day drop on record.  </P> <P> For a day, thoughts of a recession were overshadowed by hopes for world peace  as Wall Street stocks pushed strongly higher and bond prices rose as well.  </P> <P> Crude oil for January delivery dropped $4.06 a barrel to settle at $28.85 a  barrel, the lowest level in six weeks, as traders on the New York Mercantile  Exchange saw Bush's remarks heightening the prospects for peace.  </P> <P> "Prices went through support levels like Rommel through Africa," said Daniel  Uslander, a trader and partner with Hilltop Trading Co. in New York.  </P> <P> The one-day fall was surpassed only by a $5.41-a-barrel drop on Oct. 22, when  traders reacted in part to reports that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had  dreamed that the Prophet Mohammed told him his missiles were pointing in the  wrong direction.  </P> <P> The dramatic fall in oil prices spurred a strong reaction on Wall Street, where  the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks soared 40.84 points to close at  2,559.65.  </P> <P> The stock and oil markets were apparently undeterred by sobering economic news  out of Washington on Friday, as the Commerce Department reported that the Index  of Leading Indicators, a broad measure of the nation's economic health, fell  1.2% in October. It was a further indication that the economy was heading into  a recession. It was the fourth monthly decline.  </P> <P> Shaking off recession fears, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose $10.62  per $1,000 face amount.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the dollar fell against world currencies. It dropped to 1.4965  German marks in New York late Friday from 1.5040 marks the day before. It was  down to 132.55 Japanese yen from Thursday's price of 133.15 yen.  </P> <P> Similarly, gold prices, which often rise on bad news and fall when the  headlines are upbeat, dropped $5.60 Friday to $383.30 an ounce in New York.  </P> <P> On the Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery in later months joined the  fall, with most declines limited by exchange rules to $1.50 a barrel. Oil  prices are now well below the record high of $41.15 reached on Oct. 11, during  a period of high war fears.  </P> <P> Prices of unleaded gasoline and home heating oil were also down strongly.  Unleaded gasoline for December delivery closed off 5.79 cents a gallon at 77.58  cents. Heating oil for December delivery was down 7.65 cents a gallon at 85.87  cents.  </P> <P> The plunge in crude prices came as President Bush made an opening statement at  a nationally televised news conference in which he offered to send Secretary of  State James A. Baker III to Iraq and said he would welcome a visit to  Washington by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz.  </P> <P> There was no indication whether the proposals would be accepted, and Bush made  it clear that the meetings were intended not to negotiate, but to inform  Hussein of the United States' position.  </P> <P> Still, "a lot of people took that as a peace overture," said Kenneth Nugent, an  energy futures and options broker at Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, prices that had been slipping around the previous  psychological barrier of $32 a barrel fell sharply.  </P> <P> "We came off about $1.50 in a matter of about 10 minutes," said Thomas  Blakeslee, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "As  soon as the news broke that Baker was going to Baghdad, it broke through the  floor."  </P> <P> Trading was heavy as prices crashed through various support levels. The effect  was heightened by technical factors and computer selling.  </P> <P> "We compressed about four or five days of work into about 10 minutes," said  Uslander.  </P> <P> Even before Bush's speech, oil prices had been languishing after Thursday's  news that the United Nations had adopted a resolution authorizing the use of  force and setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "As President Bush was saying himself, the U.N. resolution was seen more as a  step toward peace than toward war," said Tom Bentz, director of trading at  United Energy Inc. in New York.  </P> <P> Since it now seems unlikely that war will break out before Jan. 15, the  deadline gave traders a reason to strip out some of the "war premium" that has  been built into oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.  </P> <P> "It's obviously the fear of hostilities and disruptions in supply that keeps  prices high," said Randall Rothenberg, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  in New York.  </P> <P> Just before the end of trading, oil prices again fell sharply, hitting a low  for the day of $28.70 a barrel before recovering slightly at the close.  </P> <P> "This break indicates that we will move back to the fundamentals (of supply and  demand) as there is no immediate concern for war" in the next few weeks,  Blakeslee said. Those fundamentals show an adequate supply of oil and falling  demand.  </P> <P> For the immediate future, traders said they see the oil market testing the  $28-a-barrel level, and perhaps even falling as low as $25 a barrel before  rising again -- unless, of course, there is some other unexpected news.  </P> <P> "The month of December should be an interesting roller-coaster," Blakeslee  said.  </P></p>

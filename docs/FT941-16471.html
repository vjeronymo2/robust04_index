			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Company News (This Week): Germany due for a respite from shocks - Metallgesellschaft/Siemens The worst should be over by Wednesday. By then, Metallgesellschaft's shell-shocked shareholders and bankers should have delivered their verdict - along with pledges to stump up DM3.2bn (Pounds 1.25bn) - on the new management's rescue plan. Provided there are no further unpleasant surprises from the metals, mining and engineering group, things should start to improve on Thursday. That is when Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman of Siemens - the epitome of German corporate conservatism - will reflect on a sound year and perhaps offer some tangible evidence of economic recovery. Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new Metallgesellschaft chairman, is also expected to make an appearance before the press to throw more light on how he hopes to take the group forward. Although the financial rescue package is the work of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, his role should not be under-estimated. One banker enthused: 'I'd love to see what the poor blighter can do when he gets to run a good company.' Mr von Pierer is in that fortunate position. At the Siemens press conference he will review the group's 1.3 per cent earnings gain for last year. Given the sea of red ink engulfing much of corporate Germany, it was as welcome as the plan to invest DM2.4bn in a new plant in Dresden.</p>

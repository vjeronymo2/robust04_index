			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Downgrading for Bronfman DEBT issued by four holding companies in the Bronfman business empire has been downgraded to below investment grade by Canada's Dominion Bond Rating Service. DBRS said the downgrade, which affects Brascan, Hees International Bancorp, Trilon Financial Corp and Great Lakes Power, reflected the inability of companies in the Bronfman group to raise new debt or equity. The rating on Brascan's senior debt has been cut to BBB High from A Low. Hees' senior-debt rating has dropped to BBB from A High. Trilon is down to BBB from A. The rating on Great Lakes' commercial paper has fallen to R-2 High from R-1 Low.</p>

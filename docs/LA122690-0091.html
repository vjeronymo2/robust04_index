			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> DISCOVERY;  </P> <P> FAIRVIEW REGIONAL PARK  </P> <P> Fairview Regional Park's undeveloped, historic parkland is home to  remote-control gliders, miniature train rides and a multipurpose trail. As a  recreational area, the bluff-top park along the Santa Ana River in Costa Mesa  is spacious and uncluttered, offering plenty of room to try out all the new  toys received over the holidays.  </P> <P> Listed in the National Registry of Historic Places, Fairview is thought to be  one of the most valuable archeological sites in Orange County. Over the past 30  years, archeologists have uncovered tools, house floors, hearths and cogged  stones from the site that date back 3,000 years. (Cogged stones are associated  with an Indian religious cult that flourished along the Santa Ana River.)  </P> <P> "Fairview was developed as a 'passive' park, which means that the land is not  developed for any one specific use," said Dave Alkema, superintendent of Costa  Mesa's Parks and Recreation Department. "The first phase of the park, including  some revegetation, is completed and we're reviewing the park's Master Plan to  determine the priority needs of the community."  </P> <P> Proposals requesting permission to install athletic fields will be raised at  meetings after the first of the year. Representatives of youth soccer leagues,  Little League and Pop Warner Football have all expressed a desire to develop a  sports complex on the site.  </P> <P> "We're in the throes of (deciding) what we want to do at Fairview Park," Alkema  said. "At first, we ran into money problems, but this year we got a little  funding from the state. As soon as the city decides the best use of the land,  we'll get going on the Phase II."  </P> <P> While it appears that the second phase will involve turning undeveloped land  into grass-covered sports fields, one group will not be affected by the  changing landscape.  </P> <P> More interested in the air above the park rather than the ground,  remote-control plane pilots flock to Fairview Park to loop-the-loop, lured by  afternoon thermals blowing off the shoreline. The park site is quickly becoming  one of the most frequented mini-airports for the county's avid model plane  aviators.  </P> <P> Another group dedicated to playing in the park is the Orange County Model  Engineers. Located on the east side of Placentia Avenue, the nonprofit club is  building the miniature Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction Railroad, named to  honor historical monikers for Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. About 700 feet of  temporary track have been laid to carry live steamers -- working scale models  of full-sized steam locomotives.  </P> <P> The club offers free rides to the public on every third full weekend of the  month. Upon completion, the railroad will include 2,800 feet of track that will  cross a 96-foot-long bridge. Members hope to have the project completed by  February.  </P> <P> "Within the next few years," said Ben Viola, a Midway City resident whose Santa  Fe locomotive pulls about 90% of the passengers, "Fairview Park will have one  of the finest sites in the county for live steamers."  </P> <P> If new bicycles or running shoes are the toys of choice, a trail cuts through  the raw parkland, crossing a man-made bridge and connecting with the Santa Ana  River Trail two miles east of Huntington State Beach.  </P> <P> Fairview Regional Park offers adults and children alike ample space to frolic  with Fido or to take a ride on the Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction  Railroad.  </P> <P> Hours: Park is open from sunrise to sunset.  </P> <P> Address: 2500 block of Placentia Avenue  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 754-5300  </P> <P> Miscellaneous information: Train rides are held on the third full weekend of  each month from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. only.

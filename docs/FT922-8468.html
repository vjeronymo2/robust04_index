			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Brazilian paper group plans to launch Dollars 150m offering THE first Brazilian issue in the international equity markets is due later this month, the latest in a steady stream of Latin American company issues. Aracruz Celulose, the pulp and paper group, plans to raise Dollars 150m. It will be followed in the autumn by Telebras, the Brazilian telecom group. Aracruz is expected to attract considerable interest from both the US and Europe, in spite of Brazil's reputation for high inflation and record of political instability, especially when compared with Mexico, the best developed of the Latin American markets. Its supporters believe Aracruz will be a success for two main reasons: emerging market investors are hunting around for new Latin American stocks, and analysts are forecasting a recovery early next year in the pulp and paper sector. The company, which has a leading international position in the production of eucalyptus pulp, generates some 80 per cent of its revenues in hard currencies. The Aracruz initial public offering, consisting of 10m American Depositary Shares, is being lead managed by Salomon Brothers. The international tranche will consist of 3m ADSs, while 7m ADSs will be offered in the US and Canada. The proceeds will be used to reduce short-term cruzeiro-denominated debt. In a separate development, the international equity offering for Telmex, the Mexican telephone monopoly, was priced yesterday at Dollars 56.125 per American Depositary Share - the same as the last sale price in the US. Although the Dollars 1.4bn offering was judged a success, demand from European investors was not as strong as expected and the international tranche had to be scaled back. Out of a total of 25m ADSs, only 8.65m of the original 9.5m in the international tranche were sold and the remainder were sold in the US and Mexico. Investment bankers noted that international investors who had already bought Telmex at Dollars 27.25 in last year's international equity offering saw little reason to increase their stake at Dollars 56.125 per share.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting  took place at the People's Palace of Culture today to mark the  20th anniversary of the abolition of the tax system in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    As the nation's economic potential increased the great  leader  President Kim Il-song took steps to systematically reduce the  tax burdens upon the population and saw to it that the taxes  including the agricultural tax in kind were abolished by  degrees. And in March, 1974, he proclaimed to the whole world a  decree on totally eliminating the tax system at the 3rd meeting  of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly.    Thus, the DPRK became the first tax-free country in human  history.    In his report, Hong Sok-hyong, alternate Politburo member of  the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and  chairman of the state planning commission, said the total  elimination of the taxes in Korea was a brilliant crystalization  of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song's grand strategic  plan to free the Korean people who had been freed from  exploitation and oppression even from the fetters of leftovers  of the old society and provide an independent and creative life  for them, and another great feat performed by the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il in the course of carrying forward the  revolutionary cause of chuche through to completion.    He said the total elimination of taxes in Korea had a great  inspiring effect on the working class and other labouring masses  in capitalist countries who were molested by exploitation and  oppression and weighed down under exacting taxation and, through  a vivid reality, showed the peoples of different countries who  set about the building of a new society, freed from the  imperialist colonial yoke, and the revolutionary people fighting  for the rebuilding of socialism that socialism was the only way  of attaining development and prosperity of the country and  bringing genuine happiness to the people.    He pointed out that communist policies including the  universal free medical care system, the free compulsory  education system, the popular social insurance system and social  security system and the food policy are in force in the DPRK  now, enabling all the people to enjoy a dignified and happy life  evenly in all domains of politics, the economy and culture.    He stressed the need to cherish the great national pride and  honour of living in the tax-free country and defend and further  exalt the Korean-style socialism.    "In order to step up the revolution and construction and  defend and further glorify the socialism of our own style  centred on the masses in sharp confrontation with the enemy, we  must uphold the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il with loyalty," the reporter said.    The meeting was attended by Yi Chong-ok, member of the  Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], WPK and  vice-president, and other senior party and state officials and  working people in the city.</p>

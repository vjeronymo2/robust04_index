			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / EC leaders differ on how to revive growth and jobs: Delors mandated to produce action plan EUROPEAN Community leaders last night drafted a broad strategy for dealing with the unemployment crisis in the EC, providing a mandate for Mr Jacques Delors to produce an action plan by the end of the year. But at a summit in Copenhagen dominated by the worsening economic outlook and a widespread feeling that high German interest rates are prolonging the recession, EC leaders could do little to disguise differences on how to revive European growth and employment. Mr John Major, the prime minister, called for a fundamental rethink of the Community's approach to job creation, stressing the need for more liberalised labour markets, lower social costs for business and tighter constraints on wage increases. Warning that Europe's competitiveness had been dangerously eroded, Mr Major repeated Britain's view that the social chapter in the Maastricht treaty would amount to a 'job destruction programme'. He told his colleagues: 'Our total labour costs are too high. Our employment markets are too rigid. And our labour force is not adaptable and mobile.' In a performance at the summit designed to demonstrate to his own critics in the Tory party that Britain can now seize the initiative in Europe, Mr Major suggested that there was a growing acceptance across the EC that it must focus on improving its competitiveness with the rest of the world. Mr Delors, president of the European Commission, conceded that Europe had fallen far behind the US and Japan in its ability to create jobs. But he rejected moves to dismantle Europe's social welfare system in favour of a more deregulated labour market along US lines. Mr Niels Helvig Petersen, foreign minister of Denmark which holds the EC presidency until the end of the month, said the US model produced 'very severe defects in the economy', as well as social problems, crime and hopelessness in large urban areas. However, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's Socialist prime minister, who narrowly secured re-election against strong conservative opposition, came out in favour of deregulation of labour markets. 'The recession is colliding with great rigidity in the labour market; we have to get greater labour mobility,' he said, calling for more opportunity for part-time work. Mr Gonzalez's remarks underlined how Europe's jobs crisis is encouraging fresh thinking, even though EC leaders remain undecided on how far to go. 'All the leaders see they are in trouble,' said a Dutch diplomat. 'This is important because it is the start of the debate.' Although most EC leaders indicated they would give Mr Delors a mandate to produce a white paper on unemployment by the end of the year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany argued that the Twelve could not wait until the next EC summit in December in Brussels. He called on national governments to come forward with ideas within four to six weeks. The philosophical nature of the debate was mixed with a desire for short-term action. The UK, Spain, France and Italy, among others, all called for a co-ordinated drop in European interest rates - a move diplomats interpreted as pressure on the Bundesbank to lower market rates. Mr Delors said the size of the cut was not as important as the timing. 'We are in a hole,' said an aide. 'A cut in interest rates is urgent.' During the afternoon session Mr Delors also put forward several new measures to produce short-term relief for the unemployed. These include an extra Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.35bn) extension to the temporary lending facility already provided by the European Investment Bank. This would be in addition to the Ecu5bn agreed at last December's EC summit in Edinburgh.

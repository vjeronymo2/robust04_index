			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Who needs Solzhenitsyn?: A mixed reception awaits the writer as he returns to his Russian homeland Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose image in the west is that of the conscience of Russia in exile and the literary heir to Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, returned yesterday to his country - bowing low on his first steps out of the plane in Magadan to honour the memory of the many thousands of Soviet convicts who perished there. For two decades he has been an occasional, austere and often angry voice in exile: he returns to a land where his generation is dying or exhausted, the next is deeply compromised and the youngest is sceptical, even scornful, of the imperatives which have driven him. Grigory Amelin, a young literary critic, caught this iconoclastic mood in a squib he wrote recently for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, one of the smart new Moscow dailies. In compressed, stylised Russian, he began: 'His books piled up to the roof, his beard fit for Hollywood, his conscience scrubbed absolutely spotless, he appears in Russia like a holiday, like the First of May - and, like it, shamelessly out of date . . . In Moscow he'll be received like a demi-God . . . but who needs him? No one . . . For a long time now he has understood nothing either of America, or of Russia.' He ended: 'Solzhenitsyn is a spiritual statue, he is like a hatstand in the lobby, displaying a vast arrogance, spouting prophetically - but in the end, pretty moth-eaten.' It was a stone dropped into troubled waters. On his return to Russia after 20 years (he was forcibly deported in February 1974), Solzhenitsyn will doubtless be honoured and treated as a 'spiritual statue'. But he will also be reviled; pushed and pulled to lend his name to causes; re-evaluated as a writer as he has not before; and pestered, gawped at and petitioned in a way which would try the nerves and strength of a man with a less autocratic and solitary temperament, and with fewer years than his 75. More, he will be - already is - a touchstone for the intellectual and political classes, a measure of their own moral and creative worth. He may also be, after an initial flurry, ignored - which he has not been for more than 30 years. Some of this was demonstrated as much by a defence of him as by the initial attack. Vladimir Bukovsky, himself a man of courage whose dissidence in the 1960s earned him a sentence and then deportation, wrote in Izvestia from his now voluntary exile in the English university town of Cambridge, that Russia was 'struggling not so much with economic collapse as with a complete atrophy of conscience . . . (People) hate those who are not soiled, who did not sup from the cup of the Communist Party with everyone else. They never forgive that.' Bukovsky, naturally, was being a little autobiographical: he has professed himself deeply disappointed by what is happening in Russia, seeing everywhere a return to communism in practice if not in name. Speaking from Cambridge this week, Bukovsky said that 'It might be possible for him (Solzhenitsyn) to have a kind of spiritual appeal to people. I wish him well and I hope he can - but I doubt it's feasible with this generation, it's not prepared for him. The next generation might.' 'He should,' says Lev Anninsky, a prominent writer and chairman of the Russian Booker Prize jury for this year, 'stay out of politics. He is a writer: grant him a place to write.' That he will write is certain, since his life has been an obsessive, sometimes heroic, struggle to find the space and the time and the freedom to write: but Anninsky's hope is probably vain, for two reasons. First, Solzhenitsyn is a man who evolved, even before he left it, a view of Russia which, though individual, nevertheless intersects with many of the dominant themes of current political and social struggle. He had come to believe, especially from the early 1960s, that Russia was not just a country but a civilisation apart: as his greatest biographer, Michael Scammell, has noted (in Solzhenitsyn: a biography, Norton, 1984), he even went so far as to agree with (though not to work with) a strain in the Soviet communist party which stressed the nationalist, chauvinist values against the more liberalising and pro-western current which emerged after Khrushchev came to power. And though he honoured Andrei Sakharov, the late physicist and human rights campaigner, Solzhenitsyn's dissidence had a very different philosophical and political base from that of the liberal, relativist scientist. In his famous Harvard speech, given in 1978 when he received an honorary degree from that university, Solzhenitsyn excoriated the west, assumed its long-term decline, blasted the 'collapse of courage' in intellectual and political life, poured scorn on criminality, on the popular media and on the consumer culture. That view is largely unchanged: he sees Russia as a cultural fortress to be defended, not as a too-long-isolated imperial power which must be democratised and led to the market. On the contrary: he has made clear over the past year that he sees the liberal reformers as dangerous, guilty of reckless experiments with the country on a par with those of the Bolsheviks eight decades ago, of having reduced Russia to poverty, dependence and criminality. 'He is,' says the liberal philosopher Yuri Senokossov, 'a man who does not speak to the needs of our times. I honour him for his courage and his actions: I don't follow him in what he now thinks and feels. He wants a strong hand: a return to the zemstvos (or pre-revolutionary village councils). He does not want the institutions of constitutionality and legal forms: but these are the essence of building a state which protects its citizens.' Second, his view of the scope of Russia has also been set out clearly, in his pamphlet How we should reconstruct Russia, published four years ago. It was, when published, daring in one way - a blast against empire, a call for Russia to let the dependent Soviet nations in Central Asia, the Baltics and Transcaucasia go, find their own routes to national independence. Russia, he argued, should define itself as the Slav area - the Russian Federation itself, Ukraine, Belarus and Northern Kazakhstan. This recipe is now daring in another way: it is the programme of the nationalist politicians who would indeed reconstruct Russia to include at least these peoples; and strong echoes of it are now to be found in the official, government rhetoric, even as the Russian president and government remain formally committed to the recognition of the independence of the former Soviet states around them. To have Solzhenitsyn, with the authority he can still command, living and working in Russia and representing, even if not actively propagating, such views could be a moral boost to this wing of Russian polity - even though he has made it clear he has no time for the more rabid expressions of the idea, such as those of Vladimir Zhirinovsky of the Liberal Democrats. Thus the cannier leaders in the opposition forces - nationalists, communists and others - already see him as an ally, even if only because their enemies might become his enemies. Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, said in a comment earlier this week to the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily that 'we should expect him to be critical - especially towards the authorities, and the president'. (Though others in these circles dismiss him with the same contempt as Amelin: Alexander Nevzorov, the nationalist journalist, asked sarcastically: 'Who is he anyway? A writer? He's more of a propagandist. A historian? But from his novels you would understand history as from a Dumas novel.') He will, it is likely, be either dragged or move of his own volition into the political maelstrom. His life in Russia, from the publication of A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, in the journal Novy Mir in 1962, until his expulsion 12 years later, was stormy and public. Much of this was because the Communist Party could not leave him alone, whether as (at first) a 'true son of the Party' for his perceived value in exposing Stalinist excesses, or - increasingly - as an enemy of the people, the 'crime' for which he was expelled. But part of it was his own choice: though he sincerely craved space to write and usually created it, he could also not stand aside from bearing witness to the crimes of Soviet society - even if he did so with generally greater caution and circumspection than other, usually younger, dissidents, being ever careful to protect his precious manuscripts and freedom to write. Will he be different now? The manner of his return yesterday speaks of the public rather than the private man - a touchdown in the former prison camp area of Magadan, then to the far-eastern city of Vladivostok, a planned train ride through the country to examine its state, accompanied by the BBC. The voracious media, which he has both courted and hated, will no longer observe the courtesies they maintained while he passed nearly 20 years in seclusion in Vermont, where he created a refuge into which little American was allowed to intrude. He will be thrust into the pulpit whether he likes it or not. Says one of his detractors from the nationalist camp, Shamil Sultanov of the weekly Den: 'Various political forces of the left and the right and the centre will try to use him for their own ends . . . but when these attempts do not work - and they will not - they will lose all interest in him.' Says Gavril Popov, the former mayor of Moscow: 'If Solzhenitsyn takes part in politics, his reputation will fall.' And he adds: 'He's come back a little too late.' This is a general theme of comment on him: that had he returned (as he at one time said he would) in the last years of the Gorbachev period, then he would have been swept up into the pantheon of the liberalisers and truth-tellers, taking his place with Sakharov. At that time, to read Gulag Archipelago - his stunning account of the camp system - was a cross between a civic duty and a fashion. But now, he returns to a divided, exhausted, struggling land. 'He missed the great period - 1988-91,' says Alexander Tsipko, a leading social critic and philosopher. 'In these years, only his books were active in the struggle. Now, his version of anti-communism has lost its influence, since as a result of the break-up of country there has arisen a nostalgia for the past, for what has been lost. And in these conditions his active dislike for communism may not be comprehensible to people.' He may thus, soon, be ignored, or simply judged on his literary merit, which he might well say he preferred. Many of his admirers - such as Senokossov and Anninsky - are not fans of his later writing: Senokossov says he cannot read August 1914, the first of the novels conceived as the 'Red Wheel' cycle. 'The language is so deliberately archaic, of a kind no one speaks or spoke,' he says. Others would even query whether the early novels - Ivan Denisovich, First Circle, Cancer Ward - had real literary merit, as opposed to political and moral importance. His main literary defender in Russia is Alla Latynina, Russian literature editor at the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta - ironically, the organ of the Soviet (now Russian) writers' union from which he was expelled in the late 1960s. Latynina, in her cluttered office, says that 'he immediately stood out as a master and was recognised as such by his contemporaries. Many camp inmates wrote about their experiences: many were very fine books. But why has Solzhenitsyn remained supreme? Because he is a great writer, in the great Russian tradition. Why does the Gulag stand out as an account of the camps? Because it was not just a list of horrors, but a work of literature.' 'Who needs him?' says Anninsky, irritably rehearsing the Nezavisimaya question. 'I need him, I, I. We all need him, in conditions of freedom as much as in conditions of lack of freedom. He is there to tell us of our past, a very large part of it, and he can give unique expression to it. I need him.' Solzhenitsyn has been rendered into statuary - as much by the western media and academe as by the Soviet Communist Party. But, like the famous statue of the Commendatore in Don Giovanni, he can and probably will revive - to call sinners to account and to reveal a fundamentalist vision of good and evil. 'If we, the creators of art,' he wrote a year ago, 'will obediently submit to this downward slide, if we cease to hold dear the great cultural traditions of the foregoing centuries together with the spiritual foundations from which it grew, we will be contributing to a highly dangerous fall of the human spirit on earth, to a degeneration of man into some kind of lower state, closer to the animal world.' This is a a vision of the artist as a saviour of mankind: and Solzhenitsyn cleaves to that. The man who returned to Russia yesterday retains the power, and probably the will, to challenge, to move and to disturb. He remains a hero, in the classic, and perhaps tragic, sense.</p>

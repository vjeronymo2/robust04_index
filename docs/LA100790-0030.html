			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> KIDS;  </P> <P> ROCKING HORSE RANCHERS  </P> <P> ROCKING HORSE RANCH in Riverside County is busy "breeding" high-styled mounts  for the toddler set. Built to last long enough to grow into heirlooms, they are  handcrafted from southern mountain pine.  </P> <P> A custom-order Ranch pony features the child's name and birth date branded  beneath the mane (the same spot where a real registered Arabian would be  branded). Rather than paint her rocking horses, master builder Marie Crain  generally stains them a rich, nut brown, though she is willing to match the hue  to other furniture.  </P> <P> All the trimmings are intact -- including a flowing acrylic yarn mane and tail,  genuine leather reins and a comfortable vinyl saddle. Prices begin at $45 for  the 18-inch table-model version. Among the ridable models, a 25-inch rocking  horse sells for $115, a 29-incher for $135, and a 38-inch size for $165. For  those rocking-horse aficionados who like them more classical, a bit of  Victorian painting -- flowers and ribbons -- can be added ($250 for the 38-inch  model).  </P> <P> Recent additions to the Rocking Horse Ranch line include an 18-inch carousel  horse ($60) and a 21-inch rocking horse lamp ($65). And ambitious sorts can  order a 38-inch rocking horse kit ($115).  </P> <P> Best of all, on these horses, there's no way the bandits can escape: No matter  how fast they gallop, these animals cannot tip over; the ends of the rockers  have been specially designed to prevent tipping.  </P> <P>  For orders and information, telephone Rocking Horse Ranch, (714) 926-4304.  </P> <P> L.K.P.  </P></p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Question of arms points up Czechoslovak divisions: Slovak MPs fight to keep the weapons industry in the face of federal attempts to curb output AN ARMOURED carrier can be had in Prague these days for about Dollars 1,600 (Pounds 909). Federal deputies put one on show in front of the parliament building last Friday. They said they had found it on sale in a used car shop. Czechoslovakia, once the largest producer of conventional weaponry in the former communist bloc after the Soviet Union, is finding it hard to control a flourishing arms market. Since the end of communist rule, the authorities have sought to curb production, halt exports and convert weapons factories to peaceful production. But many producers, and trade officials, have been determined to carry on selling, in part because of the lack of alternative work in the post-communist era. Attempts to restrict the market were blocked in parliament yesterday by Slovak MPs worried about the impact on one of their region's most important industries. Most of the country's factories are in Slovakia, where unemployment is about 12 per cent. The Slovak deputies refused to adopt a constitutional amendment laying down strict conditions for the import and export of arms and drugs. Parliament's failure to adopt the legislation leaves the way clear for arms merchants operating in a virtually unfettered market. In a small grocery store in Holesovice, a Prague suburb, the sales assistant denies vigorously that he intends to sell weapons. Yet officials at the federal ministry of economics say the shop's address appears alongside an offer for arms sales made by an unregistered Czech company in a Brazilian newspaper. At the Federal Ministry of Foreign Trade, officials from the embattled republic of Georgia come out of the arms trade department and walk away furtively. A legislative loophole means that while licences to export products must be granted by the federal ministry of foreign trade, deal-making is unregulated and a spate of private companies have set up shop to try to sell a range of military products. 'Nowadays, officially, anyone can go into the arms business if he gets a licence. As a result, everybody is trying to go into the business. At the same time, producers are lowering the prices because they are eager to sell. So one ends up with dumping prices often 30 to 40 per cent below the original prices,' explains Mr Stanislav Kozeny, chairman of Omnipol, the once all-powerful company which held a monopoly on arms trade under the former regime. Mr Stefan Glezgo, head of the arms trade department in the Foreign Trade Ministry, who put forward the bill rejected yesterday, wants to restrict the sales of weapons and the granting of export licences to a few selected companies. 'We are not afraid of companies choosing arms trade as business. But we want them to let us know about it and give us all the detailed relevant information,' says Mr Glezgo. He adds that licences are not granted easily. Last year, only 28 companies were granted licences to export military products and these included many manufacturers. Furthermore, he says, all controversial cases are referred to an inter-ministerial commission which must approve the deals. Efforts by federal authorities in Prague to control the arms market have repeatedly run into the opposition of Slovak politicians. Nationalism plays a crucial role in Czechoslovakia's ability to control both its arms production and trade. Eighty per cent of the defence industry lies in Slovakia, the smaller and poorer of the country's two - Czech and Slovak - republics. In 1991, arms production in the whole country, amounting to Kcs7.6bn (Pounds 150m) reached barely 50 per cent of the previous year's level. Slovak arms factories, which employ some 80,000 workers, face enormous social difficulties as they try to restructure production towards civil output. To ease the transition, the federal government has launched a conversion programme which last year granted Kcs1.5bn to support projects for civil production in arms factories. But the resistance of arms producers has hampered the programme. 'The Slovak factories want to continue producing tanks and their managers are hiding information from us,' says Mr Josef Fucik who supervises the conversion programme at the federal ministry of economics. Arms producers have put growing pressure on the federal authorities to allow them to export weaponry in order to survive. Last year, the federal government approved the sale of 252 T-72 tanks to Syria over objections from the US and Israel. 'There are too many competing interests within the government which is trying to balance economic and political imperatives,' says Mr Martin Palous, deputy foreign affairs minister who sits on the inter-ministerial supervisory commission. 'The licence department of the foreign trade department comes to us with done deals. If we say yes, it means billions of korunas for the country. If we say no, it means we don't respect the economic interest of Czechoslovakia. It's like trying to square a circle.' Pressure from arms factories has increased alongside Slovak nationalism. The plight of the arms industry has fuelled resentment against federal policies in Slovakia. The most popular politician in the republic, Slovak nationalist leader Mr Vladimir Meciar, has promised to keep the industry afloat if, as expected, he wins next June's general elections. 'The first priority of the new Slovak prime minister will be to maintain standards of living. And in Slovakia, this is linked directly to allowing the arms factories, the republic's main hard currency earners, to sell' says Mr Kozeny, of Omnipol.</p>

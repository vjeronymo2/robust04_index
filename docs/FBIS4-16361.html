			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "The mechanism for  implementing measures stipulated by the tri-partite statement  made by the Presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. on  January 14 of this year has started to work", said a spokesman  for the Russian Foreign Ministry.    Grigoriy Karasin was referring to the arrival of the first  shipment of nuclear fuel assemblies from Russia to the Ukrainian  Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in  Europe. The shipment was sent as compensation for Ukraine's  dismantled nuclear warheads.    As the spokesman, in accordance with the three presidents'  statement, all nuclear warheads should be transferred from  Ukrainian to Russian territory, where they should be dismantled  as soon as possible. Russia is then required to compensate  Ukraine in the form of fuel assemblies for the latter's nuclear  energy programme, also as soon as possible.    In order to begin the process of compensating Ukraine,  Russia  agreed to provide the fuel assemblies, containing 100 tonnes of  lowly-enriched Uranium, within ten months. In the same time  period, at least 200 nuclear warheads from RS-18 and RS-22  rockets will be transported from Ukraine to Russia for  dismantling.    According to Russian specialists, the first shipment of fuel  to the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant is enough to enable one of  the plant's five reactors to work for an entire year, which will  give Ukraine 5.5 to 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Barbados Foreign Minister Branford Taitt stated to  PRENSA LATINA that the presence of Cuban President Fidel Castro  at the First International Small Island [Nations] Conference has  greatly contributed to defining the objectives and strategies of  the conference.    Following a brief meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto  Robaina, Taitt said he had been excited to learn that Fidel  Castro was to attend the Bridgetown conference. Taitt pointed  out that Fidel Castro's address to the plenum was brilliant, and  that he personally believes Castro's presence lends greater  importance to the conference and contributes to defining  fundamental elements in the strategies of sustainable  development of the small island nations.    Taitt added that the process of integrating Cuba into the  Caribbean Community's economic mechanisms would not suffer  delays due to external pressures.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOHAMMED'S NIGHT JOURNEY  </P> <P> In their review of Amos Elon's "Jerusalem: City of Mirrors" (Book Review, Oct.  1), Roger Friedland and Richard Hecht essentially revise history by writing:  "The Muslims claim the cleared platform of Solomon's Temple as the launching  pad for Mohammed's night journey to heaven. In fact, the Koran does not mention  Jerusalem by name and the city was probably identified with the sacred text's  'far distant mosque' only a century later by Damascus-based Umayyad sultans to  whom Mecca was denied."  </P> <P> I won't take offense at the snide tone of the words "launching pad," but the  next set of facts needs to be aligned with history. Many things not spelled out  in detail, or by name, in the Koran were later expanded upon by the Prophet in  his hadith, or "traditions," recorded in his lifetime and selected as  "canonical literature" through a strict verification process by early scholars.  Jerusalem is mentioned by name in the most accepted hadith on the Night  Journey: in the collection of Bukhari and Muslim. One piece of evidence for  Mohammed's journey, in fact, was that he was able to describe Jerusalem in  detail to people who had visited it in broad daylight on their caravan  journeys, while the Prophet had never visited it except during the journey.  </P> <P> Mohammed's ability to describe the city convinced many skeptics that he had  indeed been there, in whatever corporeal or non-corporeal mode one may wish to  believe. So when the second Caliph (Omar), who was Caliph only two years after  the death of the Prophet, came to Jerusalem himself, to find the spot he knew  about through the Prophet's account, he built what is described as a rude  wooden mosque above the rock of the prophet Solomon, large enough, it is  reported, to hold 3,000 people at a time.  </P> <P> Fifty-three years after the Prophet's death, Caliph Abd al-Malik built the  opulent mosque, the Dome of the Rock, over the first Omar's mosque and  established the golden dome that now stands above Solomon's Temple stone, the  present mosque almost identical to the original with the exception of exterior  Persian tiles in place of the original mosaic work. This is the event mentioned  in the Elon review, but the location long before had been identified by  Muslims, as most historians -- Muslim or not -- know.  </P> <P> What is fretful in such an allegation is the possible sinister intent by the  author of the book, and then by its subsequent reviewer. Israel and its  supporters would like nothing more than to undermine any spiritual claims by  Muslims, Arabs and Palestinians in particular, to the Mosque of the Rock as one  of our three most revered spots on Earth. To simply say that it wasn't even  identified until a century after the Prophet's death severely trivializes the  Muslim's love for Jerusalem as the place where our Prophet began the experience  of one of his greatest miracles, the Night Journey, during which he received  the form of the Prayer as we do it five times a day to this day. The  intimations of inauthenticity regarding Judaism's Tower of David and  Christianity's Via Dolorosa also may be erroneous and would also be  reprehensible history, but I leave it up to experts of those two faiths to  correct.  </P> <P> ABD AL-HAYY MOORE  </P> <P> SANTA BARBARA  </P></p>

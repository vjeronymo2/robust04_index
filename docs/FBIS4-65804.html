			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl described  the great unity with which the CDU/CSU [Christian Democrat  Union/Christian Socialist Union] group voted for Roman Herzog in  the presidential elections yesterday as very important. He was  also very pleased that the majority of representatives of the  FDP [Free Democratic Party] had also voted for Herzog, Kohl said  in Berlin today. The chancellor leveled harsh criticism at the  Social Democrats. He said he could not understand the  complaints of several SPD representatives. The SPD has proved  itself a bad loser.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Rent reasonableness limitation. The initial contract rent must be reasonable in relation to rents currently being charged for units in the private unassisted market that are comparable to the newly constructed units or to the units after they are rehabilitated, taking into account the location, size, structure type, quality, amenities, facilities, and management and maintenance service of the unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial contract rent may not exceed rents charged by the Owner for comparable unassisted units and may not exceed the rents necessary to make the project feasible, as determined by HUD, after taking into account assistance from other government sources. For an assisted unit that is subject to local rent control, comparable units are rent-controlled units. However, for an assisted unit that is not subject to local rent control while it is assisted (regardless of whether the unit would be subject to such control if it were not assisted), comparable units are units that are not subject to rent-control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a project is financed with a HUD-insured multifamily mortgage, then, in addition to meeting the other requirements of this paragraph (ii), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial contract rent for each assisted unit shall not exceed an amount determined by HUD to be necessary to amortize the insured mortgage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Congregate housing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If congregate housing is utilized, the fair market rent for each congregate housing unit shall be the same as for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0-bedroom unit, except that if the unit consists of two or more private rooms, the fair market rent shall be the same as for a 1-bedroom unit. To qualify as congregate housing, there must be a central kitchen and dining facility with food service provided by persons other than unit occupants. At least one hot meal each day must be provided in the central facility. Each unit in congregate housing must contain a living room, a bathroom, and a refrigerator of appropriate size, although food preparation facilities and a kitchen area are not required in the congregate housing unit. In determining the reasonableness of the rents, consideration must be given to the presence or absence of common rather than private cooking, dining, and sanitary facilities, and the provision of special amenities or maintenance and/or management services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other services_exclusion from contract rent.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The contract rent may not include the cost of providing supportive services, housekeeping or laundry services, furniture, food, or the cost of serving food.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contract rent adjustments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Contract rents shall be adjusted in accordance with the PBC program regulation at 24 CFR 882.715.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (7) Owner's Submission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Owner's submission to the HA for inclusion in the application to HUD must contain all of the information required under the PBC program regulation at 24 CFR 882.720(b)(3). In addition, the Owner's submission must contain a statement of sources and uses of funds for the development or rehabilitation of the project, and a certification that the assistance, including adjustments of the contract rent, will not be more than is necessary to make the assisted activity feasible after taking into account assistance from other government sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (8) Program Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligibility requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participation in the Multifamily Project Demonstration is limited to frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons, as these terms are defined in section I(B)(2) of this NOFA, who:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Qualify as a very low income family (whose income generally does not exceed 50 percent of the median income for the area); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Are not receiving any form of Federal, State or local housing assistance at the time of expressing an interest to the HA in participating in the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Selection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) General. The HA must establish a Multifamily Project Demonstration selection preference for frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons on the HA's Section 8 waiting list. If there are an insufficient number of eligible frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly persons on the HA's waiting list who qualify for selection for the Multifamily Project Demonstration, the HA must advertise for frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicants to be added to the waiting list. If the HA waiting list is closed, the HA may open its list solely to frail elderly and near-frail elderly applicants who are willing to reside in the demonstration project, and may also limit the number of applications accepted. A frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicant who refuses the offer of a unit assisted under this demonstration may keep his or her place on the waiting list unless the applicant was added to the waiting list in response to a solicitation for applications from only frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicants willing to reside in the demonstration project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Supportive services application. Before selecting program participants, the selected HA (with PAC assistance) shall develop a supportive services application form for frail elderly persons to use in applying for supportive services under the Multifamily Project Demonstration. The information in the individual's supportive services application is crucial to the PAC's determination of the need for further physical and/or psychological evaluation of any individual who wishes to receive the supportive services offered. The application should include: any intake form, the ADL assessment, and any appropriate comments from both the applicant's physician and the service coordinator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Institutionalization during participation in demonstration. If a program participant is unable to reside in a dwelling unit in the project assisted under the Multifamily Project Demonstration, due to severe illness or accident requiring institutionalization, the HA and the PAC, in consultation with the program participant, the participant's family, and any involved doctors, shall determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that the individual will be able to return home to live in the dwelling unit. If not, the HA may terminate the individual's eligibility for the supportive services under this demonstration. The HA must adopt a policy for termination of supportive services and informal hearing procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Termination of rental assistance and supportive services. Rental assistance shall be terminated only in accordance with 24 CFR 882.758. If rental assistance is terminated in accordance with Section 8 requirements, the HUD-funded portion of the supportive services component also is terminated. The program participant shall be provided an informal hearing in accordance with the procedures in 24 CFR part 882.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supportive services shall be terminated if the participant:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Gains physical and mental health, and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time (in which case readmission to the supportive services component_based upon reassessment to determine degree of frailty_is acceptable).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

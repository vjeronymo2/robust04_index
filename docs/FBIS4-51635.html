			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP] plans to take over from the presidential  office [Chongwadae] in handling future political disputes with  the main opposition Democratic Party, DLP sources said Monday.    President Kim Yong-sam's administration has recently been at  odds with the opposition party over such issues as the  resignation of Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the  Sangmudae scandal.    Since the inauguration of the civilian government last  February, the ruling party has needed the strong leadership of  Kim Yong-sam, who also serves as DLP president, in carrying out  reform and purging corrupt officials.    But now, Chongwadae believes that stable execution of  government affairs should be given top priority.    In order to maintain better relations between the ruling and  opposition parties, the presidential office has therefore  decided to let the DLP take the initiative in handling political  affairs.    Under the new idea, the ruling party hopes to strengthen  inter- party dialogue and remain in close contact with the  opposition party through their floor leaders at the National  Assembly, as well as through their secretaries-general and  policy-makers.    DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, speaking at a regular monthly  meeting of senior party officials, pointed out that the ruling  party exists because there is an opposition and vice versa.    "Although there is a gap, the Democratic Party has to be an  essential partner (for the DLP)," Kim said.    "We should do our best to maintain healthy relations with  the  opposition party," he added. "We should keep building  partnership relations with it."    DLP Secretary-General Mun Chung-su said that whenever the  opposition launched an offensive in the past, Chongwadae  hastened to handle it, assuming a greater burden. Mun thus  signaled a change and the party's intention to grab the  initiative in political affairs from now on.    Another senior DLP official said that Chongwadae is studying  ways to leave party affairs to the DLP and administrative work  to the cabinet.    In view of this new policy direction, the DLP is expected to  offer a "cooling-off period" before opening formal and informal  channels of dialogue with the opposition party, he said.</p>

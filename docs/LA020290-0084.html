			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING BOOK ON LITERACY  </P> <P> The centerpieces were the giveaway. Rather than the usual eruptions of imported  out-of-season flowers, each table was topped with a leather-bound tome by an  author such as William Shakespeare, George Eliot, Edith Wharton or Pearl S.  Buck.  </P> <P> The books were propped on mini-word processors with the words "Family Literacy"  on the screen.  </P> <P> The theme of the annual Town Hall of California dinner was reading and writing  -- in today's parlance, literacy. About 850 people representing business,  education and the arts filled the Century Plaza Hotel's Los Angeles Ballroom  Wednesday night to honor Jean Sharley Taylor, retired associate editor of the  Los Angeles Times and originator of The Times' 2-year-old Reading Lab, which  offers literacy skills to employees, their families and the downtown community.  </P> <P> As soon as they stepped from their cars, guests were invited to inspect the  latest expansion of Taylor's vision, a New Age version of the little red school  house: a mobile reading lab equipped with six computer work stations. "We just  got it today," Barbara Neder, Reading Lab administrator, said of the large  white van that will serve youth and adults in Los Angeles through different  social service programs.  </P> <P> First Lady Barbara Bush served as the evening's honorary chair, and the timing  of her husband's State of the Union address earlier that evening was lost on no  one. "That this event is the same night that the President made one of his  national goals to have all adults become literate by the year 2000 is  symbolic," said Leonard Britton, superintendent of schools for the Los Angeles  Unified School District.  </P> <P> "The United States is in dire, dire danger of becoming a third-rate nation  unless we catch up," said attorney Richard J. Riordan, co-chairman of the event  with Tom Johnson, vice chairman of the Times Mirror Co.  </P></p>

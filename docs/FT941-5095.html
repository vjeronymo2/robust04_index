			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Worries cast shadow over Canadian banks Worries over interest rates and continuing property problems are overshadowing Canada's six largest banks after a strong first quarter. Earnings for the three months to January 31 were generally higher than expected. Led by Royal Bank of Canada, the six reported net profit of CDollars 1.13bn, up 43 per cent from a year earlier. The gains were driven mainly by the banks' brokerage subsidiaries, reflecting booming stock markets and mutual fund (unit trusts) business. Also loan losses declined and non-performing loans eased. Return on assets and on equity generally improved and costs were held in control. Mr Al Flood, chairman of the Canadian Imperial of Commerce, said he sees clear signs of economic recovery in North America and Mr Allan Taylor, chairman of the Royal Bank, foresaw a return to a solid level of profitability in the fiscal year to October 31 1994. But brokerage and investment banking may not keep up the torrid pace of 1993 and 'there's nothing in the fundamental economy to make banking more profitable,' said Mrs Donna Toth, bank analyst with Nesbitt Thomson in Toronto. The commercial property crisis is still severe and like a millstone around most banks' necks, said another analyst, 'and it's not getting much better'. Loan losses would linger, said Mrs Susan Cohen, of Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd, but the kay variable is the course of short-term interest rates.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US persistence pays off at trade talks - After the success of Japan's PR campaign against the US, last-minute talks give Washington much of what it wanted After a 20-hour negotiating marathon, US trade officials were too weary to celebrate their success in reaching 'significant trade agreements' with Japan in the areas of telecommunications, medical technology, insurance and flat glass. 'You wouldn't want me to fall under the table right before your eyes,' said a hoarse Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, as he prepared to go home. But first he read from a dog-eared sheet of paper his 'instructions' from his deputy, Ms Charlene Barshefsky: 'Three things we are going to get: Annual progress in (exports) value and (market) share. Significant increase in access and sales, using recent trends to evaluate the extent of the process made.' This was the formula agreed for the results-oriented trade pacts the US has been demanding for the past 15 months. For months Japanese officials called it 'managed trade' and skilfully organised worldwide sentiment against it. The Europeans, whom Mr Kantor had hoped to count as allies, stood aside. In the end, the deals contained no 'numerical targets' or fixed market shares. In fact, Ms Barshefsky said, US government and industry wanted no more than rising 'trend lines'. They did not want specific targets setting ceilings on foreign market share as in the case of semiconductors. The successful Japanese public relations offensive emboldened the bureaucracy and delayed agreement, said one former US official. But fears of unrest on the currency markets, the return to power of old-line Japanese officials and concern about damage to the overall US-Japan alliance ultimately prevailed. The US got by no means everything it wanted, but the gains were solid enough to cede to Japan a victory of sorts on vehicles. Efforts to get commitments from Japan's private sector for increased purchases of car parts were set aside. Mr Kantor, however, will bring a trade action against Japan's regulatory barriers to sales of foreign car replacement parts. The action will come under Section 301 of US trade law, rather than the much-loathed 'Super 301', which 'may have been the wrong signal at the wrong time', said Mr Kantor. There is little difference between the provisions - both require a year of negotiations to end specified trade barriers, with the threat of threaten sanctions if all else fails  - but a simple 301 is considered less offensive. According to US officials, the final throes of the talks were gruelling, repetitious and marked by some embarrassing incidents of recriminations by a senior Japanese official towards his juniors. Although it was held in Washington, the dozen US negotiators involved were greatly outnumbered by the Japanese delegation. Eighty were lodged at the Willard hotel alone. The achievement should go a long way towards boosting Mr Kantor, who has lately has been criticised for moving too slowly to get the Uruguay Round pact through Congress. 'Kantor has proven once again to be the guy who gets results,' said Mr Clyde Prestowitz, one of the administration's outside advisers on Japan. 'I don't know how much this will effect the trade deficit but it will make a significant difference for companies in these sectors.' Mr Kantor sought to gain some credit for President Bill Clinton, who he said had been 'clear, precise and unwavering' in his instructions. Then he talked of the 'enormous common agenda' shared by the US and Japan - implementation of the Uruguay Round, moving the Asian Pacific regional trade group toward more open trade, political and strategic issues. 'It involves co-operating together to create global growth to raise standards of living, not only in our own countries but around the world.' This package of five trade deals takes both countries 'a giant step' toward those goals, he said. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

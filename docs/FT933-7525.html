			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: Mexican oil giant profits from private tuition - Commercial contractors are showing Pemex how to cut costs OFF THE south-east coast of Mexico in the Sound of Campeche a group of foreign and private Mexican oil companies is drilling for oil. The companies man their own rigs, lease or own their equipment and operate independently of the company to which they are contracted, Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the country's state oil corporation. In the nearest on-shore town, Ciudad del Carmen, property prices have soared as new residents have looked for homes; local entrepreneurs have set up video bars and a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet to cash in on the boom; and rich, rowdy foreign oil workers have upset local sensibilities. After being closed to foreign oil drillers since the early 1970s, Mexico is now opening up. Private - and thus foreign - companies still cannot explore for oil and take a cut of what they find, but they are doing drilling work for Pemex on a contract or turnkey basis. Of about 60 wells in the Bay of Campeche, 36 are being drilled by private oil companies, at a cost to Pemex of between Dollars 300m and 400m. While the government is unlikely before next year's presidential election to modify Mexico's nationalist constitution to permit foreign oil companies to explore for oil, some further relaxation is expected eventually. 'This is not the end of the trend toward opening,' says Mr Rafael Quijano, an expert on Pemex at the Petroleum Finance Corporation in Washington. 'Quite the contrary; it is the beginning.' Pemex recently allowed a private consortium headed by Valero Energy of Texas to build, operate and own a gasoline plant in Mexico for the first time, and has taken a 50 per cent stake in Shell's refinery at Deer Park, Texas. It had also put up secondary petrochemicals plants for sale, although this has now been postponed for the foreseeable future because of low petrochemical prices. In an indication of possible changes ahead, the government has drawn up draft legislation that would allow private companies to use Pemex pipes to import oil, according to a report cited in the El Financiero newspaper. Such legislation, if passed by to congress, would break Pemex's 55-year-old monopoly of the distribution of oil in Mexico. The partial opening of the sector to foreign contractors has already had an effect on how Pemex does business. Thanks to their greater nimbleness and efficiency, private contractors take half as much time to drill a well as the state company, according to Mr Ernesto Marcos, its finance director. So contracting out has saved Pemex huge sums in drilling costs, as well as teaching it lessons that it has used to improve its own operations. 'We are not willing to follow examples of pre-cooked dinners (on the rigs),' says Mr Marcos, referring to Mexican distaste for American frozen food, 'but we certainly follow other practices of the private companies.' He points out that Pemex has substantially de-centralised procurement, allowing rigs to buy equipment directly from suppliers, rather than through the Mexico City headquarters, which often entailed months of delay. The private drillers are generally American, Mexican or joint-ventures between the two. So far of the 36 wells contracted out, most have been to four companies - Triton International of Houston, Faja de Oro and Protexa, both Mexican, but contracting work out to foreigners, and a joint Mexican-US owned company, EPN-Sonat. They operate on a turnkey basis, drilling a given depth for a specified sum before handing over the well to Pemex, which brings it into production, and take all financial risk in case drilling proves more difficult than expected. Generally they make do without the large numbers of cooks, waiters and other excess staff seen on the Pemex wells and have an average basic crew of 32 to 35, compared with 42 at Pemex operations. Apart from personnel, the main difference between the private companies and Pemex is in logistical and managerial expertise, rather than technology. One oil man in Campeche explains: 'Pemex's main problem is not that they don't have good people in the field. Its the ponderous organisation above that. They have to go to six or eight people to make a decision, whereas I can make one there and then'. Mr Marcos thoroughly agrees. 'Before, we had to co-ordinate people in drilling with people in procurement with people in transportation. You can never structure yourself in a company this size so that such co-ordination is efficient.' The lack of co-ordination caused delays in drilling, pushing up Pemex's costs. So convinced is the company of the benefits of contracting out that Mr Marcos claims it is now ahead of most international oil companies in the proportion of drilling work it gives out on a turn-key basis. Pemex will continue to drill a few of its own wells, he says, but only to keep abreast of technological developments. The main limit on such contract work is Pemex's own budget rather than lack of oil to be taken out. The Sound of Campeche is rich in oil, producing 1.9m barrels a day of Mexico total of 2.67m b/d last year. Its extraction costs are among the lowest in the world, and were there were more funds, further investment in exploration and drilling would be justified, says Mr Marcos. But although the government tells Pemex to operate as a commercial company, it sets its budget according to political criteria. The company is under instructions to meet growing demand for oil and maintain exports at current levels of about 1.37m b/d, rather than to maximise profits.</p>

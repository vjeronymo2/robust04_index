			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Survey of Dutch Banking and Investment (3): Concept fosters cross-selling of financial services - Dutch financiers' enthusiasm for 'bancassurance' trend AT home, Dutch financial institutions are fervent followers of the trend towards 'bancassurance' - the combining of banking and insurance operations in one financial services group in order to foster cross-selling of banking and insurance products. Now, having taken the 'bancassurance' concept further than most European competitors, the Dutch are slowly branching out, with varying degrees of success, into other parts of the continent and beyond. The export of Dutch-style bancassurance marks the second phase of the Netherlands' embrace of integrated financial services. The first step came in 1990 when the government lifted an informal ban on mergers between insurers and banks. This freedom was quickly seized upon by several leading players to create three main domestic bancassurance, or 'Allfinanz,' groups: Internationale Nederlanden Group (ING); Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch banking and insurance group; and Rabobank, the big Dutch co-operative bank, and its insurance subsidiary Interpolis. Of the three, Rabobank is the only one which has yet to take its bancassurance concept to other markets. In recent years it has concluded a string of partnerships with banks in Spain, France, the UK, Italy, Germany and Austria, but these ties are focused on traditional banking activities, mainly helping each others' clients on their respective home markets. The bank is planning to look into applying bancassurance to other markets than the Netherlands, but no conclusions have yet been drawn. ING - the product of a merger in 1991 between Nationale-Nederlanden, the Netherlands' largest insurer, and NMB Postbank, the country's third-largest bank - has so far managed to 'export' bancassurance to Italy, the first country outside the Netherlands where it operates as a fully integrated financial services company. The vehicle for ING's bancassurance approach in Italy is Sviluppo, a Milan-based financial group in which the Dutch company has gradually built up a 100 per cent stake. Sviluppo, which was already active in areas like securities brokerage and investment funds, mainly through its 650 financial advisers, now also sells Nationale-Nederlanden life insurance and pension products. ING's hopes of creating a second 'home market' for bancassurance in Belgium were dashed, at least for the time being, when it decided against launching a bid for Bank Brussel Lambert (BBL), Belgium's second-largest bank, in late 1992. BBL has since said it wants to develop bancassurance in co-operation with two of its institutional shareholders, Royale Belge and Winterthur. ING, which has a 10 per cent stake of its own in BBL, has not ruled out some sort of pact with BBL in the future. Meanwhile, ING continues to search for what it describes as a second 'home market' in Europe. Elsewhere, it has opened an insurance desk at its Hong Kong banking operation and it is looking at insurance and pension opportunities in South America, where it has extensive banking operations. Fortis, jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, already has two home markets, and it has applied bancassurance practices successfully on both. The Dutch-Belgian group's position in Belgium may soon be strengthened if it succeeds in negotiating the takeover of a significant stake in the government-owned Belgian savings bank group ASLK-CGER as part of the country's privatisation programme. ASLK-CGER, which already sells insurance products through its banking network, has granted Fortis exclusive negotiating rights until October 15. If no deal is reached, the Belgian bank may turn to another suitor, but both sides have said they will do their best to reach an agreement. By taking a large stake in ASLK-CGER, Fortis would not only be extending the reach of its bancassurance operations in Belgium but it would also be gaining a new distribution canal. AG, Fortis' Belgian shareholder, sells its insurance policies mainly through independent agents rather than through bank offices like ASLK-CGER. Besides Belgium, Fortis has also made bancassurance inroads in Spain through a joint venture with the country's largest savings bank, La Caixa. The 50-50 venture owns large stakes in the bank's life and non-life insurance operations, making Spain the fourth most important market for Fortis after the Netherlands, Belgium and the US.</p>

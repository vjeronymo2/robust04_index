			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VINCENT: STEINBRENNER SUIT 'IMBECILIC'  </P> <P> Fay Vincent said Monday the filing of a lawsuit by George Steinbrenner's  attorney challenging the transcript of testimony before the commissioner was an  "imbecilic act."  </P> <P> The suit was filed last week against the firm that handled the transcript of  Steinbrenner's hearing.  </P> <P> It contends the testimony was changed to make Steinbrenner look bad.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner accepted the commissioner's findings that his dealings with  gambler Howard Spira were not in the best interests of baseball, yielded daily  control of the Yankees and signed an agreement preventing him from suing the  commissioner's office.  </P> <P> "I think (the suit) is an imbecilic act which reflects enormous concern on his  part about an agreement he signed," Vincent said. "He obviously doesn't like  the agreement, and he is desperate to find ways of attacking it. He said in an  agreement he would accept the findings, he would not attack it. And it's  disturbing he's doing what he is doing."  </P></p>

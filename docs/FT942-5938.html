			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / People: Mercury Asset Management James Dawnay, a former head of Mercury Asset Management's unit trust operations, is starting to put his stamp on the unit trust operations of Martin Currie, the Scottish fund manager that he joined a couple of years ago. Dawnay, 47, has taken over as chairman of Martin Currie Unit Trusts, replacing Michael Kennedy, 58, the chairman and chief executive of the privately-owned Martin Currie group. Kennedy remains on the unit trust company board but is starting to hand over some of his responsibilities as he approaches retirement. Sandy Dudgeon, 37, amateur jockey and former deputy managing director of Adam &amp; Co, the Edinburgh private bank, has been brought in to replace Alan Maidment, 58, who retires as managing director of Martin Currie's unit trust business in September. George Tsergas, 48, who joined Martin Currie last year after nine years with the Fidelity fund management group, has been appointed sales director. Since Dawnay arrived at Martin Currie, which has Pounds 4bn under management, he has been involved in building up the group's overseas institutional business. He now intends to devote more time to its unit trust business which has doubled in size over the past couple of years, to Pounds 430m. Dawnay says it is still too small and hopes to double its size again in three years.</p>

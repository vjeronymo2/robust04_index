			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather worries spark surge in US grain prices GRAIN FUTURES prices shot up in Chicago yesterday as concerns about weather gripped traders. In late morning trading at the Chicago Board of Trade the July contract, the spot month, for soyabeans jumped 17 cents to Dollars 6.31 a bushel, wheat climbed 8.5 cents to Dollars 3.58 and maize rose 4.5 cents to Dollars 2.64. 'It's pure weather,' said Mr Steve Bruce, grains analyst for the big Chicago trading house of Geldermann. 'They're not going up on nearby demand, it's going up on concern about the crop. The trade is very weather sensitive.' Differing weather patterns in the midwest's and south-western growing states were affecting crops in various manners. But the overall effects appeared negative for crop harvests and growing conditions. Heavy rains were pounding certain Plains states, such as Oklahoma, where it was believed that harvests of soft red winter wheat could have suffered damage. Spurring further concern in the wheat market, the Kansas Farm Bureau reduced its estimate of the 1992 wheat crop by 20m bushels because of last week's frost damage. Meanwhile, in the northern Midwest, particularly in Illinois, persistent dryness was touching off worries that there would be damage to the newly planted crops of soyabeans and maize. The National Weather Service and other long-term forecasters have been predicting hot, dry weather for June and July. Illinois has already recorded its driest May on record. The weight of the weather forecasting has sent large commodities funds into the grain pits to buy, speculating that prices are likely to rise further. The spate of fund buying 'has fuelled the fire' on prices, said Mr Bruce.</p>

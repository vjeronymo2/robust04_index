			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 31, IRNA -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman on Thursday rejected claims by Armenian officials that  Iran had commented on the reasons behind the March 17 crash of  the Iranian aircraft in Karabakh region before a team of experts  finished its probe into the issue.    The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, termed as "untrue" the  claim  raised by a spokesman of the Armenian president on Wednesday  that Iran had made its comments on the crash even before the  completion of the investigation by a team of Iranian experts.  Based on the report filed by the fact-finding team of experts,  the Iranian Foreign Ministry issued its statement last Monday,  saying Armenian troops in Karabakh had missiled down the Iranian  aircraft killing all 32 passengers and crew members aboard.  Mohammadi said that at present some details relevant to minor  aspects of the crash were being followed up.    Over the past two days, the ISLAMIC REPUBLIC NEWS AGENCY has  contacted Armenian officials in Yerevan and Armenian diplomats  in Tehran to inquire about their views on the statement of the  Iranian Foreign Ministry concerning the crash but none of them  have yet made any formal comment on the issue.    The C-130 which was bound to Tehran from Moscow with  families  of Iranian diplomats on board exploded in mid air and crashed in  Armenian held Karabakh moments after it contacted the Yerevan  control tower at 19:10 hours GMT.</p>

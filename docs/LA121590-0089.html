			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS TRADE VIZCAINO TO CUBS FOR TOP PROSPECT  </P> <P> The Dodgers may have filled their hole at second base Friday by acquiring top  prospect Greg Smith from the Chicago Cubs for former prospect Jose Vizcaino.  </P> <P> Smith, 23, has played in only 22 major league games over six professional  seasons.  </P> <P> But scouts and several opposing managers who inquired about him this winter  agreed that if it had not been for Ryne Sandberg, he would have been a  full-time starter.  </P> <P> "This is a guy who can be our everyday second baseman," said Fred Claire,  Dodger vice president.  </P> <P> Smith's acquisition could mean the Dodgers believe that free agent Juan Samuel  will not accept their one-year contract offer, a decision he must make by Dec.  19. If Samuel does not accept, Smith will compete for the job with Lenny Harris  and Mike Sharperson.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-11 Smith is a former second-round draft pick who batted .291 in 105  games for triple-A Iowa last season and .296 for double-A Charlotte in 1989.  </P> <P> In 18 big league games last season, the switch-hitter batted .205, giving him a  career .224 average with no home runs and seven runs batted in.  </P> <P> "He is hard-nosed, he is a battler, he runs well . . . Everybody we talk to  likes him a lot," Claire said.  </P> <P> They used to say those things about Vizcaino, 22, who has been with the Dodgers  since signing in 1987. He and Jose Offerman were once projected as the  double-play combination of the future.  </P> <P> But despite a .275 average in 37 games last season, Vizcaino did not impress  Dodger officials with his hitting. Despite his speed, he has just two  extra-base hits in 61 major league at-bats.  </P></p>

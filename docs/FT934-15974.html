			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE share indices changes THE FOLLOWING notice was issued yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices steering committee: The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices steering committee has met to consider the issue of the eligibility of the SmithKline Beecham units, new Rothmans units and Vendome units in the indices following the proposal to change the rules defining a UK company. The committee has decided, pending a review, to make no changes. SmithKline Beecham A shares and units will remain unaffected and, upon the restructuring of Rothmans International and Dunhill, the new Rothmans and Vendome units will not be admitted to the indices. The steering committee felt that defining a UK company for index purposes was a complex issue and reaffirmed its commitment to three important guiding principles, namely: Integrity of the indices as a benchmark of the performance of UK companies. Objective and equitable treatment of all constituents. Continuity and stability of index constituents. In light of the complexity of the issues involved and the impending ruling on foreign income dividends anticipated in the November budget, the steering committee decided not to make changes to the rules governing the indices at this time but to conduct a further review to assess the nationality qualifications for membership of the UK indices and to examine the problems posed by complex cross-border capital structures. In the meantime the committee agreed to make no changes to the rules. SmithKline Beecham units will remain in the indices as will the SmithKline Beecham A shares which are unaffected by this issue. Because Rothmans International's capital structure is undergoing significant change, Rothmans International will no longer exist as a corporate entity from October 25 and will, therefore, leave the indices on its restructuring on October 22. It has been decided that neither new Rothmans units nor Vendome units will be admitted to the indices at that time.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subsides after inflation data gains Wall Street AFTER POSTING big early gains on promising inflation news, US share prices fell back amid growing concern about the outlook for the economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13.29 at 3,505.01, some 10 points off its session peak. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.63 higher at 447.01, while the Amex composite finished down 1.40 at 434.32, and the Nasdaq composite up 5.14 at 693.19. Trading volume on the NYSE was 255m shares. The release of the May producer prices index brought relief to those in the markets worried that rising inflation would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The PPI came in flat last month, and the 'core' measure (excluding the volatile food and energy components) was up by only 0.2 per cent. The figures will relieve the pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy as a precautionary measure against inflation. They lifted both stock and bond prices. The Dow gained 25 points in the opening 30 minutes, while the benchmark 30-year government bond rose three quarters of a point, lowering the yield to 6.81 per cent. The gains, however, were not sustained. The bad news about yesterday's data was that the low inflation figures confirmed that the economy is currently too weak to support the price increases that were seen at the start of the year. The release yesterday of a disappointing May retail sales report - sales rose by only 0.1 per cent last month - was further evidence that domestic demand remains subdued. As a result share prices eased off their early highs, although bond prices remained firm, and the 30-year yield fell further to under 6.8 per cent. The jury is still not out on inflation, however, because the May consumer prices figures have yet to be released. They are due on Tuesday. Bank stocks were helped by the reduced threat of a rise in interest rates. BankAmerica added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 43 3/4 , Banc One rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 1/8 , Chemical put on Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 38 1/2 , Citicorp firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 27 1/2 , and Wells Fargo climbed Dollars 4 to Dollars 103. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which fell sharply on Thursday following a profits warning from the company's management, rebounded, gaining Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 . Affiliated Publications, which owns the Boston Globe, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 5/8 in volume of 1.3m shares after the New York Times confirmed that it plans to buy Affiliated for Dollars 1.1bn in cash and stock. On the American Stock Exchange, New York Times shares fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 24 3/8 in busy trading. Canada TORONTO prices ended mixed in moderate trading. According to preliminary figures, the TSE-300 composite index fell 8.95 points, or 0.23 per cent, to end at 3,866.49. Over the week,the index lost about 28 points. Winning issues led losers by 368 to 317, volume of 57.28m shares compared with 59.65m and trading value was CDollars 559.8m compared with CDollars 598.4m. Gold shares fell 2.15 per cent on index.</p>

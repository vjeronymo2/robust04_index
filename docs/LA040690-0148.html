			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SHERIFF CANDIDATE VOWS ETHICS UNIT  </P> <P> Fullerton City Councilman Don Bankhead, who is challenging Orange County  Sheriff Brad Gates in the June election, kicked off his campaign Thursday by  promising to "bring integrity back" to the county's highest law enforcement  post.  </P> <P> In a brief speech to about 75 people, the retired Fullerton police captain  capitalized on civil rights lawsuits filed against Gates and said that, if  elected, he would establish an ethics unit and make such lawsuits unnecessary.  </P> <P> "We'll put the shine back on the badge and we'll all have a good clean  Sheriff's Department," Bankhead said. "If no one's rights are violated, we  won't get sued."  </P> <P> Bankhead, 57, challenged Gates to justify spending nearly $1 million in  taxpayers' dollars to settle two civil rights lawsuits filed against him and to  explain why some of the terms of the settlements were sealed until after the  March election filing deadline.  </P> <P> The county recently agreed to pay $475,000 to settle two lawsuits filed by  Preston Guillory, a private investigator and former political opponent of  Gates. But the total cost in payouts and attorney fees has been about $1  million for the county.  </P> <P> The county also paid $375,000 in 1987 to settle a lawsuit by Orange County  Municipal Judge Bobby Youngblood, an outspoken opponent of Gates and one-time  sheriff's candidate. All three lawsuits contended that Gates used the  department to investigate his political enemies and hurt his opponents.  </P> <P> George Wright, a Rancho Santiago College instructor and longtime Gates critic  who shared part of a recent lawsuit settlement, told the gathering in Fullerton  that it is time for a new sheriff.  </P> <P> "The good people of this county are going to have stand up and say it's time to  change things, time to get an honest person in there who can distinguish  between politics and law enforcement," Wright said.  </P> <P> Nick Novick, a retired deputy district attorney who headed the district  attorney's Laguna Niguel office, said Gates frequently exerts pressure on the  district attorney to file charges he wants to see filed and to withhold those  that he does not.

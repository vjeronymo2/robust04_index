			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["XINHUA Forum" by Yang Genglai (2799 6342 0171): "A </F> Multitude of Measures Is Needed To Curb Inflation"]    [Text] The vast number of people in Jiangsu are pleased  that the margin of commodity price hikes in the province has  dropped since March. However, having experienced the hardship  of steep hikes in grain and vegetable prices last year, many  people still harbor a lingering fear. They are particularly  concerned about grain and vegetable prices, and have called on  the government to hold down the prices of the "grain bag" and  "vegetable basket" at all costs!    Unquestionably, if the prices of goods and clothing increase  a little, we can buy less or refuse to buy them. However, food  is a necessity which we must purchase daily. When grain and  vegetable prices increase excessively, it will of course have a  strong impact, and immediately affect the people and aggravate  the hardships of low-income families. However, we have taken  the task too lightly if we believe we can control commodity  prices as well as grain and vegetable prices by applying the  sole "commodity price control" measure.    For example, grains are primary products and raw materials  for the food processing industry. However, for farmers, grains  are terminal products as well. Grain prices are affected by  demand, moreover, they are factors that finally determine  capital investment in agriculture. When capital increases  following the hike in prices of chemical fertilizers, farm  chemicals, and machinery, controlling only grain prices and not  the prices of capital goods is obviously unfair because it will  harm peasants' benefits. No wonder that as the busy farming  season approaches, farmers are making this urgent call: "Like  holding down grain prices last year, the country must adopt  strong measures to control price hikes for capital goods."  However, chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals are also  terminal products of capital goods manufacturing enterprises.  When prices of capital goods are low, manufacturing enterprises  naturally ask for preferential prices for the supply of oil,  water, power, and coal. Subsequently, a chain reaction that also  affects other prices will be created.    It is evident that prices of grains and other commodities  are  linked to and affect each other. As a fundamental commodity,  the fluctuations of grain prices will affect other prices.  However, when other prices fluctuate, grain prices cannot help  but fluctuate. For example, exceeding our financial capability  by expanding and embarking on too many projects will not help to  control grain prices. On the contrary, the action will  precisely become the driving force for hiking grain and  commodity prices. According to a report by RENMIN RIBAO, the  total fixed asset investment in 1993 was 1182.9 billion yuan, a  sharp rise of 50 percent over that of the previous year. A  piece of stone will create a thousand layers of waves. The  first wave created was a steep hike of 38.2 percent in capital  goods prices; the second wave spurred a 24-percent increase in  industrial goods prices; and the third wave caused a 13-percent  increase in consumer goods retail prices. Further, subsequent  effects became factors for continued inflation, making the trend  of this year's commodity prices not too optimistic. As they are  a part of the commodity price chain, how could grain and  vegetable prices not be affected?    Since price hikes are due to many factors, a multitude of  measures should be taken to stabilize commodity prices. The  inflation problem should be tackled by looking into both its  root cause and symptoms, and a multitude of -- instead of  singular -- measures should be adopted. If we do not wish to  see outlandish increases in the prices of the "grain bag" and  "vegetable basket," we should urgently call for a halt to  embarking on an excessive number of projects, excessive  spending, neglecting the role of agriculture as the foundation  of the national economy, and rampant spread of shocking  profiteering in the market. First, the size of capital  construction planned for this year should generally be the same  as last year. It is necessary to strictly control galloping  expansion, and prevent a tight supply-demand situation that will  become a motive force causing price hikes. Second, we should  not use bank overdrafts to cover financial deficits, but should  raise funds by issuing government bonds to prevent money  depreciation due to deficits. Third, we should attach great  importance to agriculture and the "vegetable basket" project.  We should increase investment in the project by adopting  appropriate comprehensive measures that will raise grain  purchase prices. We should strive to arouse peasants'  enthusiasm, stabilize grain and vegetable production, increase  supply, and maintain the supply-demand balance. Fourth, we  should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and  monitor the prices of 20 essential commodities that concern the  people's livelihood, including the "grain bag," "vegetable  basket," and "stove." We should standardize pricing to bring  the margin of price hikes within the limits consumers can  afford. We should undertake various measures to curb the  excessive growth in demand, regulate the supply-demand  situation, and hold down commodity prices.    To obtain desired results in implementing a multitude of  measures for curbing inflation and stabilizing prices, it is  necessary for all sides in society to enhance the concept of  giving due consideration to the overall situation,  conscientiously submit to macroeconomic regulation and control,  gradually implement every measure, and expend vigorous efforts  to solve each practical problems. We can then realistically  curb the rampant growth of various factors that cause inflation,  and succeed in ensuring basically stable prices for the "grain  bag" and "vegetable basket" without extra efforts.</p>

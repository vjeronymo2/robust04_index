			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, June 13 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Ambassador  to the United Nations Madeleine Albright said Monday the first  draft resolution calling for U.N. sanctions against North Korea  might be circulated within 24 hours.    Commenting on North Korea's announcement that it would quit  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Albright said  that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the agency, if it were true,  would be a serious problem and would make the situation worse.    Meanwhile, representatives of the 10 non-permanent members  of  the U.N. Security Council had separate meetings with the South  Korean and Japanese ambassadors here Monday to exchange views on  sanctions against Pyongyang.    South Korean Ambassador Yu Chong-ha said, "Judging from  North  Korea's attitude at this juncture of the scheduled third round  of high-level talks between the United States and North Korea,  Pyongyang seems determined to develop nuclear weapons." He then  called on the Security Council to adopt sanctions to stop the  North's suspected nuclear weapons program.    The council's non-standing members are to meet with North  Korea's U.N. Ambassador Pak Kil-yon Tuesday on similar matters.    The Security Council is expected to hold a closed meeting  Tuesday to continue discussion of the North Korean nuclear issue  including its withdrawal from the IAEA.    The United States has almost completed a draft resolution  calling for the step-by-step imposition of sanctions. Upon  approval by President Bill Clinton, the draft will be circulated  within the Security Council after Korea-U.S. consultations.    The draft resolution could be distributed to the council as  early as Tuesday, but other U.N. sources predicted it would be  determined after former U.S. President Jimmy Carter returns from  Pyongyang.</p>

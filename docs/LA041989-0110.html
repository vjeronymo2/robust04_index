			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> THOBE'S BEST OUTING OF THE SEASON LEADS EDISON PAST MARINA  </P> <P> J.J. Thobe pitched a four-hitter and hit three singles to lead Edison High  School to a 3-2 victory over Marina in a Sunset League baseball game Tuesday at  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Both runs off Thobe (3-2) were unearned and came in the fifth inning when  Edison committed three errors. An inning earlier, Thobe lost a no-hit bid when  Marina's Robin Lindsey smashed a liner off the glove of Edison third baseman  Jeff Daniel. Thobe had retired 11 consecutive batters to open the game.  </P> <P> Edison (7-8-1, 4-4) scored in the third, fourth and fifth innings with Thobe  scoring one run and driving in another.  </P> <P> Edison lost two one-run games last week and appeared too far behind Fountain  Valley (12-4, 7-1) to contend for the league title. But Thobe's performance  against a good hitting team gave Edison Coach Paul Harrell hope.  </P> <P> "That was shades of last year when J.J. dominated people in this league,"  Harrell said. "We sure needed it. That's the best he's pitched this season."  </P> <P> Marty Osborne's single to center scored both of Marina's runs in the fifth, but  Thobe retired six of the next seven batters he faced and struck out three of  the last five batters he faced to end the game.  </P> <P> In other Sunset League games:  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 8, Ocean View 7 -- Jason Brissey hit a two-run homer in the  bottom of the seventh to give the Oilers (7-11, 3-5) the victory at Huntington  Beach. Ocean View scored five runs in the first inning. Gary Christopherson had  a two-run double and Mike Burns a two-run single for the Seahawks (4-4 in  league play). Brian Wright had a bases-loaded triple in the second inning for  Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Westminster 4, Fountain Valley 2 -- Jim Slagle had three hits, including a solo  home run, and two RBIs for the Lions (12-6-1, 4-4) at Westminster. Brett Grebe  (5-2) allowed eight hits and struck out eight for the victory. Mark Dodd had a  solo home run for Fountain Valley (6-2 in league play).  </P> <P> In the Academy League:  </P> <P> Liberty Christian 23, Newport Christian 0 (5 innings) -- Chris Buckels pitched  a two-hitter and struck out eight for visiting Liberty Christian. He batted in  three runs with a single, a double and a two-run homer. Buckels has struck out  67 batters in 32 innings. John O'Conner had four hits and four RBIs, and  Richard Beyikian added three RBIs on three hits for Liberty Christian (13-2,  3-0). Newport Christian is 1-5, 0-3.  </P> <P> In the Century League:  </P> <P> Foothill 17, Santa Ana Valley 1 -- Host Foothill had 18 hits in breezing past  Santa Ana Valley.

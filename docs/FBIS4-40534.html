			<p>BFN     [Text] Bishkek, 16 Jun -- "The som has strengthened its  position," said Prime Minister Abbas Dzhumagulov in an interview  with a KYRGYZKABAR correspondent. "Judge for yourself. The  inflation rate in February this year was 16.9 percent and in  June, 3.5 percent. The national currency has also stabilized.  One dollar now costs not 12.35 soms as in February, but 11.4.  In March-April, production became more brisk and the tendency  could have been maintained had inflation slowed down, but [word  indistinct] on all kinds of industrial goods over a month has  decreased by 28 percent. All of the national economy's  indicators have deteriorated. To improve the situation, we need  investors from outside, and we are looking for them. I recently  met Salem Ehasesom [name as received], the representative of the  World Bank. The topic under discussion was attracting  investments to the mining industry. We have been told that the  World Bank is looking for the funds to carry out a tender so as  to finance geological surveys in this area. The problems are  expected to be settled during a meeting in June in the U.S. city  of Houston. We know that the donor countries, such as Norway,  will render us consultative services not only for surveying oil  fields, but also in elaborating the law on the use of nature.    "The Government of Kyrgyzstan is eager to render any kind of  support to foreign entrepreneurs in surveying and developing gas  and oil fields.    "The issue of investments will be the main topic on the  agenda of the second meeting of the Japan-Kyrgyzstan economic  commission, which is due to take place in November. I have the  honor of being the chairman of this commission. We have  prepared a number of projects for joint ventures with Japan in  the food industry, for example, in the production of rice, baby  food, silk, leather, and also in the mining industry. We should  invigorate prospecting for oil and gas. Kyrgyzstan will give an  advantage to those companies who have experience in developing  oil and gas fields. He also said [as received] that in the near  future we intend to open a free economic zone centered in  Tokmak, near the capital.    "We can only add here that over one month, the money income  of the population has decreased by 3 percent and spendings and  savings have increased by 12.9 percent. In reality,  accumulations have been minimal. In January-May, the savings  bank of the Republic has attracted 5-percent less in savings  than during the same period last year.    "There has also been a slowdown in business activities. For  example, a number of commodity and raw materials exchanges has  decreased twofold. More than 60 percent of their turnover comes  from the machine-building industry, diesel fuel, and timber.    "In a nutshell, inflation has been brought to a minimum, but  we have not yet started the structural transformations in  industry. The Republic is awaiting a large Western credit, but  it has not created conditions for invigorating investment  activity."</p>

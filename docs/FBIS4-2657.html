			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yu Haisheng (0060 3189 3932)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier and Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen met with a delegation from the U.S. Center  for Strategic and International Studies [CSIS] led by former  U.S. Secretary of Defense Brown. The meeting took place this  afternoon at Ziguang Pavilion in Zhongnanhai. The host and his  guests exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and other  international issues of common concern.    Qian Qichen stated: The 20th century, which will soon be  over, has witnessed two world wars and many regional conflicts.  In the coming century, China hopes to see a diversified world  with equality among all nations, and without hot or cold wars.    Qian Qichen pointed out: The relationship between China and  the United States, though containing some twists and turns as  well as contradictions, is not a relationship of confrontation.  There is no conflict of fundamental interests between the two  countries, and they should constantly promote cooperative  relations in every field.    Brown said his current China tour is aimed at seeing old  acquaintances and making new friends, as well as exchanging  ideas with Chinese scholars and officials on a wide range of  issues. He hoped the exchange will be helpful in resolving  problems in bilateral relations.    The U.S. guests are visiting China at the invitation of  China's Center for International Studies.</p>

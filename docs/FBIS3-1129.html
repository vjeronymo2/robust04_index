			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The South African Police have arrested 2 more  suspects on attempted murder charges after part of an  investigation into German links with South African right-wing  radicals.    One of the two Germans arrested at a smallholding near  Pretoria is also linked to sabotage activities in Namibia. They  were found to be in possession of firearms. The arrest follows  a shootout between two police constables and three German  nationals east of Pretoria last week. One German was shot dead  during the encounter and one arrested. Another escaped.  Several firearms, including a Scorpion machine pistol, was  found in their car. This led to an investigation into their  presence in South Africa and their contact with right-wing  figures in Pretoria.    A report also alluded to preeminent South African  politicians  having been identified for assassination.</p>

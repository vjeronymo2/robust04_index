			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Observer: Filling up Meanwhile, it's nice to know that at least some of the 300-plus bankers assembling in Toronto today to hear Olympia &amp; York's debt-restructuring plans will be making a special contribution towards keeping the financially-strapped developer on an even keel. They are the ones who have elected to stay at the Camberley Club, a posh but little-known hotel in the heart of the city's financial district. The 52-room Camberley occupies the 28th and 29th floors of the 68-storey Scotia Plaza tower. O&amp;Y owns Scotia Plaza and, not surprisingly, books many of its out-of-town guests into the Camberley. The hotel returns the favour. Its usual room rate is CDollars 210 a night. Corporate clients get a special rate of CDollars 170, but the best deal is offered to tenants of O&amp;Y buildings, who pay just CDollars 120. Bankers expecting to return to Toronto in coming months as the debt-restructuring talks drag on will be pleased to hear that the Camberley is happy to offer its ultra-low Reichmann rate to them as well.</p>

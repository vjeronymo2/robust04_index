			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, June 14 (TURAN) -- Azerbaijan's Prime  Minister, Suret Guseynov, issued a protest against Judge Shahin  Rustamov, who is presiding over the trial on the case of June  events of 1993.    The Premier sent the letter to the Judicial Collegiate,  which  is examinining the crimes committed in the city of Ganja on June  4, 1993, with a request to remove Shahin Rustamov, as concerned  person, from his duties.    Suret Guseynov, who is testifying as a witness to the Ganja  events, said that Rustamov was appointed Chairman of the  Judicial Collegiate of Azerbaijan's Supreme Court by the former  Chairman of the Parliament, Isa Gambar [Kamberov] who is himself  presently on trial. Suret Guseynov also states that Shahin  Rustamov was appointed to this office as an active leader of the  PFA [People's Front of Azerbaijan].    Shahin Rustamov was himself involved in the process because  following the June events he was stripped of his duties as  Chairman of the Judicial Collegiate of the Supreme Court.    The trial concerning the Ganja events began on April 29 and  has since been developing in an unfavorable direction.    As was earlier reported, on June 4, 1993 an armed conflict  arose between the motor-infantry brigade headed by Suret  Guseynov and govermental troops under the President Elchibey.    This accident inflicted a defeat on the Popular [People's]  Front of Azerabijan.</p>

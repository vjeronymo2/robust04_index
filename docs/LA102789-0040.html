			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'HAD TO BE YOU' LOSES ITS WAY  </P> <P> In their play "It Had to Be You," Renee Taylor and Joseph Bologna offered a  perfectly pleasant evening in the theater and enjoyed a long local run with it,  but in bringing it to the screen, they've met with disaster. Never as strong as  their durably hilarious 1971 "Made for Each Other," of which it is a variation,  "It Had to Be You" citywide)just lies there and dies, an embarrassment.  </P> <P> Taylor casts herself as Theda Blau, a flashy, neurotic, garrulous, fad-ridden,  no-talent, aging starlet who manages, through tortuous twists of fate, to trap  Bologna's Vito Pignoli, an eligible, successful (but sour) advertising  executive in her East Village flat on Christmas Eve. Theda is one of those  obnoxious types who are supposed to be adorably irresistible underneath their  desperation.  </P> <P> But Theda is such a bore, such a dated, stereotyped self-demeaning kook, and so  relentlessly grating that it defies credibility that Vito should fall for her,  even if eventually he does get to see her in a new light.  </P> <P> "It Had to Be You" might just have slid by had its writer/stars not also  attempted to direct as well. Throughout, there's the feeling that they've given  each other permission to let it all out. The effect is to make the film play  like a miscalculated vanity production.  </P> <P> Taylor and Bologna are too experienced to have indulged themselves as they so  clearly have in "It Had to Be You" (rated R for mildly adult situations). Its  only genuinely funny moment is a cameo by the wonderfully eccentric William  Hickey as Theda's ancient agent who no sooner tells her he is going to make her  a star or die trying, than he drops dead.  </P> <P> 'IT HAD TO BE YOU'  </P> <P> A Frank B. Tolin, Herve S. Tolin &amp; Ronald B. Fenster presentation of a Tom  Yanez/Richard G. Abramson production. Writers-directors Renee Taylor, Joseph  Bologna. Camera Bart Lau. Music Charles Fox.

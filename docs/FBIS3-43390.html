These  nominations have now been made available to all the regions.    It must, however, be pointed out that the lists of  nominations that have been sent to the regions are only  provisional. All of those who have been nominated have not yet  been informed, many of them may still decide not to stand, or  may opt to keep their positions in their respective  organisations or apply for positions in the civil service.  Provincial conferences to consolidate the nominations of the 14  regions will be held over the forthcoming weekend of the 8th and  9th of January. A national list conference to finalise all the  lists will be held on the 15th of January. The National  Executive Committee of the ANC will publicly announce the final  lists on Tuesday 18th January.</p>

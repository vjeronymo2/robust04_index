			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / BCCI creditors get details of deal The creditors' committee to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International is expected to meet the liquidators at the end of next week to give its verdict on a proposed new agreement with the government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder. Representatives met the liquidators from accountants Touche Ross to learn for the first time details of the agreement which was reached in the past few days. The settlement would include a payment of about Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) from Abu Dhabi and a restructuring of its claims against BCCI in exchange for agreement by the liquidators not to be sued. The agreement had to be renegotiated following a surprise rejection of the original by the Luxembourg appeals court in October.</p>

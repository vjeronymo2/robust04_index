			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (23): The market's burdens - Profile: Dalian Machine Tool Works THE DALIAN Machine Tool Works, maker of lathes, boring machines and other important if unglamorous equipment, is the type of factory in which China's legendary model workers were supposed to have toiled ceaselessly and selflessly for the sake of the proletariat. Mr Zhou Kui, the factory's director and Communist party secretary, now finds himself at the centre of a sensitive debate over the reform of state industry and the rights of workers to leave the state sector and take their skills to collectively-run or private companies. Over the past year, the machine tool factory has lost 71 of its employees, many of them managers and senior engineers, to a small company, Bohai Machinery Plant, established late last year on the fringe of Dalian, a northern port. The case has received national coverage, with the departing workers asserting that 'if you want to have a market economy, competition is inevitable.' However, Mr Zhou complained in a state newspaper that 'they are digging at our wall publicly' and 'some of our departments are half-closed'. The remarks prompted letters from factory managers who either agreed with Mr Zhou or thought that he had to accept the defections as part of managing a factory in modern China. But the replies also highlighted the welfare burden faced by large state-owned factories, which run kindergartens, provide housing and bear most of the costs of keeping retired workers and their families. A tractor factory manager wrote to the Economic Daily complaining that his company had 40,000 workers, 100,000 relatives and 20,000 retirees, and 'we have to take care of everything - how they eat, drink, and sleep.' His complaint was that this burden left the factory at a disadvantage in the domestic and international markets. HAVING been surrounded by political controversy, Mr Zhou is now careful in his choice of words. He began talking about the resignations by emphasising that he and the Dalian Machine Tool Works are committed to economic reform, and that the factory has imported new machinery in the state-approved quest for quality. But he also makes clear that the factory has a long and honourable history of serving the state, which he thinks should count for something even in the middle of reform: 'We have won many awards for our products since our founding in 1948. We have contributed to the growth of China's industry.' Mr Zhou did not directly criticise the senior staff who resigned, and made a point of mentioning that the exchange of talents was a natural result of the market economy, which suggests that he has been doing his duty as party secretary by taking note of the pro-reform editorials in the People's Daily. However, he thinks that the exchange should be gradual, and not be allowed to damage state-owned companies, which do not have the flexibility enjoyed by their smaller competitors: 'We are trying to make the transition to the market, but it is not easy because we have been part of a planned economy for a long time, and must deal with overstaffing and other difficult issues.' Mr Zhou is unable, for example, to dismiss a few hundred of the factory's 6,500 workers without government approval and without the danger of impoverishing those employees, as Beijing has yet to put a social safety net in place. He sees these changes taking a long time, and implies that state-owned companies need assistance in the meantime. 'We still have some planning and regulations from the central government, and even in a developed market economy there should be some regulations. After the perfection of regulations, our development will become more orderly and reasonable,' he said. Mr Zhou is not the only factory head to think that reform has created disorder. The director of the Luoyang Copper Products Factory wrote that he experienced 'bitter and sour tastes' similar to those felt at the Dalian Machine Tool Works, and is unable to overhaul the factory, despite appreciating the need for change. 'Some people say that the state has invested a lot of money in our factory, and that we should be able to revitalise our operations. It's not that we don't want to do it or that we don't have ability. There is really nothing we can do. We are like a big elephant being eaten away by ants.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Grant Gukasov: "For Whom are Russians Kith and </F> Kin?"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] The Representative Assembly of the Russian-Speaking  Population was instituted a year ago in Estonia as the only  organization for non-citizens which has been officially  registered and is permanently functioning as a party to the  round table under the auspices of the President of the Estonian  Republic. Its leader, Nikolai Yurantsev, was interviewed by MN  correspondent in Baltic countries.    MN: Who are the Russians in Estonia? Are they splinters  of the empire? Or is it already a new community with its own  world views and interests?    N.Yu.: The Russians diaspora in Estonia consists  of many layers: it includes the old indigenous Russians from the  time of the Russian Empire, and the most numerous postwar  emigration wave, and two subsequent ones --dating back to the  mid-1960s and the early 1980s. No one doubts any longer that all  of us, the permanent inhabitants of Estonia -- Byelorussians,  Ukrainians, Russians, Koreans and Armenians are Russian-speaking  people --and we have been trying to unite on the principles of  an association of fellow-countrymen, language and  non-citizenship. The latter has been engendered by the political  partialities of national-radicals, become embodied in a number  of ER laws on the state language and on foreigners, and turned  into a veritable calamity for a third of Estonia's population.  We are already the Baltic Russians. Our association is more  necessary for the indigenous inhabitants who must understand  that living next to them are "their own Russians."    MN: Today the image of a Russian looks like that of a  rabid foe from the East whose only occupation was to oppress,  enslave and occupy...    N.Yu.: Forgetting that the West has perpetrated  more troubles here than the East. But the position of many  present-day Estonian politicians is this: all evil comes from  the East. Even the period of the war from 1941 to 1944 is being  repatterned to fit a simple and very clear theory of the main  enemy being nearby.    Life itself has repeatedly given the lie to this obstinately  imposed stereotype. From the very beginning of perestroika, the  "native" Russians have repeatedly demonstrated their loyalty to  the independent Estonian state. For instance, last year there  was a referendum in Narva and the question was formulated as  follows: "Are you for national-territorial autonomy as part of  the Estonian Republic?" The majority said "yes," but the result  was an attack on the part of governmental structures and the  non-recognition of the referendum's results. The situation was  fraught with power confrontation. But the "reds", as the  government called the Narva leadership, recognized the verdict  of the State Court on this referendum as being valid and final,  that is, their reaction to the "attack" was obedience to the  law. A similar referendum took place in Transdniestria,  whereupon a war broke out there. The result: Transdniestria  remained Transdniestria, and Moldova remained Moldova. Here,  however, the Leningrad highway was not blocked with  ferroconcrete slabs, as both sides displayed sense.    MN: Citizenship is the key problem today. The wisest  decision on this question has been taken by Lithuania. And not  because there are few Russians there or because they are  especially loved...    N.Yu.: Evidently because the politicians there  understand what a state is. And they do not put up countless  fences which they themselves will have to climb over, turning  their problems inside out before Europe. Europe's orientation is  clear and accurate: the peoples of the Baltics must  independently decide the problems of relationships with Russia.  In the wake of Lithuania, Latvia has defined its attitude on the  question of citizenship. And has found a common language with  Russia.    The 1988 Law on Citizenship in Estonia could have solved the  entire problem had it been carried into effect from the first  paragraph to the last. But it was tailoured with a simple  resolution on putting the law into effect, deleting the  paragraphs which did not suit the national-radicals. But to  Europe the law was shown as a whole. And Europe was delighted --  they had no such liberal laws. In accordance with this law,  permanent inhabitants, i.e., inhabitants with the permanent  Estonian domicile registration, who have lived here for more  than ten yeas, actually receive their citizenship in the zero  variant. The ruse of the national-radicals was that the  resolution introduced the countdown not from the actual time of  residence, but since 1990. A temporary residence permit is now  granted for a term of up to five years, and only coupled with a  passport does this document give one a right to stay in the  country. The term of the general civilian passport's validity  expires in July 1995. And one fine day you will get your  residence permit in the shape of an insert into the passport  with the loss of the latter's validity. And then you will be  able to live in Estonia on legal grounds for a mere 24 hours.    "There is need to fight for this residence permit" -- such  is  the meaning of the statement issued jointly by the  Representative Assembly and the Russian Community of Estonia.  Everyone must decide the problem radically for himself. If he  stays to live here, it means that he can follow two roads. The  most correct thing, we believe, is the acquisition of the  Estonian citizenship.    MN: How does Russia assist the Russians' integration in  an independent Estonia state?    N.Yu.: Let me answer bluntly to a blunt question:  in no way. Needless to say, any word uttered by Russia in  defence of the Russian diaspora carries weight. But today this  is no longer enough. Russia's policy towards Russians must be  normal protectionism which is widespread all over the world.  But, it seems, Russian protectionism extends solely to the  retired military servicemen, and this is a partial problem.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who worked at the  Union enterprises. Russia only singles out but a handful of  retired servicemen from among hundreds of thousands. This tends  to trigger these Russians' surprise and dislike for both retired  servicemen and for Russian politicians. Russia has never  formulated its policy in relation to Russians in the near abroad.    There are some fragmentary general declarations, but there  is  no tangible political line which is clear to everyone. In the  past few years we have witnessed many sanctions: economic and  political, as well as the President's formidable statements. And  all this, as a rule, boomeranged at the Russian-speaking  population and failed to reach its objective. Of the same nature  is the decision on raising custom tariffs beginning with March  15 of this year -- this again hits at the Russian-speaking  population.    During the past year we have had more understanding with the  West than with Russia, which can only be regretted. When a  crisis broke out in connection with the Law on Foreigners, five  ambassadors, accredited in Estonia from European Community  countries, undertook a political demarche as a result of which  this law was sent to the Council of Europe for an examination by  experts. Those were the ambassadors of Italy, France, Germany,  Denmark and Sweden. The Russian ambassador was not among them.    MN: Are you under the impression that Russia has been  sliding more and more towards power solutions already inside the  CIS?    N.Yu.: As I see it, democracy the Russian way must  be a rigid system ensuring the controllability of the whole  country, but this does not mean that its feet in high boots must  stick out in neighbouring countries.    The latest elections to the local self-management bodies in  Russia have demonstrated a system of anarchy. When, however, the  government of Estonia granted non-citizens the possibility to  elect to self-management bodies, the majority came to the  polling stations. At Tallinn's City Assembly there are 32  Russians among the 64 deputies. But electors first had to  register, then go to the polls. They came on both occasions in  contrast to people in Russia. The government made a little step  to meet them half-way, and it received a splash of loyalty.</p>

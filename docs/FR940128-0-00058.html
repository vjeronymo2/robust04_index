The following is an analysis of comments and changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM. Substantative issues are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical and other minor changes to the language published in the NPRM_and requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_may not be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 692.10&blank;How Does the Secretary Allot Funds to the States?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : Three commenters agreed with the revision in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;692.10(b) of the proposed regulations to redefine students who are ``deemed eligible'' to participate in the SSIG Program as students who were reported by the State as SSIG recipients in the most recently available performance report data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters objected to the use of State-reported SSIG recipients in the most recently available performance report data as students who are ``deemed eligible'' to participate in the SSIG Program. These commenters believed that the number of recipients could be easily manipulated by States by inflating the number of awards to students. Rather than provide substantial awards to the most needy students, States could inflate the number of students deemed eligible by providing smaller awards to a larger number of students in order to receive a larger share of program funding above the hold-harmless amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters believed that the current allotment formula for awarding SSIG funds above the hold-harmless amount should not be amended. These commenters felt that the current allotment formula based on the enrollment data for each State is more objective and meaningful in distributing funds for the SSIG Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters recommended that the allotment formula above the hold-harmless level should be based on the amount of funds actually expended by each State to match its Federal allotment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : The Secretary is amending the current allotment formula for awarding funds above the hold-harmless level because it does not conform to section 415B(a)(1) of the HEA. Section 415B(a)(1) was amended by the Higher Education Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;498), but the SSIG Program regulations were not amended to conform with this statutory change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is changing the allotment formula for funds above the hold-harmless level to one that counts, for purposes of making allotments to States, the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program as determined by the following formula. The Secretary divides the amount of each State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States in the most recent award year as reported by the State. The Secretary determines the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, the Secretary has provided extreme flexibility to States in implementing the SSIG Program statute. It is the Secretary's experience that mere head counts do not accurately reflect the participation of States in the joint Federal-State SSIG Program. Moreover, this change responds to the concerns raised by some commenters that States might manipulate a head-count of recipients and the concerns raised by other commenters that funding should be based on the actual matching expenditures of the States. Furthermore, the Secretary collects the Federal and State SSIG funding data and average grant award per student from each State's most recent SSIG Program performance report. By using the most recently available performance report data, the States will not be required to conduct a new data collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 415B(a)(1) of the program statute, this formula would be used only if an appropriation exceeds the fiscal year 1979 appropriation. Each State still receives at least its ``hold-harmless'' amount. The Secretary believes that by considering the amount of State SSIG expenditures in the calculation of the number of students ``deemed eligible,'' States are provided with incentive to increase the amount of funds they allocate to their SSIG Programs. In this way, States that provide more State dollars will receive more Federal SSIG funds above the ``hold-harmless'' amount, the allotment each State received in fiscal year 1979 under the SSIG Program. For States to exceed the allotment of funds beyond the ``hold harmless'' amount, States would have to elect to include more of their State grant funds under the SSIG Program in their calculation under &sect;692.10(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the change encourages the inclusion of additional State funds in the SSIG Program and, as a result, would stabilize the grant funds available to students from the States. The Secretary also believes that the revised formula provides for the best use of Federal funds under the program by: (1) Rewarding States that have made a strong commitment of their State grant funds to the SSIG Program as reflected by the States' amount of State grant funds; and (2) encouraging States to maintain or expand their commitment of their level of expenditures for State grant programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : A change has been made. The Secretary has amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;692.10(b) to provide that the Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of each State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most recently available data reported by each State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 692.21&blank;What Requirements Must Be Met by a State Program?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> : One commenter stated that the Secretary should clarify &sect;692.21(e) concerning whether fees may or may not be collected in the case of decentralized State grant programs under which institutions award State grant funds as well as institutional aid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

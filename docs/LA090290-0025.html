			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FOOD BECOMES WEAPON OF BLOODY CIVIL WAR THAT DIVIDES LIBERIA;  </P> <P> HUNGER: STARVING CITIZENS ARE HELPLESS VICTIMS AMID ARMIES' BATTLES. REBELS  SPEND AS MUCH TIME FIGHTING EACH OTHER AS THEY DO ATTACKING COUNTRY'S  PRESIDENT.  </P> <P> The woman crouched alongside the road, slowly swaying back and forth, holding  her baby loosely in her shawl.  </P> <P> The curfew was in force but she did not care. She had given up.  </P> <P> Her bare feet splashed in the rainwater puddle, stirring the sand. She was  young. She was lost. The war had killed her spirit but she could not die.  </P> <P> "I can't, I can't. There's nothing. I don't want your money. Nothing to buy.  Nothing to buy. I don't want your money," she said as she stamped her feet in  the puddle.  </P> <P> The baby screwed up its red face. The woman was too tired to cry or even  listen. She put the money given her on the pavement.  </P> <P> Hunger has almost emptied the streets. The only people left are too hungry to  get off the road when the curfew starts. They don't care what the soldiers  might tell them or do to them, or that they might steal from them.  </P> <P> They don't know when the curfew starts. The sun goes down and it's just another  night on the street.  </P> <P> Liberia's civil war has become bloodier and more brutal each month since former  civil servant Charles Taylor launched his drive to oust President Samuel K. Doe  in February. Rival rebel leader Prince Johnson split from Taylor's group and  the two rebel armies encircled the capital.  </P> <P> But what began as a quick advance on Doe's executive mansion bogged down and  today the rebels spend as much time fighting each other as they do attacking  Doe. Deep tribal divisions have resulted in several massacres of refugees and  innocent civilians.  </P> <P> People have crossed the river to where Prince Johnson's rebels have opened some  of the warehouses and handed out rice. Up to 3,000 people wait in queues. They  wait in the rain along the road. They wait and they beg and they faint from  hunger. But they still wait.  </P> <P> Freddie from the Lebanese Embassy arrives at a foreigner's house with ham, tins  of milk, prunes, crackers and bottles of Amaretto and Cinzano. His prices are  high but he doesn't reveal them until after the purchaser makes his selections.  Then he mutters about the sliding exchange rate.  </P> <P> The food Freddie sells is stolen. Some of it came from the Ashi supermarket.  The owner of the Ashi was arrested by the rebels. He had been providing food  for President Doe. Even the president is running short of food. The rebels  arrested the supermarket owner and burned his supermarket.  </P> <P> The hungry people saw it burning. They knew what was inside.  </P> <P> Prince Johnson shot a man he said was profiteering from the war. The man, a  Liberian called Bashi, was selling rice to refugees across the river from the  city center. Johnson, though he had agreed to the sale as a way of preventing a  stampede for rice, shot the man while he was handcuffed to a French aid worker  who had been doing the same thing.  </P> <P> The rice belonged to the Firestone Rubber Co. The U.S. government had agreed to  buy the rice from Firestone and then have it distributed.  </P> <P> Johnson is proud that he shot a profiteer. Now he is planning on selling the  rice himself. He thinks it's a good idea, a good way of stopping a stampede of  hungry people. Some Lebanese people are going to arrange it for him. And, of  course, they will take a cut of the money.  </P> <P> "Do you think it's a good idea?" he asks, sitting back in his chair at the  roadside cafe that is his field headquarters. Everybody nods. He swigs at a  near-empty bottle of rum. It's 10 a.m. He grins and puts his hand over his  mouth in a slightly childish gesture, like a naughty boy somebody has given a  war to play with.  </P> <P> His troops all clap in sincere approval.  </P> <P> A group of women come around the corner of the cafe. They plead and beg for  rice. One of them becomes hysterical. Her high-pitch voice grates and  infuriates Johnson. He hits her. Pushes her and the others away. They run,  moaning, afraid he might shoot at them.  </P> <P> He empties his bottle of rum.  </P> <P> Now that the stores are empty of food, the government soldiers have taken to  stealing the floor tiles, the shelves and the light fixtures.  </P> <P> Nobody really understands why. There is nobody to buy the goods. And everybody  knows the soldiers probably will die when the rebels attack the palace and they  realize at last that they have nowhere left to go.  </P> <P> Even the president will have nowhere to go. The U.S. Marine helicopter will not  be able to take him out now. It would be too dangerous.  </P> <P> Instead, the troops loot the shops of what is left, while a few blocks away the  rebels shoot at them. But they would rather steal and die than defend  themselves. Steal until there is nothing left to steal and then die with a  roomful of light fixtures, floor tiles and empty shelves.  </P></p>

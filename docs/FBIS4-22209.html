This Statute sets forth a series of measures to control  exports of certain types of raw and other materials, equipment,  technologies, and scientific-technical information that can have  applications in the development of weapons and military hardware  (referred to hereafter as dual-use goods and services).    2. The procedure for controlling exports from the Russian  Federation of dual-use goods and services shall entail:    --the preparation and issuance of authorization findings on  the export of dual-use goods and services included in the List,  confirmed by Russian Federation Presidential Directive No. 74-rp  of February 11, 1994, of certain types of raw and other  materials, equipment, technologies, and scientific-technical  information that can have applications in the development of  weapons and military hardware and whose export is controlled and  carried out under licenses (referred to hereafter as the List);    --the licensing and customs clearance of exports of dual-use  goods and services.    3. All economic entities under the jurisdiction of the  Russian Federation, regardless of type of ownership, when  concluding contracts for the export (transfer, exchange) of  dual-use goods and services included in the List, shall be  required to specify in the contract text the end users of the  goods and services being exported, the purpose for which they  will be used, and undertakings by the importer that the goods  and services will be used solely for the stated purposes, which  shall not be related directly or indirectly to the production of  weapons and military hardware, and will not be re-exported or  transferred to any party without the exporter's written consent.    The undertakings must be specially filed by the importer  with  a duly authorized state agency of the importer-country for each  specific transaction involving the delivery of each exported  object included in the List, in the form of an international  (national) import certificate or equivalent document, or, in the  absence of a procedure for filing an import certificate, in the  form of a document containing the undertakings specified in  paragraph one of this point, with a notarized Russian language  translation.    4. In the event of the absence in the importer-country's  legislation of regulations relating to export controls for  certain dual-use goods and services or the absence of the  dual-use goods or services being imported from the Russian  Federation in the national control list of the importer-country,  it shall be necessary to present an official document  (certification) to this effect issued by a duly authorized state  agency of the importer-country.    In this event, the importer's undertakings in the contract  text shall constitute sufficient grounds for export. An extract  from the trade register of the importer-country or other  document confirming the legal status of the foreign importer in  accordance with the legislation of the country in which it is  located, with a notarized Russian language translation, shall be  appended to the aforementioned documents.    The contract text must include a mandatory provision  specifying the exporter's right to verify that the exported  goods or services are being used for the stated purposes.    Verification of compliance with the undertakings of foreign  importers with respect to the use of dual-use goods and services  imported from the Russian Federation shall be organized in the  procedure specified in Russian Federation Council of  Ministers-Government Decree No. 1030 of October 11, 1993.    In the event that efforts to verify compliance with the  importer's undertakings reveal a breach of those undertakings or  noncompliance with them, the contract shall be subject to  dissolution.    5. The obtaining of licenses for the export (transfer,  exchange) of dual-use goods and services included in the List  shall be mandatory for all economic entities on the territory of  the Russian Federation, regardless of type of ownership; this  shall apply to all types of foreign economic activity, including  direct production and scientific-technical ties, coastal and  border trade, and barter operations, in accordance with this  Statute.    The export (transfer, exchange) of dual-use goods and  services included in the List shall be carried out only on the  basis of one-time licenses issued by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.    An export authorization finding for dual-use goods and  services issued by the Russian Federation government's Russian  Federation Commission on Export Controls shall constitute  grounds for the issuance of a license.    To obtain such a finding, the following items must be  submitted to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the  export control department): A license application completed in  accordance with the requirements established by the Russian  Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations; a copy of the  contract; a copy of the agreement between the Russian producer  and the exporter (if the export of goods or services is being  carried out via an intermediary); originals of the documents  containing the importer's undertakings (if they are absent from  the contract text) and of the importer-country state agency  specified in points three and four of this Statute.    The export authorization finding shall be issued no later  than 20 days after the receipt of the aforementioned documents.  The finding shall be forwarded by the Russian Federation  Ministry of Economics (the export control department) to the  Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and to  the applicant.    The Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations  shall send information on licenses issued on the basis of  findings issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export  Controls (in an agreed-upon form) to the Russian Federation  Ministry of Economics (the export control department).    Authorization to re-export shall be issued to Russian  exporters on the basis of a re-export authorization finding  issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export Controls.  To obtain a re-export authorization finding, the Russian  exporter shall submit to the Russian Federation Ministry of  Economics (the export control department): notarized copies of  the foreign importer's contract with the third party containing  the terms stipulated in point three of this Statute, and a  document that contains the undertakings that follow from the  contract and that has been filed with a duly authorized state  agency of the third party's country in the form of an import  certificate or other document specified by that country's  national legislation.    6. The temporary export from the Russian Federation of  equipment (goods), materials, technologies, and  scientific-technical information included in the List for  demonstration at exhibits and trade shows and for advertising  purposes may be carried out without licenses on the basis of a  finding issued by the Russian Federation Commission on Export  Controls.    To obtain a temporary export authorization finding, an  application shall be sent to the Russian Federation Ministry of  Economics (the export control department) containing information  on: the type of object to be exported (specifying the foreign  economic activity product code) and the quantity; the purpose of  export and the manner in which the object will be used; the  country of destination; the name of the exhibit (trade show);  the locations where the object will be used; the period of time  for which the exported object will be abroad; the name and  address of the Russian organization carrying out the export; the  foreign contracting parties; and the name of the customs agency  that will clear the object at customs, along with an undertaking  by the Russian organization exporting the object to the effect  that the object will be returned.    A temporary export authorization finding shall be issued no  later than 20 days after receipt of the aforementioned  documents. The Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the  export control department) shall send the finding to the  applicant for submission to the customs agency indicated in the  finding. A copy of the finding shall be sent to the Russian  Federation State Customs Committee.    7. The export from the Russian Federation of materials,  equipment (goods), and technologies containing information that  constitutes a state secret shall be carried out in accordance  with the requirements of the Russian Federation Law "On State  Secrets."    8. The dual-use goods and services included in the List  shall  be subject to mandatory customs clearance in the established  procedure upon leaving the Russian Federation.    The exporter shall present the obtained license to the  customs agency, and the license shall constitute grounds for  clearing the object for export from the Russian Federation.    When equipment (goods), materials, technologies, and  scientific-technical information included in the List are  temporarily exported for demonstration at exhibits and trade  shows and for advertising purposes, the temporary export  authorization finding of the Russian Federation Commission on  Export Controls shall be presented to the customs agency.    The Russian Federation State Customs Committee shall submit  information on the export from the Russian Federation of  dual-use goods and services for which the findings and licenses  specified in points five and six of this Statute have been  issued to the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics (the  export control department) in an agreed-upon form.    9. Persons who export dual-use goods and services subject to  special export controls in violation of the procedure set forth  in this Statute shall be liable in accordance with Russian  Federation legislation.</p>

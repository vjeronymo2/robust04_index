			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P.S.: "Fewer Bad Debts -- Bank Gdanski SA in Line </F> for Privatization"]    [Text]Along with Bank Handlowy w Warszawie SA, it is  the most secure in Poland, it is fourth on the list of main  activity indicators, and it is fifth in amount of capital --  such are the rankings of Bank Gdanski SA. So far, it has had  just one division in Warsaw, but as of Friday, it also has a  branch.    "The bank is getting ready for privatization. Is is second  in line after the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy SA" --  said Edmund Tolwinski, the bank's chairman. "But first we must  put some internal things in order and prepare a program. After  two privatizations of banks of the `Group of Nine,', we want to  conduct our privatization in the safest possible way."    So far, the establishment of an information management  system  has been of the main directions of activity. Divisions and  branches have been computerized for the customers' needs, but  there is no integrated management system. Availing itself of  World Bank credits and working in line with its procedures, Bank  Gdanski will make a decision in June as to who will deal with  designing and implementing such a system.    An extension of the range of activities is another issue.  Talks with a French insurance group named Azur are already in  progress. The bank will be selling a few of the group's products  as its agent before the end of the year, while a joint  undertaking is being planned for 1995. Its main goal will be  life insurance.    The process of restructuring bad debts has been progressing  favorably. As the first bank in the country, Bank Gdanski SA  resolved the problem of difficult credits by selling its  financial claims. It happened in 1992 and it applied to a debt  incurred by the Szczecin shipyard which constituted 25 percent  of Bank Gdanski's "bad credits." For 31 December 1991, such bad  credits constituted 32.5 percent of the total value of credits.  On 31 March this year -- the deadline for finalizing the  restructuring -- the figure dropped down to less than 20  percent. "The structure of the current difficult debts is  completely different from that of three years ago" -- said  Hubert Kierkowski, the bank's deputy chairman for restructuring.  "Back then, difficult debts were comprised of credits for huge  state-owned enterprises whereas currently, they are loans  granted to smaller privately-owned companies."    Commenting on rumors regarding a merger with Bank Slaski,  Chairman Tolwinski stated that some analysis work has been  conducted but without any specific bank in mind.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>   [Text] Kiev January 24 TASS -- Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy,  Ukrainian ambassador to Russia, has described the tripartite  Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as a great  breakthrough not only for Ukranian, but also for Russian  diplomacy. He took part in the Perekryostok programme,  broadcast by Ukrainian TV on Sunday, which highlighted the  forthcoming discussion of the agreement by the Ukrainian  parliament, due to take place on January 25.    The Ukrainian ambassador stressed that Russia had approached  the tripartite Moscow agreement realistically, acting as an  equal and not senior partner during the settlement of the  complicated problem. Kryzhanovskiy said that he supported the  tripartite Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament  both as a diplomat and a Ukrainian citizen. "Nuclear weapons  are not what our people need today. The problem for them is  survival. If nuclear disarmament even involves compensation,  the Ukrainian parliament should support the Moscow agreement,"  he said.    The same idea was expressed by Ukrainian Deputy Defence  Minister Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, who also took part in the  Perekryostok programme. He stressed that President Kravchuk had  acted in Moscow on the basis of the resolution of the Ukrainian  parliament in the part, dealing with the ratification of the  START-1 Treaty. He pointed out that the participation of the  United States in the Moscow treaty is a positive factor and a  guarantee, and called attention to the importance for Ukraine of  the fact that Russia agreed to provide maintenance to the  nuclear warheads, deployed in Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / New party aims to save the D-Mark: Bonn already sees Bund freier Burger as right-wing threat With plentiful supplies of coffee and cakes, and a fair amount of procedural confusion, 120 worthy German citizens gathered in an unremarkable hotel in Wiesbaden, the eminently respectable capital of the state of Hesse, yesterday to found the latest challenge to the German political establishment. The Bund freier Burger (BFB), or Free Citizens' Alliance, plans to campaign in the forthcoming European elections in June, and in the general election for the German Bundestag in October, for freedom, the market economy, and the preservation of the Deutsche Mark. If it were not for that final ambition, the exercise might be dismissed as a hopeless tilt at the creaking windmills of German democracy. But the desire to save the D-Mark from being swallowed up in a nebulous European Ecu, created by the Maastricht process of European economic and monetary union, is one shared by about 75 per cent of the German population. It could prove to be a real vote-winner at a time of widespread disaffection with all the main parties of the political establishment. At the same time there is more than a sneaking suspicion that the new party is trying to steal a few leaves from the book of Mr Jorg Haider, the right-wing leader of Austria's Freedom party, who has gained widespread support and notoriety by appealing to latent xenophobia. The BFB is the brainchild of Mr Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in Brussels and principal challenger of the Maastricht treaty when it came before the German constitutional court last year. Mr Brunner looks more like a bank manager than a Don Quixote, with a round, earnest face and spectacles. Yet he has lost his job and risked his career in his determination to fight the treaty, and the overwhelmingly pro-European Union establishment. He says Mr Haider is 'a sensible man with interesting ideas'. He is clearly regarded as a threat in some quarters. The founding meeting of the party had to be moved at the last minute from the far more evocative surroundings of Weimar, the home town of Goethe, in east German Thuringia, because of a bomb threat to the Hilton Hotel. Mr Franz Schuster, the Christian Democrat interior minister in the state, declared the proposed party to be more dangerous than either the far right-wing Republicans, or the even more extreme National Democratic party (NPD). Yesterday's meeting could scarcely have been called threatening. The participants, mostly male and with an average age of 50, were almost entirely solid representatives of the bourgeoisie, small businessmen, the self-employed, professionals and professors. They are all frustrated with the political process, and their former political parties. 'All the parties have become the same,' Mr Ralf Gutmann, president of the national dentists' association, declared. 'It is not bad to be conservative. It is about preserving something.' 'The word bourgeois is not a swear word any more,' said Professor Bernd-Thomas Ramb, who describes himself as an entrepreneur. 'It means a consciousness of freedom with responsibility.' Mr Brunner is clear that his main platform is anti-European. He does not want to dismantle the European Union, but he wants to make sure it is no more than a loose confederation of nation states. He does not want to lose the D-Mark, and he wants to make sure Germany's money pays first of all for German unification, before it is redistributed round the rest of the EU. His problem is that he is plunging into an increasingly crowded market place. Another 'citizens' movement', the Hamburg-based Statt Partei - 'Instead of a party' - decided on Saturday to organise itself on a national basis. It is also clearly pitched at the disaffected bourgeoisie. As for the far right, if that is where Mr Brunner ends up, he will have to contend with the well-organised Republicans, as well as the Deutsche Volksunion (DVU) and the NPD. They could all be forced to split the conservative, nationalist vote, and thus all fail to gain the necessary 5 per cent support for a seat in any parliament.</p>

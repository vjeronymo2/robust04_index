			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> LAKES SHIMMERS, MEIER SHINES IN WAGNER CONCERT  </P> <P> In its modest 25-year span, San Diego Opera has hardly been a hotbed of  Wagnerian enthusiasm. Thanks to the vision of founding director Walter Herbert,  the company traversed the mighty "Ring" cycle in annual installments from  1974-77, but Herbert's successors have rarely dipped into the Wagner canon.  </P> <P> Tuesday's all-Wagner concert at the Civic Theatre, however, made some modest  amends for this neglect, and, more important, served as the lure to bring the  young American tenor Gary Lakes to San Diego for the first time.  </P> <P> If the concert's first half seemed unduly slight -- it was a potpourri of four  short arias and three overtures -- the compelling, post-intermission  performance of the first act of "Die Walkure" vindicated the entire  undertaking. Under Heinz Fricke's authoritative baton, soloists and an expanded  on-stage orchestra offered a sweeping, intense and stylistically sympathetic  concert performance.  </P> <P> Soprano Johanna Meier, who graced the local opera stage in memorable  performances in the 1970s, projected a Sieglinde of affecting beauty. Meier  inflected the vocal line with gleaming yet limpid tone and uncommon  sensitivity. Her joyous encounter of her lost brother, Siegmund, was the work's  emotional linchpin.  </P> <P> As Siegmund, Lakes warmed up appreciably from his tentative arias in the first  half. Pursuing the familiar outlines of a part he has often sung, he brought  requisite ardor to the role, although he still seemed stiff in comparison to  Meier. The clarion strength of his voice, even sweeter on top than in other  ranges, is clearly this aspiring heldentenor's calling card.  </P> <P> John Macurdy, a last-minute replacement for German bass Artur Korn, projected a  stern and aptly stentorian Hunding, negotiating his chiseled lines with  assurance and conviction. In his only other appearance in the concert, he  sailed through Daland's humorous aria from the second act of "The Flying  Dutchman" with consummate ease.  </P> <P> Clearly, Macurdy's sure technique has preserved his sonorous chords over the  decades. (He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1962, about the time Lakes'  voice was beginning to change.)  </P> <P> Unlike his colleagues, Lakes sang his first-half arias with score in hand. His  subdued "Almachtiger Vater" from "Rienzi" and Lohengrin's final "Mein lieber  Schwan" suffered from overly deliberate phrasing.  </P> <P> Meier brought dramatic flare to "Dich, teure Halle" from "Tannhauser," although  the aria's athletic declamation was taxing and brought out an undeniable wobble  in her lovely instrument.  </P> <P> In a way, the opera orchestra was the evening's surprise star. It was  consistently responsive and flexible under Fricke's dramatic direction,  especially in the flashy Prelude to Act III of "Lohengrin," in which the brass  sections mustered well-focused brilliance and depth.  </P> <P> Fricke, music director of the Berlin State Opera, made his American debut with  this concert and will return to San Diego Opera in 1992 for the season opening  to conduct "Der Rosenkavalier."  </P></p>

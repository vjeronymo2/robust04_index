			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Straight talker who could ignite the warm-words committee: Kevin Brown takes pre-result temperatures in the race for Labour's deputy leader The form book was right. Mr Tony Blair, the modernising shadow home secretary, started as favourite to succeed John Smith as Labour leader and seems certain to win. Even Mr Blair's rivals, Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr John Prescott, sound increasingly half-hearted as they repeat the well-worn mantra that they can win on the final straight. That would be a huge and unexpected upset. But there may yet be some excitement when the preferences of up to 4.5m Labour supporters are announced on Thursday. It looks increasingly possible that Mrs Beckett, the interim leader, may also lose the deputy leadership to Mr Prescott, the rumbustious shadow employment secretary. If that happens, it will be a heavy blow to Mrs Beckett, who has campaigned largely on her record as Mr Smith's deputy since the last leadership election in 1992. But it would be a stunning victory for Mr Prescott, whose passionate advocacy of full employment has provided one of the few highlights in a dull campaign. Interviewed in the opposition leader's room at the Commons, Mrs Beckett admitted that it was 'perfectly possible' that she might fail to win either leadership post. She said: 'I am used to going into elections that I might not win, and having to make my case and abide by the judgment of electorate. There is nothing odd to me about the fact that I might end up having lost both positions. 'But the party must decide on the leadership team it wants at the next election. Winning is so crucial that if the party were to decide that it ought to have a different leadership team then the party must be free to make the decision.' Mrs Beckett's pessimism is mirrored by growing optimism in the Prescott camp. Rifling through hundreds of supporters' letters in his turret office overlooking the Commons, Mr Prescott said it was 'staggering how many people are now coming over'. He thinks the party will vote for Mr Blair because it wants a leader who can persuade Conservative and Liberal Democrat voters to switch sides. 'I am not a strong suitor on those grounds,' he said. He added: 'But if they vote for me as the deputy leader, I represent the heart and commitment that the party is concerned about, and it is a synthesis of those two positions from which, presumably, we will draw our general direction, values and presentation.' Mr Blair has scrupulously avoided giving any indication of his preference for the deputy leader's job. But if Mrs Beckett does lose there will be long faces among his entourage. In part, this is because of a long-standing enmity between Mr Prescott and Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, whose hopes of running Labour's economic policy might come to nothing under a Blair/Prescott leadership team. But it also reflects concerns about Mr Prescott's volatile personality, which throbs with passion and commitment, in sharp contrast to the calculating but bloodless approach of Mrs Beckett. Some Blair supporters say the shadow employment secretary is already prone to embarrassing flights of fancy. Give him a leadership role, and he will be a loose cannon on deck, they say. Mr Prescott is clearly irritated by this. He repudiates many of the more flamboyant stories about him - such as reports of a row in the Commons tea-room with Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, over nuclear disarmament. He is keen to defend his record as a serious political operator - leader of Labour's European parliament delegation from 1976 to 1979; successful cod war negotiator with the Icelandic government in 1976; author of eight long pamphlets on Labour's economic and industrial policies. He is also no slouch at the soundbite strategy so dear to the modernisers. His slogan, 'Traditional values in a modern setting' was devised by Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe, assistant general secretary of the Unison public sector union, but it could easily have been dreamt up by Labour's spin doctors. But wouldn't there be tensions with Mr Blair over Mr Prescott's robust approach, and his determination to sharpen Labour's image by setting targets for progress in key policy areas such as full employment? Mr Prescott rebuts this analysis with some force. He is clearly fond of his freebooting image, and admits disarmingly that he has done little to discourage it. 'My style fits easily into that character,' he said. But that doesn't mean he is incapable of knuckling down to collective responsibilities. 'The leader and deputy leader can't be at war with each other,' he said. 'The party puts two people into the leadership . . . but at the end of the day the leader is the leader and it is their responsibility to set the framework.' Nevertheless, Mr Prescott's language betrays an impatience with the Blair style that augurs badly for those who think vigorous debate inevitably spells electoral disaster for Labour. Noting that people are supporting him 'because they think I will say it as it is', he launches into a long critique of the 'be safe and say nothing' approach of Labour's modernisers, whom he lampoons as the 'warm-words committee'. He said: 'We have started to have soft profiles which have made it very difficult to differentiate Labour and the Tory party. I think we can be robust about our principles and argue our case. 'Sometimes you have to find words to get over difficulties, but the trouble with our side is that we have got too caught up with the warm-words committees . . . the warm words almost become the policies. I think the electorate has seen through a lot of this. Vision is OK, but they do like the nuts and bolts, and I'm more of a nuts and bolts politician.' What will he do if he loses? 'There are people who don't want to stand for elections because they think they will come out a bit weaker because the vote might not be as good as they think it should be. 'I've always taken the view that if you acquit yourself well you will come out of it stronger . . . I will certainly come out of this one considerably stronger, whether I have one of the leadership positions or not.'</p>

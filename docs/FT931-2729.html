			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Arts: Sherlock Holmes - The Musical In 1887, Dr Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) wrote the first of 56 'Sherlock Holmes' stories. This provided motive and opportunity for Ellie Norwood, Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett to play the tweedy sleuth. Now, Holmes has become a singing detective in Leslie Bricusse's Sherlock Holmes: The Musical at the Bristol Old Vic. The scene opens at the Reichenbach Falls. Holmes surfaces again near Victoria. But with Moriarty dead, Holmes is bored to distraction in retirement. However, the King Charles spaniel thefts from the Duchesses Monmouth, Richmond, Argyl and Tyneside signal Moriarty's survival. But this Moriarty is 1890s New Woman Ms Bella Moriarty, with whom Holmes promptly falls in love. His hormones corrode his judgment, and he finds himself framed for murder. The barge-footed Lestrade of the Yard arrests him, and even the woolly Dr Watson threatens to doubt. Bricusse has done much better work than this, most recently songs for the films Home Alone and Hook. Holmes lacks sophistication. The key is the absence of the dog that did not bark (in 'Silver Blaze'); the musical misses the complexities of Doyle's forensic style, and never hits on a musical style to convey the dry wit of Doyle's stories. The dialogue keeps up some acquaintance with traditional Sherlockiana, as in 'This is a three-pipe problem' and 'the little things are infinitely the most important.' But the setting needs to change. Around Baker Street, a jolly cockney chorus is trapped in a Mary Poppins chimberley-sweep vision of London: 'It's a bleedin' garden of Eden' they sing, before the rhyming slang number, 'Apples 'n' Pears'. The songs are never complex enough, content to describe rather than move the action forward. Stephen Sondheim's 19th-century crime musical, Sweeney Todd, fills the songs themselves with suspense: 'The demon barber of Fleet . . . pause . . . Street.' But here, as the show eases into its songs, lulling strings and a high wistful oboe signal an emotional number, while a jolly plucked bass and wire brushes mean a singalong character tune. The music itself fails to surprise. However, the show does have some spikey, atmospheric recitative signalling Moriarty's return, and a fine complaint from the Landlady at 221B, Mrs Hudson, with - for 1893 London - the anachronistic 'A Lousy Life'. Other highlights are 'Men Like You' sung by Bella at Holmes, and a reminiscence number called 'Halcyon Days' sung by Dr Watson and his old pal Boffy in the police morgue. Robert Powell as an imperious Holmes strikes a superior tone with Roy Barraclough's excellent Watson, all slow wits and campaign memories. Alongside them, Louise English as Bella Moriarty and Sarah Hay as Mrs Hudson add scope and depth. The ensemble scenes are sharply choreographed by Tudor Davies, and Bob Tomson's direction keeps the action flowing through Mick Bearwish's versatile London set. Bristol Old Vic until April 10</p>

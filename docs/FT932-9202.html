			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Catalogue of controversy at annual meeting SEARS, Roebuck managed to avoid confrontation with Ms Elizabeth Holtzman, New York City's comptroller, at its annual meeting in Kansas, but still found itself swamped by controversy, writes Laurie Morse. Dozens of smaller shareholders, many of them retired Sears employees, complained that, by dumping its century-old catalogue and closing small-town stores, the company had abandoned rural America. A bus-load of protesters from Chicago and other mid-western cities disrupted the meeting with demands that Allstate, Sears' insurance arm, address allegations of 'red-lining'  - denying or overcharging for insurance in poor communities. The charge against Allstate, by the activist group Association of Community Organisations for Reform Now, forced Sears directors to make a hasty exit from the meeting, protected by local police. The public protest came less than a month before Sears plans to take 20 per cent of Allstate stock public. The stock is being offered at a price close to Dollars 27 per share. Sears' largest activist shareholders were absent from the meeting, however, apparently mollified by a steady rise in the company's stock price this year. Sears closed Thursday up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 , up from Dollars 41 in September, when the company's restructuring was announced. Ms Holtzman, who represents more than 2m Sears shares through her administration of New York's employee pension funds, decided not to travel to Kansas when it became clear that her initiative to force Mr Edward Brennan to divest of one of his two management titles would fail to win majority support. Three shareholder initiatives, all aimed at reform of the governing board and management, received substantial support but failed to win a majority. Ms Holtzman's proposal, delivered by proxy, received 35 per cent of the vote. A plan seeking annual elections for all directors won 44 per cent of the vote.</p>

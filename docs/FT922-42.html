			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Observer: Reshuffle Which is the more important job - being finance director of Britain's biggest company or chief executive of a medium-sized fund management firm? The question is raised by Glaxo's reorganisation of its finance team. John Hignett, a former head of the City Takeover Panel and ex-Lazard corporate finance chieftain, is handing over his title as Glaxo's managing director, finance, to John Coombe, a 46-year-old chartered accountant. After Hignett has finished adding up this year's profits, he will turn his full-time attention to managing Glaxo's Pounds 1.2bn cash mountain. While it's good to see that the company is taking seriously the job of husbanding its fortune, it is still hard to believe that it is a task which will stretch Hignett's talents. And anyway his skills lie not in fund management but in corporate finance. Could it be that, now 58, he just wants a quieter life?</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ACCUSED OF 'BOILER-ROOM' SCAM  </P> <P> A Santa Monica man has been charged in Utah with running a telephone "boiler  room" that used promises of discount vacations to defraud credit-card holders.  </P> <P> The two-count complaint alleges that Edward Kane was among several people who  from June through August of 1984 helped manage Sunsets Unlimited, a Utah-based  travel club in reorganization bankruptcy.  </P> <P> To sell club memberships, Salt Lake City Prosecutor William Ryan said, Kane  helped set up a boiler room office "equipped with multiple telephone hookups  and a sales staff of telephone solicitors." According to the complaint, Kane  instructed the phone solicitors to seek out major credit-card holders as  customers and obtain their card numbers "by means of various  misrepresentations."  </P> <P> The victims were allegedly told that they would receive a package of materials  including a "valuable discount coupon book for reduced rates at major hotels,  restaurants, car rentals agencies and tourist attractions." But Kane knew, the  complaint said, that Sunsets Unlimited was systematically charging $149 to the  credit-card accounts as soon as the number was obtained, "irrespective of  whether the customer had agreed to become a member."  </P></p>

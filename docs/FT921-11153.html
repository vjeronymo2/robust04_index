			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Anglia Secure almost doubles loss to Pounds 17m LOSSES continued to mount at Anglia Secure Homes, the retirement housing and care services company. The deficit for the year ended September 30 was Pounds 16.9m, almost double the previous year's Pounds 8.89m. Exceptional charges on the value of landbank and developments, its joint venture with Balfour Beatty, and a write-off of capitalised interest accounted for Pounds 9.5m of the loss. Last year, Anglia took a provision of Pounds 6.5m, mostly for the decline in property values. Mr Peter Edmondson, chairman, blamed the 'appalling malaise in the housing market' for the result. Sales fell by 35 per cent to Pounds 23.1m. During the year, Anglia sold 293 units, compared with 443 last year, partly reflecting the group's move away from development. Average house prices fell from Pounds 71,000 to Pounds 67,200. Mr Richard Clough, managing director, said the actual decline was probably greater as most of Anglia's units were sold in the south-east. The care services division, in which UK insurer Commercial Union holds a 49.9 per cent stake following a financial rescue package in 1990, returned sales of Pounds 3m and had been profitable, Mr Clough said. The division was expected to account for Pounds 6m of turnover by the end of the current year. The group intends increasingly to focus on this division, which manages retirement and sheltered housing units, and builds nursing homes for health authorities. Mr Clough expected the group to break even or return a small profit in 1992-93 as it decreased its dependence on development business. Interest charges fell from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 4.9m and debt was reduced from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 29.5m. Gearing was 185 per cent of shareholders funds. Loss per share rose from 35.6p to 49.3p.</p>

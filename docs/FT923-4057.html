			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies One must either gape in admiration or in horror at the behaviour of the Swedish central bank. To raise its overnight emergency lending rate by 8 percentage points to 24 per cent when inflation is only 2 per cent and the economy is in deep recession takes, to say the least, determination. But it is also a vivid illustration of the price that peripheral countries in Europe are paying to align themselves with a fixed-rate currency system centring around the D-Mark. Weaker countries already inside the system must be wondering whether they will eventually be called on to pay a similar price. There is some consolation in the thought that the Nordic currencies are a special case. All are outside the formal system and defended by central banks with limited reserves. Sweden's rate rise was prompted by Finland's decision to float the markka - and Finland's troubles are compounded by its heavy dependence on forest products priced in dollars. The implications for struggling ERM members like the UK are disturbing nonetheless. Sweden's action is a rude reminder that a small rate increase will be insufficient if it does become necessary to use the interest weapon to defend the pound. Then again, such a drastic move seems so perverse as to make the whole effort at European currency stability look absurd. Investors could be forgiven for doubting whether European politicians will have the stamina to stay the course.</p>

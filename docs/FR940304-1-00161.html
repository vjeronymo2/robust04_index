			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Microwave ovens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level 5 for amended microwave oven standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 will save the most energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (0.84 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department assumes that all microwave ovens will have more efficient power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplies, fans and magnetrons; modified wave guides and reflective surfaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the payback at this standard level of 13.0 years exceeds the 10-year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product life, and this level produces increased life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for microwave ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next most stringent standard level is standard level 4. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard level is projected to save 0.77 quad of energy. However, the payback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this standard level of 7.4 years is nearly three quarters of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life and produces an increase in life-cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for microwave ovens outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microwave oven portion of kitchen ranges and ovens with standard level 3 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microwave ovens. The Department concludes that standard level 3 for microwave  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ovens saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the period 1996&hyph;2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.67 quad of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment by reducing the emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 128,000 tons and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 156,000 tons, respectively, or by as much as 0.10 percent each by the year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by 56 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tons, or 0.10 percent, over the forecast period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer payback of this standard level is 2.9 years, which meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuttable presumption test of economic justification. This standard is close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the lowest life-cycle cost for microwave ovens and is expected to result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a reduction in life-cycle cost of approximately $14. Additionally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard is expected to have almost no impact on the prototypical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's return on equity of 8.6 percent. Since this standard does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have negative impacts on smaller competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> f. Pool Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department examined a range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of standard levels for pool heaters. In reviewing the design options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to achieve those standard levels, the Department determined that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new energy descriptor was needed to adequately address some of the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options in the analysis because the current energy descriptor, Thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Efficiency, does not include pilot light usage or electrical consumption. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, to consider electronic ignition, the savings in pilot light gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption would have to be accounted for in the descriptor. Furthermore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other design options, for instance, fan-assisted combustion, improve thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency but, at the same time, increase overall electrical consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which, unless accounted for in the energy descriptor, could lead to higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thermal Efficiency with little or no net energy savings. Because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, the Department conducted the analysis, and is proposing the standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in terms of a new energy descriptor, annual efficiency. The test procedure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine this energy descriptor is contained in the previously mentioned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Table 4&hyph;13 presents the four efficiency levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that had been selected for analysis for pool heaters. Level 4 corresponds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

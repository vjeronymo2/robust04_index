			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> DECISION DELAYED ON 77-ACRE TRACT, MALL  </P> <P> The Oxnard City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to postpone for two weeks a  decision on a proposal to build a 77-acre residential and retail project on the  northeast corner of Oxnard Boulevard and Gonzales Road.  </P> <P> The delay was made at the request of Hardy Strozier, a consultant for the  developer, Warmington Homes of Agoura Hills.  </P> <P> Strozier said the postponement is needed to give city staff time to study two  modification options to the project.  </P> <P> As proposed, the project would include 454 residential units -- including 154  townhouse condominiums -- and a 51,275-square-foot retail center. However,  Strozier asked the council to consider two options: one would replace the 4  1/2-acre retail center with an office building, the other with about 90 more  condominium units.  </P> <P> The project's retail center was criticized Tuesday by members of the Rio Lindo  Neighborhood Council. Members of the residential group said they fear that the  retail center would increase traffic in the neighborhood. Strozier said the  number of traffic trips from the commercial center would drop to about 6,000 a  day from about 8,000 by replacing the retail center with office space. The  number of trips would drop to about 4,000 daily if the retail center is  replaced with residential units, he said. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORKING TO BECOME A COMPLETE CATCHER;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA'S VARGAS JUST MAY BE A NATURAL, BUT HE CONTINUES TO STRIVE FOR  PERFECTION  </P> <P> Bob Glassman, baseball coach at Willard Intermediate School in Santa Ana, took  one look at Julio Vargas and knew the seventh-grader was born to catch.  </P> <P> Vargas had never played organized baseball when Glassman persuaded the  youngster to put on a mask and shin guards and get behind the plate. Glassman  quickly discovered that Vargas was a natural.  </P> <P> "He had the physical and mental tools and was eager to play," Glassman said.  "Catching can be a very difficult position for someone who has never played,  but it came easily to him. We never lost a game in two years with Julio at  catcher.  </P> <P> "He was confident and self-assured. He was a real student of the game. It was  like he was born to play baseball. I think he could make a living off the  game."  </P> <P> In the past six years, Glassman, an 11-year veteran at Willard, has watched  Vargas grow into a 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior at Santa Ana High School.  </P> <P> Vargas, a two-time All-Southern Section selection, is batting .457 with three  home runs and 17 RBIs and has struck out only two times. Power? Vargas has hit  13 home runs at Santa Ana, including two in a playoff game against Upland as a  sophomore.  </P> <P> Bill Ross, Santa Ana's coach, says Vargas has become a more disciplined hitter  this year, hitting to all fields. He showed plenty of patience last season when  he walked 36 times. He has 27 walks this season, including eight in the past  three games.  </P> <P> Vargas has paid a price for the long hours he spends on weekends at a batting  cage in Tustin. He quit wearing batting gloves, saying he was wearing out a  pair every three weeks and it was getting expensive replacing the worn gloves.  </P> <P> "I've concentrated on becoming a better hitter," Vargas said. "I'm trying to go  with the pitches to right field, hitting the curveball and the inside fastball.  </P> <P> "I've also worked a lot with Coach (Herschel) Musick on my catching. He'll put  me against a wall and throw a whiffle ball into the dirt to test my reflexes.  I've still got a lot to learn.  </P> <P> "I'm getting better at handling pitchers. I'm not only watching where a batter  stands in the box, but how much bat speed he gets on inside or outside pitches.  I've also worked a lot on my picks (pickoff throws) to second."  </P> <P> In short, Vargas is working to become the complete player. He is very agile and  quick for his size -- physical tools that also make him attractive to football  coaches.  </P> <P> Vargas was a starting tight end for Santa Ana for three seasons despite missing  summer passing league competition and workouts each year because he had to  work. Vargas said he hasn't ruled out a future in football.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to go out for football as a sophomore," he said. "But Coach  (Dick) Hill talked me into coming out and then made me work my tail off for a  starting position. Coach Hill taught me the rewards for hard work. We won the  league title three times."  </P> <P> Ross wonders how much better Vargas could have been if he concentrated solely  on baseball at Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "He needs to get away from football for a year and then I think he'll really  develop," Ross said. "He came out this year with nagging shoulder and ankle  injuries after playing football that set him back.  </P> <P> "He's had some trouble with his elbow and I'm sure the scouts are a bit suspect  of his arm. But there are games where he just dominates. He picked off two  runners against Villa Park and tagged out two runners at home against Foothill.  </P> <P> "Julio is a big, aggressive kid who's not afraid to throw. Very few players run  on him. In fact, we hope they try to run."  </P> <P> Vargas, who plans to attend Rancho Santiago College in the fall if he is not  taken in baseball's amateur draft June 5-7, rated himself in five phases of the  game and gave himself high marks with the exception of power. Here's the Vargas  meter:  </P> <P>  -- Arm strength: "Better than average. My elbow was sore at the beginning of  the year, but it's fine now. I like to throw and I think runners respect my  arm."  </P> <P>  -- Speed: "Good. I think I run pretty good for a guy my size. I've been timed  under 5.0 in the 40."  </P> <P>  -- Hitting: "Better than average and improving. I'm trying to become a more  aggressive hitter."  </P> <P>  -- Power: "Average. I'm not getting good pitches to hit. I'm a little  disappointed here. I had more homers when I was a sophomore than I do this  year."  </P> <P>  -- Intensity: "Good. My intensity is up and improving. I've heard people say  that sometimes it looks like I'm just going through the motions. I'm hustling  all the time."  </P> <P> Earlier this season, Vargas learned that he can't go out of his way to please  the scouts after a disappointing afternoon against Ocean View.  </P> <P> "I concentrated too much on who was watching me and how I looked," he said. "I  had a poor game. Now, I'm just going day to day and not worrying about who's  watching me. I'm out there having fun.  </P> <P> "If I got drafted, I would probably sign. My dream is to play professional  baseball. But I'd also like to get an education. We'll just have to see what  happens and take it from there."  </P></p>

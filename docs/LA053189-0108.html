A State Department spokesman said Congress has  authorized $2 million for the trade union for two years, but U.S. spokesman  Richard Boucher said, "We're not interfering with the campaign." After a  government statement accused Western diplomats of helping the opposition, an  official spokesman said the "way of behaving of those diplomats unambiguously  showed that they were taking part in the electoral campaign in favor of the  opposition."  </P></p>

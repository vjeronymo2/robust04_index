			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tigran Liloyan] </F>   [Text] Yerevan May 11 TASS -- "If the people of  Nagorno-Karabakh is threatened with physical extermination, the  Armed Forces of Armenia and the entire Armenian nation will not  sit on their hands and watch dispassionately how their brothers  and sisters are being killed," Armenian Defence Minister Serzh  Sargsyan said in an interview with the newspaper AZG published  in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.    The minister said that Karabakh needs no large-scale  military  assistance at present, because the armed forces of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic can effectively rebuff all attacks of  the Azeri Army.    The situation at the front in Nagorno-Karabakh has sharply  improved in favour of the Karabakh Army and the initiative is in  the latter's hands. The Azeri Army has suffered considerable  losses in manpower and military equipment, the minister said.  According to his estimates, Azerbaijan has lost about 12  thousand soldiers and officers since December 18, and 650-700  officers and soldiers, two combat aircraft, twelve T-72 tanks,  six armoured vehicles, four artillery guns, two tractors and  several truckfuls of ammunition since the beginning of the April  offensive. During the same period, Karabakh lost 70 men, three  tanks and two armoured vehicles.    The Armenian minister said Azerbaijan's leaders are trying  to  hide the amount of their Army's recent losses in the Mardakert  and Agdam districts and are exaggerating the losses sustained by  Karabakh.    The Armenian minister rejected allegations that the Armenian  Armed Forces are involved in battles in Nagorno-Karabakh. He  said the Karabakh Armenians make up the bulk of the fighters in  Nagorno-Karabakh and a few tens of volunteers of Karabakh  extraction from Armenia cannot change the overall picture. "We  cannot forbid small groups of volunteers from Armenia to go to  Karabakh in order to protect their relatives and friends, no  more than we can regard them as armed forces," he said.    Sargsyan said Azerbaijan's authorities are seeking to  involve  Yerevan in the war in order to portray the Karabakh conflict as  a result of territorial claims of one country to another,  instead of the Nagorno-Karabakh's people national liberation  struggle for self-determination. Azerbaijan's leaders "are  ashamed to admit that the small Karabakh formations have been  routing for a number of years larger Azeri forces armed with  modern weapons and reinforced with Afghan Mojahedins, Turkish  instructors and Ukrainian and Pakistani mercenaries," the  minister said.    The Armenian leader rejected allegations that special units  of the Russian Army are taking part in battles on the side of  Nagorno-Karabakh to capture Azeri positions and hand them over  to the Karabakh military. "Frankly speaking it would be good if  the Russian Army were really involved there. But unfortunately,  the Azeri allegations have nothing in common with reality,"  Sargsyan said.</p>

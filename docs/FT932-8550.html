			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Germany scraps separate data Germany is scrapping separate trade data for the old East and West Germanys. The Federal Statistics Office said it would no longer publish separate trade figures for the two regions of the united Germany, Reuter reports from Bonn. Officials said that it had become too complicated to calculate the data in time because of the creation of the European Community's single market. In the past, the office published pan-German trade figures for each month, followed by release of separate sets of data for west and east Germany later in the month. The office plans to release pan-German February trade data today.</p>

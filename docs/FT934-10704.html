			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Suppliers of motor parts criticised THE revival of the UK motor industry is being put at risk by hundreds of smaller component suppliers failing adequately to improve quality and productivity standards, a Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders conference will be warned today, The warning will come from Professor Dan Jones, who holds the chair of motor industry management at Cardiff Business School and is the author of the book The Machine that Changed the World. Prof Jones will tell the conference in Birmingham that the biggest UK component groups have learnt from the Japanese and are trying hard to reach world-class standards. But he added: 'You can't have smaller component companies working to a different set of rules when they're supplying parts which all have to be incorporated into complete systems for the vehicle assemblers. 'The lower tiers are where we have to place the emphasis since that's where the weaknesses lie.' The warning to the sector reinforces one delivered by Mr George Simpson, chairman of Rover Group, to a recent Commons trade and industry committee inquiry into UK industrial competitiveness.</p>

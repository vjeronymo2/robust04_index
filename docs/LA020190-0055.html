			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CODE VIOLATION ENFORCEMENT IS FOUND LAGGING;  </P> <P> BUREAUCRACY: THE PACE OF PROSECUTIONS SLOWS TO A TRICKLE DUE IN PART TO  REDUCTIONS IN THE CITY ATTORNEY'S STAFF.  </P> <P> Housing, building and zoning code enforcement in the city of San Diego is  plagued by "extraordinary" delays and a huge backlog of cases, a situation  exacerbated by a bottleneck in the city attorney's office, according to an  independent study of city agencies.  </P> <P> More than 70% of zoning cases not resolved by voluntary compliance took 2 1/2  years or longer to process for legal action, according to the report by the San  Diego Law Center of the University of San Diego School of Law. The $124,000  study, released to council members and city staff this week, was jointly funded  by the city and USD.  </P> <P> Even worse, City Atty. John Witt's code enforcement unit is allowing some cases  to remain permanently unprosecuted because of staff cutbacks that took effect  July 1. Cases that do not present significant health and safety issues are  routinely being returned to the investigators who prepared them.  </P> <P> "The people who want to abuse the system, frankly, they can," said Michael  Shames, the study's author. "The system can be easily manipulated by those  people who are a little less scrupulous."  </P> <P> "There's no end to the case. There's no results," said Daniel Morales, an aide  to Councilman Wes Pratt, who handles citizen complaints.  </P> <P> Continued neglect of the violations leads to "the slow erosion of the housing  stock or the buildings or the infrastructure of the community," Shames said.  </P> <P> A bright note in the study is the early performance of the city's Dispute  Resolution Office, an 4-month-old experiment in settling cases between the city  and violators with the help of volunteer mediators. The office resolved all but  two of the 65 cases that came before it.  </P> <P> Shames recommends continuation of the alternative process as a way of relieving  some of the burden on the city agencies. He and others also have been pursuing  creation of a special Municipal Court devoted entirely to code matters, but so  far they have been unsuccessful.  </P> <P> The study also notes that complaints lodged with council members are resolved  much more quickly than calls directly to the enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Zoning investigators respond to complaints about illegal dwelling units,  businesses operating in residential zones, structures under construction,  garage conversions, junk and debris, illegally parked and abandoned cars,  over-height fences and satellite antennas.  </P> <P> Building inspectors respond to land-use and noise complaints, including  buildings without permits, unsafe and dangerous buildings, and unpermitted  construction work. The agency's housing division enforces space and occupancy  permits for homes, and complaints about "habitability requirements" such as  plumbing, heating, electrical equipment and sanitation.  </P> <P> The system is plagued by the huge backlog, delays, low morale, a "computer data  base system resembling the Tower of Babel," a large increase in cases since  1985, over-reliance on the judicial system and "inconsistent handling" of cases  by Municipal Court judges, according to the study.  </P> <P> "Over the years, departmental policies and prosecution delays have allowed a  buildup of unresolved cases with little prospect for resolution without  meaningful reforms," the study notes. As of Dec. 1, 1989, Zoning Investigations  has a backlog of approximately 2,600 cases that are more than six months old.  Similarly, Building Inspection reports a case backlog approximating 2,000  pending cases.  </P> <P> Once cases are referred to the City Attorney's office, "it generally took 18  months" before a court ordered compliance or the case was returned to the  inspector, the study said.  </P> <P> Joe Flynn, deputy planning director, said that zoning investigators resolve 95%  of their cases without the need to go to court. When legal action is necessary,  due process requirements slow procedure, he said.  </P> <P> Likening his predicament to the city's decision to increase its police force  without providing more jail space, Joseph Schilling, the deputy city attorney  in charge of code enforcement, said that his staff has grown more slowly than  the code enforcement staff. The attorneys have fallen further and further  behind, even before Schilling's 10-person unit was reduced by 3.5 positions  last year.  </P> <P> "While the other departments have doubled or tripled their staffs, even before  there was a (budget) cut, we had not grown as rapidly. Even if there hadn't  been a cut, we'd still be scurrying around here trying to take the cases to  court," Schilling said.  </P> <P> Since the budget cuts, the legal unit "can really only focus on the health and  safety violations" or those that have a significant impact on surrounding  neighbors. The attorneys have sent 70 cases back to the city departments and  are accepting far fewer new ones for prosecution, Schilling said.  </P> <P> The prospect for additional help in the coming fiscal year is dim. City Manager  John Lockwood said that the city must raise $66 million in additional revenue  just to keep city services at current levels.  </P> <P> "There will have to be cuts in almost every service the city provides just to  balance next year's budget," Lockwood said. The City Council is scheduled to  discuss its budget crunch Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Faced with such realities, inspectors "begin to feel like the INS inspectors at  the Mexico border -- 'Why should I be putting in all this effort when it's not  going to go to court for 2 1/2 years,' " Shames said.  </P> <P> In addition to the special court, which has proved successful in other cities,  the report recommends better computerization, more training for inspectors,  assigning priorities to cases, establishment of fees and fines that would pay  for code enforcement staff, the use of volunteers and changes in the municipal  codes to make enforcement more efficient.  </P></p>

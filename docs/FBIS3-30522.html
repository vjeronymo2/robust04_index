Pawlak and Kwasniewski were driven to the URM through a side  entrance; after the meeting, they drove off without talking with  journalists waiting outside the building. The subject of the  talk was the recall of Finance Deputy Minister Stefan Kawalec,  as well as methods of governing and joint governing within the  coalition. Kwasniewski held over three hours of talks with SLD  ministers before the meeting. At that time, Deputy Prime  Minister Borowski suggested that the powers of each of the three  deputy prime ministers be clearly defined, so that each of them  understood their responsibilities.    On the same day, on the plane from Brussels to Warsaw,  Waldemar Pawlak told journalists accompanying him that internal  relations between the coalition parties are much more quiet than  it might seem when one views them from the outside. The  coalition agreement signed by the Polish Peasant Party and SLD  does not regulate all relations between the governing parties,  and even though there are no major frictions between them, their  stands on many issues are different. This is why the situation  requires patience and dialogue, which will make it possible to  find good solutions.    During the meeting of the prime minister and SLD leader in  Brussels, Aleksander Kwasniewski is said to have expressed his  dissatisfaction over the existing conflict. Journalists who  witnessed this had the impression that Kwasniewski was voicing  his opinions very firmly--but not so firmly as to let the crisis  rock the government coalition. After the Thursday evening talks  between both politicians, journalists came to the simple  conclusion that their faces were rather glum. Both politicians  are supposed to issue information on the results of their talks  at a press conference on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY PANEL GIVES TENTATIVE OK TO SHIPYARD  LEASE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee has tentatively approved a new lease with  the largest commercial shipyard on Terminal Island, but not without harsh words  for the Harbor Department's handling of the agreement.  </P> <P> The proposed 10-year lease with Southwest Marine Inc. drew criticism from the  council's Commerce, Energy and Natural Resources Committee because the  agreement has been in negotiations since 1986 and falls short of the 20-year  lease sought by the shipyard.  </P> <P> Harbor-area Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who chairs the committee, said she  was particularly sensitive to Southwest Marine's position, because it is the  last large shipyard in the harbor.  </P></p>

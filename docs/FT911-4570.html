			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / From doldrums to new dawn: The turnaround at MGN The numbers cannot lie,' Mr Robert Maxwell, the publisher, said yesterday at the marketing launch for the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers. Its flagship, the Daily Mirror, may be famous for its pithy words and punchy pictures but it was the numbers that held sway - money paid, money invested, money made. Mr Maxwell is trying to raise about Pounds 250m from floating 45-49 per cent of the company partly to pay off debt of more than Pounds 200m. The irony is that Mr Maxwell, long thwarted in his attempts to become a national newspaper owner, was only able to buy the Mirror group in 1984 because S G Warburg, the merchant bank, had advised its then owner, Reed International, that it could not go ahead with a flotation. He paid Pounds 113m for the group, but Pounds 23m of that was an inter-company loan, so the real price was Pounds 90m. On top of that the premises were then estimated to be worth Pounds 10m. In the final year of its previous ownership operating profits at the Mirror group had been Pounds 4.3m on sales of Pounds 274m. Last year operating profits were Pounds 88.3m on sales of Pounds 445m. When Mr Maxwell took over the group, it seemed as if the best days of the Daily Mirror were far behind it. It had sold The Sun to Mr Rupert Murdoch, thus creating a ferocious competitor. Reed has since admitted that it did not feel able to take on the apparently invincible print unions and their exorbitant costs. In pre-Maxwell days, the Mirror's headquarters in London's Holborn were called a 'mink-lined coffin', a reference to the newspaper's image as a declining title that was still overspending. Its transformation has been remarkable. In January 1986 Mr Maxwell reached agreement with the print unions - backed by closure threats - to shed 2,100 jobs, nearly two months before Mr Murdoch's dramatic move of his titles to Wapping. Costs have gradually been squeezed by Mr Maxwell's home-grown management. The operating profit margin rose from 14.6 per cent in 1988 to 19.8 per cent in 1990. Since 1985 the full-time labour force on MGN titles - including the Sunday Mirror, People, Scottish Daily Record, Sunday Mail and Sporting Life  -has fallen from a yearly average of 7,235 to 3,726 last year. Apart from his deal with the print unions, Mr Maxwell has made at least one other key contribution to the turnround of the group's fortunes. He spotted very early the importance of colour to the future of popular newspapers. He was nearly two years ahead of Mr Murdoch when he introduced colour in 1988. This move has sustained group advertising revenue in the face of the sharpest recession for a decade. Mr Maxwell exuded optimism yesterday about the future of the popular press and clearly does not take kindly to anyone who suggests otherwise. In January, Mr Roy Greenslade, then editor of the Daily Mirror, told UK Press Gazette, the newspaper industry journal, that he worried about its future. Mr Maxwell revealed that this unauthorised pessimism was one reason the two parted company last month. But the overall picture seems to support Mr Greenslade. It is one of declining circulation, internecine rivalry and increasing competition from television. Mr Maxwell's Pounds 500m investment in re-organisation and colour presses and inserting equipment has meant, however, that the Daily Mirror has had a smaller fall in circulation than The Sun. In 1988 The Sun had average sales of 4.184m compared with the Daily Mirror's 3.119m; the Daily Record was at 771,000. In 1990 the Daily Mirror was at 3.109m, the Daily Record on 778,000 and The Sun had slipped to 3.896m. In the first quarter of this year the Daily Mirror on 2.988m and the Daily Record on 769,000 were together just ahead of The Sun with a circulation that had fallen to 3.739m. Despite its gentle circulation slide the Daily Mirror still has a 24.5 per cent share of the national popular newspaper market and operating profits are up for the first quarter of this year compared with the same quarter last year. The improved performance has come from increased cover prices, the appeal of colour to advertisers, and inserting. Two things are unlikely to change at a publicly quoted Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr Robert Maxwell will still be around despite his purchase of the New York Daily News which could be offered for sale to MGN before the year is out. His part-time commitment to MGN as chairman 'would likely be whatever an ordinary man does on a full-time basis', he said. The Mirror titles would also continue to support the Labour party unless it fell 'yet again' into the hands of people who do not understand democracy. Labour had at last seen things the Daily Mirror and Mr Maxwell's way, and had embraced Europe, rejected unilateral disarmament and shown the door to the hard left. 'I played a small part in bringing them to heel or to book,' said the MGN chairman.</p>

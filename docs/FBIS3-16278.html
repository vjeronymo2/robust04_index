Aldoshina report; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The government is apparently to get involved in  solving the problems of reciprocal nonpayments between  enterprises. [First Deputy Prime Minister] Oleg Soskovets  announced at a news conference today that this is really a  problem for enterprise managers to resolve. The first deputy  prime minister is of the view that nonpayments are the result of  poor management and badly organized relations between suppliers  and consumers.    As for the wage arrears in a number of industries, the  Ministry of Labor has been instructed to investigate and to take  measures. Soskovets reiterated that the government intends to  strengthen the role of the state in economic development. It is  not yet clear how this will look in practice, as Oleg Soskovets  was not inclined to talk specifics. He answered questions with  either platitudes or statements such as: The government is  studying this problem, or the government is working on this.    Incidentally, Soskovets' meeting with journalists today was  the first of a series of news conferences on the implentation of  the program of economic reforms in the period up to 1995. We  will probably hear specific answers to all issues later.</p>

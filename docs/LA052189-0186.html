			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APPLAUSE, 11 BY CAROL MUSKE  </P> <P> What happens to that youthful formality of purpose?  </P> <P> (I feel like I'm lost, do you? Listening to everyone  </P> <P> applauding a play I missed.) Spring here in L.A. today,  </P> <P> ninety or so, everything in bloom. I drive my four-  </P> <P> year-old to preschool and turn off Santa Monica  </P> <P> into a stakeout. Top-lit cop cars jacknifed onto lawns,  </P> <P> a chopper churning the smog, an amplified voice:  </P> <P> Give up while you can. Come out with your hands raised.  </P> <P> My kid doesn't look up from her book, The Big Orange Splot.  </P> <P> All the hyper-tense police phrasing doesn't phase her.  </P> <P> I stare at a woman on the curb, solemnly applauding  </P> <P> the police -- as if this is a film set. Perhaps it is  </P> <P> But who's in that house? Finally, we're allowed to pass,  </P> <P> the choppers hang and sway. Who was in that house?  </P> <P> I woke, wondering, today, and who's in my life in this aftershock, L.A.?  </P> <P> </P> <P> From "Applause" (University of Pittsburgh Press: $16.95, cloth; $8.95, paper;  53 pp.). Muske, who lives in Los Angeles, is the author of several collections  of poetry and, most recently, a novel, "Dear Digby" (Viking). (See review on  Page 3.) The title poem of the collection, whose title is taken from a  photographic exhibit by Holly Wright, has 12 parts of which the 11th is  reproduced above. Carol Muske, 1989.

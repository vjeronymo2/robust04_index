The distinguishing feature of Russia's foreign trade in 1993  has been the rise in exports (despite the economic recession)  accompanied by a drastic reduction of imports.    Russia's foreign trade turnover from January-October 1993  accounted for a total of 46.9 billion dollars (exports--31.4,  imports--15.5 billion dollars). The industrially developed  countries accounted for 40% of exports (18.8 billion  dollars),  developing countries--for 9.4% (4.4 billion dollars), and  the  share of ex-CMEA countries--17.5% (8.2 billion dollars).  However the favourable quantitative result provides no grounds  for positive assessments of foreign trade or its influence on  the country's economy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The fuel and raw materials component of exports, above all,  owing to a noticeable expansion of exports of non-renewable  resources, continues to grow. Oil exports in 10 months grew by  28%, oil products--40%, and timber--39%.  Exports of pig iron  grew by 20%, aluminium--35%, and  ammonia--29%.    To preserve the present export growth rates in terms of  value, it is necessary to increase its volume in natural terms  at higher rates, since the average export prices are  substantially reduced. But considering the grave situation in  Russia's fuel and energy sector, serious difficulties in  ensuring its domestic requirements, the conclusion can be drawn  on the increasing instability of the country's export base.    To keep imports at a low level means to entail a  considerable  reduction of purchases, above all, of food. The marked  curtailment of the purchases of machines and equipment (by  5.2%) leads to a lessening influence on the development of  domestic production and becomes ineffective for the country.  Besides, foreign economic activity is characterized by the  intensive development of barter, which spells serious losses of  hard currency for the country.    Yet another negative tendency is the rupture of ties with  many partners which held a leading place in Russia's foreign  trade, above all, with former CMEA member-countries. And the  drive to increase at all costs the volume of exports to foreign  countries negatively affects supplies to the ex-Soviet  republics--Russia is losing very important markets.    The factors that have shaped in Russia's foreign trade in  1993 will, most probably, aggravate the situation still more in  the future. It can be predicted with confidence that foreign  trade turnover will fall. It is quite possible that already in  the first quarter of 1994, because of the need to increase the  supplies of fuel and energy resources for domestic needs,  exports will fall.</p>

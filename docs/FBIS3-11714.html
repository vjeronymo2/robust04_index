Iglesias met with  Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia to discuss the matter.    [Begin Iglesias recording] An established mechanism was  implemented, but it seems that the delay caused some problems,  as the fruit could have spoiled. But there were no serious  problems at all, nor any violations of the mechanisms of the  economic supplementation agreement. [end recording]    Iglesias could not determine the specific problem, as there  was no technical explanation.    He was told that labels written in English had been the  origin of the problem, and that Argentine officials rejected  them as they must all be written in Spanish.    [Begin Iglesias recording] Yes, this issue was discussed.  The economic supplementation agreement provides norms for  quality, quantity, and containers. But the quality of the fruit  was not mentioned at all. [end recording]    When asked if he could assure that this problem would not  jeopardize the economic supplementation agreement, he said:    [Begin Iglesias recording] On the contrary, it is working  better than ever, and there is no major problem that could  prevent it from being implemented. I think this mechanism shows  that problems are solved within 48 hours, as has happened with  other cases. Argentina is also concerned about the possible  dumping of flour, a situation that is regarded as incorrect. It  seems that some sectors are claiming that Argentina is  distorting the economic supplementation agreement mechanism. I  have asked Buenos Aires for more information. I do not think  this position is correct. [end recording]    Iglesias concluded by saying that this case of trucks loaded  with fruit had been resolved, but that they would be on constant  alert about the situation.    Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, in turn, told the  Argentine ambassador that the problems that fruit exporters were  experiencing in Argentina could lead to possible actions that  could hamper bilateral commercial development.    Garcia met with Iglesias, with whom he discussed other major  issues.    [Begin Garcia recording] We also analyzed the need to review  the economic supplementation agreement agreed upon by Chile and  Argentina taking into account the Common Market of the South,  Mercosur, agreements. This year all Mercosur member countries  will have to maintain equal treatment of third countries, and  this obviously could lead to changes in the bilateral agreements  with Argentina. We have already agreed to begin talks so as to  avoid surprises that the changes in reciprocities demanded by  Mercosur could imply for our bilateral agreement. [end  recording]    As for the specific problems, Garcia said that Iglesias  suggested that the quality standards required of Chilean  exporters do not imply any discrimination, as these must also be  observed by local producers and other foreign partners.  Concerning the trucks loaded with fruit, Garcia told Iglesias  that the problem was caused by the shortage of employees in  Chilean customs, which compelled exporters to take their  products to other zones. This entailed a delay of three days,  which for economic reasons they could not tolerate. Garcia noted  the need to prevent mutually harmful actions.    [Begin Garcia recording] This hampers the full development  of  the trade agreement. Iglesias completely agreed that we had to  avoid at any cost this type of situation, and act in keeping  with our common decision. [end recording]    Garcia concluded by saying that Iglesias was not fully aware  of the incident, and promised to soon try to determine the  causes.</p>

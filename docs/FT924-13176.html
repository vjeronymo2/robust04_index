			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (5): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, Michael Heseltine said on the Today radio programme (October 15) that one of the reasons for buying gas and converting the power stations is that it would be cheaper for the consumer. The electricity industry, like other businessmen, had to go out and buy the cheapest option. Has nobody ever told him, 'Cheap is dear'? I would have preferred to have paid a little more for my electricity than see the coal industry die, the resultant unemployment and inevitable consequences.

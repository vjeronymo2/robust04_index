			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Tokyo reels under relentless US probing: Finance officials have endured a grilling on macro-economic policy MENTION of Professor Larry Summers, the US economist, prompts Japanese finance ministry officials to shake their heads, draw a deep breath and mutter: 'That is all very sensitive at the moment.' Prof Summers is responsible for the Clinton administration's policy on international economic co-ordination. The sensitivity is caused by the novel way he has introduced himself to his Japanese colleagues. He has been behind the dispatch of a long list of detailed questions about the inner workings of Japanese economic policy. These are not just idle inquiries. They signal an attention to Japanese policy which has unsettled the assured elite bureaucrats at the finance ministry. Japanese officials expected the Clinton administration to take a more assertive approach in cutting Japan's rising trade surplus. They were not prepared for questioning on the contents of their macro-economic plans, which suggests economic policy could become as contentious as trade policy in US relations with Japan. The US and Japan differ on several important questions. Tokyo argues the economy has been given a significant boost through the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency spending package agreed last year combined with the 1993 budget. Most of the increased spending is financed by higher public sector investment by the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme (FILP), which is funded by savings deposited through the postal system. The Tokyo finance ministry says this investment would not have been undertaken without government action. The US is sceptical. It argues that the postal savings would have been invested anyway, via the banking system, to provide savers with a return. The government may have merely diverted this investment from a private to a public sector channel into the economy. As a result the US and Japan will differ over the extent of the stimulus provided by FILP- financed programmes. The Japanese government argues that last year's package was worth about 2.3 per cent of gross national product. About Y4,000bn was financed by the FILP. The US estimates the package was worth less than 1 per cent of GNP. Finance ministry officials want to use the FILP to fund a large part of the package being planned, which could be worth Y14,000bn. The US has signalled that it will not take this figure at face value. This scepticism will put the finance ministry under pressure to tap other sources of finance such as higher government borrowing. The finance ministry argues that the 1993 budget is a discretionary expansion because it is not attempting to make up for falling tax revenues by cutting spending. Officials say that in effect they are cutting taxes. The US is likely to point to last year's OECD report on the Japanese economy which said the fall in tax revenue should be regarded as an automatic adjustment to slower growth rather than a discretionary easing of policy. The US favours standardised international measures, used by the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, to assess whether policy is expansionary. These suggest that Japan has substantial room to expand public spending. The OECD says the Japanese general government financial surplus - central and local government combined with social security funds - was worth 1.7 per cent of GDP last year, compared with a deficit of 4.8 per cent in the US and 2.9 per cent in Germany. This suggests Japan could increase spending without excessive borrowing. Japan's net government debt is less than 10 per cent of GDP while the OECD average is more than 30 per cent. However, Tokyo insists the government is in surplus only if its social security fund, worth about 3.5 per cent of GDP, is included in the calculation. Japan argues that this fund is made up of savings put aside to pay the pensions of a population which is ageing more rapidly than in any other OECD country. The Japanese argue that, if these future liabilities are taken into account, the government would be in substantial deficit, a point which the OECD itself has recently accepted. The finance ministry argues that Japan is further penalised because international measures exclude the deficits of public corporations which are a significant tool of economic policy in Japan. Public corporations such as the Japan Highway Public Corporation and the JNR railway corporation account for about a fifth of public works spending. Their deficit, which was worth about 0.4 per cent of GNP in 1990, is rising rapidly to finance spending on bridges and roads throughout Japan. When Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrives in Washington on April 15 for talks with President Clinton he will unveil a plan with an impressive price tag. But he will find he is facing a much more critical audience than in the past. Moreover, these differences over macro-economic policy are unlikely to fade quickly. Indeed they may cast a shadow over the Group of Seven summit of industrialised countries to be held in Tokyo in July. Japan is opposed to a concerted G7 approach to stimulating world growth. President Clinton has made it clear he favours a 'global growth strategy.' Over the past few years Japan has grudgingly become used to the US probing aspects of its business culture in an attempt to open up the Japanese market. It may have to get used to some of the same treatment in its macro-economic policy as well.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway accused of 20% subsidy on salmon farming A study of Norwegian salmon farming by the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young has concluded that over the past five years the industry has enjoyed a 20 per cent subsidy on its cost of production from the Norwegian government. The study also shows that over that period the Norwegian industry has consistently lost money. The losses have mostly been absorbed by the four big banks, which since 1991 have come under the control of the government. A further expected surge in Norwegian salmon output is likely to be financed by the government and its associated banks. Ernst &amp; Young says that Norway's high level of production at low prices could not have been achieved without direct grants and subsidies to producers; loans and guarantees awarded but subsequently written off; overpayments to the statutory marketing organisation, the debts of which were later written off by the government; and the continuing bankrolling of fish farming by the state-controlled banks. The Scottish Salmon Growers Association and Sir William Lithgow, a leading businessman, commissioned the study in response to the crisis in the Scottish salmon industry, caused, they say, by Norwegian over-production and dumping. It intends to use the report to press the UK government to take stronger action against Norway through the European Union, and to stimulate an EU investigation into unfair subsidies to fish farmers by the Norwegian government. It has already complained to the EU that Norway is dumping salmon. Because of a surge in Norway's production, salmon prices in the EU collapsed last October. Norway produced 180,000 tonnes of salmon in 1983 compared with Scotland's 45,000 tonnes. Some 85 per cent of Norwegian salmon is exported to the EU. In November the EU imposed a minimum import price of Pounds 2.64 a kilogram, but Scottish farmers said this was insufficient to restore their profitability. Last weekend the minimum import price was increased to Pounds 2.74. The study says that the Norwegian salmon industry received more than Pounds 230m in state subsidies over the past four years. The money came principally from Norway's Industrial and Regional Development Fund, which made loans that were not repaid and guaranteed 50 per cent of bank loans on which the fish farmers defaulted. In addition the Norwegian government in 1991 wrote off the Pounds 177m debts of the Fish Sales Organisation, the statutory salmon marketing body which, the study says, had been overpaying salmon farmers for their fish. A further Pounds 35m was spent financing a programme to freeze salmon and sell them outside the EU. The report points out that following a series of banking crises up to 1992, the state now controls the four biggest Norwegian banks and through them 50 per cent of the salmon industry. It suggests that the bank-controlled and bank-financed farms are effectively being 'bank-rolled pending a return to more favourable market conditions'. It calculates that direct subsidies averaged Pounds 295 a tonne in 1991 and 1992, while the writing off of the debts of the FOS was worth another Pounds 172 a tonne, making a total subsidy of Pounds 467 a tonne. That was 20 per cent of Norwegian farmers' average cost, calculated by the Norwegian consultants Kontali, of Pounds 2,370 a tonne. The Norwegian government has consistently denied allegations of unfair subsidies and dumping. It argues that it makes no specific subsidies to salmon farmers and that the general subsidies available are in accordance with EU rules on state aid. Its assistance to the freezing programme was to the benefit of Scottish as well as Norwegian farmers.</p>

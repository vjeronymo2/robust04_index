			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Hotel pay 'rises 3% or more' Many of Britain's biggest hotel chains and catering companies have raised the wages of their low-paid workers by 3 per cent or more since the government's abolition of the wages councils last year, says a study published today. The findings by Incomes Data Services appear to contradict fears that the end of statutory protection for the low paid would encourage employers to drive down wages in weakly organised sectors such as hotels and catering. Mr Chris Pond, head of the independent Low Pay Unit, said yesterday that it showed big companies were 'using their market power to gain a competitive edge by attracting the best staff available'. The report found minimum pay rates covering more than 10,000 employees in hotels had been raised by at least the rate of inflation to Pounds 3.07 an hour, maintaining in real terms the minimum set down by the wages council for the industry before its demise last year. The report says that many companies in catering have frozen minimum rates or introduced new lower starting rates for staff, using the cost savings made to provide higher rises for more experienced staff. A report published today by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux says pay and conditions of employment have deteriorated in recent months for a growing number of people working in London. The report, based on evidence of employment problems from 48 local bureaux in the capital, shows that the abolition of the wages councils and erosion of employment protection have driven down wages in many small companies. The report found that wages have fallen as low as Pounds 1 an hour for some catering jobs. It says employers are replacing permanent staff with workers on short-term contracts to prevent them reaching the two-year qualifying threshold for employment protection. The report says employers in London are withdrawing holiday and sick pay, imposing commission-only work and breaching health and safety regulations. 'With no protection against unfair dismissal, many workers are faced with a choice between accepting less pay and longer hours or the sack,' it says. The report calls for a reduction in the two-year qualifying period for protection against unfair dismissal to at least its pre-1979 level of six months. Report No 677.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (3): Searching for funds  -Corporate Borrowing KOREA'S leading corporate names are pressing for freedom to tap international capital markets in order to reduce funding costs and improve the competitiveness of their products. The cheaper borrowing available in the international bond markets is particularly attractive to Korea's high-tech companies which need to invest heavily in research and development to compete at an international level. Korean companies have tapped international capital markets with a growing number of issues since the mid-1980s. Overseas securities offerings peaked in 1991 as Korean companies raised a total of Dollars 1.06bn in convertible bonds, bonds with warrants and depositary receipts, according to the Securities Supervisory Board. So far this year, companies such as Pohang Iron &amp; Steel (Posco), one of the world's largest steelmakers, and Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) have borrowed in the Yankee bond market and others are lining up to follow suit. However, Korean companies complain about government restrictions on overseas borrowing: the business community has been lobbying for the removal of all controls as the Ministry of Finance proceeds with the liberalisation of the domestic financial markets. At present, Korean companies may only tap the international capital markets if the proceeds are used either for investment in their overseas operations or to finance the import of advanced technology unavailable in Korea. The proceeds may not be repatriated for the financing of domestic operations. While officials at the Ministry of Finance are well aware of the benefits of lower funding costs to Korea's leading corporate names, they remain concerned about the possible effect of such borrowing on the Korean economy. The restrictions reflect government concern that the money raised abroad would be transferred back to Korea, increasing the money supply. The government is determined to curb inflation and has set its M-2 money supply growth target at 18.5 per cent for the year. To tap international capital markets, companies need permission from the Ministry of Finance and, at present, corporate demand exceeds the amount permitted, according to investment bankers in Seoul. Domestic sources of financing remain limited or relatively expensive for borrowers. The weak state of the stock market has made it difficult for companies to issue large domestic share offerings. The cost of borrowing in the domestic bond market remains relatively high, even though three-year corporate bond yields have fallen from over 19 per cent at the end of 1991 to below 13 per cent in October. Meanwhile bank loans are subject to guidelines on credit allocation and so are not always easy to obtain. For high-tech companies such as Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest electronics group, and Hyundai Motor, the car manufacturer, which need to invest large amounts in research and development, the high cost of funding in the domestic markets can prove a handicap. 'The availability of funds is one of our main problems, as well as the cost of funds,' says Mr Young-Key Hwang, executive director and group treasurer at the Samsung Group. He reckons that the cost of funds in the international capital markets approaches 8.5 to 9 per cent, while domestic bond yields are still in double digits. The result could well be to force Korean companies to curb capital expenditure and focus on the rationalisation of their businesses.</p>

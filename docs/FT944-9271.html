			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: CE Heath hit by direct line costs The cost of entering the direct line insurance business and accounting vagaries at an Australian associate depressed profits at CE Heath for the six months to the end of September. The pre-tax figure fell from Pounds 14.9m - inflated by a Pounds 3.25m exceptional item - to Pounds 6.37m. Turnover on continuing operations was little changed at Pounds 81.5m (Pounds 81.5m). Heath's Premium Search telephone broking business incurred losses of Pounds 1.6m during its first four months of operation, with Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, forecasting that the full-year deficit would be about Pounds 4m. He anticipated that the business, which is likely to employ up to 400 people, would move into profit in 1996. Mr Presland denied that the company had left it too late to enter the direct line market. 'There is a big market out there for this kind of service and it is going to get bigger as more and more people look for their insurance needs away from the high street.' CE Heath International Holdings, the group's Australian associate in which it holds a 23 per cent stake, saw its profit contribution drop from Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.2m. The company blamed the fall on the halving of its stake, and Australian accounting rules which make the company reflect all investment gains and losses in its profit and loss account. Losses from the New York underwriting business widened from Pounds 450,000 to nearly Pounds 1m, although the company added that the subsidiary's book of agricultural business had been sold and the losses would not recur. Profits from the computing services division rose 26 per cent to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 2.14m). Earnings per share dropped 46 per cent to 5.9p (10.9p). The interim dividend is maintained at 5p. The shares rose 13p to 232p. COMMENT Heath's chunky dividend, currently yielding nearly 9 per cent, should limit any downside for the shares. However, in the short-term it is difficult to see where any sustained earnings growth is likely to come from. With its broking operations under pressure, underwriting contributions declining and the direct line service in its formative stages, it is only the fairly limited contribution from computer services which can be counted on. Worth holding for the yield, and on the off-chance a predator might swing into view.</p>

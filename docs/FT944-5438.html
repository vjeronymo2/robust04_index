			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Sinn Fein ready to discuss IRA arms as part of full Ulster deal Sinn Fein is prepared to discuss the crucial question of the disposal of IRA weapons - but only in the context of an overall settlement in Northern Ireland, one of the organisation's leading political strategists said yesterday. The disclosure by Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein's northern chairman, came as the Northern Ireland Office announced that next week's talks with the IRA's political wing had been put back 48 hours to December 9 at Sinn Fein's request. Whitehall officials said last night that they had been given no explanation for the delay, beyond being told that the Sinn Fein delegation wanted more time to prepare. Meanwhile, it emerged that Mr McLaughlin is among six Sinn Fein councillors who have been invited to an important Belfast investment conference to be launched by the prime minister on December 13 and 14. It was initially decided that Sinn Fein would not be invited to attend the conference. But the government appeared to change its stance after several US institutions threatened to boycott it. Mr McLaughlin said Sinn Fein was 'prepared, perfectly prepared, to discuss the issue of the amount of weapons that are in circulation in Ireland, both legal and illegal'. But he said the weapons question had to be resolved in the context of discussions on 'the political conditions in Ireland and how we can replace those failed political structures with agreed political structures'. The British government wants the issue of paramilitary arsenals to be addressed in the preliminary talks due to begin next week and not in future political negotiations to which Sinn Fein and loyalist representatives may in time be admitted. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday that preliminary discussions 'must elicit proposals for the disposal of arms and explosives'. Mr John Major, the prime minister, used a speech to the Conservative Women's conference in London yesterday to confirm that the government would also begin talks with loyalist political representatives before Christmas.

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: Polaroid improves to Dollars 35.5m POLAROID, the US photography group, unveiled a 32.5 per cent improvement in second-quarter net income to Dollars 35.5m from Dollars 26.8m a year earlier. Polaroid's 1991 results were distorted by a pre-tax gain of Dollars 11m which was partly offset by preferred dividend payments of Dollars 10.1m. The company retired its preferred stock towards the end of 1991, so there were no preferred dividend payments in the latest quarter. Polaroid had primary earnings per share of 74 cents in the latest quarter against 33 cents last year. Sales advanced 7 per cent to Dollars 557.7m from Dollars 521.4m. US sales grew 4 per cent to Dollars 300.6m, while international sales rose 11 per cent to Dollars 257.1m, due partly to a weaker US dollar. Mr I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's chairman and chief executive, has not changed the company's earnings projections for the full year. 'We still believe we can meet our 1992 financial goals and deliver a level of profitability that approximates 1991's operating performance,' he said. He added that the company was tightly managing expenditures because of the uncertain and difficult worldwide economy. Polaroid will incur higher marketing expenses when it launches two new products later this year. The company benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the latest quarter of 34 per cent, compared with 44 per cent the previous year. Polaroid said shipments of all of its significant product lines increased during the quarter. For the first half, Polaroid had net income of Dollars 41.7m, or 86 cents, against Dollars 43.2m, or 46 cents in the same period of 1991. Sales rose 3 per cent to Dollars 989m.</p>

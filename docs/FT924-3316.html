			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Lionhope scheme to be scaled down BACKERS OF a controversial Pounds 500m package of commercial and residential developments in one of the south-east's unemployment blackspots are proposing a scaled-down version to address environmental objections, Andrew Baxter writes. Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, and Citibank, the US bank, are discussing with the government, councils and environmental groups a new version of the Lionhope plan on and around the Isle of Sheppey in north-east Kent. The 'son of Lionhope' proposal is the latest move in a saga that began with the administrative receivership in 1989 of the developer Lionhope (Kent), which devised the original project. The plans were rejected in July by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, after a public inquiry in 1990 during which environmentalists condemned the effect on local wildlife. In September, Touche Ross - Lionhope's receiver - said it would challenge the decision in the High Court. The projects' promoters have been discussing revised proposals with Kent County Council, Swale Borough Council, English Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The revised plan, based on four sites, still hopes to create 9,000 jobs, and a big expansion of Sheerness Dock, remains mostly unchanged.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / UK Company News: OFT to investigate Healthcall charges The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate allegations of anti-competitive practices by Healthcall, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors which came to the stock market in May. The OFT said yesterday that it would make 'some preliminary inquiries' into charges regarding Healthcall's relationship with the British Medical Association and its treatment of potential competitors. Mr Maurice Henchey, Healthcall's chief executive, dismissed the allegations as the work of 'political activists who accuse of us of privatising the National Health Service by the back door'. He denied suggestions that Healthcall threatens to cut off its service to doctors immediately it hears that they are planning to set up a duty doctors' co-operative in competition. 'But if we find that they are approaching our staff or deputies, we will make their lives difficult,' he said. Healthcall's duty doctor service, started almost 30 years ago, provides GPs with the out-of-hours cover they are obliged to supply.</p>

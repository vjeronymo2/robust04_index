			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Moscow warns on latest MMM offering The Russian government was moving anxiously yesterday to distance itself from what promises to be an intriguing 'second act' of the MMM investment fund crisis, which could begin today. The controversial financial pyramid scheme, which appeared to be on the verge of collapse after a raid by tax police earlier this month, has announced that today it will reopen its offices and offer new 'MMM tickets' for sale. The Ministry of Finance, which has come under fierce criticism for its failure to stop the sale of MMM shares earlier this year, yesterday issued a strongly worded warning about the new, heavily advertised, 'tickets'. The original MMM share scheme, which attracted more than 1m investors, collapsed earlier in the summer and police have arrested the fund's founder. The ministry said the new 'tickets' were merely 'pretty postcards' and had no official status as stocks. Investors in the tickets 'should not expect to receive any revenues'. Potential investors were warned that merely purchasing a stock did not entitle them to shareholder rights. To enjoy full rights as a share owner, the ministry cautioned, the stock must be formally registered at an independent stock-registry office. This caution indicates that that Russia's byzantine financial regulations, which have proved confusing to many sophisticated western investors, could be part of the reason why so many Russians have been seduced by the simple sales pitches of the investment funds. As the MMM fund, which authorities have described as a 'classic pyramid operation', prepared for what could be a remarkable resurrection, the state intensified its campaign against similar schemes throughout Russia. The infectious popularity of funds like MMM, which promise immediate and swift returns, presents a dilemma for the Russian government which hopes to encourage the growth of capital markets but fears a public backlash if capitalism is seen to bring impoverishment rather than prosperity. Legitimate stockbrokers worry that the government will also turn its new-found interventionist zeal to the booming stock market. But popular rage over failing investment schemes is mounting. Over the weekend, according to Moscow radio, disgruntled investors in the Russki Dom Selenga, a central Russian fund whose operations were frozen last week, smashed the windows of a branch of the fund in the Siberian city of Cheliabinsk. The government, seeking to rebuild credibility in the wake of the MMM scandal, has stepped up its attack on Russki Dom Selenga, which company officials say has more than 1.5m investors. Over the weekend, tax police seized Rbs13bn (Pounds 4m) in cash from the Russki Dom Selenga branch in the city of Ufa, in the Urals. Similar financial crises could be brewing in other former Soviet republics. The Alex Company, an investment fund in Azerbaijan, closed its doors earlier this month, leaving investors penniless, but the Vahid fund, which claims one quarter of the Azeri population as shareholders, is still doing a booming business. One in 10 citizens in neighbouring Georgia have put their money in a local pyramid scheme, hoping to protect their savings from Georgia's hyper-inflation.</p>

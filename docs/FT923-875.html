			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (7): Sector faces big marketing challenge - Surveys reveal contrasting perceptions on the role of venture capital companies THERE is a consensus among venture capital companies that they need to market themselves more intelligently, but that consensus tends to fragment when they tackle the multiplicity of methods available for marketing. The British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) has stimulated the industry debate over marketing, through the results of three surveys conducted on its behalf in mid-1991 by the London Business School. The results of the surveys disclosed a startling mis-match between the image of venture capital companies - very positive - and their perceived importance as a source of long-term funding - relatively low. While the bulk of the entrepreneurs and intermediaries who participated in the surveys described venture capitalists very positively - 'shrewd, well-connected, approachable, experienced and creative' - those without experience of using it ranked venture capital low on their list of preferred sources of long-term capital, behind (in descending order) banks, individual investors and corporate investors. But of those entrepreneurs who had used venture capital, 98 per cent said they would recommend it as a first port of call in future. Helen Walsh, former marketing manager of County Natwest, now with the BVCA, believes the venture capital industry in the UK is facing a series of marketing challenges in its second decade, brought about by a variety of circumstances, not least the recession. 'County Natwest Ventures in the first six months of this year had some 1,400 introductions, of which only 2 per cent were completed. That leads to huge waste of time. For the industry generally, it is not the marketing of the initial transaction which needs to be improve upon, it is the quality of the deal. They need to work on marketing as an an educational task, to get people to understand what venture capital is. The three segments of the venture capital industry - the captives, the semi-captives and the independents - have rather similar marketing tasks, dominated by two concerns; attracting funds and attracting the right deals. Fund-raising is less problematic for captives such as County Natwest Ventures, but finding the right deals requires clever marketing; 30-40 per cent of its deal flow comes from the National Westminster bank branch network. It needs to be highly systematic in the way it markets itself to branch bank managers, in order to sure that they will think of County Natwest Ventures first when the top-quality deal passes across their desk. Semi-captives, managing funds from both parent institutions and also funds raised independently, fight on two fronts, as do the independents. Both need to make sure they are listened toby the pension funds which source the bulk of the investment. Independents, generally with smaller staff levels, need also to ensure that the indispensable personal networks of both intermediaries and pension fund managers are with the right people, and, having located them, that such networks are well-fostered. Smaller venture capital companies, such as the captive Guinness Mahon Development Capital, have as a priority not just avoiding time-wasting on investigating deals which will not complete, but also to build a clear identity as a niche-player; in its case, in publishing, educational and merchandising. Guinness Mahon's team is also constructing other marketing ploys as a means of defining itself, weeding out the obvious non-starter deals, and concentrating both its and potential clients' minds. For Christopher Woodward, marketing director of 3i, marketing is 'one of those unfortunate terms that means a hundred different things to a hundred different people. Particularly in the financial services sector, its strategic role is often misunderstood - it's too often confused with 'let's do some advertising.' But marketing has to start with an appreciation of the marketplace, requiring quite a bit of research, going on to a segmentation of the market - not being all things to all people.' In one sense, 3i learnt about marketing the hard way; between 1945 and 1980 it faced little competition in the market, but very quickly in the 1980s that competition boomed from being a handful to more than a hundred; 3i's response was to rationalise its several businesses into one, develop a corporate image and logo, and present a new, branded image to the world. With hindsight, that was probably a triumph of style over strategy. In 1986, Christopher Woodward joined 3i and insisted on the development of a strategy  -'I said at the time that we had to develop a systematic rationale for what we stand for, as opposed to others, and create in the minds of potential users the belief that 3i is more likely to be a successful investment partner than the others.' Differentiation is thus a crucial marketing first step, no matter what the size of the player. Advertising may play a part in that, but it can be a gamble probably best left to the larger, more generalist players, such as 3i, who have the resources to cope with the flood of deal offers it is likely to generate. 3i does about 1,000 deals annually, 500 of those new business. Christoper Woodward reckons 3i needs about 50,000 inquiries a year to meet that target, and many of those inquiries are inspired by 3i's direct mail marketing, via its regular bulletin called QED, which goes out to 10,000 clients - 'if you have established a target database, you must send out a message to that database every six to 12 weeks, otherwise they forget you,' says Woodward. So there are a few nuggets of guidance for the venture capitalists considering the whys and wherefores of marketing The whole purpose of marketing in this industry is to optimise quality deal-flow. There are a lot of deals around, but the quality ones are increasingly difficult to find. Building a relationship with intermediaries while the deal is still just a gleam in someone's eye can best be done by the 'softer' marketing methods - arranging seminars, careful public relations, regular communications. Venture capital is still a weak fourth choice for companies seeking investment which have never used venture capital; but for those which have used venture capital, it is a strong first choice. Bridging that perception gulf is a big marketing task for any venture capital company. Don't create unrealistic expectations - woolly marketing messages will only disappoint all sides of the deal.</p>

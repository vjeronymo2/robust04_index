			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Water supply reliability improves WATER SUPPLIES are more reliable than last year, with fewer interruptions and cuts in pressure, Ofwat, the water industry regulator, reported yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. The number of people affected by hosepipe bans and other restrictions was 6.7m in the 12 months to July this year compared with 21m in the 12 months to July last year, in spite of a continued lack of rain. Ofwat also reported that the risks of sewers flooding had fallen as a result of the companies' big modernisation programme. It warned, however, that past figures may have underestimated customer service problems. Wessex results, Page 16</p>

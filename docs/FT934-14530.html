			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Moscow slated over rights: 'Campaign against ethnic minorities' criticised by Helsinki group THE RUSSIAN government has carried out 'widespread' human rights violations and used its emergency powers to conduct a campaign against ethnic minorities in Moscow, according to an international human rights organisation. Speaking in Moscow, representatives of the Helsinki Watch group said thousands were detained, and many beaten, during the past 10 days. The allegations came as President Boris Yeltsin said Russia would hold a referendum on a new constitution on December 12 and prosecutors started presenting charges against the main leaders of an armed attempt to overthrow him. Interfax news agency said the General Prosecutor's office had started pressing charges of organising mass disturbances against former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi and ex-parliament chief Ruslan Khasbulatov. Several other rebel leaders were being charged with the same offence, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years' jail. About 17,000 'immigrants', 90 per cent of them from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, have been driven out of Moscow in what the city's authorities claim is an attempt to defeat crime. In an ironic throwback to pre-perestroika days, 7,000 people were forcibly detained and expelled under emergency powers which allow the police to expel anyone without a legal 'residence permit'. Another 10,000, the police say, have left 'voluntarily', fearing they would be caught by random police searches and police appeals to Moscow's citizens to report on illegal immigrants. Mr Yuri Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow, indicated the authorities were preparing to extend some of the controls by introducing a new 'visa regime' to replace the state of emergency, intended to be lifted on Monday. He said the moves had the full backing of Mr Yeltsin, and welcomed them as a chance for Russian traders, selling cabbage, to replace Caucasian traders with their 'exotic fruits'. who have traditionally dominated the Moscow fruit market. The markets have been left half empty as the traders from the Caucasus have fled. Polls show the drive against ethnic minorities has been highly popular with Russians, who blame the Caucasians for rising crime. However, human rights groups and the Georgian, Azerbaijani and Armenian embassies yesterday insisted that most of those expelled had been political refugees or honest businessmen.</p>

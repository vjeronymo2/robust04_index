			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: MIN may sue over football club dispute Writs are expected to fly today in the feud between Birmingham City Football Club and Midland Independent Newspapers, the publishing group which is set to float next month. MIN is expected to sue either Mr David Sullivan, publisher of the Sunday Sport and majority owner of the football club, or Ms Karren Brady, Birmingham City's managing director, for libel. The action arises from anonymous documents which have been circulated raising questions over the readerships of individual newspapers and company transactions with directors. The dispute is likely to be included as a contingent liability in MIN's prospectus, following comments from Ms Brady and Mr Sullivan that they would seek a boycott of the group's papers from the 28,000 fans on the club's mailing list. The feud began last month when Ms Brady wrote to Mr Christopher Oakley, MIN's chief executive, demanding greater financial support of the club. After further exchanges, Ms Brady suggested that a boycott of the paper by Birmingham City fans could knock 10 per cent off the circulation of the Birmingham Post &amp; Mail.</p>

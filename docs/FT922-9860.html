			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Bavarian caught in a storm: Why Finance Minister Waigel is refusing to panic SPARE A thought for Mr Theo Waigel, the bluff and cheerful Bavarian who has the thankless task of steering Germany's federal budget through the stormy costs of reunification. Since he took over the job just three years ago, he has seen a nice tight budgetary ship of state, actually enjoying a marginal surplus, buffeted into a painful deficit which is variously estimated at anything from 3.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent of gross domestic product. He admits the situation is uncomfortable, and calls for 'iron savings', but he refuses to overreact to the more dire prognoses of deepening structural deficit in the German economy, threatening to drag down the entire European economy into a vicious high interest rate-slow growth spiral. In the past 10 days, however, he has come under attack not only from his colleagues in the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised states, led by the US, but also from within his own government. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister, the respected independent economic institute Ifo and the opposition Social Democrats are all questioning his assumptions, and therefore questioning his refusal to panic. There are two lines of argument behind the criticism. One is that Mr Waigel and his Finance Ministry fail to include all public borrowing needs in their calculations, in particular the costs of the Treuhand privatisation agency in east Germany, the funds set up to service the inherited debts of the East German state, the German Unity Fund to subsidise the new federal states, as well as the additional spending taken on by the German railways and telecommunications for the east. The other argument is that his calculations of future costs are based on over-optimistic assumptions about compensation payments for environmental damage, for example, and modernisation of the east German housing stock. The criticisms also cite a failure to provide adequately for other outlays: rising bad debts on trade with eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the need for more cash for east European economic stabilisation, and the demands for significant increases in the European Community budget. The most embarrassing leak came from the Economics Ministry last week. A much more gloomy forecast of future costs of unification suggested that without drastic cuts, the federal budget deficit alone would not be halved by 1995, from around DM50bn (Pounds 17bn) to DM25bn, but would actually rise to DM55bn. Mr Mollemann took as his starting point Mr Waigel's medium-term financial plan for the federal budget (excluding states and local authorities) to 1995, agreed last year, which aimed at an annual increase in spending of just 2.3 per cent, against an income growth of 5.4 per cent per year. First he questioned the underlying economic growth rate assumption: a real 2.5 to 3.0 per cent per year on average for 1991-95. In actual fact the 1992 growth rate is only expected to reach 1.5 per cent for west Germany (2.0 per cent including the east) on the basis of relatively optimistic assumptions: a successful conclusion of the Gatt negotiations, and moderation in the national wage negotiations, as well as international economic recovery. He calculated that after the tax package negotiated in February between the federal government and the German states, the federal deficit would deteriorate appreciably (example B in table). Then he proceeded to list the 'additional substantial risks, which are both difficult to quantify and to fix in any clear time-frame'. They include: New rules for compensation and indemnity yet to be agreed (original proposal for a fund authorised to borrow up to DM10bn); Environmental costs beyond the financial capacity of the eastern states. Additional cash for housing modernisation and rebuilding; Export credit guarantee bad debts, costing an extra DM1bn in this year's supplementary budget, and 'showing a rising tendency, especially for the Commonwealth of Independent States.' Costs of the Delors-II EC budget proposals, estimated by the Economics Ministry at an additional DM1.5bn in 1993, DM2.8bn in 1994, DM4.4bn in 1995; follow-up costs from the liquidation of the Treuhand at the end of 1994, with estimated debts of around DM250bn - from 1995 an additional debt service cost estimated at around DM10bn. All of which estimated as conservatively as possible in Mr Mollemann's ministry would more than double the 1995 federal budget deficit from DM25bn to DM55bn. The conclusion of the paper is that spending growth will rise by 3.7 per cent a year to 1995, instead of 2.3 per cent as planned. Debt service costs could total DM74bn that year, or 15.7 per cent of spending, rather than the planned DM46.4bn, or just 11 per cent. When the spending of the states and the local authorities is included, this scenario puts the current deficit in 1995 at 3.2 per cent of GDP instead of the planned 2.5 per cent - outside the qualification criteria for Germany to join the European monetary union. Overall public sector debt would total 55.3 per cent of GNP, against an Emu ceiling of 60 per cent - just inside, but potentially 'critical'. The Social Democrats have been scathing about Mr Mollemann's figures, but only because they say he is a 'slow learner': the opposition suggested such potential extra burdens nine months ago. Now the worthy Ifo institute has weighed into the debate, also questioning Mr Waigel's assumptions. Its calculations suggest that if all sources of public borrowing are included, then overall public sector debt will rise from the DM1,170bn at the end of 1991 - 41.7 per cent of GNP - by some 70 per cent to around DM2,000bn by the end of 1995: coming to the same conclusion as the Economics Ministry, or 55 per cent of GNP. Ifo is nevertheless confident of one thing to give Mr Waigel a little relief: by the year 2000 overall debt burden of the German public sector may have risen to DM2,500bn, but the proportion will be down to 50 per cent of GNP. With the current deficit forecast for the end of the century back below 2 per cent of GDP, the qualifications for Emu should be fulfilled - then.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NET BORROWING REQUIREMENT 1992-95 (DM BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1992   1993   1994   1995  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A Expenditure                  422.6  428.5  438.8  449.2 Income                       372.7  383.4  408.6  424.1 Net borrowing requirement     49.9   45.1   30.2   25.1 B Expenditure                  424.1  434.1  446.8  449.2 Income                       372.4  381.9  407.1  419.1 Net borrowing requirement     51.7   52.2   39.7   30.1 C Net borrowing requirement     52.0   62.0   55.0   55.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A figures are the federal government's medium-term financial plan statistics, keeping expenditure growth to 2.3 per cent pa in order to halve the net borrowing requirement by 1995.

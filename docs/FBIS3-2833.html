			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Delegates to the  current session of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)  today held discussions on Chinese Premier Li Peng's government  work report delivered to China's top legislature yesterday.    Their discussions centered on the theme of "reform,  development and stability." Close attention was also given to  the current difficulties in economic development, as well as the  drawbacks of the government's work in 1993.    During the discussions, heads of a number of local  governments said that localities should conscientiously uphold  the central authority and be subordinate to the economic  macro-control of the state.    Chen Huanyou, governor of the economically advanced Jiangsu  Province in east China, called the country's reforms this year  "an uphill battle," "having risks" and "being inevitable." In  order to ensure the smooth progress of reforms, local  governments must "act in line with the arrangements of the  central government, serve and abide by the need of the country  as a whole."    "Localities must not go their own way beyond the central  government's policies to pursue immediate or local interests,"  he said.    Xu Yan, female major of Nantong city in Jiangsu, said that  macro-control measures that the central government adopted in  the latter half of last year have had satisfactory effects on  ensuring a healthy economic growth.    "The central government is far-sighted and appropriate in  arranging its macro-control," she said. "Enterprises are  enhancing their ability to adapt to these measures."    Gu Jinchi, secretary of northeast China's Liaoning  Provincial  party committee, said that in order to ensure social stability  while accelerating reform and economic growth, local governments  have to promptly solve contradictions in the relations  concerning interests sharing emerging from the process of  reform. Meanwhile, they have to improve the living standards of  the people and crackdown on crimes.    Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the Hubei Provincial party  committee, also voiced concern over poor economic efficiency,  stagnant state-owned enterprises, "bottleneck" sectors of  transport and energy, agricultural production and social  stability.    Delegates from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who are  divided into eight groups for discussion today, said that the  army must carry out its tasks spelled out in Li Peng's  government work report.    Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Central Military  Commission,  said that the Army has a two-pronged strategy to safeguard  national security and social stability.    Defense Minister Chi Haotian said that the Army will  unswervingly support the country's drive to establish a  socialist market economy and make every effort to create a  reliable environment for reform and economic growth.</p>

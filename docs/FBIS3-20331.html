			<p>26 Mar 94 p 16  <F P=103> AU3003123094 </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main BOERSEN-ZEITUNG ("German  Industry -- Branches, Innovation, Finance" supplement) </F>   Language: <F P=105>German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tyll Necker, president of the Confederation of </F> German Industry: "The Breakuo of Industries of the New Laender"]    [Text] The objective of a dynamic economic growth has not  yet been attained in the new laender, but east German industry  has, by and large, consolidated itself, albeit at a low level.  With a 6.3-percent growth in the GNP in 1993, the new laender  have earned a reputation in Germany and Europe as "Growth Region  Number One." A 6- to 8-percent increase in the GNP can be  expected this year. However, these growth figures should not  cloud the fact that eastern Germany continues to be dependent on  the "western bread-basket," for, last year, almost half the  east's expenditures were financed by the West.  <H5>  A Divided Industrial Development </H5>   A gradual rise in eastern Germany's productivity is to be  expected over the next few years. However, the increased  productivity will not be equal in all industrial spheres.  Differentiation is to be expected just as before. In those  industrial spheres that produce for local markets or profit  directly from west German transfer payments, the progress is  obvious. That applies to handicrafts and the retail trade,  services and the construction industry, and to industrial  branches such as food and mineral resources. On the other hand,  those industrial branches involved in competition with the west,  such as the textile, machine, and chemical industries, are still  faced with considerable difficulties.    Many industrial branches should expand their production  during 1994, so that the economic growth in the east will reach  a new dimension. At the same time, personnel reductions should  be halted.    In view of the veritable "cold shower" suffered particularly  by industry in the new laender, it is not only necessary to halt  personnel reductions there, but also create new jobs. This  requirement is made all the clearer when one compares the  situation in the east with that in the west. In the east, the  number of people employed in industry per 1 million of the total  population is only 50 percent of the western figure, and  industrial turnover is only 20 percent of the western figure.  <H5>  Reasons for the Breakup of Industry </H5>   There is no doubt that the breakup of industry on a massive  scale in the east is the result of a combination of several  factors:    -- The introduction of the German mark on 1 July 1990  represented a massive change for the enterprises in the former  GDR [German democratic Republic]. The east German enterprises  were exposed to international competition virtually overnight.  They had no time to create the competitiveness that was missing  in terms of the quality and price of their products.    -- As a result of East European trade's conversion from  transfer rubles to hard currency on 1 January 1991 and the  subsequent drastic restructuring in the countries of Central and  East Europe, east German enterprises lost their traditional  markets. After all, 70 percent of east German trade was  earmarked for East Europe.    -- As a result of the "Rapid Adaptation of the Standard of  Living" slogan of 1990, firms found themselves under enormous  financial pressure. Industrial plants were compelled to come to  terms with wage increases of 25 percent and more, and this at a  level of productivity comparable to Greece. This was nothing  less than a death sentence to those plants that had found  themselves exposed to foreign competition.    -- Potential investors encountered numerous obstacles in the  new laender. There were major deficiencies in the  infrastructure, and major problems with the acquisition of  property. Added to this was the inefficiency of the  administration and unresolved ecological issues, such as the  question of who should take over the responsibility for old  waste deposits.    -- A comparison with the economic situation of private and  due-to-be-privatized enterprises brought home the fact that  enterprises managed by the Trust Agency are in a comparatively  worse situation with their orders, and have a lower turnover and  lower level of investments.    -- All the above factors were joined by another one -- the  effect of the worldwide recession on Germany. The year 1993  brought Germany the biggest drop in production since the war.    In view of all these changes and developments and the  combination thereof, industrial development in the new laender  comes as a surprise to no one. Needless to say, the dramatic  impact of these developments, especially the impact on the labor  market, could have been softened by means of different conduct  and different concepts. The necessary revision of thinking  should have occurred at an early stage.  <H5>  Developing a Feeling for Reality and Confidence </H5>   In the meantime, it should have become clear to everyone  that  a centrally managed economy cannot be converted into a  free-market economy over the space of just a few years and  without major upheavals. Prosperity can neither be decreed nor  enforced. Therefore expectations and behavior must be adapted to  the reality.    This requires that the people of eastern Germany restrain  their demands that the people of western Germany cease thinking  in materialistic terms. Old habits must be reconsidered and new  priorities established. A high degree of restraint and maturity  is required in the east and in the west. This must be reflected  in wage policy. In order to alleviate the costs crisis in  industry and the already precarious situation of the labor  market, the social partners in the East can no longer use  western wage levels as a pattern, for the only assets  enterprises have are those which they themselves create through  market competition. To stop the competitiveness of enterprises  exposed to competition from deteriorating even further, a  clearer orientation of productivity is necessary just as much as  a stronger flexibility and differentiation of wages.  <H5>  Reorientation to Western Markets </H5>   But east German entrepreneurs are also required to alter  their way of thinking. Because the traditional Central and East  European consumer markets have almost completely disappeared and  the development of the situation particularly in the countries  of the former Soviet Union is not quite clear, there must be a  reorientation to Western markets. There is no alternative to  this reorientation, even if external factors still make it  difficult to win new customers and markets.    In order to increase the market for east German products and  thus improve the orders situation for east German enterprises,  the Confederation of German Industry and Trust Agency together  launched the so-called New Bundeslaender Trade Offensive at the  beginning of last year. The purpose of this initiative,  sponsored by the "Industrial Initiative for Germany," is to  double the trade capacity of the west German economy between  1992 and 1995. At first, 33 west German enterprises belonged to  this trade initiative. Now, 100 industrial and trade  enterprises belong to it.    Even if the New Bundeslaender Trade Offensive has got off to  a good start, it cannot solve all the trade problems of east  German enterprises on its own. In addition to this, a  continuation of the Trust Agency's privatization activity is  just as necessary as an increased competitiveness of the  products manufactured in the new laender. The introduction of  time-limited and regressively structured value-added tax  concessions would have been very helpful for industrial  enterprises in the new laender, and would have made it easier  for them to enter the harsh markets of the Western world. They  woid have received a bonus for every mark they earned. The  advantage of this idea is that the bonuses would have depended  on productivity, and not on the principle whereby "he who incurs  the greatest losses receives the largest subsidies." Market  forces would not have been paralyzed, and because of the  time-limitation and regressive-structure factor, the possible  financial burden for households would have been limited.    But unfortunately, this proposal, already a subject of  debate  by the Confederation of German Industry for quite some time, has  not been implemented to this very day, even though it would be a  useful addition to the economy-promotion programs for the new  laender, especially the program to encourage investments.    In view of the need to renew the out-dated capital assets in  the new laender, the government's proposal to promote capital is  most welcome. But because investments need time before they  have an impact on the labor market, parallel measures are  desirable in at least a few selected branches, measures such as  wage restraint and the value-added tax concessions I mentioned  earlier. Just as before, the main economic-political challenge  is to consolidate investment activity and create permanently  profitable jobs in eastern Germany.    This challenge can only be met if the locational conditions  in the whole of the Federal Republic are improved, for the  continually necessary financial help for eastern Germany cannot  be permanently provided at the expense of general prosperity,  but has to be earned by enterprises in harsh international  competition.  <H5>  Solving Structural Problems </H5>   Therefore the problem is not just to overcome development  difficulties, but above all to solve the structural problems.  This applies to the high labor costs and costs of environmental  protection, the unusually high tax burden, the social security  network that can hardly be financed any more, and the runaway  national debt.    In order to overcome the cost crisis in the economy and the  confidence crisis in politics, a priority task is to restrain  the ever increasing activity of the state, for economic growth  is not an automatic process. It can only occur when market  forces are free to develop.    For this purpose,the social security system must be made  more  dependent on one's own contribution. Without appropriate  incentives, an abuse of this system at the expense of the  socially insured is guaranteed.    Last but not least, job guarantees must be accorded greater  importance in wages policy. Only when we face the facts and  concentrate first of all not on material distribution, but on  economic growth, can the competitiveness of German industry be  improved and east German industry be provided with fresh  prospects.</p>

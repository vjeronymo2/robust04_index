			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>   [Excerpts] [Kalyagin] We have invited to our studio today  Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, the chairman of the Committee for  International Affairs of the Russian State Duma, who was until  very recently Russian ambassador in Washington, and councillor  at the embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Mr. Djuro  (?Kreneta). Vladimir Petrovich, certain differences have  emerged between Russia and its Western partners. What do you  think, is this a result of the Zhirinovskiy factor? Or is it a  question of deeper, fundamental changes in our foreign policy?    [Lukin] Well, in the first place I would not dramatize, or  globalize the Zhirinovskiy factor. What is the Zhirinovskiy  factor? Sometimes a politician here only has to start squealing  like a piglet or screaming like a woman in labor, and some  factors or other start appearing. We are talking about one of  the factions, not a majority faction. The statement adopted by  the State Duma on Yugoslavia was not a statement proposed by the  Liberal Democrats. So we are talking about the mood of the  Russian people, and as an expression of this mood, the mood in  the Duma itself, not in one faction, but in many, practically  the overwhelming majority of factions. This is the mood of our  public, which consists of this, that what is needed is  international efforts to eliminate this crisis, and in this we  differ radically from the Liberal Democrats, they are needed not  by way of using violence -- violence will entail further  violence, not stop violence. [passage omitted]    [Lukin] I was speaking to the well-known U.S. politician and  diplomat James Collins yesterday, at his request, and he  admitted that the process is under way, that both the Serbs and  Muslims are surrendering their artillery, that is, the process  of disarmament is really under way.    [Kalyagin] So you think force will not be used by NATO?    [Lukin] I cannot think that, because there could be two  alternatives here. The alternative of genuine interest on the  part of NATO and the Western countries in Sarajevo not being  shelled -- this is a legitimate interest -- and the alternative  of looking for any pretext, which is unfortunately being whipped  up by some of the Muslim leaders, to intervene at any price and  foist their own understanding and their own solution to this  matter. Just look at what happened with the so-called mortar  bomb at the Sarajevo market. This is really very similar to the  Reichstag fire, it was as though it was done to order  immediately prior to the foreign ministers' conference, the day  before.    [Kalyagin] And if the bombing still goes ahead? What could  that lead to? What do you think?    [Lukin] If that happens, it could lead to very bad  consequences in terms of Russia's relations, our trust in the  countries of the West. You see, there are two kinds of  relations -- relations between partners, and relations with a  boss. When a decision is made first, and then the other side is  informed of the decision that has already been made, that is  relations with a boss. Relations between partners mean that  first of all there is very careful and serious discussion of the  issues, and then a joint, considered decision is made. That is  what I am in favor of.

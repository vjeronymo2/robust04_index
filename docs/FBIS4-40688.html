			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Resolution of the Congress of Delegates from the Georgian </F> Workers Communist Party, the Union of Georgian Communists, the  `Stalin' Political Organization, and the `Remembrance of Stalin'  International Organization"]    [Text] Proceeding from the generally recognized acute  crisis situation into which the Republic of Georgia and its  peoples have been plunged;    -- recognizing the real danger of the further fragmentation  of Georgia as a result of the ethnic crisis that has been  provoked and accompanied by bloodshed;    -- predicting still greater confrontation in society, the  final collapse of the economy, the seizure, plundering, and  destruction of the remains of property belonging to the state  and to collective farms and cooperatives, a growth in the crime  wave, and other unbearable social conditions that can endanger  the very existence of the state;    -- concurring in our views regarding the strategy and  tactics  for bringing Georgia out of the political, economic, social, and  ethnic crisis,    the congress resolves:    1. To view (constitute) the present gathering of delegates  from the Georgian Workers Communist Party [GWCP], the "Stalin"  political organization, the Union of Georgian Communists [UGC],  and the "Remembrance of Stalin" international organization as a  congress and the 425 delegates as congress delegates.    2. The present congress establishes the Unified Communist  Party of Georgia [UCPG] that includes the Georgian Workers  Communist Party, the "Stalin" political organization, the Union  of Georgian Communists, and members of the "Remembrance of  Stalin" international organization.    The rules of the Georgian Communist Party that were  published  in KOMUNISTI No. 1 of 19 March 1994 are to viewed as the rules  of the UPCG until this party holds its congress.    3. A political council is to be formed to prepare and hold  the regular congress and direct the activities of the UCPG. It  is to be composed of the following 23 people: P. Georgadze, D.  Lomashvili, D. Kevlishvili, I. Khazaradze, G. Leiashvili, D.  Gaganidze, D. Glunchadze, R. Chkhaidze, T. Pipiya, Z.  Lelashvili, V. Makharadze, S. Rigvava, K. Gardapkhadze, M.  Chachukashvili, D. Kiknadze, K. Kuliyev, F. Makharadze, V.  Dolidze, G. Oniani, I. Pantskhava, A. Tsereteli, N. Zakariadze,  K. Ukleba.    In the event of there being an urgent necessity to include  new members, the Political Council is provided with the right of  co- option.    4. The congress declares the UCPG to be the successor to the  Georgian Communist Party that existed until 26 August 1991.    5. Once the UCPG has been registered, the parties that have  joined it (GWCP, UGC, and the "Stalin" political organization)  will be liquidated in accordance with their rules.    6. The congress informs those parties and social  organizations that adhere to socialist ideas that the UCPG is  ready to receive them into its ranks.    The Political Council is empowered to conduct conciliatory  talks with the representatives of any parties and social  organizations that wish to defend the interests of Georgia's  workers through joint efforts.    7. The congress approves the activities of the editorial  board of the GWCP organ KOMUNISTI and considers it necessary to  assist it in every way (including materially). The constituent  congress confirms KOMUNISTI, the newspaper of the GWCP, a party  that has made a big contribution to the creation of the UCPG, to  be its press organ.    8. The congress recommends that primary, rayon, town, and  oblast party organizations unite their efforts, strengthen the  unified ranks of party organizations, and, at regular meetings  (conferences), elect single delegates for the forthcoming  congress according to the norm that will be established later.    9. The congress, understanding all the complexities of  settling the Abkhazian problem, views as acceptable the  agreement on a cease- fire and the separation of forces signed  in Moscow on 11 May 1994 by representatives from Georgia and  Abkhazia in the presence of [representatives from] the UN,  Russian Federation, and CSCE.</p>

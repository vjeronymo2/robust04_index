			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 1 Apr -- President of Crimea Yuriy Meshkov  dismissed Valeriy Astakhov, the president of the Krym Television  and Radio Company, on 31 March, although, according to the  Crimean Council of Ministers regulation on the Krym State  Television and Radio Company, approved at the instruction of the  autonomous republic's Supreme Council, "a candidate for the post  of president is nominated by the Council of Ministers and  confirmed by the Supreme Council of Crimea, with the consent of  the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company [Ukrteleradio], for a  period of five years."    In this connection, Mykola Okhmakevych, the president of the  Ukrainian Television and Radio Company, filed a resolute protest  to Yuriy Meshkov. The Krym Television and Radio Company,  stresses Mr. Okhmakevych in his statement, is a constituent part  of the Ukrainian Television and Radio Company. According to the  currently valid resolutions of Ukraine's Council of Ministers,  Ukraine's Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of the  Republic of Crimea, decision-making on personnel issues without  the involvement of the Ukrteleradio president is a gross  violation. Mr. Okhmakevych suggested Yuriy Meshkov revise his  decision.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 30 (XINHUA) -- China's government  aims to take measures to curb illegal coal mining and improve  safety in small township coal mines, to ensure "the healthy  development of the industry."    Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, addressing an on-going national  work  conference of township coal mines, said that within two years  the sorting out and rectifying of the township coal mines  nationwide should be completed.    He told officials from local governments and the ministry of  coal industry that the guidelines to "support, innovate,  rectify, unite and improve" township coal mines should be  adhered to in the process, for the promotion of their healthy  development.    China's township coal mines, outstripping state-owned and  locally-owned large and medium-sized coal mines in the rate of  development, have been one of the fastest growing sectors over  the past 15 years. Their annual production stood at 470 million  tons in 1993, more than three times the figure in 1978 when  China began its open door policy.    With output now making up 41.2 percent of the nation's coal  production, the township coal mines have become an important  component of China's coal industry, Zou said. Their rapid  development has contributed to the improved coal supply and  continued growth of the national economy, he added.    However, he said, appropriate attention should be paid at  the  same time to the problems existing in the development of  township coal mines.    Illegal mining has gone rampant. More than half the 80,000  township coal mines in China are operating without any  government permission. And some of them don't have basic safety  conditions, giving rise to more accidents and deaths.    Zou made clear that it is the nation that possesses all coal  reserves and the central government exercises a "centralized"  administrative role, while the local governments play  "subordinate" roles.    Therefore, every township coal mine will be screened in  accordance with the set standards, Zou said. "Those in need of  rectification should be overhauled and those without licence  should try to get a government permit."    Zou said all the mines should be given clear territorial  boundaries for mining to prevent indiscriminate undercutting and  eventually waste of resources. The death rate per million tons  in the mines should be reduced to meet the national standard, he  stressed.    He ordered the coal ministry and local governments to  strengthen cooperation and enhance administration of the mines  in a system which unifies power and responsibility.    The coal market should also be addressed for the formation  of  better standardization of coal transportation and sale, he said.  "We should raise the level of administrating township coal  mines, which would contribute to a durable, sustained and  healthy development of the national economy," he added.    The conference, which began on Tuesday [29 March], is  expected to end tomorrow.</p>

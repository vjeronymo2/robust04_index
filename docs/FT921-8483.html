			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Observer: Free issue While we may be spared another war in the South Atlantic, there'll be ructions for the poor translator who produced the English version of last week's European Parliament speech by Argentine president Carlos Menem. The original Spanish had the often-jinxed president calling for greater EC-Argentine 'inter-action free of suspicions and mistrust'. The official English translation unfortunately misplaced a word. 'Let there be a free inter-action of suspicions and mistrust,' it read. Ouch.</p>

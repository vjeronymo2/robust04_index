			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik believes that preserving integration and cooperation at  "its current level at least" is a priority in relations between  the Czech Republic and Slovakia.    The preservation of the Customs Union was important from the  point of view of the expected integration into the European  Union, the support of European thinking and general strategy for  the future, Moravcik told journalists today.    He said that open questions between the two countries should  be solved but expressed doubt that they could be solved during  his cabinet's six-month term of office. "However we are ready to  make use of this space," he stressed, adding that he would  consider it wonderful if the division of the former federal  property could at last be settled.    Moravcik said that his cabinet intended to settle previously  tense Slovak-Hungarian relations.    "We are interested in expanding cooperation," Moravcik said.  He confirmed Slovakia's interest in Hungarian Foreign Minister  Geza Jeszenszky's postponed visit to Bratislava taking place but  admitted that it was being hindered by difficulties surrounding  the conclusion of the Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement.    "I firmly believe that we will find a way to overcome this  problem," Moravcik said, adding that Bratislava was ready to  open new border crossings between Slovakia and Hungary.    Moravcik rejected Meciar's warning against the penetration  of  Hungarian capital into southern Slovakia, arguing that capital  was essentially international and to look for its ethnic origin  was "counter-productive."    The signing of a basic Slovak-Hungarian inter-state treaty  was an open question in relations between Slovakia and Hungary,  Moravcik said. He said that Bratislava expected the treaty to  confirm the current border, which would eradicate fears of  ethnic minority irredentism and possible territorial claims from  the south. However Budapest is making the recognition of  collective rights of the half- million Hungarian minority a  condition, which Bratislava rejects, Moravcik said.    Jeszenszky's visit, planned for last autumn, was again  postponed after Bratislava made the conclusion of a readmission  agreement on the return of illegal emigrants a condition for  opening new border crossings between the two countries.  Budapest refuses to conclude such an agreement for fear of an  influx of Romanian refugees into its territory.    As regards the current state of Slovak-Polish relations  Moravcik said: "We are greatly interested in developing these  relations but we cannot find a mechanism to realize them. We  realize that our deeds are lagging behind our words." He  mentioned the possibility of the Polish premier visiting  Bratislava.</p>

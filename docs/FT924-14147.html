			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Danish dilemma IN SEEKING to resolve the conundrum left by its rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June, Denmark seems to have taken the advice of a celebrated former counsellor at the Danish court. The adage of Shakespeare's Polonius - 'Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement' - runs through the 251 pages of the long-awaited white paper published in Copenhagen on Friday. The document assembles a list of eight options for Denmark's relationship with the EC. Yet it pointedly fails to give any recommendation on the course the country will actually take. That will be worked out in negotiations both with the Danish opposition parties, and with the other 11 EC partners - a procedure aiming to find a compromise capable of being approved in a new Danish referendum next year. Some of Denmark's objections to Maastricht - for instance, its request for clearer definition of how the 'subsidiarity' principle will be applied - seem likely to end up as welcome additions to the treaty. Other points, however, if appended as riders effective for all EC members, could end up making the document more rather than less opaque in both in its political aims and its areas of practical application. Denmark already has what amounts to an 'opt-out' clause on economic and monetary union. Under the deal last December, the third stage of Emu would not come into force for Denmark unless it was agreed in a separate referendum. Denmark now wants additional safeguards to prevent it from being press-ganged into a future European defence community, as well as to avoid lowering its high standards of environmental and social protection. Considerable legal and political complexities still lie ahead. One of the most intriguing of the eight options presented on Friday is one under which Denmark could ratify the treaty subject to a time-limit. This would allow it to withdraw later if the Community developed in a manner deemed prejudicial to Danish national interests. It is hardly surprising that, in their initial reactions, officials in Brussels are taking a distinctly cautious view of the chances of agreeing a workable compromise between Copenhagen and the other 11. The EC as a whole has to steer a mid-course between the general desire to avoid wholesale renegotiation of the treaty, and the necessity to find some means of Danish ratification to allow Maastricht - with appropriate amendments - to come into effect. Denmark has its own dilemma. A large majority of the Danish electorate, according to opinion polls, does not want to opt out of the EC as it stands. And the Danes want to remain as firmly as possibly associated with the EC of the future - if only to maintain the degree of political influence over its development which they have so evidently wielded since the night of June 2. Negotiating a solution to the 'Danish problem' will require considerably more diplomatic and political skills than the EC has displayed during the Maastricht process so far. The only reason for being even moderately sanguine is that, unless they come up with an escape route, EC politicians will find themselves accused, still more than today, of furthering the cause not of European integration, but of European disarray.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Multi-media merger mania MULTI-MEDIA, convergence, communicopia. Talk to top executives at telephone utilities, entertainment groups or computer companies these days and you are likely to hear such buzzwords. Hardly a week passes without a new alliance, project or merger being announced with the aim of positioning the participants for the coming world of multi-media. This week Viacom, the US-based cable television group, bid Dollars 8.2bn for Paramount Communications, the film production and publishing company, while news leaked out that British Telecommunications is pressing ahead with proposals to provide a national video-on-demand service via its telephone lines. Earlier in the year, telecommunications group US West agreed to invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time Warner's cable and entertainment operations - which were in turn formed as part of a Dollars 11.6bn merger in 1989. The essential hypothesis underlying all the buzz about multi-media is that technologies in the computer, telecommunications, consumer electronics, entertainment and publishing industries are converging. The time is rapidly approaching, the theory goes, when homes will sport smart terminals - something of a cross between televisions and computers - linked into advanced communications networks. Over those, they will get access to services such as video-on-demand, interactive computer games, picture telephones and home shopping, as well as ordinary TV and telephone services. Over-impressed Heard it all before? Sceptics with long memories may well suspect they are being bamboozled with techno-hype. Enthusiasm for convergence between telecommunications and computing in the early 1980s led to a wave of unsuccessful mergers such as that between computer giant IBM and Rolm, the switchboard manufacturer. Strategists were over-impressed by technological convergence. But it was difficult in practice to devise 'killer products' that appealed to consumers or to manage companies with different cultures. A second version of the convergence hypothesis, popular in the late 1980s, was that consumer electronics manufacturers and entertainment groups should combine forces. This led to Japan's Sony acquiring Hollywood's Columbia studios and CBS records, while rival Matsushita took over MCA. There never seemed much logic in the idea that makers of video recorders should tie up with film producers - it is not as though they could provide them with better distribution channels. But the deals have not been failures, since the Japanese parent have largely left their software arms to run themselves. Main focus The current enthusiasm for multi-media convergence is rather different. The main focus is on entertainment distribution. This in turn comes in two versions: vertical integration between entertainment groups and distribution networks; and convergence in telecommunications and entertainment distribution channels. In the first category comes the proposed tie-up between Viacom and Paramount. This may make business sense in that it will give Viacom's cable networks ready access to a critical mass of films and TV programmes, while securing outlets for Paramount's products. But vertical integration will, at best, provide only a partial way forward. Entertainment companies need global distribution - something no single cable network will come close to delivering - while no network will appeal to consumers by distributing a single company's products. In the second category comes BT's planned move into videos. The industrial logic here is compelling. There is sense both in telephone utilities carrying entertainment over their networks and in cable companies providing telephone services over theirs. Sadly, in most countries, such convergence is stopped by regulation. The reason for feeling more confident about the current convergence wave compared with previous ones is that it is driven less by techno-hype and more by a popular application - entertainment. Restructuring entertainment distribution does not, of course, amount to full-scale multi-media convergence. But it may prepare the way for such a future.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. NOT HOPEFUL ON OTHER HOSTAGES; LAUDS IRAN, SYRIA  </P> <P> The Bush Administration expressed its gratitude Monday to both Syria and Iran  for helping win freedom for hostage Frank H. Reed, but U.S. officials conceded  privately that they do not anticipate another imminent release.  </P> <P> "It looks like the well will be dry for awhile," said a source close to the  hostage crisis.  </P> <P> Indeed, within hours of Reed's release, the battle lines of Phase 2 of the  hostage release drama appeared to be taking shape.  </P> <P> An editorial in today's Tehran Times warned: "Now the ball is in the court of  the United States and the Western countries. . . . Without an appropriate  response from the West, there is no chance for the continuation of Iranian  mediation and requests."  </P> <P> But at a White House ceremony to welcome returned hostage Robert Polhill,  President Bush ruled out any improvement in relations with Iran or a reciprocal  gesture to any party until all Americans are freed.  </P> <P> "We're not, in a piecemeal basis, bidding for human life," he said.  </P> <P> In an earlier written statement, the President pointedly noted that six other  Americans and at least eight foreigners remain hostage in Lebanon.  </P> <P> "Their predicament weighs on our mind and tempers the joy we feel today," he  said.  </P> <P> The President did go further in acknowledging Iran's role in Reed's release  than he did in last week's reaction to Polhill's freedom. In the written  statement, he thanked Tehran for "using its influence to help bring about this  humanitarian step." In contrast, he thanked Damascus only for "facilitating"  Reed's freedom.  </P> <P> The statement indicated that the Administration believes that Iran played the  more pivotal role. But the Islamic republic made clear that words will not  suffice.  </P> <P> In the Tehran Times editorial, Iran for the first time claimed credit for the  release of the two Americans within nine days.  </P> <P> "Something miraculous has happened," the Tehran Times said, because Iran "put  in months of hard effort" and "used its maximum power and credibility" to free  the first American hostages in more than three years.  </P> <P> The English-language Times, which is considered the mouthpiece of Iranian  President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said that the next "appropriate" step would be  for the release of "a significant number of hostages including a few Iranian  hostages and Sheik Obeid . . . so that we can celebrate the year 1990 as the  end of the hostage crisis."  </P> <P> The demand was a reference to an estimated 400 Shiite Muslim and Palestinian  prisoners under the control of Israel or the pro-Israeli militia in southern  Lebanon and to four Iranian hostages abducted by a Christian militia outside  Beirut in 1982. Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a prominent Shiite sheik, was abducted  from his home in southern Lebanon by Israeli commandos last July.  </P> <P> The editorial also described the Bush Administration's reaction to the first  hostage release as "not likable and very unexpected," and it denounced the  congressional vote last week that endorsed Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  </P> <P> A U.S. counterterrorism official responded to the editorial's demands by saying  that the Administration has no intention of backing down from its position of  "no deals."  </P> <P> But he conceded that some "fancy footwork" will be necessary to win freedom for  the remaining six Americans. At this point, the Administration is hoping that  Israel will contribute to the new momentum with a release, however token, he  said.  </P> <P> Although the Israeli government has made several offers of a swap in the past,  its terms include the release of three soldiers captured during Israel's  occupation of Lebanon.  </P> <P> President Bush said he has "no knowledge" of any deal that would involve Israel  releasing prisoners under its control in exchange for U.S. and other hostages.  But he later added that he would have "no objection."  </P> <P> White House officials have repeatedly tried to signal a desire to see the  Israelis free some prisoners without directly calling on Israel to do so.  </P> <P> "The problem boils down to who takes the next step -- and how to avoid it from  being seen as part of a deal," said the source close to the hostage crisis.  </P> <P> As in the case of Polhill, U.S. officials had no idea why Reed was picked for  the second release. They had, however, anticipated further movement. When the  Syrians first approached the U.S. Embassy in Damascus 12 days ago, they told  American diplomats that they expected two to come out. When only Polhill was  freed, the Syrians offered reassurances that another would be freed soon.  </P> <P> At the White House today, Polhill told a Rose Garden press conference, "I  sincerely hope that Frank (Reed) is Step 2 in what will be a continuing release  of hostages and bringing us all back."  </P> <P> Of the reasons behind his release, he said, "You may be surprised but I really  don't know very much about what was going on around me."  </P> <P> But U.S. officials confirmed that Polhill did have a message for Bush from his  captors, a message he had refused to divulge to his debriefers during the  stopover in Germany last week.  </P> <P> After the Rose Garden ceremony, Polhill, who is expected to undergo a biopsy  this weekend for a growth in his throat that developed during his 1,183-day  captivity, met with the President, Secretary of State James A. Baker III,  National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and others to relay the message. U.S.  officials refused to disclose the contents.  </P> <P> Polhill's White House reception and Reed's release came on the day the State  Department published its annual report on terrorism, which lists both Iran and  Syria among six countries still involved in state-sponsored terrorism.  </P> <P> "A number of states involved in terrorism, including Libya and Syria, remained  wary of getting caught sponsoring terrorists and reduced their support. Iran  was a notable exception," the report says.  </P> <P> Although Tehran's involvement in state-sponsored attacks decreased slightly in  1989, it concludes, "Iran continues to provide Hezbollah with money, weapons  and training and has approved -- and in some cases encouraged -- the kidnaping  of Western citizens."  </P> <P> Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Shiite group in Lebanon thought to be an umbrella  organization that includes several of the groups holding foreign hostages in  Lebanon.  </P> <P> The report adds that Iranian intelligence has been used "to facilitate and in  some cases conduct terrorist attacks." And it reports extensive support for  terrorist groups even after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in  June, 1989.  </P> <P> The State Department survey said Syria has not been linked to the planning or  execution of incidents outside Lebanon since 1987. But Damascus has not been  taken off the list of sponsors because it provides support and safe haven to  groups such as Hezbollah, the Japanese Red Army and the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command.  </P> <P> The report was deemed sufficiently sensitive that the White House ordered all  copies, scheduled to be released Monday morning, delayed until after Reed's  release was confirmed. U.S. officials said they did not want Tehran or Damascus  to balk at the last minute.  </P> <P> In general, however, the report concludes that international terrorism declined  sharply, by almost 38%, worldwide in 1989.  </P> <P> Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and David Lauter also contributed to this  report.  </P></p>

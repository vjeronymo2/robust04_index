			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar ignores strong figures THE DOLLAR retreated from initial gains to test support at DM1.6490 yesterday, in spite of more encouraging US economic figures, writes Neil Buckley. February housing starts rose 9.6 per cent to 1.304m, against the 1.176m expected, and was the largest increase for a year; industrial production showed a slightly smaller than expected rise of 0.6 per cent, but was still a turnround from a 0.9 per cent fall in January; and consumer prices rose 0.3 per cent (after 0.1 per cent in January), in line with expectations. The dollar bulls had hoped these figures would take the currency higher. But the market seems to have already priced in a US economic recovery, and a push above DM1.66 only brought sellers. The US unit closed at DM1.6500/10, after a DM1.6525/35 start, its lowest for nearly a fortnight, and was easier at Y133.30/40 from Y133.50/60. Later in New York it ended at DM1.6455 and Y132.80. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, said: 'Yesterday's figures added to the accumulating evidence that the US recovery is under way. But this was not sufficiently powerful for the dollar to break through strong resistance at DM1.6720, and we could see further slippage in the near term.' He added that economic fundamentals still favoured the dollar in the long term, and most dealers still expect it to reach DM1.80 by the third quarter. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar firmed against the yen but barely moved against the D-Mark in late trading, after falling sharply at first. Dealers said US investors, Middle East speculators and Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, had been active sellers of the dollar against the D-Mark. It closed at Y133.32 and DM1.6528. The D-Mark rose against most EMS currencies, as faint rumours circulated that the Bundesbank might raise interest rates at its council meeting tomorrow. Even though money supply growth and inflation data have been high recently, most dealers said they doubted that the bank would lift rates, but the market was nevertheless squa-ring short D-Mark positions. The Bank of Italy was said to have been forced to sell Ecu30m to support the lira, which reached a technical low against the D-Mark of L753.80, before rallying to L751.84/94. Sterling finished at DM2.8610/15, up from a previous DM2.8578/83. Although still near its floor against the top-placed peseta, it strengthened to 47 per cent of its allowed divergence below the central rate, from 51 per cent. It was boosted by an opinion poll showing the governing Conservative party three points ahead of the Labour opposition. It wobbled only briefly after UK industrial output and PSBR figures, which one dealer called 'unambiguously awful'. The pound also benefited from a weaker dollar, ending at Dollars 1.7340, up from Dollars 1.7155. In New York it closed at Dollars 1.7355.</p>

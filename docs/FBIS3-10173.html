According to sources at the government palace, Gaviria asked  Caldera to support his candidacy, but the Venezuelan president  said the country has its own candidate, whose qualities measure  up to the needs of the hemisphere.    For several months, Venezuela has promoted the candidacy of  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas to this post. A  Foreign Ministry spokesman affirmed Burelli will not only  maintain his candidacy, but will also "fight for it until the  second or third round" of votes at OAS headquarters in  Washington.    The Venezuelan delegation to the OAS sent a statement to the  evaluation committee noting Burelli Rivas as the "sole option to  renewing the system." The communique added that with Venezuela,  the inter-American system would have an OAS which is much more  active and committed to the objectives and principles of its  charter.    Political analysts feel the Venezuelan foreign minister  would  withdraw his candidacy to avoid a resounding defeat by Gaviria  or Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, who seems to have  received the support of Central America and the Caribbean.</p>

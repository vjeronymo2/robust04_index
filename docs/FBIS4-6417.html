			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- An influential business  leader expressed hope Tuesday [19 April] that political  stability will be restored with the likely selection of Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata as successor to departing Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), was commenting on news  reports the ruling coalition is expected to choose Hata as  Hosokawa's successor.    The new administration is expected to pursue the line  followed by the Hosokawa government, and its foundations will be  more stable than present ones, he said.    The government will do its utmost to enact the 1994 fiscal  budget, up for parliamentary approval, as soon as possible,  Nagano said.    He said the yen's appreciation has hampered economic  recovery, and its value should be lowered to a level matching  its purchasing power to help ease the impact on domestic  industry.    There are bright signs of recovery but they have yet to  cover  all industries, he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> I completely agree with Howard Rosenberg's Oct. 10 article, "Standards Double  When Controversy Strikes," in which he scolds a number of TV stations for  banning an ad calling for an end to U.S. military aid to El Salvador.  </P> <P> Not only do these stations promote public ignorance on such important issues,  they also help our government censor the media.  </P> <P> U.S. taxes pay for Army ads that glorify the cause of killing innocent people;  at the same time, the media reject an ad encouraging us to condemn the crime of  murder.  </P> <P> If in November our country again has a low voter turnout, we can blame it on  the networks and their stations that wouldn't show "controversial" issues.  </P> <P> JENNIFER HENDERSON  </P> <P> Berkeley  </P></p>

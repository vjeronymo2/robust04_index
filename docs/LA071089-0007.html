			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'INTELLECTUALS: MUTE VOICE'  </P> <P> In response to "Intellectuals: Mute Voice of America" by Donald Davis, Opinion,  June 25:  </P> <P> The issue is not muteness on the part of this country's intellectuals, it is  the silencing of these people by this culture -- a silencing more thorough and  insidious perhaps than the silencing of intellectuals in many communist or  fascist countries.  </P> <P> We are writing, but our best, our strongest work is not getting into print. The  low salaries most of us command as university professors reinforce the popular  notion that we are ineffectual and dismissable. We are not taken seriously in  the political arena.  </P> <P> In the United States, children are taught early on to distrust ideas, to make  fun and to disregard abstract thinkers. Look at the way poets and intellectuals  are treated for example, on television -- very effective. Who would listen to  such buffoons?  </P> <P> GAIL WRONSKY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

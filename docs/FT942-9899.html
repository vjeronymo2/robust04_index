			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Troubled shipyard breaks even in year Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which went into receivership a year ago today, has broken even on turnover of Pounds 46m in the past 12 months, receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday. Mr Gordon Horsfield, joint receiver, said draft contracts for the sale of Swans to French-based shipbuilder Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie had been discussed at meetings this week. He hoped a deal, conditional on the award to Swans by the Ministry of Defence of the refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere, would be signed by the end of this month. He gave two reasons why it had not been possible to conclude the agreement sooner. One was the detailed negotiations with the MoD that were necessary for CMN to become an approved supplier if it bought Swan Hunter. The other was the issue of the contract to complete the last frigate being built at the yard. A meeting about that was held on Wednesday, and another is planned for next Friday. Swans' rivals for the Bedivere refit are Yarrow, Tees Dockyard and two consortia, VSEL/Devonport and BAe/Semma/Rosyth. The tenders, said Mr Horsfield, were within a 'fairly confined range'. A decision would be announced in July. Mr Horsfield said closure of Swans and piecemeal sale of its assets looked likely if the yard did not win Bedivere. He hoped it would first finish the last frigate, due for completion in November. The departure from the Tyne next week of her sister ship Northumberland will trigger a further 148 redundancies plus 237 lay-offs, reducing the workforce from nearly 2,500 on receivership to 650.</p>

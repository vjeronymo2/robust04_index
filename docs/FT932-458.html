			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / BMA accepts GP fundholding THE British Medical Association yesterday decided to relax its opposition to general-practitioner fundholding, the most controversial aspect of the government's National Health Service reforms. While the association continues to believe that fund-holding has led to the development of a two-tier health service, its annual representative meeting in Torquay yesterday voted 189 to 140 for a motion declaring that 'given the present reality' the association should no longer assert its opposition to the scheme. Twenty-five per cent of general practitioners are now in fundholding practices and this is likely to rise to around 40 per cent next year. In these circumstances the association would have been able to maintain entrenched opposition only at the expense of dividing its own membership. Fundholders have budgets from which they purchase hospital and other care on behalf of their patients. There have been allegations that hospitals have sometimes given preference to fundholders' patients on financial rather than clinical grounds. Even some supporters of the scheme accept that it can distort local health spending priorities. But Dr John Rae, a member of the association's council who moved the successful motion, told the conference that fundholding had become a reality and by 'stating implausible opposition' the association implied that it would not talk about the scheme. Fundholding affected all GPs, he said, and the association had to be involved in negotiations on the issues it raised for all its members. While the decision will be welcomed by the government, it does not indicate a collapse of the association's hostility to the health reforms. There is a growing feeling in the association that the warnings it sounded when the reforms were introduced in 1991 are being proved correct. Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the association's council, said in his opening speech to the conference: 'We did not believe that the government would make enough money available to solve the widespread problems that were bound to appear. The government has not provided enough money and the problems have appeared.' Large industrial organisations, he said, now recognised that structures based on co-operation and teamwork were best, adding that the co-operation in the health service was being lost by the commercial competition at the heart of the reforms.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cut in charges helps Schneider to 58% advance Schneider, the French electrical engineering and construction group, yesterday announced a 58 per cent jump in net profits for the first half of the year, to FFr345m (Dollars 65.5m) from FFr218m, and forecast an even stronger increase for the full year. In 1993, the company posted profits of FFr405m. It attributed the increase to improved trading conditions in its main markets and a 30 per cent reduction in financial charges. Turnover rose 3.6 per cent to FFr27.69bn, although the increase was much stronger in the company's industrial activities. Operating profits climbed to FFr1.48bn from FFr1.34bn. According to Schneider, the first six months brought a strong contribution from its US activities. However, industrial operations in Canada incurred losses. In Europe, economic conditions improved, although the French market remained mediocre and the company incurred exceptional costs from the merger of its Merlin Guerin and Telemecanique operations. Schneider's Spie Batignoles division, which includes its construction and property activities, continued to suffer losses, although the deficit was reduced during the first half, to FFr59m from FFr70m. The company said the operating environment remained relatively weak, but that charges from the division would be lower for the full year than in 1993. Financial charges were reduced to FFr630m from FFr906m during the first half. Schneider said the reduction reflected a lower debt burden, resulting from a capital increase last year and the sale of non-strategic assets. It said it expected to finalise shortly the creation of a joint company which pooled its robotic operations with those of AEG of Germany.</p>

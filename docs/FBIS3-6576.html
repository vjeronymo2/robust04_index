			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panmunjom, South Korea, March 19 (YONHAP) --  Inter-Korean talks on exchanging special envoys broke down in  the truce village on Saturday after the North Korean delegation  walked out of the meeting room.    In the eighth round of inter-Korean dialogue, which opened  in  the Southern side's peace house at 10 AM, the South urged the  North to agree to an immediate exchange of special envoys,  noting that the envoy negotiations are merely marking time  because of Pyongyang's "insincere attitude toward the contacts."    In response, the North Korean delegation abruptly walked out  55 minutes after the meeting opened, leaving a cloud of  uncertainty hanging over possible meetings in the near future.    Chief South Korean delegate Song Yong-tae, accusing the  North  of hampering the envoy exchange by making four "unjustified"  demands since the contacts started last October, requested that  Pyongyang focus on procedural matters related to the exchange  and discard all unrelated issues.    North Korea's refusal to allow full inspection of a key  radiochemical laboratory, believed to be a nuclear fuel  reprocessing facility in violation of an agreement with the  United States made in February, has aggravated the situation, he  noted. "We've not much time left for negotiations and we can't  say what will happen if the nuclear issue is not resolved  immediately."    Song then urged his North Korean counterpart Pak Yong-su to  agree to a proposal on procedures for an envoy exchange made by  the South at a previous meeting.    Pak, saying recent developments have justified the four  demands made at previous meetings, claimed the South is using  inter-Korean dialogue to impede the third round of North  Korea-U.S. talks.    "We can't help taking serious note of the South's attempt to  break this working-level contact and hinder an envoy exchange  while creating a new North-South confrontation," North Korea's  chief delegate said.    "This confrontation will eventually lead to a collision and  further to a war. We're fully prepared to meet any challenge, a  word with a word and a weapon with a weapon."    Song then demanded that the North immediately stop  slandering  President Kim Yong-sam and instigating the South Korean people  to struggle against the government, while expressing Seoul's  determination to realize the proposed envoy exchange to resolve  the nuclear issue.</p>

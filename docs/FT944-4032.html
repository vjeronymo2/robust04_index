			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Britain and France firm on Bosnia Britain and France, the two powers with the most troops in Bosnia, yesterday reassured their EU partners they would resist pressure to 'cut and run' from the war-ravaged region. Although Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, warned at the EU summit in Essen that the 23,000-strong UN peacekeeping force could be forced to withdraw in 'a matter of weeks' unless the Bosnian Serbs accepted the UN-EU peace plan, there was still a strong consensus yesterday that a diplomatic solution could be found in Bosnia. Mr Hurd and his French counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe, both gave assurances to Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and other EU partners who have despatched troops to Bosnia. Fears of a collapse of the UN peacekeeping effort grew this week after renewed Bosnian Serb aggression and US confirmation that it was willing to supply more than 20,000 troops to assist in a forced withdrawal. The US offer matched Nato contingency planning, but it could also spur calls in the new US Congress for a lifting of the UN arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslem government. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the summit host, was determined to maintain a consensus within the EU in favour of a diplomatic solution. This approach was confirmed, albeit with difficulty, at a meeting a week ago of the contact group on Bosnia - France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US. Mr Hurd is pinning his hopes on a three-point plan which relies heavily on President Slobodan Milosevic, the erstwhile aggressor, putting pressure on his former Bosnian Serb allies to accept a settlement. The plan involves: An early ceasefire, particularly in the besieged Moslem enclave of Bihac. Acceptance by the Bosnian Serb assembly in Pale that the Serbs occupy 51 per cent of Bosnia and the Moslems 49. Further land swaps between the Serbs and Moslems, perhaps trading Serbian gains in eastern Bosnia with a consolidation of Moslem territory around Sarajevo. The aim would be to create a confederation between the Bosnian Serbs and the Serbian government in Belgrade which would have a 'parallel special relationship' with the confederation already established between the Bosnian Moslems and the Croats. France and the UK are hoping President Milosevic will simply bypass his former ally, Mr Radovan Karadzic, and win over the majority in Pale. Mr Hurd has been in regular contact with Mr Milosevic in the past few days, according to British officials. Both countries were last night pressing European partners not to issue a strong summit statement attacking Serbian aggression for fear of destabilising Mr Milosevic. Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: A UN relief convoy yesterday reached besieged Moslems in the Bihac enclave, for the first time in more than two months as artillery and mortar attacks intensified. Serbs from Croatia yesterday finally allowed the passage of 90 tonnes of emergency food aid.</p>

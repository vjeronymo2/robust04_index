			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: S Wales Electricity dividend rise reinforces industry trend SOUTH WALES Electricity (SWALEC) announced a 14.9 per cent dividend increase yesterday, reinforcing the trend towards high pay-outs in the regional electricity indus-try. The Cardiff-based utility is recommending a final dividend per share of 15.7p, bringing the total for the year up to 22.3p. The increase came with a 19.3 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 87m, equivalent to an 18.3 per cent rise in earnings per share to 60p. Mr Wynford Evans,the chairman, said: 'The strategy we have consistently implemented since flotation is reflected again in this year's very satisfactory results. Cost reduction targets are being achieved, customers are benefiting from lower prices and we are maintaining a progressive dividend policy for shareholders.' Comparisons with the previous year's result were complicated by earlier losses in the retail unit and its subsequent disposal. But SWALEC said that ongoing businesses increased their overall profit contribution by 1.6 per cent despite tariff reductions totalling 3 per cent. The total amount of electricity distributed increased by 0.4 per cent, led by the commercial market, and costs in this segment of the business were reduced by nearly 5 per cent. Tariff reductions and a Pounds 4m investment in a new computer system for customer service led to a Pounds 2m fall in operating profit to Pounds 68.5m. The supply business contributed Pounds 5.8m, up from Pounds 3.1m the year before. The contracting business, which was expanded with the Pounds 5.4m acquisition of Phoenix Electrical, cut its loss to Pounds 2.3m from Pounds 3.8m after providing Pounds 1.1m for manpower reductions. During the year, the company paid off its debt, and ended the year with Pounds 10m in cash. The financial position was strong, and the company was unlikely to gear up again in the short term, according to Mr David Myring, group finance director. The new Teesside gas-fired power station in which SWALEC has a 7.7 per cent stake is now supplying 25 per cent of its franchise market. The company is also entering the wind power and natural gas markets. COMMENT Despite the strong result, the shares shed 2p to 546p. One reason could be a worry that SWALEC's above average rates of return will attract the regulator's eye. The company sells some of the most expensive electricity in the business, even allowing for the tariff cuts it made during the year, and some analysts were suggesting yesterday that SWALEC could prudently tone down its performance. Another strong factor is the balance sheet. With these results, SWALEC becomes the first REC to ungear, though others will follow before long. The result includes nearly Pounds 1m of net interest.</p>

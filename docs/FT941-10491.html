			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Whitehall admits aid link to Malaysian arms deal Precise amounts of British foreign aid were offered to the Malaysian government in return for arms purchases as part of a preliminary agreement between the two governments, the Foreign Office disclosed yesterday. The disclosure, that a protocol for a Pounds 1bn arms deal signed in March 1988 by the two governments contained 'figures relating amounts or percentages of civil aid to amounts of arms purchases', is the most compelling evidence to date that the government breached its own guidelines that the provision of aid should not be linked to arms sales. The admission was made last night in a parliamentary written answer by Mr Alistair Goodlad, a Foreign Office minister, in response to a question from Mr Alan Williams, the Labour MP. The allegation that the protocol contained an arms for aid formula was first made last week in the Economist magazine. Last month, the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, had said that the the protocol included 'a reference to 'aid in support of non-military aspects under this programme' ', but gave no hint that precise amounts of aid were offered. In an interview last week, Lord Younger, who was defence secretary at the time and signed the protocol, said that he had 'no recollection' that it contained an aid-for-arms formula. Soon after the signing of the protocol, Lord Younger was advised by the foreign office that aid could not be linked to arms sales, so in June 1988 he wrote to the Malaysian government to say that aid could not be linked to arms sales. The Foreign Office would not reveal last night the specific amounts of aid offered in the protocol. However the disclosure strengthened claims made by Labour MPs that the donation of Pounds 234m of aid to the Malaysians to help build a dam on the Pergau river was made in return for the arms deal. At the end of last year, a National Audit Office report criticised the method of funding for the dam chosen by the UK government. It has also emerged that the aid was given despite opposition from the Overseas Development Administration, which is supposed to have responsibility for administering the Aid and Trade Provision used to fund the dam. Foreign Office officials said yesterday that Cabinet Office guidelines on the distribution of official documents made it highly unlikely that the protocol would be published. They also said that it would be impossible to reveal officials' written advice relating to the matter.</p>

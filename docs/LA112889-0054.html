			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL URGED TO OK PANEL'S ETHICS PACKAGE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council members Gloria Molina and Marvin Braude called Monday  for quick adoption of a code of ethics proposed by the mayor's blue-ribbon  panel and, if necessary, abandonment of the council's own attempts at drafting  such a code.  </P> <P> Molina, in a written statement, asked the council's ad hoc committee on ethics  to immediately convene and recommend to the City Council that "we adopt the  entire . . . ethics package" released by Mayor Tom Bradley's special ethics  commission last week.  </P> <P> Braude has also thrown his support behind the ethics commission's proposals. He  said he will call for a full council vote on the proposals if the council's  ethics committee cannot come to general agreement on its own package by Dec. 7.  </P> <P> Braude said he will urge his colleagues, "Let's go. Stand up and be counted."  And he said council members will need a "damn good reason not to support" the  reforms, or they could face public criticism.  </P> <P> The sweeping reform measure drafted by the mayor's commission calls for a ban  on outside employment, gifts and honorariums for elected officials, a  toughening of financial disclosure regulations, a cap on campaign spending and  partial public financing  </P> <P> of city political campaigns. In addition, the commission proposed a procedure  for appointing a special prosecutor for politically sensitive cases, such as  the Bradley conflict-of-interest scandal, and establishing an independent  ethics agency.  </P> <P> The commission was established by Bradley in April, the day after his close  election to an unprecedented fifth term in office.  </P> <P> Bradley has continued to face questions about his personal finances, including  his relationship with Far East National Bank, which received $3 million in city  deposits. The bank paid Bradley $18,000 as an adviser in 1988 -- money later  returned by the mayor.  </P> <P> A report by the city attorney's office in September concluded that there was  insufficient evidence to prosecute Bradley for conflict of interest. But City  Atty. James K. Hahn criticized Bradley's ethical conduct and sued him for  failure to properly disclose his financial holdings.  </P> <P> A federal grand jury is currently investigating Bradley's ties to Far East and  seven other financial institutions.  </P> <P> In April, the City Council began its effort to draft new ethics laws but has  become bogged down by differences among its four members in key areas such as  bans on outside employment and acceptance of gifts and honorariums. The  committee has also avoided the issue of campaign finance reform, a critical  component of the mayoral commission's package.  </P> <P> The commission has set a February deadline for City Council adoption of its  proposals, or it will seek voter approval of the code of ethics through a  ballot initiative, said commission Chairman Geoffrey Cowan.  </P> <P> The commissioners have formed a "watch committee" of prominent civic, business  and labor leaders to ensure that the reforms are enacted.  </P> <P> The positions taken by Braude and Molina are among the first public stances  taken by council members in what is expected to be a divisive debate over  ethics reform.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo, through a spokesman, said Monday that he did not feel  it was necessary to respond to Molina's request for quick committee action.  Woo's spokeswoman, Julie Jaskol, said an ethics committee meeting was scheduled  Thursday to discuss Woo's earlier proposals for tighter regulation of  lobbyists. No date had yet been set to discuss the ethics commission report.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, another committee member, urged restraint and a  full public airing of the proposals. "The City Council should not be stampeded  into approving any new ethics reforms without a full analysis of their intended  and unintended effects," Galanter said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, the fourth member of the committee, has not  made public her position on the ethics reform package.  </P> <P> Many of the council members were in Atlanta on Monday.  </P></p>

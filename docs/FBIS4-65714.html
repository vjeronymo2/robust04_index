			<p>BFN     [Text] The Dutch Cabinet has announced that the security  situation in Rwanda is so bad that, for the time being, the  Netherlands is not to provide troops for a UN peacekeeping  force. Apparently, the gruesome murder of 10 Belgian blue  helmets in Rwanda last month was an important factor in the  Dutch Cabinet's decision. Rwanda used to be a Belgian colony  and the Dutch ministers fear that Dutch soldiers could be  mistaken for Belgians.</p>

The American Reliance Company, which helped set up the  unified telephone network in greater Cairo and Alexandria,  established an information line between the Egyptian Telephone  Exchange network and the central computer in the United States.  The line could be used to tap the telephone communications of  various ministries, parties, trade unions, and different  subscribers.    In unifying the network, the American company Reliance  depended on a central computer in which data concerning  subscribers was stored on floppy disks connected with sets in  every telephone exchange. These programs could be used to cut  in on subscribers for testing and for other purposes, such as  listening in.    The programs are started by a specific signal that could be  sent from some distance from the United States using the  information line between the Egyptian Telephone Exchange and the  American central computer. With slight changes, signals could  be received indicating that the line of the subscriber they want  to tap is busy. Thus the telephone conversation can be taped.    The CIA tapped President Husni Mubarak's telephone calls  during the Achille Lauro crisis, contrary to reports circulated  at the time that bugs were planted in the president's office.    The devices were also used in taping Palestinian leader  Yasir  'Arafat's telephone calls on the settlement talks. The  recordings were used in an attempt to show that the Palestinian  stance was racist.    According to information, the National Telecommunications  Authority had started to implement measures to guarantee secrecy  and prevent the use of devices and advanced technologies that  seek to serve subscribers for purposes other than those for  which they were designed, particularly activities that threaten  Egyptian national security.</p>

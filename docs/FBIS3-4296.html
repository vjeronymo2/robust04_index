			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by ROK President Kim Yong-sam with domestic </F> and foreign reporters at the Great Hall of the People in  Beijing--live]    [Text] [SBS reporter Chon Yong-hak] Mr. President, you  agreed in the ROK-PRC summit talks yesterday on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the principle of  solution through dialogue. But the present situation is that  the efforts for solution through dialogue have run up against a  wall, as inter-Korean dialogue broke down and the dialogue  between North Korea and the United States is suspended. In this  connection, please tell us whether specific discussion was made  on the issue of China playing the role of mediator to resolve  the North Korean nuclear issue. In addition, you said that you  would decide the time when the Team Spirit exercise will be  resumed after your visit to Japan and China. What is your plan  on this?    [President Kim] The one-on-one summit I had with President  Jiang Zemin which lasted for one hour and 20 minutes was  entirely devoted to the North Korean nuclear issue. Only in the  expanded summit talks did we discuss economic cooperation. I  think the talks were very serious and beneficial. However, it  is difficult to disclose all the conversation between the  presidents here. Nevertheless, I told you that the presidents  intensively discussed the North Korean nuclear issue. Although  much discussion is being made on such matters as the Team Spirit  exercise and the Patriot missiles, we never discussed the Team  Spirit exercise or the Patriot missile in the talks.    My statement that I would decide on the matter of the Team  Spirit exercise after my visit to Japan and China is still  valid. I am now staying in China. Therefore, I have time  before making the decision I promised to make, you will  understand this.    [KBS reporter Kim Hong] I would like to ask you about the  Team Spirit exercise. You said you would decide on the issue of  the Team Spirit exercise after your visits. Do you think that  the results of your visits will affect the issue of the Team  Spirit exercise in any way?    [President Kim] As I have emphasized whenever there was an  opportunity to do so, the Team Spirit exercise is an exercise  for defensive purposes, not an offensive exercise. This is the  point that should be taken into account. This concept remains  unchanged if I leave the ROK or if I visit Japan and China.    [SEOUL SINMUN's Beijing-based correspondent Che Chu-sang] As  was noted in the first question, the North Korean nuclear  problem does not show any signs of solution. Please tell us  whether you have any plan to conduct inter-Korean economic  cooperation or to make an active effort for inter-Korean summit  talks to bring a breakthrough in this situation.    [President Kim] There is no change in my position regarding  the inter-Korean summit talks. That is, I am prepared to come  to the talks if it helps resolve the nuclear issue. I think  that this helps create an atmosphere for economic cooperation as  well.    [XINHUA reporter] Your excellency has previously said that  the economic and trade relations between the ROK and China have  been pushed ahead without a hitch. However, for instance, China  last year recorded a $2 billion trade deficit with the ROK. As  far as we know, the ROK imposes unfair controlled tariffs on  some Chinese agricultural products. Do you have any plan to  abolish such tariffs for the rectification of the trade  imbalance?    [President Kim] I think there is a difference in the method  of calculating the trade volume between the ROK and China. You  said China's trade deficit amounted to $2 billion last year,  however that is not true. I guess it resulted from the  difference in the calculation. The ROK is now paving the way  for easing all the regulations and opening our markets further  and will endeavor to have these things handled autonomously to  the maximum. In addition, the ROK will direct all possible  efforts to balance ROK-China trade.    [KYODO News Agency reporter Kotawa] Mr. President, in your  address before the Japanese Diet, you looked back upon the past  one hundred years of Korea's modern history and expressed a  resolve that the ROK will not repeat past failures. In light of  this, what kind of role do you think the ROK should assume in  the Asia-Pacific region toward the 21st Century?    [President Kim] In connection with this question, I firmly  believe that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] will  become the epicenter of the economy of the 21st Century. In  this connection, what I desperately felt during my visit to  Japan and China was the necessity for the ROK, Japan, and China  to cooperate. An APEC meeting was once held in Seattle. I think  we should further enhance the role of the APEC and effectively  operate the APEC summit which is slated to be held in Indonesia  in January.    [HANGUK ILBO Beijing correspondent Yi Kyong-won] I would  like  to ask you once again about the nuclear issue. The president  visited China, which is expected to play a decisive role in the  North Korean nuclear issue, at a time when the issue is  virtually in a deadlock. Were you aware of the stance China  would assume toward North Korea's nuclear issue before your  visit? Is there any change in your stance toward the nuclear  issue in the wake of your visit?    [President Kim] I have already touched on that issue. I had  a comfortable conversation with President Jiang Zemin since this  was my second summit with him. I met with him several times at  the APEC summit. I think it is very important for people to  meet often because this will give an opportunity for the people  to share their opinions frankly. I think it is not appropriate  to reveal all the conversation exchanged in the summit. However  what I can say is that there is no change in China's position  and my position on the nuclear issue in the wake of my visit.  The two sides reaffirmed a joint stance. President Jiang Zemin  and I concurred that nuclear weapons should not exist on the  Korean peninsula. I also think this issue must not hinder  economic development in this region.    [CNN reporter Mike Chinoy, in English] Mike Chinoy from  CNN. Mr. President, the Chinese have made very clear in the  last few days they are strongly opposed to the use of pressure  on North Korea, that they are strongly opposed to bringing the  issue to the United Nations, that they are strongly opposed to  the use of sanctions. Are you at all disappointed with the way  the Chinese put forward their position on this issue? In view  of what the Chinese have said publicly or privately to you,  where does this lead the process of dealing with the nuclear  issue which is now under discussion at the UN Security Council?  Does this slow it or does this clear any difficulties for  moving through the United Nations into trying to exert pressure  on the North to open up its nuclear facilities? Thank you.    [President Kim] You have asked questions in a very  complicated way. I know China has its own views, of course.  However, our two countries reached an agreement that the ROK  and China will closely cooperate with each other with regard to  the North Korean nuclear issue. Therefore, the two countries  will hold close consultations on how to deal with this issue in  the United Nations and any other places. Of course, how the  North Korean nuclear issue will proceed -- I sent the ROK  foreign minister to the United States this morning. He will hold  consultations with the U.S. leaders and ambassadors at the  United Nations. He will also visit Japan on his way back home  and meet the Japanese leaders. We will hold close consultations  with the United States, Japan, and China. We are also holding  consultations with Russia, an important country in our  neighborhood, on various channels. I am planning to send our  foreign minister to Russia early next month. We will hold  consultations with the four powers. I believe every issue can  be satisfactorily resolved at the United Nations and other  places. [pause for translation into Chinese] Let us conclude  today's news conference at this point. Thank you.

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Sullivan has 10.15% stake in Bristol Post Mr David Sullivan, proprietor of The Sunday Sport, has increased his stake in the Bristol Evening Post to 10.15 per cent, through the purchase of 25,000 shares. Mr Sullivan, once the owner of Britain's biggest chain of sex shops, has been stalking the Post for some two years in the hope of using it as a base from which to launch a middle-market national daily paper. So far his efforts have yielded a snub from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and failure to win a seat on the Post board.</p>

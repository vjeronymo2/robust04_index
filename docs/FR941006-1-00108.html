			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Iron Toxicity in Young Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the minimal toxic and lethal doses for iron have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been clearly established (Ref. 6), the severity of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> poisoning when an overdose has been ingested is related to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of iron absorbed into the circulatory system. Experts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have stated that ingestion of 25 mg/kg of iron (250 mg total iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a 10 kg child) may produce symptoms of poisoning, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of 60 mg/kg total iron for a 10 kg child is the minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intake for the development of significant iron poisoning (Refs. 6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 7). One source recommends emergency room evaluation when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of iron exceeds 50 mg/kg (Ref. 6). An acute ingestion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of more than 250 mg/kg for a 10 kg child is typically considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a lethal dose for iron (Ref. 8). However, it has been reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ingestion of 100 to 200 mg/kg for a 10 kg child can be fatal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 9), and that ingestion of as little as 650 mg of iron (65  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/kg for a 10 kg child) has resulted in death (Ref. 7). Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon these reported values, acute ingestions of less than 1,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg of iron appear to be likely to cause nonfatal injuries of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> varying severity, depending on the amount of ingested iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Iron overdose results in both local and systemic effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref 10). Toxicity is caused by both a direct corrosive effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the gastrointestinal mucosa and the presence of unbound iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the circulatory system. Locally in the stomach and intestine, ingested iron is corrosive and produces death of cells in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mucosa lining the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in ulceration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and hemorrhage. While intact mucosa limits the absorption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron, eroded mucosa permits absorption of relatively huge amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of iron into the portal circulation that goes immediately to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liver, causing damage to liver cells. Overload of the liver  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cells, which normally remove iron from the circulation, allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron to enter the general circulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  When the circulating iron exceeds the capacity of certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proteins to bind it, free iron reaches other tissues, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kidneys, lungs, heart and blood vessels, and the brain. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resultant death of cells in these tissues produces the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wide-spread symptoms and signs of iron poisoning: Kidney  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure, edema in the lung, hemorrhage, hypotension from damage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the heart and blood vessels, coma from damage to the brain,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and acidosis from release of organic acids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Severe iron poisoning is characterized by four clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stages (Refs. 6 and 9):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) Stage one, which may occur within 30 minutes (min) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion, is characterized primarily by signs and symptoms of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (i.e., nausea, vomiting, abdominal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pain, hematemesis (vomiting blood), and bloody diarrhea) that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress to shock, coma, seizures, and death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) During stage two, which occurs from 2 to 12 hours (hr)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after ingestion, patients may be without symptoms and may appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have recovered. Some children will recover, but some may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> progress to stage three. The appearance of recovery should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay evaluation and treatment for iron poisoning because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful treatment is difficult once the iron is absorbed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the small intestine into the blood.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) During stage three, from 12 to 48 hr after ingestion,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a recurrence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage with severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lethargy or coma, and there may be liver and kidney failure and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collapse of the heart and blood vessels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (4) Stage four, 3 to 4 weeks after survivors of poisonings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingested the iron, may include gastrointestinal obstruction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cirrhosis of the liver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In evaluating a child who is thought to have ingested an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overdose of iron, an abdominal x-ray looking for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tablets, a qualitative color test for iron in the stomach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contents, and an emergency determination of the concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron in blood plasma may be performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  If an overdose of iron is indicated, an emetic agent may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administered to cause regurgitation of the iron if the patient is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully awake and alert. In addition to emesis, catharsis with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saline or sorbitol may be used to induce gastric emptying.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, neither emesis nor catharsis is advised if hemorrhagic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gastroenteritis is present. Gastric lavage, i.e., washing out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stomach, with saline or sodium bicarbonate or whole bowel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> irrigation with a balanced polyethylene glycol-electrolyte  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solution by gastric tube have been used to remove undissolved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tablets (Ref. 11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

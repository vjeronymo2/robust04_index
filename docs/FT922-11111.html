			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / ABF falls 5.4% to Pounds 175m at half year ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS, the Sunblest bread to Silver Spoon sugar group, yesterday reported a 5.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 175.2m as investment income fell and baking margins came under pressure. The figures cover the six months to March 14. Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said the economy lacked buoyancy and trading conditions were depressed. He saw no sign of an immediate improvement. The shares fell ahead of the results but recovered to close unchanged at 427p as the profits were at the top end of expectations. Mr Weston said that, without a material uplift in the economies where ABF operates, second-half results would 'at best' match the previous year, suggesting a pre-tax profit for the year of at most Pounds 322.5m, down from Pounds 332.4m. The figures were affected by the Pounds 880m acquisition of British Sugar, owned for 12 weeks of the first half of 1990-91. It contributed sales of Pounds 370m and trading profits of Pounds 74.5m in the first half, compared with Pounds 170m and Pounds 33.2m. Group turnover rose 17.4 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn, and trading profits were 31.5 per cent up at Pounds 160.4m. British Sugar's profits more than offset the fall in income from financing the purchase. However, investment income fell from Pounds 84.4m to Pounds 36.6m, with Pounds 10m of the fall attributed to lower interest rates. Interest payable was Pounds 21.8m against Pounds 21.3m. Net cash was around Pounds 350m at the half year, down from Pounds 416.7m at the September year-end which is a seasonal high point. After a slightly higher tax rate of 32.4 per cent from 31.3 per cent there was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 10.6m which is a provision for the fall in value of the group's stake in Berisford International. Last year's accounts included a Pounds 100.5m write-down of the investment. The holding has been written down to 18p a share. In the UK and Europe sales were 19 per cent up at Pounds 1.8bn, and trading profits 37 per cent ahead to Pounds 141.8m. Excluding British Sugar, other operations increased sales by 6 per cent to Pounds 615m and trading profits were down by Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 42.3m. Earnings per share were 25.8, down from 27.7. The first interim dividend is unchanged at 8.5p. However, ABF said that, following the change in year-end, the entire increase for the 1991-92 financial year would be included in the March 1993 dividend. Lex, Page 20</p>

Ukrainian Military Delegation Visits Almaty and  Tashkent]    [Text] A military delegation, headed by Colonel General  Ivan Oliynyk, deputy minister of defense for armaments of  Ukraine and chief of armaments of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,  returned to Kiev from Central Asia. The delegation visited  Almaty and Tashkent, where it held talks on a wide range of  subjects with representatives of the war offices [viyskovi  vidomstva] of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Among the topics  discussed were the modernization of already existing equipment  and weapons and the development of new models, scientific  research, cooperation in the rocket and space research field,  and the effective use of the capabilities of the  military-industrial complexes of these sovereign countries. The  parties expressed interest in cooperating in all these areas. In  today's situation, this is understandable -- the shortest route  to attaining our objective is by combining our endeavors.    Summarizing the outcome of the talks after the conclusion of  the Ukrainian military delegation's visit to Kazakhstan,  Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk underscored:    "These talks not only enabled us to bring our positions  closer together but also to lay a long-term foundation for a  series of joint measures in the field of military cooperation.  These meetings should have been held a year ago. We have lost  time and certain opportunities, which we now have to make up  for."    Obviously, this applies not only to the talks with the  Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan, but also to Ukraine's  relations with Uzbekistan. After all, the armed forces of all  three independent young states find themselves in a similar  situation. On the one hand, this means a huge inventory of  equipment and weapons, which very often cannot be utilized to  their full potential due to a shortage of component and spare  parts, and, on the other hand, a complete lack of certain kinds  of weapons that are essential for ensuring the military security  of a sovereign state, difficulties in settling accounts between  states for services of a military-technical nature (the national  monetary units have not yet been made convertible and there is a  catastrophic shortage of hard currency in the republics'  budgets), and a decline in the output of the defense industry,  whose task it is to supply the army of each state with  everything it needs to maintain a high level of combat readiness  [boyehotovnist].    Today, however, the situation is such that precisely because  of prevailing economic conditions, the primary task facing the  defense industry ["oboronka"] is not developing and producing  new kinds of weapons (although this, too, must not be ignored),  but rather modernizing and uniformizing existing inventory with  a view to improving its tactical features. This is the sphere in  which there are wide-ranging opportunities for cooperation on  the part of Ukraine's defense industry enterprises with both  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan -- above all, on a bilateral basis.  The advantages of this are quite obvious, both in political and  economic terms. Bilateral treaties and agreements are a real  foundation for genuinely equal, mutually advantageous interstate  relations that are free of the so-called older or younger  brother syndrome. It was, after all, rather strange to learn  during the talks that at one time Russia had offered to sell  Ukraine weapons, which, as it turns out, are being produced not  in Russia but by Kazakhstan's defense enterprises. And, as was  to be expected, Russia offered its services in exchange for  rubles. Would it not make more sense for Ukraine to deal  directly with Kazakhstan, just as Kazakhstan should not need to  look for products of Ukrainian manufacture in Russia, but should  come directly to a reliable partner, who is guided by principles  of trust and mutual economic benefits?    It seems that after the talks this point became quite clear  in both Almaty and Tashkent. The position of the chief of the  General Staff of the Armed Forces of Kazakhstan is quite telling  in this respect. Despite the fact that, unlike Ukraine,  Kazakhstan is a member of the Agreement on Collective Security  of the CIS, Major-General Alibek Kasymov noted:    "A state always has its interests. And if we build the  relations between our states on the principles of mutual  respect, mutual trust, and mutual economic advantage proposed by  the Ukrainian side, there will never be any misunderstandings  between us. The further strengthening of our relations and  anything we do to broaden and deepen them -- and I regard the  meeting of the representatives of the defense ministries of  Kazakhstan and Ukraine as a step in precisely this direction --  will only benefit the defense capabilities of both countries."    We should regard as quite logical the desire by the  respective war offices to speed up the work of preparing the  Treaty on Military Cooperation between the Republic of  Kazakhstan and Ukraine that is reflected in the concluding  protocol. There is indeed a great deal that we can work on  together.    Apart from modernizing and uniformizing armaments, an  important role in the relations between Ukraine and Kazakhstan  consists in cooperation directed at developing the rocket and  space research potential of the two countries, both of which  possess a real foundation and the necessary capabilities for  this endeavor. Evidence of such cooperation will be Ukraine's  Zenit carrier-rocket with a Ukrainian satellite, which will be  launched from the Kazakh space center in Baykonur.    Kiev's military is also interested in obtaining access to  the  proving grounds located in Kazakhstan to use for their own  needs. The effective military training of anti-aircraft and  rocket forces is next to impossible without such access, and it  is much more difficult to modernize certain kinds of military  equipment. What is interesting, however, is that although de  jure these sites clearly belong to Kazakhstan, de facto they are  quite actively controlled by Russia. In reference to this  matter, Col-Gen Ivan Oliynyk stated:    "The issue of using the military proving grounds and the  space center located on the territory of Kazakhstan has to be  decided on the basis of a tripartite agreement between  Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. It is unlikely that we will be  able to attain our objective without such an agreement. I think  that at the outset Russia may oppose the signing of such  trilateral agreements, but we have enough arguments at our  disposal to ultimately succeed."    As regards Uzbekistan, the visit of the Ukrainian military  delegation to Tashkent will also produce fruitful and mutually  advantageous results. For example, Ukrainian industry is in a  position to offer the Ministry of Defense of Uzbekistan a broad  range of products and services that are needed to refurbish and  modernize the military equipment of the national armed forces of  Uzbekistan. There exists a real basis for joint  scientific-military projects and for establishing a mutually  beneficial system of training military personnel. It is not  unlikely that in the very near future Ukrainian enterprises will  receive orders for the manufacture of cloth for Uzbek Army  personnel, with Uzbekistan supplying our enterprises with  cotton...    Most of the plans based on the bilateral agreements, which  are now interstate and intergovernmental in nature, are expected  to benefit the armed forces in particular and the defense  potential in general of all three countries -- Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan -- in the very near future.</p>

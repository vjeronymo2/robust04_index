			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> AD PUSH DESIGNED TO BOLSTER TOURISM  </P> <P> In a first for Buena Park, city officials have teamed with several local  businesses in a bid to lure tourists from Northern California to such  attractions as Knott's Berry Farm by promoting the city in an ad campaign.  </P> <P> The Sacramento Consumer Campaign, scheduled to begin in April, is a cooperative  effort conceived to boost not only tourism but also the city's tax base,  through the transient occupancy tax.  </P> <P> The ad campaign will cost $50,000, which will be split by the city and  participating businesses.  </P> <P> Sacramento was chosen as the first target because, according to marketing  surveys conducted by area businesses, Northern California is where most Buena  Park tourists come from, said Marilyn Cuadros, director of marketing for the  Buena Park Visitors and Convention Bureau.  </P> <P> If this effort is successful, other potential areas to be targeted will include  San Diego, Phoenix and San Francisco, she added.  </P> <P> "We have been thinking for a long time about doing something there," said Joyia  Emard, director of marketing for the Medieval Times theater-restaurant.  </P> <P> Emard said the campaign is attractive to her business because it is a  group-sponsored promotion.  </P> <P> The campaign will target several media, including newspaper and radio. Several  promotions are planned, including an on-the-spot discount for patrons who show  a Sacramento-area driver's license when buying tickets at participating  attractions.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

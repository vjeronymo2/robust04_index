Last  week's record seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine dispelled  any remaining doubts about the key role the country plays in  shipping cocaine produced in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. In  addition to distributing drugs to other countries, for the past  four years there has been a new twist in Brazil's trafficking  activities that concerns police authorities: Brazil is producing  cocaine.    The Federal Police [PF] believe at least 2 percent of  Colombian-owned refining laboratories have been operating in  Brazilian territory since 1990.    Sergio Sakon, chief of the PF Narcotics Enforcement  Department, rules out the possibility that this percentage will  increase in the next few years. In addition to difficulties in  transporting the cocaine base -- a coca by-product -- into  Brazil, there are no experts in cocaine refining in the country.  Brazilian laboratories are operated by Colombian and Bolivian  "cooks," who attract attention in border areas and thus increase  the risk of a police crackdown.    Sakon added: Furthermore, laboratories require the  cooperation of their host communities. They can get this  cooperation in Colombia, but not in Brazil.    Studies by the DEA (the U.S. drug enforcement organization)  show, however, that U.S. military actions against the Colombian  cartels have resulted in the laboratories being moved to safer  ground, mainly to the Brazilian border with Colombia, Bolivia,  and Peru. The Brazilian region that houses the laboratories is  identical to the areas where the main cocaine refining  laboratories are located in the three neighboring countries:  Tropical forests and savannas.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK says Libya is stopping Britons leaving BRITAIN yesterday accused Libya of preventing a number of foreigners, including some UK nationals, from leaving the country as the United Nations Security Council moved to vote to impose sanctions on Libya, including a ban on air links. The foreign office, echoing reports from European embassies in Tripoli, said several people had been refused exit visas in the past 10 days and that the matter had been raised with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN Secretary General. European envoys in Tripoli met yesterday afternoon and agreed to hand the Libyan government a formal letter of complaint demanding the swift issue of exit visas. Poland said 50 of its citizens had been refused documents and one diplomat said a further 25 Europeans had encountered difficulties. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, described the matter in a BBC radio interview as 'thoroughly unsatisfactory', adding it could be a ploy by Libya to obstruct the imposition of sanctions. But the foreign office said the position in Tripoli was 'patchy and unclear' and there was no certainty that Libya was deliberately blocking visas to Britons or other nationalities. A small number of visas had been issued in the last few days, including to Britons, officials said. A diplomat at the Italian embassy in Tripoli, which has represented British interests in Libya since diplomatic links were cut, said by telephone: 'We think it's just a general delay. There's no panic here.' The granting of visas usually takes four or five days in Libya and what some diplomats in Tripoli called an 'unusual slowing' in the process may in part be due to the effects of Ramadan and the proximity of the Eid al Fitr holiday to mark its end on April 5. Britain, along with the US, last month urged the 5,000 or so Britons working in Libya to 'consider carefully' leaving the country in view of the prospective ban on air links. The US state department said it had no information about any difficulties faced by the 1,000 or so Americans working in Libya. Thousands of foreigners work in the country including 15,000 Indians, 5,000 Britons, 5,000 South Koreans, 2,800 Poles, 600 Germans, and 500 French citizens. The air ban, along with an arms embargo and curbs on the size and status of Libyan representation abroad, will take effect on April 15 unless Libya surrenders two men suspected of bombing a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie in 1988. Tony Walker adds from Cairo: Traffic across Egypt's remote western border with Libya is expected to increase after the imposition of the UN ban on aviation links. Shipping from Egyptian ports is also likely to benefit from the air embargo. Others among Libya's neighbours who are also certain to experience a jump in 'transit' traffic include Tunisia, which shares a land border, and Malta. Col Gadaffi's recent threat, in an interview with the French weekly Figaro magazine, that he would refuse to do business with 'hostile' countries, such as France, indicates Libya will endeavour to be more selective in its choice of trading partners. 'I make it quite clear and what I am telling you is a warning: whoever supports our political cause will benefit from all our projects. Whoever stands against our political cause will get nothing.' Western officials in Cairo say that while Egypt will probably fall reluctantly into line with the letter of the UN resolutions, it will do what it can to soften the blow to Libya by facilitating movement of goods and personnel that would normally have gone by aircraft.

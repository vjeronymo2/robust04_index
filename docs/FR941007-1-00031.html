			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) Contracting officers shall include the mandatory designated entity subcontracting goal in the presolicitation notice (see (FAR) 48 CFR 5.204) and in any draft Request for Proposal that is issued. The contracting officer and the small business specialist will consider all comments received in response to either the presolicitation notice or the draft Request for Proposal prior to determining the mandatory goal in the formal solicitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In negotiated acquisitions, an initial proposal will not be rejected as unacceptable solely as a result of an offeror proposing a goal that is less than the mandatory goal. Subsequent to the evaluation of proposals, in which the proposed goal shall be evaluated as a separate element under a management subfactor under the Mission Suitability factor, consistent with NFS 1815.608&hyph;72, the contracting officer shall negotiate with the apparently successful offeror(s) to establish the designated entity subcontracting goal to be inserted in the contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If a bidder, in response to a sealed bid solicitation, takes exception to the specified mandatory subcontracting goal, the bid shall not be rejected as nonresponsive. If the bidder is selected for award, the contracting officer may request the bidder to offer a revised designated entity subcontracting goal by a specified date. If the bidder's response indicates that the bidder does not intend to use its best efforts to provide the designated entities the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in performance of the contract, the contracting officer may find the bidder nonresponsible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) In solicitations, proposals, and resulting contracts, the designated entity subcontracting goal should be stated as a percentage of the total contract value rather than as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars. Subcontracting plans shall conform to the requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, i.e., the goals included in the plans shall be expressed in terms of percentages of total planned subcontracting dollars. Also, SF 294 and SF 295 reports shall continue to be completed in accordance with the instructions on these forms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1819.7006 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The contracting officer shall insert the provision at 1852.219&hyph;73, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, in solicitations containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9. Insert in the last sentence the number of calendar days after the contracting officer's request that the offeror must submit a complete plan. When offerors are to include subcontracting plans in their initial offers as contemplated by (FAR) 48 CFR 19.705&hyph;2(d), or if a noncompetitive solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the provision with its Alternate I. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;75, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Reporting, in solicitations and contracts containing the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9. Those current contracts containing subcontracting plans and designated by NASA Headquarters (Code HC) shall be amended to require quarterly submission of the SF 295. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In all solicitations and contracts which contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76, NASA Subcontracting Goal, when contracting by negotiation. In all solicitations and contracts which contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 with its Alternate I, when contracting by sealed bidding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, and when the contract value is expected to exceed the small purchase limitation, the contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 with its Alternate II, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In solicitations and contracts which do not contain the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.219&hyph;9, and when the contract value is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction), and the contractor is a small business which is not a designated entity, the contracting officer may use the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 instead of the clause at 1852.219&hyph;76 with its Alternate II. The basic clause should be used when the contracting officer determines that the procurement offers subcontracting opportunities with designated entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1852_SOLICITATION AND CONTRACT CLAUSES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / TSB to cut 440 jobs in shake-up TRUSTEE Savings Bank is making 440 managers and clerical staff redundant as part of a merger of its retail banking and insurance operations. The move is the latest in a series of attempts by banks to reduce staff costs, John Gapper writes. TSB said yesterday that 80 senior managers had already left the bank, mostly by voluntary redundancy. It hoped to reach agreement on voluntary redundancy with 150 branch managers over the next few months. The remaining job losses in TSB Retail Banking and Insurance will involve 120 computer staff and 80 clerical staff. The company, which employs 25,000 staff, said it expected most of those made redundant would leave within a year. The job losses were criticised by the banking union Bifu, which said it would hold meetings with members employed by TSB Retail Banking and Insurance over the next few weeks to decide how to respond. Ms Jennifer Cole, a Bifu negotiating officer, said the job cuts were 'totally indefensible' and would damage customer service. The union said it believed there would be further job losses as a result of the operations merger.</p>

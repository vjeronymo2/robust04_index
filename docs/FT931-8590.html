			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: CDC profits fall due to provisions CAISSE des Depots et Consignations (CDC), one of France's largest state-controlled financial institutions, saw net profits fall by almost 40 per cent to FFr2.1bn (Dollars 380m) last year from FFr3.5bn in 1991 after making sizeable provisions on its property and equity investments. Mr Philippe Lagayette, the former deputy director of the Bank of France who last year replaced Mr Robert Lion as CDC's chairman, said he hoped to see a return to profits growth this year. CDC said it was extending its investments by providing FFr1.5bn in equity-linked debt to Air France, the state-controlled airline. CDC already has a small stake in the carrier through CDC Participations, one of its subsidiaries. Mr Lagayette said CDC's banking activities and other financial operations had fared well during 1992, with gross profits (before provisions) rising 18 per cent to FFr6.4bn. However, CDC, like other French financial groups, was affected by the impact of the economic slowdown on its industrial investments and property holdings. It also suffered from the poor performance of its cable television interests, which lost FFr540m during the year. These problems fuelled a steep increase in overall provisions, which reduced gross profits to FFr3.3bn, against FFr4.85bn in 1991.</p>

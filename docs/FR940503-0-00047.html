Were there is any doubt as to the item's suitability for calibration or test, where the item does not conform to the description provided, or where the calibration or test required is not fully specified, the laboratory shall consult the client for further instruction before proceeding. The laboratory shall establish whether the item has received all necessary preparation, or whether the client requires preparation to be undertaken or arranged by the laboratory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The laboratory shall have documented procedures and appropriate facilities to avoid deterioration or damage to the calibration or test item, during storage, handling, preparation, and calibration or test; any relevant instructions provided with the item shall be followed. Where items have to be stored or conditioned under specific environmental conditions, these conditions shall be maintained, monitored and recorded where necessary. Where a calibration or test item or portion of an item is to be held secure (for example, for reasons of record, safety or value, or to enable check calibrations or tests to be performed later), the laboratory shall have storage and security arrangements that protect the condition and integrity of the secured items or portions concerned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The laboratory shall have documented procedures for the receipt, retention or safe disposal of calibration or test items, including all provisions necessary to protect the integrity of the laboratory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Records.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The laboratory shall maintain a record system to suit its particular circumstances and comply with any applicable regulations. It shall retain on record all original observations, calculations and derived data, calibration records and a copy of the calibration certificate, test certificate or test report for an appropriate period. The records for each calibration and test shall contain sufficient information to permit their repetition. The records shall include the identity of personnel involved in sampling, preparation, calibration or testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All records (including those listed in &sect;285.33(f)(4) pertaining to calibration and test equipment), certificates and reports shall be safely stored, held secure and in confidence to the client. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Certificates and reports.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The results of each calibration, test, or series of calibrations or tests carried out by the laboratory shall be reported accurately, clearly, unambiguously and objectively, in accordance with any instructions in the calibration or test methods. The results should normally be reported in a calibration certificate, test report or test certificate and should include all the information necessary for the interpretation of the calibration or test results and all information required by the method used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each certificate or report shall include at least the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A title, e.g., ``Calibration Certificate'', ``Test Report'' or ``Test Certificate'';  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Name and address of laboratory, and location where the calibration or test was carried out if different from the address of the laboratory; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Unique identification of the certificate or report (such as serial number) and of each page, and the total number of pages;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Name and address of client, where appropriate;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Description and unambiguous identification of the item calibrated or tested;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Characterization and condition of the calibration or test item; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

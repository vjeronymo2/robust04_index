According to  various estimates, the death toll runs from 20 to 50. Jean Mater  Ndi has more details.    [Begin Ndi recording] Between 23 and 24 December, a Kotoko  was killed by an Arab Shuwa in the Makere District in the  extreme north of the country. In retaliation, Kotokos decided  to exact revenge on the night of 25 December; they went from  mere words to action. The Arab Shuwa village of Sulfa was  attacked and the two communities are now fighting with cold  steel weapons, arrows, and rifles. Several people were killed  or seriously wounded on both sides. As is usually the case in  this region, the Arab Shuwa reacted swiftly. The day after the  attack, 26 December, they attacked all Kotoko villages around  the (Ndjamonou) District. This is the second day of terribly  violent clashes between Arab Shuwa and Kotoko with some sources  stating 20 dead and seriously wounded, while sources close to  official circles say the death may be as high as 50.    Last year, clashes took place between the two communities  and  led to scores of dead and injured. [end recording]</p>

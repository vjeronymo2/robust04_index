Weiss met earlier in the day with Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and invited him for official visit to Israel, Japanese  officials said.    The speaker of the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, arrived  in  Japan on Monday as leader of the first Knesset delegation  officially invited by the Diet, or Japanese parliament.    On behalf of Israel, Weiss received an original visa issued  by Sugihara during a ceremony at the Israeli Embassy.    It was presented by Sugihara's widow, Yukiko, and Sumiko  Simkin, widow of Joseph Simkin, a recently deceased Polish Jew  who was a beneficiary of Sugihara's past humanitarian action.    Embassy officials said the visa will be preserved in the Yad  Vashem, a national holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.    Simkin, who also participated in rescue operations during  the  war in Poland and Lithuania, came to Japan on the visa and  remained as a businessman until his death last year.    As Nazi forces rolled across Poland, Sugihara issued in  August 1940 transit visas to Japan for 6,000 Jews without prior  authorization from Tokyo.    He was ordered to resign from the Foreign Ministry in 1947  and died in July 1986 at age 86. In October 1991, the ministry  posthumously rehabilitated him and apologized to his widow.    In Israel, Sugihara has been awarded the title of "righteous  among the nations" and a small grove in a Jerusalem suburb is  named after him.    Embassy officials said Weiss, a holocaust survivor, will  visit the atomic-bombed city of Hiroshima on Friday to lay a  wreath at a memorial.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck meeting to go ahead SEARS, Roebuck, the troubled US retailing conglomerate, said yesterday that two shareholders had failed in a legal attempt to delay the company's annual meeting, which will take place today in Chicago. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter denied a motion by the stockholders, who together own 500 Sears shares, seeking a delay in the meeting on the grounds that Sears failed to disclose, in proxy materials for the meeting, the existence of a 1988 shareholder suit in Chicago against the company. The Chicago case, revealed last weekend in a newspaper article, alleges that a restructuring of Sears in 1988 was meant to entrench management against a possible takeover threat.</p>

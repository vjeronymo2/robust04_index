			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / FT Traveller, Zurich (15): Start at 'The Gates of Hell' - The city is blessed with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the visitor busy for a week or more. But check admission times: some are open only in the afternoons Where is the largest collection outside Scandinavia of the work of Edvard Munch? And where is one of the finest private collections of European art? Where is the only museum in Europe entirely devoted to native American Indians? And where is the only museum showing the influence of coffee on social and cultural life? Where did the Dada movement begin? Where can one view a collection of 20th-century art, dominated by the works of Augusto and Giovanni Giacometti and Giovanni's son, Alberto? Where is one of the world's finest museums of Asian and African art? And which European city threatens its graffiti artists with imprisonment? The answer to all these question is, of course, Zurich. The city is blessed with enough museums, gardens and galleries to keep the most enthusiastic observer busy for a week or more. The smaller contemporary art galleries tend to open only in the afternoons, so it is a good idea to visit the main collections in the mornings. Why not start your tour at 'The Gates of Hell' by Rodin outside the entrance to the ultra-modern Kunsthaus in Heimplatz? Here, you can acquaint yourself with the work of the leading Swiss 20th-century painter, Ferdinand Hodler. There is also an excellent range of paintings, drawings and sculptures of old masters and Zurich artists from the 15th century to the present. It is here that one can see so much Edvard Munch and so much space devoted to the Giacomettis. The Kunsthaus is on the circuit for full-dress exhibitions of artists of international repute and often has smaller studio presentations of contemporary and local artists. The Swiss National Museum (Schweizerische Landesmuseum) is a neo-Gothic building which looks like an old castle complete with gate tower and wings built around a central courtyard. It is across the street from the main railway station and acquired notoriety in the late 1980s when drug addicts converged in the adjacent Platzspitz park. The addicts have since been shooed away and the park has been restored. It displays artefacts of Swiss culture from the stone age to present, including weapons, flags, uniforms, armour, toy armies, costumes, coins, jewellery, seals, glass painting, religious painting and sculpture, whole house interiors, watches, musical instruments and farm and industrial tools. In short, one can discover a well-presented and informative illustrated history of Switzerland. The Rietberg Museum in Gablerstrasse is housed in the grounds of an exquisite 19th-century neo-classical mansion, Villa Wesendonck, built for a German merchant in imitation of the Roman Villa Albani. It long served as a retreat for musicians and writers. Richard Wagner spent several years here, and there is a monument to him. After the City of Zurich acquired Baron Eduard Van der Heydt's famous Asian and African collections in 1956, this villa became a public museum for non-European art. The Bellerive Museum, housed in another neo-classical villa in Hoschgasse, is devoted to arts and crafts, including art nouveau textiles, tapestries and modern furniture. Sadly, the display space is limited, but the care which is taken in presenting the frequently changing displays make it well worth a visit. In the summer the courtyard contains a sculpture exhibition. Across the street from the Bellerive is the unique Heidi Weber Private Museum. This was the last building built by Le Corbusier and is the only modern example of 'total concept art', where architecture, sculpture, and painting live in supposedly perfect harmony. It is open only from June to October. The Buhrle Collection (Stiftung Sammlung EG Buhrle), built on the fortune of the great Zurich-based weapon makers, Oerlikon Buhrle, is small, but contains some of the finest European paintings from several periods. The impressionist and post-impressionist works are particularly dazzling. Here one sees Manet's Swallows, Renoir's Little Irene and Cezanne's Boy in the Red Waistcoat, among other masterpieces. The collection is open only on Tuesday and Friday afternoons from 2pm to 5pm but alone is worth a trip to Zurich. If North American Indians are of special interest, the Indianermuseum in Feldstrasse 89, with some 1,400 items in part of an old schoolhouse, is worth a visit. On the same theme, try to find the Museum Leuengasse in Leuengasse 10. This unusual exhibition space - it is an old nuclear bomb shelter - is devoted exclusively to North and South American Indian and Eskimo art and culture. It houses not only ancient works but also the occasional contemporary artists on two levels proceeding ever deeper into the earth. In addition to these formal collections, the city's main churches are repositories of wonderful works of art. The 12th-century Fraumunster in Munsterhof is best known for the narrow stained glass windows created by Marc Chagall in the chancel and south transept and by Augusto Giacometti in the north transept. If you have time, you can see the remains of the Romanesque cloisters on the south side of the church, decorated with frescoes by Paul Bodmer representing the legend of the foundation of the abbey as well as that of Grossmunster and the Wasserkirch. Across the Munsterbridge the Grossmunster cathedral, with the south tower crowned by a colossal statue of Charlemagne, can be clearly seen. The Grossmunster also dates from the Carolingian period, and it was here that Huldrych Zwingli set off the Reformation in 1519. The bronze doors of the north and south portals are by Edvard Munch and inside are stained glass windows by Augusto Giacometti. The crypt under the choir is the best example of early Romanesque architecture in Switzerland, and it contains the original statue of Charlemagne. The one on the south tower is a copy.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAPING UP IN ADVANCE FOR SKIING;  </P> <P> EXERCISE: SKIERS CAN CONDITION THEMSELVES FOR THEIR SPORT THROUGH A PROGRAM  THAT COMBINES AEROBICS, ANAEROBIC WORKOUTS AND CALISTHENICS.  </P> <P> Being in good physical condition helps reduce the chance of injury or accident  and makes it easier to improve your skiing skills.  </P> <P> Whatever exercise program you follow, begin with plenty of easy stretching. And  if you're over 35, consult a doctor before beginning any exercise program.  </P> <P> Skiers who want to be in optimum condition should follow a program that  combines aerobic and anaerobic workouts with calisthenics. Aerobic exercise  builds up the cardiovascular system for better endurance; anaerobic exercise  helps oxygen-starved muscles perform well.  </P> <P> For the best results, build your exercise program on a firm aerobic foundation.  Swimming, bicycling, hiking or running are all good routes to an improved  cardiovascular system.  </P> <P> Runners can help develop ski-specific skills by making frequent turns, by  crossing over an imaginary line between their legs with every stride, or by  running sideways or backward.  </P> <P> Cycling and swimming are especially worthwhile; both build strength and aerobic  conditioning without putting undue stress on joints and ligaments. Mountain  biking in particular is a good workout for skiers; it helps build strong leg  muscles. To increase your aerobic capacity, aim for workouts of long duration  but of only moderate intensity. For noticeable results, plan at least three  20-minute exercise sessions each week.  </P> <P> Anaerobic conditioning is important for skiers, too, otherwise you won't be  able to carve those turns when a long run takes your wind away. Stick to the  same exercises recommended for aerobic training, but increase intensity and  decrease duration.  </P> <P> Once you're through with these basics, more esoteric exercises can give leg  muscles the same kind of torture a ski slope would.  </P></p>

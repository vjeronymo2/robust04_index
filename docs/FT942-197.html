			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Channel 4 cash move backed Channel 4 yesterday received cross-party support for its campaign to end the payments it makes to ITV under the 'safety-net' scheme established by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. Labour tabled an amendment to the Deregulation and Contracting Out bill to end the payments to ITV, which could reach Pounds 50m this year, and Mr Roger Gale, Conservative chairman of the backbench Media Committee, said the money should go to British film-making.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Poll lifeline for German FDP The Free Democratic party (FDP), the junior liberal partner in Germany's coalition government, may not be wiped out in next month's parliamentary election as a series of opinion polls have forecast. The Allensbach Institute forecasts that the FDP will not manage to cross the 5 per cent threshold of first preferences but will enter the parliament by scoring between 7 and 9 per cent of the second votes which voters give to the candidates of their personal, rather than party, preference. The same poll suggests that ratings for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) may have peaked at 41.4 per cent, having picked up steadily from 33 per cent earlier this year. Last week the party was on 42.3 per cent. If, for the first time since it was founded in 1948, the FDP fails to get into the Bundestag, the CDU seems most likely to enter a grand coalition with the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), which is now on 34.3 per cent, up from 33 per cent a week ago. The poll suggests that the CDU-FDP coalition will together pick up 49.9 per cent of the vote while the SPD-Green opposition is forecast to score 43.8 per cent.</p>

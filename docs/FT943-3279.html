			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Energy crisis deepens for ex-Soviet states An energy crisis more severe than any since the collapse of the Soviet Union now threatens Russia and its neighbouring states - as oil output and inter-enterprise debts in Russia continue to worsen and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States sink deeper into debt to Russia for energy supplies. Mr Yuri Shafrannik, the oil minister, said that the payments crisis in the industry meant that preparations for the autumn and winter surge in energy use were 'strained'. At the same times, increasing debts to Russia in Ukraine and Belarus now threaten the provision of oil and gas to these hard-hit states. Mr Shafrannik told a meeting of a government committee on the day-to-day running of the economy that oil output in the first seven months of the year was down by an average of 62,000 tonnes a day on the same period last year, and 4.72m down on the planned level for that period. The minister expects the outturn of the year to be 291.9m tonnes of oil and gas condensate - 6.8m tonnes less than the forecast level and just over 60m tonnes down on last year's estimated production level of 353m tonnes. In the refineries, worst hit by the debt crisis, only 104.9m tonnes were refined with a planned level of 128.9m tonnes. Mr Shafrannik said that 26.4 per cent of the oil wells in Russia were standing idle. With Russia's oil and gas supplies increasingly directed towards western hard currency markets, the drop in output seems certain to mean a further cut in the already relatively meagre energy exports to the CIS countries - reduced last year to 57.5m tonnes from a 1991 level of 136m tonnes. Gasprom, the state gas monoply, warned yesterday wed that it would further cut gas supplies to regions of Ukraine because of non-payment of back debts. Gasprom last week cut supplies to Mariupol in the Donetsk region by more than half to 100,000 cubic metres of gas a day, and yesterday warned it would immediately cut supplies to the Kharkov region by 40m cubic metres a day. According to the Interfax news agency, Ukraine agreed to pay Dollars 340m in August and September for gas supplies, but paid only 30 per cent of the amount. In Belarus, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the central bank, told the Tass news agency that the state owed Russia Rbs1,000bn (Pounds 309.6m) for energy supplies and that the debt was rising. He said that Russia had proposed the debt be paid by goods and industrial production, and by shares in Belarussian enterprises - but said that a schedule of payments by this kind of barter had not been agreed. The position in the other republics is generally worse - with the two Caucasian republics of Georgia and Armenia unable to pay for the supplies they presently receive and which are constantly under threat.</p>

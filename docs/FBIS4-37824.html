			<p>BFN     [Text] Officials in Aden called on the United Nations to  impose sanctions on the government of Sanaa to lift the siege it  was imposing on Aden.    Anis Yahiya, head of the south Yemeni delegation touring  Western Europe and the United States, said in a news conference  he held in London that the threat of imposing sanctions was the  only means to stop the northern bombardment of Aden.    He added that the sanctions would force Yemeni President  'Ali  'Abdullah Salih to comply with UN Security Council Resolution  No. 924, which called for a cease-fire in Yemen.    That came at a time when the intensity of the continued  northern shelling of Aden and its suburbs had increased.    A southern communique affirmed that the northern shelling  had  caused the death and wounding of 800 people since 17 June  instant. [passage omitted]    An official in Aden said that the main plant for generating  electricity was subjected to an aerial and artillery bombardment  by the northern forces, a matter which led to a power supply cut  in Aden and caused heavy losses to the plant.</p>

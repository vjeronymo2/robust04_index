			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Cheap, fresh  - and quick - Cookery THE IDEA of being able to stop off on the way home from work to buy a ready-prepared meal is appealing. Pop it into the oven, take a shower, put your feet up with a drink and, presto, dinner is served. That is the theory. But what separates this dream from reality is quality. Every supermarket and high street chain now has menus that are supposed to satisfy career-minded business people who are too tired to cook. The trouble with mass-produced food, however, is that it is mass-produced. Monosodium glutamate, onion powder, colourants, stabilisers and other undesirable additives are much less rampant than they used to be, thank goodness. Even so, chill-fresh dishes conceived in central kitchens for network distribution tend to fall flat. Prepared on too large a scale to bear the imprint of any one cook, and more concerned with shelf life and uniformity than good textures and tastes, they lack any real character. Blessed are those who live in neighbourhoods with a friendly deli-cum-traiteur selling good hot food. Charcuterie, cheese and salads are all very well in summer, but body and soul need something more warming in unpredictable March. Such shops, usually owned privately, tend to cater the way we do at home. Fresh foods are cooked today for eating this evening. Recipes are personal and flexible. Pots are stirred and tasted, with ingredients added and seasonings adjusted along the way. For those without a shop like this, self-catering seems the only solution. The quicker the recipe, the better when the cook has already put in a hard day's work at the office. And many people will agree that spending a little more than usual on ingredients is well warranted when you want a good meal - fast. To major on such ingredients as scallops, steak, duck breast or calves' liver could strike you as extravagant - but is it? In practice, home-cooked dishes using these are likely to cost no more than mediocre meals from high-street multiples. If, on the other hand, you cook a quick recipe based on such ingredients as chicken livers, herring roes, mackerel or pasta, you can enjoy a high-speed meal at bargain basement prices - just right when Budget day looms. SALMON UNDER A CRUST (serves 2) A green vegetable such as broccoli, lightly-steamed spinach or French beans, goes well with salmon cooked this way. Ingredients: 1 tail fillet of salmon weighing 8-9 oz; 1 1/2 oz fresh bread crumbs; 1 small shallot; the finely-grated zest of half a lemon; 1 tablespoon each chopped chives and parsley; 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped tarragon; extra virgin olive oil; freshly-squeezed lemon juice. Method: Chop the shallot finely and soften it in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Away from the heat, add 2 teaspoons lemon juice, then stir in the crumbs, lemon zest, herbs, some salt and pepper. Skin the salmon and brush it all over with a scant teaspoon each of olive oil and lemon juice mixed together. Lay the fish, skinned side up, on a grid laid across the gratin dish in which you will serve it, and grill for about 4 minutes under moderate heat. Turn the salmon, then sprinkle and press the savoury breadcrumbs lightly over it. Never mind if some of the crumbs fall off the fish into the dish; they won't be wasted. Slip the dish back under the grill and cook for 3-4 minutes more until the salmon is just cooked through, but still moist and tender, under a crust. MUSTARD MACKEREL (serves 2) This is an even more effortless recipe. It comes from Nigel Slater's Real Fast Food, about which I enthused in my Christmas round-up of cookbooks and which has been shortlisted for the Andre Simon award. Ingredients: 4 mackerel fillets (2 mackerel); 2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard; 1 tablespoon olive oil; the juice of half a lemon. Method: Oil a shallow ovenproof pan lightly. Mix the mustard with the lemon juice and olive oil and spread it over the mackerel fillets. Lay the fillets, skin side down, in the pan and cook them in an oven heated to 425'F/220'C (gas mark 7) until tender enough to cut with a fork: say, 8-10 minutes. Lift the sizzling fish out of the pan and serve with a watercress and blood orange salad and good wholemeal bread.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mecca, May 24, IRNA -- Although eye-witnesses and  hospital officials say a large number of pilgrims were trampled  to death in a ceremony known as "stoning the devil" in Mina, 10  kms east of Mecca Monday, Saudi Arabia has so far refused to  disclose the number of casualties.    In a bid to acquit Saudi Arabia of any charges of negligence  towards providing security for pilgrims, a government official  at the Health Ministry announced Monday that 829 pilgrims had  died in accidents or from old age and heat since May 12.  Eye-witnesses blame yesterday's tragic event on the  inefficiency of Saudi officials and their permission to [allow]  small and large motor cars to move in the region.    There are contradictory reports of casualties released by  representative offices of various countries in Mecca but none of  them can be confirmed because of the lack of official statistics  and Riyadh's silence on the issue.</p>

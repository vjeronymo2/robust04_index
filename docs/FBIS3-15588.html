			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Unity of President and Premier </F> Promises Russia a Temporary Period of Internal Political  Stability"]    [Text] It was only to be expected that the prime  minister's speech at the enlarged session of the Russian  Government would not satisfy everyone. Indeed, it showed that  the government does not have an integrated economic policy. And  it cannot have. It is impossible to find anything like the  present situation either around the world or in Russian history.  The reserves have been exhausted, and the only way out is to  maneuver between inflation economic collapse. No  miracle-working prescriptions for salvation exist. This, in  fact, can be considered the chief topic of V. Chernomyrdin's  speech. So it only remains to surmise how skillfully the  government will succeed in executing this maneuver.    Meanwhile it seems that the political consequences of what  happened in the Kremlin 4 March lend themselves to a more exact  prognosis. Given the president's overall strategic supremacy,  the monolithic union which the president and the premier  displayed at the session and the clear demarcation of  responsibilities between them -- B. Yeltsin assumes full control  of the military-political bloc, leaving economic problems to  Chernomyrdin -- give grounds for concluding that the executive  in Russia is probably as strong and united as it has ever been  since the end of 1991. This circumstance gives Russia the  opportunity to enter a period of internal political stability,  albeit a temporary one.    It seems obvious that, despite its many shortcomings, the  new  Russian Constitution today plays a positive role as the main  stabilizing factor. The predominance of the president's  constitutional rights enables him, having a loyal government, to  neutralize the danger stemming from the opposition concentrated  in the lower chamber of parliament. This is also convincingly  proved by the story of the development of the mini-crisis  connected with the Duma's political amnesty decision.    By letting the Lefortovo prisoners go free, the Duma has  essentially let off the opposition's steam. No more effective  results have been achieved. In the situation which has taken  shape since then none of the Duma factions is interested in  finding itself in the role of being a source of destabilization.  None of the parties which have entered the Duma and thereby  gotten an image of respectability will wish to part with it,  since the interests of each of them are linked with the future  presidential election. This is why, among themselves, the Duma  communists are stigmatizing V. Anpilov for his statements about  returning soon to vigorous political activity. This is why A.  Rutskoy and R. Khasbulatov have been forced to publish  statements of political passivity. In turn it has to be  considered no coincidence that the president's team on 4 March  took a demonstrative step away from the democrats toward the  "legal Marxists."    Following the amnesty decision a period of struggle against  the president ended for the Duma and a stage of heavy lawmaking  work began. Because the improvement of the state structure must  not be tackled without parliament, and for the president this is  one of the most important tasks today. At the same time the new  Constitution, having strengthened the president's power and  promoted stabilization, has also fully laid bare the importance  under present conditions of the problem of the head of state's  health. It is not difficult to trace in the examples of last  July's internal political mini-crisis and the recent February  one the fact that the president has only to fall ill for the  situation in the country instantly to exacerbate. On the other  hand, as soon as the president returns to active work, it at  once calms down.    The political results of the government's enlarged session  enable us to assume that Russia can reckon on a quiet life, at  least for the next few months. It is even possible that the  traditional spring offensive by the opposition's extremist wing  will not affect this process. But a subsequent exacerbation of  the situation seems highly likely. The problem of growing  unemployment has all the potential to become the chief  destabilizing factor. It will primarily depend on the prime  minister how successful he is in neutralizing this danger by  implementing those ideas in his speech which deal with the  organization of public works and with other measures that can  curb the social explosion. But subsequently, as the  presidential election approaches, the spiral of political  confrontation will inevitably grow, and it is perfectly possible  that approximately six months before the voting the Duma will  pass a vote of no confidence in the government in order to  neutralize the prime minister politically.</p>

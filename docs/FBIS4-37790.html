			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Difficult Road to Restore Rights"] </F>   [Text] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United  States, during which he held a summit meeting with the U.S.  President, aimed at explaining the Jordanian stand to Arab and  world public opinion regarding the progress achieved on the  Jordanian-Israeli negotiating track.    His majesty the king's statements and clarifications were  heard with great interest by various media and political  quarters, because these statements and stands showed a clear  vision, an accurate depiction of the existing situation, and  adherence to the stands and policies that have always been  followed by Jordan.    At the top of the stands emphasized by His Majesty King  Husayn is Jordan's sacred right to restore its rights and  complete sovereignty -- the objective for which Jordan has been  waging the battle of negotiations. Meanwhile, the king was  eager to clearly note that Jordan still has to wage a long and  difficult battle to seize its rights and that the success in  this battle depends both on continuous Jordanian steadfastness  and on an Israeli readiness to give up occupied Jordanian  territory.    The direct and deep meaning of this is that Jordan has never  departed from the battle of extracting its rights and that there  is still an important, and perhaps long, phase before achieving  the legitimate national objectives.    If we add to this Jordan's commitment to work for a  comprehensive peace, in accordance with which all Arab rights  will be restored -- as the peace agreement will crown the  achievement of a solution to all problems in the region, as his  majesty put it -- we will find that the road is still long and  difficult. And this in itself requires moral and political  support from the Arab brothers and the continuation of a fair  and earnest U.S. policy to make the achieved progress reach its  expected and logical end of Israeli withdrawal and the  restoration of Jordan's international borders as demarcated  between Palestine and Transjordan during the British mandate.    Therefore, the next weeks and months are expected to witness  a serious, active, and intensive political move on this level  under the agreed international sponsorship of the U.S., as  happened and is happening on the other tracks. In light of  this, it is too early to predict swift and categorical results,  although it is certain that Jordan will continue its firm  adherence to its rights and sovereignty to achieve Israeli  retreat. This is considered a national right and an important  and major step on the path toward restoring all Arab rights and  territories.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / TUC-Labour linkage forecast to survive NO MEMBER of the body set up to review the links between the Labour party and the trade unions wants to break those links, according to Ms Diana Jeuda, an official with the shopworkers union Usdaw and a leading member of the body. The review body. which met yesterday, is not due to produce a report until the middle of next year, for full debate at next year's Labour Party conference, but already the private debate is in full swing. Last week's TUC Congress in Blackpool did not formally debate the link, but it was the subject of one of the best attended fringe meetings. Ms Jeuda's view that 'nobody on the body supports divorce' would certainly be welcomed by most of the leaders of affiliated unions assembled in Blackpool. But several are keen on a radical loosening of the link and realise that to have any effective national voice they require a broader political strategy. The congress was remarkably free of mournful references to Labour's fourth consecutive election defeat. The high point was an address from Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, and after the congress there was talk of inviting a cabinet minister to next year's TUC. The TUC provided an example of why some people believe the link is bad for both sides. Mr John Edmonds set off a stampede of calls for the devaluation of sterling. He was, arguably, just saying what union leaders should have been saying for months, but they have not done so because they feared undermining the Labour party and its anti-inflationary credibility. Now that they have cast that constraint aside, they will either succeed in changing Labour's policy, thus undermining the party's claim to speak for the country as a whole, or at least create a row between the two 'wings' of the labour movement. Most union leaders recognise the limits of being tied to a declining political force, which a large proportion of their members vote against. But few of those leaders can contemplate an end to all direct influence in the party. The argument as to how far to go is wide open. The idea of converting the 5m political levy payers in the unions, most of whom are unaware that they pay the levy, into 'associate members' of the party is widely regarded as too complex and a recipe for bankrupting the party. The best guess is that the union block vote at the Labour conference, the key element of the link, will continue to decline to below 50 per cent and will not be cast as a block.</p>

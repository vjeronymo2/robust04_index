			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Training standards body launched A business-led body called Investors in People UK was launched yesterday to boost national promotion of the IIP standard, which seeks to link training to the business needs of companies. The organisation is financially supported by the government and is chaired by Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley, which owns the north London stadium. Board members include Mr John Adstead, personnel director of J. Sainsbury, Mr Terry Morgan, managing director of Land Rover, and Mr Leif Mills, general secretary of Bifu, the banking union. The standard, which has been developed by the government, is promoted by training and enterprise councils and their Scottish equivalents, local enterprise companies, which also validate whether a company has reached the appropriate levels of training and staff development to attain IIP. The new body will seek to ensure that uniform stand ards of assessment are set. To be recognised, an employer must make a public commitment to employee development so that staff can achieve the business objectives of the organisation, regularly review the training and development needs of all of its employees, and then evaluate the effectiveness of training.

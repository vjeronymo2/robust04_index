			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle's state </F> of the nation message to Congress in Montevideo on 15 March]    [Text] Mr. President of the national Congress, Gonzalo  Aguirre Ramirez:    In compliance with Article 168, Clause 5, of the  Constitution, the executive branch appears today before Congress  to report on government actions since 15 March 1993. Details of  executive branch activities, ministry by ministry, were  delivered to the legislators today; that document forms part of  this message.    It is with great satisfaction that I once again confirm the  full enforcement of the Constitution and the state of law, as  well as the full enjoyment and exercise of the people's rights.    This is the fourth and last time during this administration  that the executive branch appears before legislators, who are  the direct representatives of the people's sovereignty. This  message has a special significance because, although this  administration has almost one more year in power, our  institutional rules do not establish a further appearance before  the legislative branch, apart from that in March of each year.  We reaffirm here what has been said many times: The government  administration is a five-year term and although national  elections are held during the fifth year, we hope it will also  be a year of important achievements to show, among other things,  that the health and strength of the democratic system not only  relies on electoral events, but in the effective exercise of the  constitutional rights of government in the search for solutions  to national problems.    Honorable legislators: We believe it is necessary to deliver  on this occasion -- the last established by the Constitution --  a balance of the government administration to date so that the  people will understand what has been done over the year and  learn about the real operation of the political system which  they authorized through their votes.    Before getting down to details, it is necessary to recall  the  conditions under which government actions have been developed  during this period. Prior to the elections, we who were elected  to hold government functions through the votes of our fellow  countrymen prepared a clearly defined line of action, both the  objectives and the means to implement them.    We believe it is very important to recall this point because  we believe the people need a clear understanding of why  government action is required to strengthen the democratic  system.    Honorable legislators, we were clear in our government  proposal and we have tried to be consistent in fulfilling our  promises.    The relationship among the forces that emerged from the  elections should also be recalled. The results approved by the  Electoral Court determined that within Congress no single party  had the majority. This was known beforehand, it came as no  surprise due to the relatively equal strength of the political  forces. Being aware of this situation, we emphasized before and  after the elections the need to reach political agreement to  allow operational congressional majorities in order to have an  effective government administration.    It is known that our country chose the law as the main  government instrument. Our registries have about 17,000 laws.  The most important issues, as well as those of lesser  importance, have been resolved through the approval of legal  rules, therefore their reform require decisions of equal  juridical level. This is why the congressional majority is  extremely important for us because while the executive branch is  exclusively responsible for promulgating decrees, this is not as  significant as in other countries.    This situation justifies the attempt to organize a  political coalition, except in the case of a party that wants to  obtain an absolute majority in both houses. Large sectors of  society seek to amend the Constitution in an attempt to  facilitate or even force political parties to achieve solutions  by consensus and thus make political action more fluent and  efficient.    The current Constitution does not forbid this, given that an  agreement among parties or party sectors is enough to approve  far-reaching laws. This is what we sought at the beginning of  this administration, but we did not obtain the results we  expected. Perhaps future governments should ask why -- and the  answer probably is not in the Constitution -- we need to adopt  congressional coalitions as a political practice. This is  envisaged in our Constitution and leads to the formation of  congressional blocs which in turn create relative participation  in the cabinet.    We thought such coalitions would be even more feasible in  light of the coincidences over the diagnosis and government  solutions which the large political parties announced.  Unfortunately this was not the case. This is the reason behind  the delay in approving some laws designed to bring about changes  and the rejection of others.    Relations between the executive and legislative branches  developed within the framework of institutional normalcy and  mutual respect which, notwithstanding the harshness we use when  exerting our freedom of opinion, constitute a national  characteristic.    During this congressional term the executive branch has sent  414 draft bills to Congress. As stated before, not all bills  were equally important. Their quantity does not thus allow us  to measure the degree of efficiency of our relations. During  this speech I will mention the ones I consider most important.    Congress has exerted its constitutional wisdom as  comptroller  -- as established in Articles 118 and 119 of the Constitution.  Congress requested many reports and summoned ministers on 17  occasions. The number of times executive branch officials were  called to participate in congressional committee sessions  increased considerably, almost to weekly summons, which prompted  an intense relationship between the two branches and allowed  congressmen to become fully acquainted with the opinion of the  executive branch in many fields.    The executive branch exerted its right to veto 11 times,  thus  using the last resort of its institutional relationship with  Congress. Of the 11 vetoes, six were withdrawn to solve  differences of criteria on the matters involved.    We must point out the occasions on which the executive and  legislative branches agreed on a subject allowed the approval of  important and probably beneficial and necessary laws to attain  national objectives. Among these we can mention the approval of  the Treaty of Asuncion [creating the Common Market of the South,  Mercosur]; the reform of the port system; the much needed fiscal  adjustment; the public employees law; the creation of investment  banks; the relative deregulation of the insurance market; the  public enterprises law, which was later partially annulled  through a plebiscite; the new financial intermediation law; and  the creation of the Ministry of Housing, Territorial Order, and  Environment, among others.    Since the beginning, the executive branch has established  economic and social objectives whose partial or total  accomplishment must be explained during this speech.    I will now expand on our goals and achievements in the  economic field.    The executive branch set for itself the goal of creating --  as much as a government can -- a framework of conditions  permitting and favoring stability and sustained growth within  the economy.    For this it was necessary to face great difficulties, some  of  them long entrenched.    We had to face economic stagnation, low investment levels,  and a protracted high inflation rate that threatened to run out  of control. Our economy was still very closed and bore the  burden of a large foreign debt and a costly and inefficient  state apparatus, the financing of which had generated a strong  fiscal deficit and negatively affected the public financial  system.    It was necessary to attack many problems simultaneously and  in some cases urgently.    This administration decided to face our fiscal deficit  problem with determination. We are convinced that balanced  public accounts are indispensable for economic stability and  essential for achieving sustained growth.    When we assumed power on 1 March 1990, our public accounts  showed a deficit of 8.7 percent of the GDP. This represented a  6.7 percent deficit existing in December 1989 plus an additional  2 percent that resulted from the constitutional reform on  pensions adjustment.    With the help of the fiscal adjustment law, mentioned above,  the government reduced that deficit to 1 percent of the GDP.  Here we must note the rigidity of some budget items. The  contribution of the General Revenue to the social security  system clearly stands out. This assistance totalled $19.4  million in 1990, $96.8 million in 1991, $171.2 million in 1992,  and $282 million in 1993.    Just to mention these figures shows the unpostponable need  to  radically modify the national social security system, not only  to strengthen it, but also to see that the burden is not so  heavy on workers, the national productive apparatus, and the  Treasury. If this were the case we could liberate resources to  invest in other programs which would undoubtedly benefit the  entire community.    The balance of public accounts, as well as the  implementation  of reliable and appropriate monetary and foreign exchange  policies have contributed to a gradual drop in inflation, which  is a scourge that affects our entire society but which hurts  particularly those without fixed incomes.    At the start of this administration inflation was moving  upward, with a hyperinflation trend. Following the  implementation of some difficult measures inflation began to  slow down and then to drop. Today, and without feeling  self-satisfied, we can point out that inflation has dropped  below an annual rate of 50 percent. In 1990 it was 129 percent.    Our economic stabilization was accompanied by a deepening of  the economic opening that had been implemented during previous  years, seeking a more efficient allocation of resources. This  consisted of simultaneously implementing a double opening  process: regional integration within the Mercosur process and  unilateral global opening through a gradual reduction of tariffs  and custom barriers. It is important to note that these measures  were announced ahead of time so as to create confidence among  economic agents at the time of making decisions.    This economic opening, together with the stabilization  process, has favored investments and growth, a process of  productive reconversion, and a general modernization of the  country. One indication of these factors is that productivity  has increased.    The importation of capital goods, which was encouraged by  the  government through tariff and tax reductions, doubled between  1989 and 1993 -- rising from $156 million in 1989 to nearly $350  million in 1993. Our entire transport system has been  renovated, including buses, trucks, and automobiles. The  importation of machinery and equipment rose from $138 million in  1989 to nearly $300 million in 1993.    This modernization process also affected other areas. The  use of computers and telecommunications equipment increased.  Even in our homes there was a process of renewal and equipping  with durable goods that is unprecedented in our recent history.  The importation of durable consumer goods went from $78 million  in 1989 to over $250 million in 1993.    The balance of trade, which was negative due to this import  boom, and the negative effects of the low prices of some of our  national primary export did not hide a continuous increase in  nontraditional exports, which together grew by 20.5 [not further  specified] between 1989 and 1993, despite a modest increase in  1993.    The balance of payment is favorable and our external front,  which is in line with the other macroeconomic variables,  registers very positive indexes. We are talking about a  positive balance in our balance of payments as a result of the  entry of capital and tourism, which -- duly stimulated --  continues to grow.    We must also refer to what our country owes and what it  used to owe. Our net public debt during this past term dropped  considerably. It must be recalled that in 1989 it represented  28.2 percent of the GDP. By the end of 1993 it had dropped to  13.9 percent as result of refinancing, the increase in our  international reserves, and the drop in demand for funds by  public organs thanks to their streamlining. Net international  banking system reserves -- including the Central Bank, the Bank  of the Republic, and private banks -- amount to $2.962 billion.  This is well up on the $1.768 billion registered at the end of  1989. The net foreign reserves at the Central Bank are now  balanced, compared with a $915 million deficit found in February  1990.    Financial streamlining, stabilization, economic opening,  investment promotion, and all the objectives to encourage  economic growth -- which are indispensable for our society and  transformation -- require the transformation of the state.    Under the heading of state reform, this administration  promised to substantially modify that ancient institution. This  field can be subdivided: it can either be changed either through  a law or through an executive branch decree. The choice  determines a different degree of importance within national life.    In the field of state participation, since the beginning of  the century state industrial and commercial activities have been  organized under their own clear, unique, profile, because that  is how those who governed the country understood things. It is  wrong to now criticize solutions which past governors applied as  necessary and beneficial for the common good. It must  nonetheless be said that despite the solutions implemented in  the past, most political forces recognize this situation is a  problem that must be solved.    Soon after the beginning of my mandate, this administration  sent a draft bill to Congress attempting to coordinate  practically all public activities by proposing a deep  transformation. It was fully analyzed by Congress, which even  sought outside opinions and counseling on different aspects.  The first result of the work of Congress was the separation of  one of the aspects the law wanted to reform: port activities.  Congress turned it into a completely different entity.    The central theme was approved by Congress and became part  of  the Public Enterprises Law. The draft bill established in one  of its chapters gives general norms for all public enterprises,  introducing the gradual changes in them. Another chapter refers  to other specific subjects like the public telecommunications  company, the airline, and the fishing enterprise. The public  debate before and after the approval of the law resulted in a  plebiscite as a definite solution to the problem. This  initiative, by will of the people was centered on partial  aspects of the law which were abrogated by the end of 1992 by  decision of the people. Where validity was maintained, given  that the subjects were not included in the plebiscite, the  executive branch proceeded to liquidate the ILPE [State Seal and  Fishing Industry] and to implement a mechanism to draw private  capital into PLUNA [Uruguayan National Airlines].    The executive branch suggested that the funds raised from  the  implementation of the mentioned law should be invested in  health, education, housing, or the capitalization of the Social  Security Bank. This was done and the funds raised from the  liquidation of ILPE -- which were small in face of the needs of  the country -- were invested in education, implementing a real  transformation in state patrimony. National assets were  reassigned to more productive social objectives.    The Port System Reform Law passed by Congress and which was  not subjected to the plebiscite, is currently fully enforced and  the results of its application are evidently satisfactory. It  must be pointed out that an important activity like the  exploitation of our ports, has rendered the following results:    -- Productivity in cargo handling increased according --  based on the time the cargo spends on the dock -- by 300 percent  for cargo, 200 percent for bulk cargo, and 88 percent for  containers;    -- The average time a ship remains in the port of Montevideo  has dropped from 12 hours in the roadstead to 0 hours [as  published], and the time they remain in port has dropped from 78  hours to 34 hours;    -- The volume of cargo moved in the Port of Montevideo in  relation to the number of ANP [National Ports Administration]  workers rose from 360 metric tons "per head" in 1990 to 1,100  metric tons in 1993;    -- Port tariffs dropped 26 percent on imports, 33 percent on  transshipment and traffic, and 10 percent on exports;    -- The number of ANP employees dropped from 4,400 to 2,400;    -- The total cost of stopping in Montevideo is 50 percent  less for shipowners than any other nearby port;    -- The time ships remained docked has dropped by 40 percent;    -- The traffic of ships continues to increase by 2.5 percent  per year: the number of containers has increased by 12 percent.    These details reveal the benefits of a reform like this for  the entire community. Its prospects are even more promising if  one considers there are more than 40 authorized trading  enterprises [empresas de prestacion de servicios de mercaderia]  in Montevideo and ports in the interior, most of which entail  national capital. We have thus achieved the diversification of  the market and encouraged national enterprises to participate.    The reduction of port employees through incentives and the  natural reduction process was carried out without hardship to  the workers involved.    Another significant chapter in this state reform was the  approval of the law that eliminated insurance company  monopolies. This law broadens the consumers' alternatives for a  service as important as insurance. It will be fully in force by  next May, according to Decree No. 530/93    The post of insurance superintendent will be created soon.  It will handle this important activity of modern times.    But the impact of state activities on daily developments  does  not end with the great productive fields. Many times this  impact is also felt in regulations and bureaucratic procedures  that hinder and obstruct the activities of private individuals  or enterprises. To free citizens of useless regulations and  rules, the executive branch is creating the Plan to Deregulate  Foreign Trade and Investments [Plan de Desregulacion del  Comercio Exterior y las Inversiones] (Plades) and the Pronade  [National Debureaucratization Program].    Without going into details, it should be pointed out that by  eliminating superfluous red tape, useless forms, unnecessary  signatures, and purposeless sworn statements, Plades and Pronade  -- whose implementation has demanded a minimum investment --  will save thousands of dollars, without mentioning the saving in  time and energy. We also mention the great changes in the state  purchasing system as well as the changes in administrative  procedures through Decree No. 500, which was approved in  December 1991.    There is still a lot to be done but there are many  successful  examples. A more efficient and cheaper port is a good example.  An efficient ground service at Carrasco airport is another good  example. We can also mention the importance of the elimination  of inefficient activities such El Espinillar, ILPE, the National  Printing Shop, and the personnel cuts in all public enterprises.    The results can be calculated in many ways. Everyone is  aware of the impact of tariffs on our economy. It should be  pointed out that between 1989 and 1993 the price of diesel fuel  has dropped in real terms by 44.3 percent, fuel oil by 36  percent, and electricity by 17.2 percent. In the case of phone  tariffs, the real reduction averages 40 percent.    There is still a lot to be done in the state reform field  and  all political parties are aware of this.    Messrs. legislators: The results of the measures taken in  the  economic field are numerous, yet they represent a single result.  In last year's message I pointed out that the government did  not have enough power to drive society towards certain purposes;  but it did and does have the power to create the necessary  conditions for economic agents to grow.    We should all feel proud, without running the risk of being  complacent, that the country has confronted the great  difficulties and the deep-rooted changes a greater commercial  opening demands, not only dodging the threat of economic  recession like that currently affecting many countries, but  resuming the path of growth.    Our output grew by almost 1 percent in 1990; by 2.9 percent  in 1991; and by 7.4 percent in 1992. We estimate the percentage  duly adjusted for last year amounts to 2.5 percent.    The same goes for investments: They grew by 22.3 percent in  1991; by 9.9 percent in 1992, and by about 20 percent in 1993.  This tendency, according to the behavior of some indicators,  continues.    Unemployment indicators also show a positive tendency with  historically low levels. Real salaries and family incomes have  also increased.    Salaries in the private sector grew, in real terms, by 3.3  percent last year, while public salaries grew almost by 8  percent. The real family income grew in Montevideo: If it stood  at 100 points in 1989 it reached 115.2 points in 1993.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / The heat is on for British Gas: New price controls will create a harsher business climate When householders get their first quarterly gas bills after April next year, they could see some reduction in their payments. This would be one result of the tough new price controls imposed on British Gas, which were announced in a formula yesterday. But if those same householders are among the 5m small investors who bought British Gas shares when the utility was privatised nearly five years ago, they could see the reduction in payments matched by a slowdown in the rate of growth of the company's dividends. British Gas stressed that the stringent new ceiling on the prices it can charge its 17m domestic gas users will not affect its policy of increasing dividends by more than the rate of inflation. But many City observers are sceptical, and believe the straitjacket into which British Gas has fitted itself by accepting proposals put by its regulator, the Office of Gas Supply (Ofgas), will prove tighter and tighter over the next five years. 'Ofgas will maybe help the government meet its inflation objectives with these price proposals,' said Mr Peter Nicol, a gas expert at Warburg Securities in London, 'but it will also help them along the way to 3m unemployed.' He said this was because British Gas's new price constraints would force it to make substantial job cuts. The new formula means that British Gas can increase its domestic prices by 5 percentage points less than the rate of inflation  - rather than the current 2 percentage points. Thus, if inflation falls below 5 per cent, gas prices will actually fall. Ofgas estimates that the new controls could leave gas prices 15 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been at the end of five years. Domestic users could benefit in another way. In a complex algebraic formula, the regulator will force British Gas to buy North Sea supplies at a lower price by capping any rise in costs that is passed on to consumers. In response to calls from consumers that cuts in British Gas's costs should not be reflected in a lower standard of service, Mr James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, has also set targets for standards of service to which the company must stick. This includes, for example, the time it takes to respond to gas leaks, and how soon new customers can be connected. If British Gas consistently fails to meet these service targets, Mr McKinnon will refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which can then impose a further price cut. British Gas was sanguine yesterday about its ability to work within the new price formula - the severity of which has shocked many observers. 'This is a very tough package,' said Mr Bob Evans, British Gas chairman, 'but nevertheless, we are confident we can continue to generate satisfactory rates of return and profitability'. The formula envisages a rate of return on capital employed for the domestic business of 5 to 7 per cent. Mr Evans said this was consistent with the company's performance since privatisation when the rate of return had been just over 6 per cent before adjustment for seasonal factors. He said the company had debated the proposals and had had three tense board meetings before deciding to accept the proposals, rather than submit the issue to a Monopolies investigation  - the only alternative. One overriding reason for accepting the formula had been the need to remove the uncertainty hanging over the company's domestic business since Ofgas began its review 11 months ago. This could have meant a cloud over the company for at least another six months. Mr Evans said British Gas had reduced its number of employees by 10,000 over the past four years while at the same time connecting an additional 1.2m customers and putting in 2m central heating units. He said the company expects continued growth in the number of new gas users which will help it to increase its efficiency. It also plans to make more use of information technology and to impose tighter scrutiny of managers in the company's 90 regions. At the moment the City remains unimpressed as to whether these assertions can be translated into the sort of cost-cutting needed for British Gas to stay within its new price limits. Mr Nicol estimates that even with some measures already in place, and 3 per cent growth in the company's business each year, it would not be able to meet the new formula's target. He believes that if British Gas continues its current trend, the formula will knock Pounds 90m off profits for five years from April 1992. That amount theoretically could be saved by a cut of 6,000 jobs or 7.5 per cent of its workforce each year the controls are in place. Ofgas's price control guidelines mar the outlook for British Gas. There could be some hard bargaining over details when the consultation period begins in a few weeks because Mr McKinnon interprets broadly his brief of achieving value for money for domestic customers. But he is also applying pressure to remind the company that it is not a monopoly supplier in another sector: the industrial market, where each consumer uses more than 25,000 therms of gas a year and where competition was meant to flourish after privatisation. So far, competitors have captured only 2.5 per cent of the total industrial market  - Ofgas wants British Gas to yield 30 per cent of the industrial sector to competitors by 1993. The Monopolies Commission is currently investigating the workings of a government recommendation that encourages British Gas to buy no more than 90 per cent of the gas coming on stream from new fields so that competitors have access to more supplies. But the commission is expected to look into the whole question of industrial gas competition and its report, due for release in about six weeks, could force British Gas to undergo an overhaul as thorough on its industrial side as the new tariff formula will impose on its domestic side. Competition in the industrial sector of the market has been made all the more pressing by the sharp increase in demand from power generators and by British Gas's fear that it would not have enough gas to fill that demand. One of the first fruits of electricity privatisation has been the electricity industry's abandoning of large coal-fired plant. Observers expect gas demand from generators to grow at a rate of about 2 per cent a year. British Gas attracted widespread criticism earlier this year when its supply and demand calculations failed to predict the surge in demand in power station gas. In the absence of gas to supply this demand, it moved to choke it off by imposing a 35 per cent price increase on new gas purchases in March. Many commentators blamed the management of British Gas for failing to foresee the problem. Ofgas has now forced the company to remain in negotiations with two power station projects - Thames Power and a Mobil and Eastern Electricity joint venture  - over supplying gas at the old price in a move that could end in a court battle. One development that seems almost certain to result from the perceived gap in supply and Ofgas's new price ceiling is that the UK government will have to overcome its resistance to gas imports from Norway. British Gas is itself negotiating with Norway's Statoil over gas imports in spite of having a government veto imposed on its attempt to buy gas from the huge Sleipner field in 1985. The government must almost certainly give the go-ahead later this decade for imports in view of the fact that Norwegian gas is likely to be cheaper than UK gas from the North Sea. These mounting pressures on British Gas mean that the company will have to introduce significant changes in the way it runs it business unless it wants to see its profits slip. Ofgas has called the existence of the company in its current form into question in the industrial market where it will have to start thinking like a competitor rather than a monopoly supplier. Mr Evans says a break-up of the company is not under consideration at present, but many observers believe that would be the only way to foster real competition in the industrial market and ensure fair prices for domestic users.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Switzerland It is normally time to get nervous after a stock market has risen by a third in nine months. The Swiss market, though, still looks in peak condition. Not only has the franc gained in attraction as investors have become disillusioned with the US recovery and worried about the German recession. For once, funds flowing out of Germany are going not to Luxembourg, but to Switzerland, which, thanks to its rejection of the European Economic Area in last December's referendum, is seen as outside the reach of European regulation. Though the domestic economy remains weak, the outlook for earnings is reasonably strong. The international character of Swiss business will help if the US recovery gathers strength again and the dollar strengthens; the relatively defensive characteristic of its stock market will compensate if it does not. Banks stand to gain from further reductions in interest rates over the course of the year. Arguably the food sector is vulnerable to disillusion with brands and pharmaceuticals to US health reform. But Nestle has proved resilient so far. Among pharmaceuticals Roche and Sandoz, in particular, have a strong product pipeline. Consensus forecasts for earnings growth of around 20 per cent this year and 17 per cent next imply a prospective multiple of around 13 this year and 11 for 1994. The market looks to have been undervalued before rather than overvalued now.</p>

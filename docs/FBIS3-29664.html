			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kim Cha-ung from the UN Headquarters] </F>   [Text] Ho Chong, deputy chief of the North Korean Mission  to the United Nations, who had served as the North Korean  representative to the U.S.-North Korea contact on the North  Korean nuclear issue, has been relieved of his post abruptly. A  noteworthy speculation circulating in the UN diplomatic circles  is that he has been relieved of his position after being  reprimanded for his mistaken report to Pyongyang on the results  of the New York working-level contact which took place toward  the end of 1993 and in which the United States and North Korea  agreed on nuclear inspections.    Deputy Chief of Mission Ho's departure from his post was  confirmed approximately a week ago when Western intelligence  agencies found out that he reserved a seat on a China Airlines  [as published] flight -- that leaves New York on 24 February --  to go to Pyongyang via Beijing. The North Korean mission  refused to confirm this report over the telephone, and finally,  on 19 February, a mission official concerned confirmed his  departure for Pyongyang. When asked why Ho Chong would depart  for Pyongyang, he said he "is not in a position to comment." It  has been learned Deputy Chief of Mission Ho is now preparing for  his return home after concluding his official duties. His last  official duty was reported to be his 15 February contact with  his U.S. counterpart to discuss measures to be taken to follow  up North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspections.    This year is his fifth year at the United Nations. He was  originally scheduled to leave for Pyongyang early last year when  his term expired.    Therefore, it is speculated his departure results from a  mere  change of hands. Still, the speculation that he is departing  after being reprimanded has become more convincing.    This speculation goes like this: He was reprimanded for his  distorted report to Pyongyang on the results of the New York  working-level contact. At that contact, the United States and  North Korea agreed to hold the third stage of U.S.-North Korea  high-level talks under the condition that North Korea allows the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect all  facilities to the extent that North Korea ensures that  continuity of nuclear safeguards and that North-South dialogue  for the exchange of special envoys resumes. However, when  notifying Pyongyang of the results of the negotiations, Deputy  Chief of Mission Ho reportedly stated that the agreement between  North Korea and the United States requires North Korea to  receive not full-scope inspections [chonmyon sachal] of the  seven reported nuclear facilities but restricted inspections  [chehanjok sachal] of facilities it wants to open to the extent  that North Korea ensures the continuity of nuclear safeguards.    Because of Ho Chong's notification, North Korea reportedly  underwent significant confusion and internal trouble before it  announced it would accept nuclear inspections. North Korea's  insistence on restricted inspections during its negotiations  with the IAEA is an example.    The analysis of the diplomatic circles in the United Nations  goes like this: In further contact with the United States,  North Korea realized that Ho Chong's report was wrong.  Therefore, North Korea, at a last phase, notified the IAEA that  it would accept full-scope inspections of the seven nuclear  facilities.    During a meeting with domestic reporters in New York on 16  February, ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: "One of the  reasons North Korea had been stubborn before it announced it  would accept nuclear inspections this time is the structural  problem in communications between Ho Chong, Kang Sok-chu, and  other working-level officials in charge of the nuclear issue and  Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il."    He also said: "Working-level officials in charge of  negotiations seem to worry that they may be reproached for not  making efforts to the end but making concessions to the United  States."    Those remarks by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu is more proof  of Deputy Chief of Mission Ho's mistaken report.</p>

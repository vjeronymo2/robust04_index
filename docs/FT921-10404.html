			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rates fall OVERNIGHT rates in the UK fell as low as 7 1/2 per cent yesterday, as the Bank of England removed any doubts over its attitude to liquidity through early and decisive action. 'Someone must have got wind that a lot more paper would be offered,' said one senior dealer describing the southward movement of overnight rates after the bank's first injection of Pounds 600m. There were 'several million' pounds worth of trades at the 7.5 per cent level, he added. Overnight rates bounced back to finish at 10 3/4 - 5/8. Initially, the Bank forecast a Pounds 1bn shortage, which was then revised to Pounds 1.1bn. The main reasons for the shortage were treasury bills and maturing assistance, which took Pounds 676m out of the market, bills for repurchase, accounting for Pounds 334m, and a rise in note circulation which drained Pounds 60m. Bankers' balances were Pounds 10m below target. Exchequer transactions injected Pounds 95m. In early operations, the Bank bought bills totalling Pounds 600m for resale on February 21 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. A subsequent purchase of band one bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent came to Pounds 392m. By the afternoon, full liquidity was returned to the market with a bill purchase totalling Pounds 110m at a rate of 10 3/8 per cent and late assistance of Pounds 20m. Traders did not expect the bank to be as generous tomorrow, however. The key three-month interbank rate, which is a good indicator for sentiment on UK interest rates, opened unchanged at 10- 9/16 per cent. During the day they rose to close at 10 19/32 Pounds  17/32 . March short sterling started the day one basis point up at 89.61, to finish at 89.66. In Germany, the Bundes-bank squeezed liquidity by withdrawing DM1.4bn in this week's round of securities repurchase agreements, although it did not force rates higher as many had feared. The repos were conducted at 9.4 per cent. The call money trading band widened slightly to 9.60/70 per cent, close to the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate. On Tuesday, rates had been predominantly quoted at 9.65/70 per cent. The Bundesbank is known to be unhappy with the 6.4 per cent wage rise agreed by steel workers earlier in the week. In the US, traders did not expect the Federal Reserve to operate in the market. However, federal funds softened to 3 7/8 per cent, below the presumed target of 4 per cent.</p>

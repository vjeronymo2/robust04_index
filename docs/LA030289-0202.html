			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DEDICATED EFFORT' ENDS WITH NAMING OF CYNDI GALLAGHER;  </P> <P> UCLA GOES AGAINST TIDE WITH NEW SWIMMING COACH  </P> <P> Dr. Judith Holland makes no qualms about it.  </P> <P> When the position as women's swimming coach at UCLA opened up this year,  Holland, the women's athletic director, decided that she was going to hire a  woman for the job.  </P> <P>  "I was completely dedicated to finding a woman for the job," Holland said. "I  think enough jobs go to men that there has to be a dedicated effort to seek out  and find women."  </P> <P> And with that attitude, and the hiring of Cyndi Gallagher as women's swimming  coach, Holland is intentionally going against the tide.  </P> <P> Just 25.3% of women's swimming coaches at four-year universities in 1988 were  women, down from 53.6% in 1972, according to an 11-year study of women's  athletics by Linda Carpenter and Vivian Acosta, professors of physical  education at Brooklyn College. Over that same period, there has been an overall  decrease in the percentage of women coaches. Just 48.3% of coaches of women's  teams in 1988 were females, compared to 58.2% in 1978 and 78.9% in 1972,  according to the same study. The percentage of women coaches at the Division I  level is approximately 5% lower, Carpenter said.  </P> <P> One of the biggest obstacles to overcome, Holland said, is the lack of a large  pool of women coaches to choose from. When Holland decided not to renew the  contract of Tom Jahn after last season, about 25 coaches applied for the  opening.  </P> <P> Holland interviewed only three candidates, however, because Gallagher was the  lone female applicant. Ironically, Jahn's wife Barbara is the head coach at UC  Davis and would have been one of the few other females qualified for the UCLA  job.  </P> <P> Carpenter disagrees with Holland about the small number of candidates.  </P> <P> "It's not a lack of qualified women. It's the result of years of having few  female role models and years of having to do with prejudice, although most of  it I don't feel has been intentional," Carpenter said.  </P> <P> Jill Sterkel, an assistant at Texas who applied for the USC position, which was  also open this year, was surprised that UCLA hired Gallagher because of her  lack of head coaching experience. Sterkel, however, does not think that it is  necessary to make an extra effort to hire women coaches.  </P> <P> "I feel I could go out and get a head coaching job somewhere, just not at a  major Division I school right off the bat," Sterkel said. "The person they  hired here (Mark Shubert) was a million times more qualified than I was."  </P> <P> The hiring of Gallagher was a particularly bold step by Holland because the  former UCLA All-American and assistant to Jahn did not have Division I  experience as a head coach -- unlike many of the other applicants -- and had  spent the previous year as a travel agent.  </P> <P> "But neither did Tom Jahn," said Holland, about Gallagher's lack of experience  as a head coach. "People raise that question about Cyndi, but they didn't about  Tom. I don't see the difference. . . . Cyndi had every possible qualification  except one, that she hadn't been a head coach.  </P> <P> "That bias is everywhere, with the media, with my fellow athletic directors.  I'm planning to use our visibility here to change that."  </P> <P> Holland points out that during the same period that the UCLA position was open,  three other high-profile universities -- USC, Stanford and Texas -- had  openings for women's swimming coaches and those jobs went to men.  </P> <P> "All I did was cut the odds a little bit in favor of women," Holland said. "And  I tell you, if I didn't set my mind to hiring a woman, we'd have a man here  too."  </P> <P> One program Holland has instituted at UCLA to help increase the pool of women  qualified for head coaching and administrative positions is to have at least  one female assistant coach for every team.  </P> <P> "I don't want to cut my biases against men. That's not fair either," Holland  said. "But a man can get a job in both men's and women's departments. Women  can't. They're limited to women's athletics. If that's cut off too, she's in a  real tough spot."  </P> <P> The only opposition Holland received to hiring Gallagher came from the team's  members. During a meeting with them, Holland heard various members voice  concerns about whether a woman would be strict enough, a complaint the team had  against Jahn. According to Holland, one swimmer -- whom Holland refused to  identify -- transferred because of the hiring of Gallagher.  </P> <P> Another concern Holland received from team members was that Gallagher would  bring her 3-year-old daughter Tori to workouts, taking time away from the team.  </P> <P> "I couldn't figure out why it was O.K. for Tom to bring his daughter to  practice but not all right for Cyndi. I've learned over the years not to let my  anger show, but I was getting pretty upset," Holland said. "In their defense,  they have only had men coaches all through their careers.  </P> <P> "So I put the question to them of how many of them wanted to coach eventually.  Several said that they did. So I asked them, 'Well, who are you going to  coach?' "  </P> <P> Said Jenny Susser, a senior from Irvine: "I guess it was because there aren't  that many women coaches at the national level. It was just something totally  different to us."  </P> <P> Whatever went into the hiring of Gallagher, however, this season she has  surpassed the expectations of nearly everyone, including Holland. The Bruins  went through their regular season schedule with a 9-1 record, losing only to  second-ranked Stanford, and placed third at the Pacific 10 Conference meet this  last weekend, behind Stanford and Cal. The Bruins have had five swimmers, three  relay teams and two divers qualify for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  championships, to be held March 16-18 in Indianapolis.  </P> <P> In Jahn's six-year term as head coach, the Bruins finished between sixth and  25th nationally and finished second in the Pac-10 twice, in 1984-85 and  1985-86.  </P> <P> Gallagher came to UCLA in 1980 after swimming her freshman year at the  University of Houston and then attending Washington for one year, where she did  not swim. Swimming at UCLA for three years, Gallagher -- then Cyndi McCullam --  set school records in the 1,000 and 1,650 freestyle, both of which have  recently been broken by current swimmers Missy Herndon (1,000) and Sheri Smith  (1,650).  </P> <P> After graduating with a degree in political science, Gallagher spent five years  (1982-87) as an assistant to Jahn.  </P> <P> Gallagher finished 10th in the 800 freestyle at the Olympic trials in 1976 and  spent the next four years training to make the 1980 team.  </P> <P> Gallagher remembers where she was when she heard that then President Carter  decided to boycott the Moscow games in response to the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan.  </P> <P> "It's weird that the Soviets are just now pulling out of Afghanistan," she  said. "I was really heartbroken. I shouldn't have taken it as hard as I did. .  . . I guess it will make me hungrier as a coach to get a swimmer of mine on the  team.  </P> <P> "I think if Amy (Carter's daughter) had been into athletics, he'd have thought  twice about doing it. But I'm just a political science major at UCLA, so who am  I to say what's wrong or right?"  </P> <P> For Gallagher, the only negative reaction she has gotten has come from other  coaches. After she was hired in April, she was on the phone with a recruit when  another coach called the recruit on another line and told her that "the woman  UCLA hired doesn't know what she's doing."  </P> <P> Parents of recruits showed surprise when she introduced herself. The father of  one asked Gallagher how old she was and whether she was married.  </P> <P> "Like that has any bearing on anything," remarked Gallagher, who has been  married for seven years and lives in Venice.  </P> <P> Despite the team's concerns about Gallagher's ability to discipline, no problem  has arisen this season, according to Holland and Gallagher. The problem was a  factor in not renewing Jahn's contract, Holland said. Jahn refused to comment  on why he left UCLA.  </P> <P> Concerns about her family situation have also proved to be naught. Gallagher  has missed a handful of practices when her daughter was ill and has brought her  to practice just once, when a baby-sitter canceled.  </P> <P> "At the first meeting, I explained to them why I got the job. That it wasn't a  gift," Gallagher said. "They didn't hand me the job and say go ahead and have  fun. Obviously, they believe I can handle the job. UCLA isn't the kind of  university that would give the job to just anybody."  </P></p>

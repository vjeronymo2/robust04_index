			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S THE PAYOFF: JUMPING THE GUN ON SALARY CAN KILL PROSPECT OF JOB  </P> <P> It's a dilemma that makes even experienced job-seekers feel awkward. When in  the interview process, should you bring up money? How should you respond to  inquiries about your present pay? How hard should you bargain? The questions  can be baffling.  </P> <P> Salary negotiating is well worth worrying about, says Ronald M. Shapiro, a  Baltimore attorney often involved in salary talks involving clients in sports  and the media. A prospective employee who brings up salary issues too early or  aggressively can kill his chances, because money issues are sensitive and can  chill otherwise friendly negotiations.  </P> <P> "Don't negotiate salary as the first item. You have to sell yourself first,"  cautions Shapiro.  </P> <P> The same advice is offered by employment specialist John Challenger.  </P> <P> "Salary should never be brought up until an offer has been made, because if  you're too high, they'll knock you out of the process, and if you're too low,  they'll say, 'He or she is not at our value,' " says Challenger, vice president  of Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc., a Chicago-based placement firm with  offices throughout the country.  </P> <P> Challenger worries that a job candidate who jumps the gun on salary questions  could be unfairly slotted before he has enough information to negotiate over  pay.  </P> <P> "Don't pigeonhole yourself," he counsels. "Generally, what you want to do in  the interviewing process is to put off the salary question as long as  possible."  </P> <P> If you hold off the salary issue until the company is determined it wants you,  you'll have more clout in pay negotiations, Challenger believes. "The  difference is between you as a seller versus a buyer. You're a seller until you  get an offer."  </P> <P> Of course, the employer could always jump the gun and raise the salary issue  early in the interviewing process. In that case it's unwise to refuse a  response to the inquiry ("This is not a game," Shapiro reminds). Still, it's  smart to deftly finesse your responses.  </P> <P> For instance, suppose the employer confronts you with a question about your  present salary. You don't really want to answer, but can't afford to appear  uncooperative. The next best approach is to present the information in the most  favorable light.  </P> <P> Shapiro suggests that you respond by giving the value of your entire "salary  package," a figure that includes all the benefits that go along with your base  salary -- everything from medical care to pension and insurance coverage as  well as any special benefits you normally receive.  </P> <P> "Tell them your package is worth $80,000, if that's true," says Shapiro, who  adds that it would be a serious mistake to misrepresent your compensation  because "you can't afford to break your integrity."  </P> <P> Early on, you're also likely to confront a question from the employer about  your "salary requirements." In response to this sort of inquiry, Challenger --  whose company helps laid-off employees gain new positions -- suggests that you  offer a general, rather than specific, answer. You might say, for example: "I'd  be very open to whatever you think would be appropriate for a person with my  kind of background, skill, knowledge and expertise. Tell me how you could use  me."  </P> <P> Shapiro advises that you respond to the "salary requirements" question with  actual numbers, though presented as a range that's on the high side of what  you're seeking, "to protect yourself."  </P> <P> For example, if you're seeking to make $50,000, indicate you'd like to make  $55,000 to $60,000.  </P> <P> A key to the salary negotiation process is to amass as much information as  possible before you get to the bargaining stage.  </P> <P> "It's essential that you go into any negotiation -- salary or otherwise -- with  advance research and knowledge," James E. Savitz, a Maryland attorney, says.  </P> <P> One reason research is essential is that there can be wide variations in pay  for people in essentially the same occupation, depending on where they work and  for whom, Savitz observes.  </P> <P> In law, for instance, the starting salary of a fresh-out-of-school attorney  taking a job in New York City could be $70,000 to $80,000. However, the same  lawyer taking a position in a mid-level suburban firm in Maryland could expect  to start at $20,000 to $30,000, he estimates.  </P> <P> There are plenty of sources of information on the average salaries of various  occupations, says Susan W. Miller, a Los Angeles-based career counselor. Such  data may be found through libraries, trade associations, trade journals or, if  your field is unionized, union publications, she says. Another possibility is  to contact a benefits consulting firm, many of which frequently survey local  employers about their pay rates.  </P> <P> Other clues to understanding the would-be employer and his approach to salary  matters may become apparent to you in the interviewing process, says Shapiro,  who contends that careful listening to what the employer is saying can be an  astute way to gather information.  </P> <P> "The rule of negotiating is to do as much listening and get as much information  as possible," he says.  </P> <P> If the interviewing process winds up with you receiving an offer, the deal is  likely to contain a salary proposal. Assuming you're happy with the offer,  Challenger thinks you should "take it right away -- so that you don't lose it.  Sometimes people think they can sit around and wait and then they wind up  losing the offer," he says.  </P> <P> Shapiro, however, prefers to take some time -- as much as you can afford to  take -- to think things over. It's often a mistake to react immediately to a  job offer without thinking things through, he thinks. Ask for at least an hour,  he says, before presenting your reply. Often you can ask to consider an offer  overnight or, if you're in a favorable negotiating position, as long as a week,  he says.  </P> <P> "The idea is to get as much time to think as possible so that you don't let  some instinct, rather than a rational determination, drive you to a decision  you might some day regret," says Shapiro.  </P> <P> To be sure, there's always the possibility you'll receive a salary proposal  that doesn't please you. If that's the case, think about whether it's worth it  to you to seek higher pay.  </P> <P> "If you decide that you can take the risk of losing that offer, then you might  go back and say, 'I'm very interested in the position that you've offered, but  I feel I need to make $60,000. Where do we go from here?' " Challenger  suggests.  </P> <P> No matter what your objective, the most important rule of negotiation is to  avoid an aggressive, adversarial style, say the experts.  </P> <P> "There should be no ultimatums or burning of bridges," says Shapiro. "After  all, when it comes right down to it, the art of negotiation is basically the  art of good human relations."  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Carrefour declines 10.7% to FFr1.21bn CARREFOUR, the hyper-market group which last year staged the largest takeover in the French hypermarket industry, yesterday announced a 10.7 per cent decline in annual profits. Net earnings fell to FFr1.21bn (Dollars 210m) last year, from FFr1.35bn in 1990, in line with earlier forecasts. This contrasts with a 32.3 per cent rise in sales, from FFr75.84bn to FFr100.37bn over the same period, supported by the inclusion since July of Euromarche, Carrefour's main rival, which the group bought last June for FFr5bn. Profits were hit by a FFr382m exceptional write-down, partly for Euromarche and partly for Montlaur, a bankrupt supermarket chain acquired last March. Carrefour also reported a FFr364m capital gain on asset sales over the period. The board will recommend an unchanged annual dividend of FFr32.5 per share. SEB, the French brown goods group which owns the Tefal and Calor brand names, yesterday bucked the trend in the French corporate sector by announcing a 34 per cent increase in net profits to FFr312m from FFr233m in 1990, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Earnings per share increased to FFr109.9 during the year and the board proposed a dividend of FFr34 per share.</p>

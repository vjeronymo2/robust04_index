			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Ricoh in Chinese fax venture RICOH, the Japanese office equipment company, has formed a Dollars 15m joint venture to produce facsimile machines in Shanghai, joining the rush of Japanese companies seeking, in lower-cost China, refuge from yen appreciation. The venture, designed to produce machines for sale in China and for export in the Asian region, is expected to have an output of 40,000 units per month when a planned factory is completed in 1996. Ricoh has a 49.5 per cent stake, while Shanghai Facsimile Machines has 45 per cent, and a Hong Kong company, Champion Technology, 5.5 per cent. The venture will have 800 employees, with a Chinese chairman and a Japanese president. The recent appreciation of the yen has encouraged Japanese companies to locate an increasing share of their production facilities outside Japan so as to take advantage of lower labour charges and to avoid yen-related costs. China is a popular site because it offers lower costs and an rapidly growing domestic market. Facsimile machines sales are expected to rise by 40 to 50 per cent annually until the end of the decade. Mr Haruo Kamimoto, Ricoh's managing director, said the project is part of a Beijing-approved programme to overhaul telecommunications infrastructure, which should ensure that the venture has support.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Volvo abandons Renault merger: Chairman quits as board bows to shareholder pressure Volvo last night tore up its controversial plan to merge with France's Renault, prompting the resignation of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar as chairman of the Swedish industrial group. An unprecedented revolt by senior management forced the Volvo board to bow to shareholder pressure and to abandon the plan to create Europe's second largest automotive group, in the course of one of the most dramatic days in Swedish corporate history. Mr Gyllenhammar, who has led Volvo since 1971 and has been one of Sweden's leading industrialists, immediately announced his resignation, along with four other board members. They included Mr Raymond Levy, Renault's former chief and nominee on the Volvo board. Mr Gyllenhammar bitterly denounced his critics for having 'turned their backs on Europe and the world'. He warned that Volvo's three-year-old alliance with Renault would be destroyed and the long-term survival of Volvo jeopardised. 'The alliance will not remain. It will be dismantled by a Renault management who, understandably, has lost its confidence in Volvo . . . Volvo is right now a wounded company.' The board's decision followed a demand by Volvo's top management that the merger be dropped. The revolt was co-ordinated over the past two days by Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive who was brought into Volvo last year by Mr Gyllenhammar. Mr Gyll's decision in turn followed a wave of opposition to the merger proposal from Volvo's Swedish institutional shareholders. The board said it had become clear that it was 'very unlikely' the merger would be approved at a shareholders' meeting. That meeting, scheduled for next Tuesday, has now been cancelled. Despite Mr Gyllenhammar's warning, Mr Gyll said he hoped Volvo would be able to overcome Renault's disappointment and continue the alliance. By the merger plan, Volvo would have placed all its core car and truck operations into a joint company with Renault, in exchange for a 35 per cent stake in the new company. Swedish shareholders, however, objected to what they saw as a takeover on unclear terms by a state-owned company. Their objections were not countered by assurances from the French side that Renault would be privatised by the end of next year and that a planned golden share would not be used to dilute Volvo's holding. Investors, who had driven up Volvo's share price this week in anticipation of the deal crashing, pushed it up further yesterday in New York following the announcement. Within minutes the share price rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 55.50. Mr Gyllenhammar, who strode into a press conference to announce his resignation, dismissed arguments that Volvo's vehicle operations can prosper on their own. Mr Bo Rydin, a leading industrialist who heads the forestry group SCA, takes over as acting Volvo chairman pending the election of a new board. Renault said last night that privatisation could still go ahead. Industry observers said the process would be complicated by merger's failure.

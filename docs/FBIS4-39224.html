			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement" by the Ministry of Culture and Publishing] </F>   [Text] On 1 June 1994, NARODNAYA GAZETA published the  "Statement of the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF] Opposition in  the Supreme Soviet," which contains accusations against the  Ministry of Culture and Publishing of the Republic of Belarus.  In connection with this, we believe it necessary to provide the  citizens with objective information about the questions under  discussion.    In its everyday activity, the Ministry of Culture and  Publishing is guided by the Belarusian Constitution as well as  other legislative and normative acts which safeguard state  guarantees of the freedom of expression and publishing; the  Ministry aims to create favorable conditions for real economic  and creative independence of periodical publications and normal  functioning of the entire system of national press.    With regard to the annulment of the registration  certificates  of NAVINY BELARUSKAHA NARODNAHA FRONTU "ADRADZHENNE" [BNF News  "Revival"] and VYBAR [Choice] (Vitebsk), the resolution on this  was adopted in accordance with the law on publishing and other  information media. The Article 13 of this law provides: If a  publication is not issued or published during over a year, its  renewal requires a new registration certificate. The last issue  of NAVINY BELARUSKAHA NARODNAHA FRONTU "REVIVAL" is dated 26  March -- 20 April 1993. On 28 February 1994, the founder of the  newspaper, Zyanon Paznyak, was asked in a letter to send to the  ministry all issues of the newspaper, which were published  following 20 April 1993. The ministry has received no answer to  this letter. As a consequence, an annulment of the registration  certificate was signed (22.04.94).    The newspaper VYBAR halted publication due to the fact that  its founder -- the Vitebsk City Club "For Democratic Elections"  -- has been denied registration by the Vitebsk Executive  Committee of people's deputies. In short, the newspaper has  lost its founder.    Since the statement of the BNF opposition deputies mentions  the newspaper SVABODA, it is worth noting that the Ministry of  Culture and Publishing has sent notices about violations of the  law on publishing and other information media to the SVABODA  founder and editorial staff, too. Unfortunately, the provisions  contained in legislation has been ignored by them in many cases.  SVABODA has often published materials that came into conflict  with Article 5 of the law on publishing and other information  media, thus becoming a subject of consideration by people's  courts.    The Ministry of Culture and Publishing thinks that the BNF  opposition's statement concerning the competence of the  Ministry, is unsubstantiated and does not correspond to reality.  In our opinion, this statement appeared due to profit-seeking  reasons -- a striving for acquiring political capital during the  last stage of the presidential elections in Belarus.</p>

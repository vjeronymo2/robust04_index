			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MAX PLANS TO SHIFT EL SEGUNDO ROUTES  </P> <P> Routes will be altered on MAX, the Municipal Area Express transit system that  has been transporting commuters to aerospace companies in and around El Segundo  for the last eight months.  </P> <P> MAX officials say they hope the changes, effective Dec. 17, will continue the  system's steady increase in riders. MAX is reporting an average of 2,495 riders  boarding weekly, or 300 more than expected.  </P> <P> "It's possible that recent fuel prices have encouraged people to ride the bus,"  said John E. Wills, MAX program administrative assistant. Better marketing and  commuters' desire to "ease up morning stress a little bit" could also be  helping the system, he said.  </P> <P> The MAX line serving the South Bay beach cities will be rerouted in the El  Segundo area and lengthened southward. Planners say the change is expected to  more than double the number of passengers on the beach cities line, or Line 1,  where ridership has lagged behind that of the other two lines of the  8-month-old bus system.  </P> <P> As Line 1 buses approach the aerospace companies, they will stop first at the  TRW complex near Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Aviation Boulevard. The 25-seat  white-and-blue buses then will continue north to serve other companies.  </P> <P> At the other end of Line 1, a new park-and-ride lot is being added at the  Riviera United Methodist Church at Palos Verdes Boulevard and Calle Miramar in  Torrance. The lot will serve as the southern terminus of Line 1, which  currently ends farther north at Catalina Avenue and Avenue I.  </P> <P> The lot may attract more commuters from the western part of the Palos Verdes  Peninsula, Wills said.  </P> <P> MAX planners are also extending the Torrance-San Pedro route, or Line 3, to  serve the U.S. Air Force housing complex near Western Avenue and 25th Street.  The Air Force and the city of Los Angeles requested the change to transport  people who live in the complex and work in El Segundo, MAX officials said.  </P> <P> In addition, buses on all three MAX lines will now make stops closer to the  Hughes Radar Systems Group and Space and Communications Group buildings at  Sepulveda Boulevard and Imperial Highway.  </P> <P> MAX is a joint project of nine South Bay cities and Los Angeles County. The  first buses began running April 18 on lines formerly used by three older  systems. Funding comes from fares, a Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission demonstration grant funded by Proposition A and from local cities'  share of Proposition A money.  </P> <P> The system recently won a 1990 Transportation Award of Excellence from Commuter  Transportation Services Inc. and the Southern California Assn. of Governments.  </P></p>

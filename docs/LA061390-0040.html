			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETARY KEMP BEATS A SMART RETREAT;  </P> <P> * PULLS BACK FAST ON COUNTERPRODUCTIVE HUD RULING ON IMMIGRATION FUNDING  </P> <P> Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp knew how to read a defense in  his days as a football quarterback, and now he has made the right call on the  bureaucratic playing field.  </P> <P> Kemp scrambled deftly out of the pocket on Monday to escape the fierce  political pressure generated by his department's insensitive response to Costa  Mesa's immigration policy. He suspended an opinion rendered by his general  counsel that had managed over the weekend to offend a vast cross section of  immigration groups and nonprofit organizations.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa had no idea it would stir such national outrage when its divided  City Council last summer passed an ordinance requiring charities receiving  funds to monitor the immigration status of recipients. The city fathers were so  unsure of the fairness of their own decision that they actually rescinded the  ordinance later on, all the while looking to Washington, the source of  community development money, for clarification.  </P> <P> The mayor had been the swing vote when the ordinance passed and again when it  was pulled back. Then came a stunning decision from HUD's general counsel last  week that a city could, in effect, turn nonprofit groups into unwilling  deputies to enforce immigration policy.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, immigration groups, already concerned about a recent report  that found widespread discrimination by employers against immigrants, were very  upset. And so the legal opinion presented political problems both for the mayor  of Costa Mesa and for the secretary of HUD. The Bush Administration, after all,  has been trying to cast charities as points of light, not grand inquisitors.  Politically, it necessarily looks to immigrants for support as the old  Republican Sunbelt strongholds shift in ethnic composition in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Enter Jack Kemp. He saw correctly that even if his lawyer had issued a  perfectly sound legal opinion, based on HUD's own regulations, it wasn't  necessarily good policy. The legal ruling indeed had opened an amazing  Pandora's box: Nonprofits were to be co-opted into doing the federal  government's immigration screening, immigrants were to be subjected to new  discrimination. Kemp was right to retreat from the ruling and to put things on  hold until they can be sorted out.  </P> <P> Two conclusions are inescapable. City councils shouldn't try to transform  charities into arms of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. And  Washington's opinions may follow the letter of the law and still be bad as real  public policy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THREATS TO DEFENDANT DESCRIBED BY WITNESS;  </P> <P> HEARING: TEACHER SAYS YOUNG MEN CAME ONTO SCHOOL GROUNDS SEEKING TO ACCOST  CHRISTIAN STEFFENS, ACCUSED IN SUBSEQUENT DANA POINT SLAYING OF ROBERT ELLIOTT.  </P> <P> A Dana Hills High School teacher on Tuesday testified that a "scared" Christian  Aaron Steffens had been threatened in her class by two or three young men just  two days before a confrontation on a Dana Point beach that ended in the fatal  shooting of Robert James Elliott.  </P> <P> Steffens of Laguna Niguel is accused of killing Elliott, 18, of Capistrano  Beach on Sept. 8. His public defender is seeking to show that Steffens, then  16, shot Elliott in self-defense after Steffens was bullied and terrified by  Elliott and a group of friends.  </P> <P> The prosecution, however, is arguing that Steffens was the "aggressor" in the  Dana Strand shooting.  </P> <P> The case is before Juvenile Court Judge Robert B. Hutson, who will decide after  the hearing whether Steffens should be tried as an adult or a juvenile. A  decision to try Steffens as a juvenile would mean that he could get a lesser  sentence if convicted.  </P> <P> In testimony Tuesday, teacher Christa Jurgensen said that on Sept. 6, Steffens  was among students in her Spanish class.  </P> <P> She said that Steffens asked for permission to leave class for a brief time and  that when he returned "he looked scared."  </P> <P> Jurgensen testified that Steffens told her: "There are some guys after me. They  want to beat me up."  </P> <P> The teacher said that after class ended, "Christian stayed in the room, and he  hid in the corner. He said, 'Shut the door. They're after me. I don't want them  to see me or get me.' "  </P> <P> Jurgensen said that outside her classroom, which is in a portable building, she  saw two or three young men, about 18 or 19 years old, who are not students at  the high school. She said they walked to the door of her classroom and shouted  obscenities and threats at Steffens.  </P> <P> "They called into the room and said, 'Chris, we know you're in there. We're  going to get you. . . . Just wait -- we're going to get you.' "  </P> <P> The teacher added: "I was still standing in the doorway, so they did not dare  come in."  </P> <P> Jurgensen said the group then left her classroom area, and she reported the  incident to school authorities. She did not identify the men during her  testimony, and no one else during the court proceedings indicated who the young  men were.  </P> <P> But Marri Derby, public defender for Steffens, clearly indicated in her  questioning that she believes that those who allegedly threatened Steffens were  associated with Elliott.  </P> <P> Derby has contended that Elliott and his friends had a history of trying to  scare Steffens.  </P> <P> The only other witness Tuesday was Caleb Cassidy, 17, of Capistrano Beach, who  identified himself as a friend of Elliott.  </P> <P> Cassidy told the court that on Sept. 5, he witnessed a verbal dispute that grew  into fistfight on the beach between Steffens and Elliott.  </P> <P> Cassidy testified that Steffens threw the first punch, that at the end of the  fight Elliott chased Steffens down the beach and that Steffens escaped and ran  to his home in Dana Point.  </P></p>

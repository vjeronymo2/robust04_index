			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEARL HARBOR ATTACK  </P> <P> I'm writing because of the oversight or because of the lack of interest by the  Los Angeles Times in not publishing anything significant about the memorial of  the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.  </P> <P> Now more then any time in recent years, we face troubled times where many  American lives may be lost.  </P> <P> An attack on innocent people is an attack on freedom.  </P> <P> I believe this was a real chance to show all Americans that we honor those who  gave their lives for freedom, a chance to say we have strong feelings for those  on the sands of Saudia Arabia as well as we have for those who died in Hawaii.  </P> <P> It is the duty of all newspapers to help us reflect as well as inform. The past  is what we build our future on. Our lives are enriched by all news.  </P> <P> ROBERT L'AMOUR  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

Tumanova; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The interminable trial of the SCSE [State Committee  for the State of Emergency] members consists of a multitude of  separate sittings, most of which begin and are immediately  adjourned.    Like today. It was all over in five minutes. Two of the  accused, Lukyanov and Pavlov, were absent. Pavlov is recovering  after an operation, while Lukyanov is at home and being attended  by doctors.    The court ruled that doctors should provide findings on the  health and ability to attend the trial for both men. It was  adjourned until 12 January.</p>

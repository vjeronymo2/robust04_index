			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. MARSHAL COLLARS POLICE GAMES CROWN  </P> <P> Kent Colton doesn't usually go around hurting people, especially cops, but  Friday he couldn't help himself.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old U.S. marshal from Orange County chipped a bone in one  policeman's elbow and sent another officer off for treatment of a strained  muscle during the wrist-wrestling competition of the 24th annual California  Police Summer Games.  </P> <P> Then he got a gold medal for it.  </P> <P> Besides gold, silver and bronze medals, many of the 6,000 officers from all  over the state take bruises, breaks and bumps back to their agencies after  competing in 44 athletic events.  </P> <P> "Some sports are inherently high-risk sports," said Skip LeMaster, a Sacramento  County sheriff's deputy who helped organize the weeklong event. This year there  have been injuries from flag football, power lifting and soccer, he said.  </P> <P> "This is a very, very intense competition," said LeMaster.  </P> <P> Many officers bring their families along for a week's vacation during the  games. The games drew an estimated 15,000 people.  </P> <P> "It's fun," said Colton. "The only other time you get a lot of police together  is at funerals, and those are the bad times."  </P></p>

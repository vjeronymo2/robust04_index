			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JOHN LYNCH;  </P> <P> OFF-COURT DISTRACTIONS PUT ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON BASKETBALL COACHES  </P> <P> The sudden departures of two area basketball coaches this summer may underscore  a disturbing trend in high school coaching.  </P> <P> When Marc Paez unexpectedly announced his resignation as the Cleveland High  coach last month after just one season on the job, he leveled a broadside at  such coaching pressures as recruiting, parental interference and the growing  competition from unregulated spring- and summer-league seasons.  </P> <P> Dave Hoffman also abruptly ended his tenure as coach when he severed ties with  Chaminade two weeks ago, just two months after he was hired. Hoffman, 34, had  posted a 22-24 record at Calabasas in two seasons and was 12-10 at St.  Genevieve in one season before replacing Mike Lynn at Chaminade in May.  </P> <P> Hoffman said that a desire to spend time with his 3-year-old son and to  concentrate on his baseball card store prompted the decision, but he also  indicated that he sympathized with Paez.  </P> <P> "Some people have called me about work since I quit, but I'm not looking for a  new job," he said Friday. "If I was interested (in coaching) I'd still be at  Chaminade."  </P> <P> But after two months with the varsity, Hoffman left, questioning his commitment  to the profession.  </P> <P> "I've been involved in basketball for 27 years and I'm going to put basketball  on hold for a while," he said. "I agreed with a lot of the things that Paez  said about the distractions. I'm not sure I want to get back into coaching."  </P> <P> Add Chaminade: Hoffman's departure surprised the Chaminade players, according  to Mark Wiltshire, one of two returning starters from last season's team.  Wiltshire, a 6-foot-2 off guard, said he benefited from Hoffman's brief reign.  </P> <P> "He was a good coach and had helped me a lot," he said. "He was making us  strong and united."  </P> <P> Perhaps, but not all the Eagles supported Hoffman. Some questioned his practice  techniques and chafed under the demands the new coach placed on them, Wiltshire  said. At least a couple of players had considered quitting the team, he said.  </P> <P> "A couple of the younger players were having problems and complained that he  expected too much out of us," he said. "But there were about eight of us that  were working hard."  </P> <P> The turmoil has upset Lynn, who resigned as coach at Chaminade after 11  seasons. He also quit as athletic director and will move his family to  Sacramento. He handpicked Hoffman and proclaimed in May that Hoffman was  potentially one of the best coaches in the area.  </P> <P> "What's happening to the program is disappointing," Lynn said. "I put 11 years  of my life into Chaminade and I can't walk away and say I don't care any more.  I still respect Dave and we're friends. It's troubling to know the kids are  struggling with this."  </P> <P> Wiltshire claims the players have adjusted well to the loss of Hoffman largely  because assistant coach Rob Kurowski has jumped into the breach. "He's not only  a coach but a good buddy," Wiltshire said.  </P> <P> Still, it's been a difficult time for Chaminade and Principal Tom Moran, the  former St. Francis baseball coach who inherited the situation when he assumed  his new post July 1.  </P> <P> "My chair is not warm yet and I feel fortunate when I find my way back to my  desk from the water cooler," Moran said. "I had heard good things about Dave as  a coach and we're disappointed this happened. There's never a good time for  these things, but it's better now than closer to the basketball season. We're  going to take our time before we hire a new coach."  </P> <P> New kid at the end of the block: One of the premier football positions in the  area the past decade has been tight end at Hart. The tradition of talented  players started with Darryl Ingram, a current member of the Minnesota Vikings  who played at Cal. He starred for Hart in the early 1980s and played a key role  in the team's championship season in 1983 when Hart defeated North Torrance for  the Southern Section Coastal Conference title.  </P> <P> In the middle of the decade, David Lee was a two-time All-Foothill League tight  end who played baseball at USC. Brian Allen, a Times All-Valley selection,  earned all-league recognition in 1987 and '88 and led Hart to a semifinal-round  berth in the Northwestern Conference playoffs in '87. He plays at UCLA.  </P> <P> Hart Coach Mike Herrington has moved one of the team's top athletes to the  position, which may help to keep the tradition alive in the 1990s. George Kase,  a 6-3, 230-pound senior, has drawn the attention of college recruiters for his  play as a defensive end but will play on both sides of the ball this fall.  </P> <P> "He concentrated on defense last year and was successful," Herrington said. "He  could probably play on either offense and defense in college. He's fast and  quick, and will catch his share of balls like all the tight ends at Hart."  </P> <P> Where were these guys?: If anyone accuses Canyon Coach Harry Welch of  recruiting, he'll gladly plead guilty. But instead of searching outside the  Santa Clarita Valley for talent, Welch has focused his efforts on the Canyon  campus, where his persuasive powers finally worked on three Canyon athletes who  have joined the football team.  </P> <P> Senior Troy Aldridge, a second-team All-Southern Section volleyball player, has  joined the team as a receiver, and senior Matt Sinnott and junior Jim Zopalis  have virtually nailed down jobs as the team's outside linebackers.  </P> <P> Of course, Welch's sales pitch this year carried an enticing twist. Not many  coaches at Canyon can offer their players a road trip to Hawaii as part of the  program.  </P> <P> Canyon is one of four area teams that will open the season in Hawaii next  month. The Cowboys will join Crespi and Montclair Prep in Aloha Stadium in  Honolulu Aug. 30 for games against Hawaiian teams. The next day, Chaminade  plays Konawaena on the big island of Hawaii.  </P> <P> Despite the enthusiasm the trip has generated in Canyon Country -- the Cowboy  contingent will reach 300 -- the trip has brought its headaches for a football  coach.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest excursion in Santa Clarita history," Welch said with only  slight exaggeration. "It's been nonstop around here and the kids have been  caught up in the excitement. That's wonderful, but that's not what a football  coach is thinking about. When you're thinking about Waikiki, you're not  thinking about X's and O's."  </P></p>

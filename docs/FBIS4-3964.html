			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Tidbit" by reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Hu </F> Xiaoguang (5170 2556 0342): "At the Foot of Lofty Tianshan, a  Fine Steed Conveys Friendship"]    [Text] Bishkek, 24 Apr (XINHUA) -- On 24 April, Kyrgyz  Prime Minister Dzhumagulov handed the reins of a tall, deep  brown steed strapped with saddle and stirrups into the hands of  Premier Li Peng at the foot of the lofty Tianshan.    Today is the third day of Li Peng's visit to Kyrgyzstan. In  a most solemn ceremony of the Kyrgyz nationality held at a  national park famous for its "multicolored dragon spruces,"  Dzhumagulov offered this fine-bred steed as a present to Premier  Li Peng to show respect and friendship for the Chinese people.  The horse is named after a Kyrgyz river called "Naolusi" [name  as received]. It is also the name of a traditional festival of  the Kyrgyz nationality, meaning "the beginning of spring."    The horse, 1.7 meters tall and over 2 meters long, is six  years old. It won a horse race at Bishkek last year. When the  Chinese premier approached the fine steed, it raised its head  and neighed. Softly touching the steed's long mane, Li Peng said  laughingly: "It is very friendly."    On a slope at an altitude of 2,000 meters above sea level  and  against a backdrop of mountains whose peaks are perennially  covered with snow, Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin gladly posed for  a group photo with Kyrgyz girls and boys singing a song in front  of a forest of multicolored, evergreen dragon spruces at the  foot of the mountain.    Chinese Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Pan Zhanlin told reporters  Premier Li Peng has entrusted the raising of the fine steed  symbolizing the spring of Sino-Kyrgyz friendship to the Ili Army  Horse Ranch in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which borders  Kyrgyzstan.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDIA GUNMEN KILL 26 HINDUS; SIKHS BLAMED  </P> <P> Gunmen sprayed machine-gun fire and detonated two powerful bombs Sunday at an  outdoor meeting of a militant Hindu organization in the northern state of  Punjab, killing at least 26 people and injuring two dozen others in the worst  violence this year in the strategic, strife-torn state.  </P> <P> Calling the massacre "a most dastardly and cowardly attack by nefarious  people," Punjabi Gov. S. S. Ray declared an indefinite curfew in the area and  ordered police to capture the gunmen "dead or alive within seven days."  </P> <P> Police officials blamed the attack on a militant Sikh organization called the  Khalistan Commando Force. Khalistan is the militants' name for a hoped-for  separate Sikh state they would like to see carved out of Punjab, India's most  fertile and once most-prosperous state.  </P> <P> In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's minister for internal security,  Buta Singh, declared the massacre to be "the biggest in recent times" and said  that it is "a very serious attempt on the part of terrorists to whip up tension  along communal (religious) lines."  </P> <P> The organization targeted by the gunmen Sunday is one of India's largest and  most militant national Hindu groups, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or  National Volunteer Corps.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Martial Arts, Fervor  </P> <P> When the attack took place, the group's members were meeting in a park in the  Punjabi town of Moga, one of hundreds of such gatherings in which the volunteer  corps teaches martial arts and mobilizes religious fervor among India's  dominant religious group.  </P> <P> Police said that a van pulled up to the gathering and half a dozen men began  firing at random. Nearly an hour after they sped away, a time bomb exploded at  the scene of the shootings, killing two police investigators and a bystander.  Later, a second bomb went off in the park but caused no casualties.  </P> <P> In an effort to play down the religious implications of an attack that many  fear could further inflame the situation in Punjab state, where thousands have  been killed since the militant Sikh campaign began in 1982, Gov. Ray tried to  place the ultimate blame on Pakistan, which borders the Punjab.  </P> <P> "The perpetrators of this ghastly crime are neither Hindus nor Sikhs, but  animals hired by vested interests, principally from across our border, to  create chaos, confusion and division in our sacred land," Ray said.  </P> <P> Despite a recent warming of relations, India has often accused Pakistan of  abetting the Sikh militants. Allegations of Pakistani involvement in the  conflict have never been proved conclusively.  </P> <P> After Sunday's attack, however, several analysts in New Delhi speculated that  the massacre also may have serious political ramifications for Prime Minister  Gandhi as this year's national elections approach.  </P> <P> Gandhi, who succeeded his mother, Indira, after she was assassinated by two of  her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, must stand for reelection before the end of this  year, and religion is likely to be one of the key issues.  </P> <P> The National Volunteer Corps represents a huge, nationwide voting bloc centered  in the central Indian region known as the Hindi heartland, which political  analysts say is the key to winning a national election.  </P> <P> Already, the Hindu militants have been speaking out against Gandhi's  government, and Sunday's massacre almost certainly will alienate the group  still further from Gandhi's secular Congress-I ruling party.  </P></p>

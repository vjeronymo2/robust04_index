			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Selection of Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MWC guidelines adopted on February 11, 1991 provided the rationale for the selection of MWC's as a source category to be regulated (56 FR 5514). Moreover, section 129 of the Act directs the EPA to issue guidelines for this source category, and thereby confirms the EPA's earlier decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed emission guidelines (subpart Cb) would apply to existing MWC's, defined as those MWC's for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or before September 20, 1994. Municipal waste combustors for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced after September 20, 1994 would be covered by the subpart Eb NSPS proposed in a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, as required by section 129 of the Act, today's proposed guidelines would establish opacity limits for certain existing air curtain incinerators, for which construction, modification, or reconstruction commenced on or before September 20, 1994. Under the proposed guidelines, air curtain incinerators that burn only yard wastes, tree trimmings, and clean untreated lumber would be required to meet an opacity limit, and no other requirements would apply. The proposed guidelines for these air curtain incinerators are presented in section VI of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Modification or Reconstruction of Existing MWC's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The subpart Ea NSPS proposal published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 20, 1989 (54 FR 52251) provided a discussion of the terms and conditions associated with construction, modification, and reconstruction for MWC's. One change is being proposed. Previously, the terms ``modification'' and ``reconstruction'' were defined under sections 60.14 and 60.15 of subpart A of part 60. Section 129 of the Act has specified a new definition of ``modified solid waste incineration unit'' that combines and revises the previous definitions of ``modification'' and ``reconstruction.'' Specifically, ``modified solid waste incineration unit'' refers to: (1) Modifications for which the <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* cumulative costs of the modifications, over the life of the unit, exceed 50 per centum of the original cost of the construction and installation of the unit (not including the cost of any land purchased in connection with such construction or installation) updated to current costs. *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> or (2) modifications involving <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* a physical change in or change in the method of operation of the unit which increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by the unit for which standards have been established under [section 129] or section 111 *&blank;*&blank;*. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Selection of Designated Pollutants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A complete discussion of the rationale for selecting ``MWC emissions'' as the designated pollutants under sections 111(b) and 111(d) of the Act is provided in the December 20, 1989 proposal preamble for the 1991 emission guidelines (54 FR 52209). Additionally, section 129 of the Act specifies that emission guidelines be developed for PM, opacity, SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HCl, NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , CO, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans. Emission guidelines for all but four of these pollutants (Cd, Pb, Hg, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) were established in the February 11, 1991 emission guidelines (56 FR 5514). Section 129 specifies that emission limits be set for each of the metals (Cd, Pb, and Hg).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission guidelines for fugitive MWC fly ash/bottom ash emissions are proposed today because these emissions also contain PM, Cd, Pb, Hg, and dioxins/furans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Selection of Designated Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the proposed emission guidelines, the designated facility, an MWC unit, is defined as any setting or equipment chamber or pit used to burn MSW (including RDF) and extends to and includes MWC fly ash/bottom ash emission points, including ash storage areas, conveyor transfer points, and ash loading areas for hauling trucks at the MWC site. This does not extend to ash handling outside of the MWC property boundary or at ash fill sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Municipal waste combustion includes the burning (or pyrolysis) of MSW in any type of equipment, chamber, or pit including equipment with and without heat recovery. Municipal solid waste is defined as either a mixture or a single-item stream of household, commercial, and/or institutional discards. This would include discards such as paper, wood, yard wastes, tree trimmings, plastics, leather, rubber, glass, metals, and other combustible and noncombustible materials. The MSW definition includes household discards as well as discards from institutional and commercial sources, but does not include industrial process or manufacturing discards. The MSW definition also includes RDF, which is a type of MSW that is shredded (or pelletized) and classified by size before combustion. Municipal solid waste does not include wastes that are solely segregated medical wastes. However, any mixtures of medical waste with nonmedical hospital waste or with household, commercial, or institutional waste is considered to be MSW. Minor editing has been done to the definition of MSW to clarify this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cofired combustors are those that fire MSW with non-MSW fuel such as coal. Cofired combustors that combust a fuel feed stream comprised, in aggregate, of equal to or less than 30 percent MSW or RDF (by weight, based on a 24-hour average), would not be subject to the emission guidelines and would be required only to submit reports of the amount of MSW and other fuels combusted. The exclusion of cofired combustors from the guidelines is consistent with the Act of 1990. This exclusion is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Waste-fuel power generation facilities that combust a single-item waste stream of tires, fuel derived solely from tires, or used oil would be subject only to an initial report and to no other provisions in today's proposal or to the emission guidelines that were promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5514). This exclusion is unchanged from the February 11, 1991 guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air curtain incinerators with unit capacities to combust greater than 35 Mg/day of MSW are subject to the proposal; however, air curtain incinerators that combust only tree trimmings, yard wastes, and clean untreated lumber (these are a subset of MSW) would be subject to an opacity standard and its associated testing, recordkeeping, and reporting included in today's proposal, but would not be subject to other parts of today's proposal. This exclusion does not apply to air curtain incinerators that combust other MSW materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

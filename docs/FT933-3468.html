			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / DSS may cushion water charges SOCIAL SECURITY may help cushion poorer households if the installation of water meters pushes up their bills, Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said yesterday. Controversy about the impact of metering is set to increase after the publication yesterday of the results of three-year trials of water meters in England and Wales. Ofwat and the National Rivers Authority, the industry regulators, have joined the government in backing an extension of metering as a way of charging customers. Most households now pay a flat annual fee based on property value under the old rating system, but water companies must find a new basis for charging by the year 2000. Some households are likely to pay less if meters are installed - including pensioners living alone, one sixth of the total, according to Mr Yeo. However large families will probably pay more. Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies said: 'We think it is essential that the social security system provides some support for those households who can't pay their bill'. The largest water meter trial, in the Isle of Wight, covering 50,000 households, suggested that they used 21 per cent less water after a meter was fitted. However 11 smaller trials, covering some 10,000 households, found an average drop of only 11 per cent compared with similar unmetered areas. The report also concluded that installation and running costs were high. The Isle of Wight trial suggested the running costs of a metered system were on average Pounds 19.08 a year higher than a system based on rateable values.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (12): Boost for productivity - How portables help sales force automation SALES force automation was largely impractical until the appearance of the laptop computer. Computer-help for field sales people used to be limited to what could be mailed to or from them on disk or be telephoned to their home PC, via its modem. Now software packages abound, claiming to make the nomadic sales person more productive. Some systems are little more than glorified electronic diaries, but others are genuine marketing tools, cutting down on paperwork and handling all routine computerised elements of a sales person's work, such as: Customer requirements analysis and recording. Quotation compilation. Personal organisation facilities. Planning and developing sales prospects. A closer look at these headings might reveal facilities for recording customer details, relevant products, history of sales (and failures), past visit reports, current sales order management, and forward action for taking up new business opportunities. The transfer of information between the sales executive and head office is important. Thus, a package may allow information to be extracted for progress reports and for creating more lengthy reviews requiring pre-composed texts and calculations, in word processing fashion. There should also be an electronic mail link. The tasks may be interpreted in different ways, but should not be discrete: for example, an entry in one section should update, in spreadsheet fashion, the effects on entries in other areas. A change of contact name, to take a simple instance, will need updating in the diary, account record and future prospects reminder. Among the hundreds of packages for sales force automation, a handful are starting to acquire a name. Among these, Sales Technologies, for instance, is a leader in the pharmaceutical industry. Market Solutions, Prosper Systems and Ensure Sales Technology have well-known, but more general purpose offerings. In the insurance sector, the Business Partner system comes from industry-sponsored Origo Services. The insurance industry, as with all pioneers of computer applications, had to write its own early software. Many user-companies now combine in-house systems with off-the-shelf automation modules to add value. Sun Life of Canada, for instance, uses in-house software to gather information on the client, analyse it identifying needs and generate product illustrations. They also have a proprietary SFA system called Portex from Showerings and there will soon be an automatic data transfer from one to the other. Allied Dunbar's famous application of sales force computers has evolved into customer-needs analysis and point-of-sale product calculations combined into a personal financial planning system. They are now adding enhanced functions such as financial health checks and graphical sales tracks to a practice management module covering sales force functions. This last point illustrates the need for pick-and-mix systems design. Sundridge Park Management Centre at Bromley, Kent, has an accumulation of expertise on sales force automation. But Monica Seeley, the centre's programme director, adds a warning: 'Some purveyors are jumping on the bandwagon. Potential users must closely look at the needs of their sales force and make sure the software they buy really fits those requirements. 'For example, are sales people selling low-price items in bulk or high-value items in individual negotiations? Do they sell to wholesalers who know the trade or to end-users who need educating? 'Does each sales person have large or small numbers of customers and how well does he or she have to get to know them? Issues like these need to be set out clearly, because most packages are written with one or another type of salesforce in mind. 'Indeed, there may be a mix of 'sales types' in the company - regular sales people out on their patch and others on national accounts. It is rare that one system can serve all these people, but where different packages are used they will need 'pipelines' between them.' Another link is needed between the sales team's laptops and the head office sales management system - thence to the company's order, production, delivery and accounting arteries. Such a link allows a sales person to update head office territory records, send in orders as they are taken, and so on. The head office, in turn, sends out details of fresh enquiries, price changes, promotional information and other data.</p>

"The government has not yet decided, but the U.S. apparently  does not appreciate the voluntary restrictions," Hiroshi  Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, said at a  regular news conference.    Japan has maintained a voluntary ceiling for its annual car  exports to the U.S. since 1981, and is due to decide on a new  limit at the end of the month.    Kumagai said that U.S.-bound exports of cars manufactured in  Japan have remained below the ceiling recently, mainly due to  increased output at so-called transplant factories, or Japanese  plants located in the U.S.    The minister also cited the higher yen against the dollar as  a reason why exports have slumped.    Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports are  included among the trading practices criticized for lacking  transparency at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global  trade talks last December.    Under the accord, trading nations agreed to end such  practices within four years after the agreement is put into  effect.</p>

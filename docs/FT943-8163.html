			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Tax rate swap deal opens a fresh vista - Derivatives Morgan Grenfell's completion - announced Tuesday - of what it believes is the first UK tax rate swap agreement, for an international bank, may spark fresh interest in the market for tax swaps. But it is a market that is unlikely to become actively traded. For any swaps market to develop, there needs to be some balance between the number of counterparties with opposite views. For example, in the interest rate swaps market, liquidity tends to dry up when everyone expects a rate hike, because the prevalence of one view creates a dearth of counterparties willing to pay a floating-rate of interest. In the case of tax rates, most companies benefit when tax rates go down and suffer when tax rates go up, so there is a lack of counterparties willing to take one side of the swap. The Morgan Grenfell deal is unusual in that the counterparty in question falls into just such a minority. Because of the structure of a specific leasing transaction which provides the counterparty with tax benefits, the bank in question would lose out if corporate tax rates fell. 'We have been looking for such a counterparty for five years,' said Mr Ed Stacey, director of Morgan Grenfell. 'We haven't done such a deal before because almost every counterparty suffers when tax rates go up. This won't be an inter-bank market: there will only ever be a limited number of deals put together.' Those deals which do occur will be privately agreed. Companies are usually unwilling to publicise tax-related deals because they do not want to appear to be avoiding tax, or to attract the attention of the authorities to any loopholes they may have found. However, because the Morgan Grenfell deal involves a straightforward transfer of the risk of an increase in the tax rate, there is no effect on tax revenues to the authorities. The Morgan deal covers Pounds 15m of profits over a period of four years, but does not start for a year, since a tax rate increase is only considered likely if a Labour government were elected. Morgan will have no trouble finding counterparties to take the other side of the deal, but its small size means that the scope for further business is limited. Although the deal is something of a new departure, in allowing a specific hedge against a tax change, it relates only to the lease. A hedge against the full effect of a corporate tax rate increase on a company's profitability is not on offer. The difficulty for banks in producing such an instrument is in finding a way of offsetting their exposure, since there is no traded market, such as bond or interest-rate futures as in the case of interest rate swaps. 'I believe that derivatives will play an ever-increasing role (in hedging tax exposure). There is no reason why a forward market in UK tax rates could not be developed,' said Mr Richard Collier, lead tax partner of the financial risk management group at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Whether explicitly tax-driven or not, the swaps market has always been used by companies to provide tax benefits for companies. Such deals are commonplace, although the details are kept under wraps. However, the tax authorities are constantly on the look-out for such ploys. See Lex</p>

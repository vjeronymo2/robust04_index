This was announced by Lech Walesa  today.    [Reporter] My representative, a lower-ranking one, is going  to return to the commission for formal reasons, the president  said before leaving Gdansk for Warsaw. It had seemed that the  constitution should be created at the Sejm, but there is no good  atmosphere for the president there, Lech Walesa said. He  announced that in using a different political setup and other  opportunities he will be preparing his own draft constitution  and perhaps in the future, under favorable conditions, it might  be possible to combine both.    Asked about reports in some newspapers to the effect that  Piotr Kolodziejczyk is considering appointing a deputy national  defense minister from among the present government coalition,  President Walesa said: This appointment must not be made.  Anyone who seriously thinks about the state knows that no  divisions must be created.    He offered assistance to the heads of the presidential  government departments.    Lech Walesa would not reply unambiguously to the question of  whether his press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski would be either  resigning or dismissed in the immediate future. Are you feeling  tired? he asked Drzycimski, and added: I don't think he looks  all that bad yet.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 5 (TANJUG) -- The delegation of Bosnian  Moslems on Sunday torpedoed for the fourth straight day the  effort by U.N. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi to make the warring sides in the civil-war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina sign a cessation of all hostilities.  Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams said this afternoon that  the Moslem delegation, dissatisfied with the situation around  Gorazde where they said armed Serbs still remained, was about to  return to Zagreb.    The delegation's statement was understood among conference  circles as a fresh blackmail rather than the definitive decision.    In the afternoon at the Palace of Nations, three news  conferences were held at which Williams spoke about Moslems's  fresh assertions about the presence of armed Serbs on a hill 200  metres within the 3-km zone from central Gorazde banned for  armed soldiers. The final destiny of the talks is most likely  to be known around 7 p.m. when Akashi would speak to reporters,  Williams said.    There are many who believe that the undermining of the talks  so far had been a scheme aimed at harming the good name of the  Japanese diplomat.    In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) Commander for  the former Yugoslavia General Michael Rose said on Sunday that  the evacuation of Serbs from the Gorazde zone had been completed  and that this fact was well known to the local Moslem commander  on the ground because he was combing the zone together with  UNPROFOR.    The French AFP news agency learned from General Rose's aides  that two or three Serbs were still on a strategically  insignificant and hardly accessible hill a few metres within the  banned zone. Sarajevo UNPROFOR spokesman Major Baker Halloway  told the AFP that these three Serbs were not a threat to  Gorazde, an eastern Bosnian enclave designated a safe area.    On Sunday morning, the delegation of the Bosnian Serb  Republic, headed by President Radovan Karadzic and Army  Commander General Ratko Mladic, arrived at the Palace of Nations  on time. Karadzic reiterated to TANJUG's correspondent that the  Serb side was prepared to sign peace.    In the afternoon, leaving the Palace of Nations, Karadzic  said the Moslem delegation's behaviour meant the Moslems'  dealing a blow to the international public. In Karadzic's  words, well-informed circles in Europe assert that those who  want Moslems exterminated were in fact pushing the Bosnian  Moslems into conflicts now with Serbs and at other times with  Croats.    Karadzic believed that the Moslems were not sabotaging the  conference on their own initiative but that they, to their  detriment, were persuaded to choose a wrong tactic.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Unilever sets its sights on satisfying Mrs Jones - The new co-chairman It is not often that a change at the top of a well-managed multinational as big as Unilever coincides neatly with a shift in the company's direction. But Michael Perry, who this week succeeded Sir Michael Angus as British co-chairman of the Anglo-Dutch consumer products manufacturer, talks like a man who stands on the verge of a new era. 'If you ask what characterised the Angus years, clearly it was the single-minded focus on improving Unilever's profitability by driving out inefficiency and low margin businesses,' Mr Perry says. Boosting the bottom line will remain as important as ever - his aim is to improve on last year's 8.7 per cent operating margin by 'a percentage point or two' during his four-year chairmanship. 'But it will have to happen by different means,' he says. The challenge now is to move forward by seizing the initiative much more aggressively in all Unilever's markets: 'We have got to do better than our competitors and better than we have ever done before at harnessing our global technological resources to individual markets. It's my firm belief that restoring the all-important focus on leading and setting the agenda is what it's all about.' That does not imply any let-up on cost cutting. In Europe, where Unilever is rationalising extensively its food business to prepare for the single market, Mr Perry says the biggest pay-off is still to come: 'You ain't seen nothing yet. There's a hell of a lot more to come in margin improvement.' Unilever is also still ploughing a lot of effort into straightening out US businesses acquired in the 1980s. Profitability at its Cheseborough Ponds subsidiary should be 'exactly where we want it in the next 12 months or so'. The big wave of restructuring, disposals and acquisitions of the 1980s, when Unilever shed many established businesses and expanded into new ones such as perfumes and cosmetics, is unlikely to be repeated. Further acquisitions are likely to be closely related to the company's four 'core businesses' of food, detergents, personal products and speciality chemicals. One imperative dominates the 58-year-old Mr Perry's strategic vision for Unilever. It is sharply to accelerate the company's rate of innovation, showering markets worldwide with new products. The goal is particularly urgent because some of Unilever's biggest traditional businesses - notably edible fats, in which it is the world market leader - have grown mature and face increasingly tough price competition. To restore margins and growth, the company needs to diversify into new products with higher added value. Mr Perry is counting heavily on Unilever's extensive investments in modern information technology to tighten internal communications. But its ability to innovate and respond faster will depend, above all, on the success of radical moves under way to reorganise some of its biggest operations. These have gone furthest in detergents, where Unilever's previous patchwork of national baronies has been replaced by a more unified executive intended to drive the business worldwide. A slightly less sweeping shake-up has been instituted in European foods, while the personal products division is seeking to co-ordinate its operations more closely from an office recently established in Paris. Although Mr Perry is satisfied with results to date, he admits that the company is still experimenting. The trick will be to strike a balance which produces coherent global strategies without endangering Unilever's much-prized entrepreneurship in the field. As Mr Perry puts it: 'Innovation and creativity only happen successfully close to markets - not in Brussels or any other central place.' Above all, it is essential to keep attention riveted on the consumer. 'The moment you focus anywhere else, you are lost. Everything that drives you must be with the sight of Mrs Jones looking you straight in the eye. If you get that right, all the rest will be in place.' If Mr Perry has his way, the Unilever of the 1990s will reach more Mrs Joneses in more countries than ever before, as its reliance on Europe - 60 per cent of its business today - is gradually diminished by faster growth in other parts of the world. He is particularly excited by prospects in South America, south-east Asia, India and China, where he is going in September for 'a first-hand look see'. China, he says, will be the biggest growth market of them all 'if things come together, if there are no more Tiananmen Squares'. Meanwhile, Unilever will keep plugging away at the more mature markets of the US, Europe and Japan. Although it has yet to show a profit in Japan, Mr Perry says the company cannot afford not to be in one of the world's most innovative markets. However, he concedes that Unilever needs to focus its operations there more selectively. His expansionist vision owes much to a 35-year career with Unilever which has included postings in the Netherlands, Thailand, Argentina and Japan. He expects his international experience - far more varied than that of Sir Michael Angus - to be a big advantage in steering Unilever through the challenges of the 1990s. A self-confessed hands-on manager, whose biggest anxiety is not to grow remote from the business, he also relishes getting out and meeting people around the world. 'I've got to be down there talking to people, walking through stores, looking at what my competitors are doing, sniffing around. Not second-guessing management, but just asking them bloody tough questions and making sure they've got sensible answers.'</p>

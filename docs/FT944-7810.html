			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Cities take the strain A business-funded international congress on the impact of cities on the environment held in Hong Kong earlier this month has highlighted the contri-bution that the private sector can make in finding solutions to environmental problems, writes Peter Knight. More than half the world's people are expected to live in towns and cities by the turn of the century. The population of Mexico City, for example, is already 15m and growing, creating significant water and air pollution problems. The congress brought together 47 speakers from different parts of the world, including a senior managing director of Mitsubishi Electric, the chief executive of the UK's nuclear power stations and a Manila nun campaigning for squatters' rights. The Prince of Wales gave the opening address. Funding for the week-long event came from 20 companies, including the John Swire group and World-Wide Shipping of Hong Kong, Mitsubishi Electric and Marubeni Corporation of Japan, and Anglian Water, Friends Provident Life Office and Nuclear Electric of the UK. 'Business has a role to play, and indeed a duty, in helping to find solutions. Conferences such as these help to focus the mind on what needs to be done and how best to achieve it,' says Bob Hawley, chief executive of Nuclear Elec-tric. The congress, which included a large contingent from China, discussed a range of issues on the environmental and human problems created by cities. The closing statement acknowledged the source of sponsorship but called on the private sector to be more active in seeking solutions. A first step would be to accept a greater civic responsib-ility. 'As a strictly private-sector initiative we could adopt a more holistic approach, which gave equal consideration to the human, scientific, technological and legislative aspects of environmental protection,' says congress organiser John Calabrini.</p>

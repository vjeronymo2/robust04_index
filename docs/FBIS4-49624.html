			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Friday [6 May]  protested to Mainland China over its restriction on the number  of Taiwan reporters that will be allowed by Beijing to cover the  trial of the four men charged with robbing and killing 24 Taiwan  tourists and eight mainland guides and crew members on Qiandao  Lake.    "It simply doesn't make any sense to impose such  restrictions," Yeh Chin-feng, vice chairwoman of the Mainland  Affairs Council, said one day after mainland authorities made  the decision to allow only 30 Taiwan journalists to cover the  case.    The four men charged in the crime -- three for murder,  arson,  and robbery and one for complicity -- will stand trial on  Tuesday.    Li Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of the Straits  Exchange Foundation, said SEF had conveyed a complaint to its  mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Straits (ARATS).    SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by  the two sides to handle private exchanges in the absence of  official contacts.    In the complaint, Li pointed out, SEF said it could not  figure out why the mainland wants to restrict the number of  Taiwan journalists when it had previously indicated Taiwan  journalists would be freely allowed to cover the case.    "That abrupt change has caused extreme discontent among the  local mass media," Li said. SEF Deputy Secretary General H. Y.  Hsu is scheduled to lead a 22-member delegation to Mainland  China on Sunday to look into the mainland's investigation into  the incident. The group will comprise relatives of the victims,  lawyers and forensic experts.    Hsu also called on the mainland to re-think its restrictions  on news coverage, saying that only by clarifying the lingering  doubts surrounding the deaths can fragile cross-strait ties be  patched up.    Beijing at first insisted that the tourists were killed in  an  accident, and refused to allow the victims' relatives to board  the pleasure boat on which the tourists perished. Taiwan  reporters were also barred from the scene.    Mainland authorities did an about-face on the issue,  however,  after Taiwan threatened to put a stop to private exchanges  between the two sides, which began in 1989. Beijing's handling  of the case touched off an uproar here, and led President Li  Teng-hui, in an unusually strongly worded statement, to call the  Beijing regime a group of "bandits," who should have been  overthrown by the people a long time ago.</p>

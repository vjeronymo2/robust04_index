			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian nickel output to remain low INTERNATIONAL NICKEL Indonesia (PT Inco), one of the world's major nickel producers, will operate significantly below its installed capacity in 1993 for the fourth year running, the company admitted yesterday. Mr Thomas Sitepu, the company's vice president, said that the second of three furnaces at its Sulawesi plant was being overhauled and would be closed until mid-year. He said production this year would be marginally higher than 1992's total of 80.1m lb (36,350 tonnes) of nickel in matte but below the plant's nameplate capacity of 100m lb. Industry officials forecast PT Inco's 1993 production at about 83m lb. Mr Sitepu said the company would operate at full capacity in 1994 but warned the third furnace would need overhauling in 1995, again limiting output. PT Inco, with its own hydroelectric power plant, remains one of the world's cheapest nickel producers, able to break even at a price of Dollars 2.45 a lb. Nickel prices last year averaged Dollars 3.38 a lb and the company made a Dollars 36.1m net profit, down from Dollars 57m in 1991. 'We run the company well but if the nickel price drops, what can I do?' said Mr Sitepu, who painted a grim picture of the world nickel industry. He forecast that world supply - including exports from Commonwealth of Independent States, China and former Comecon countries - would drop by less than 100m lb from last year's 1.5bn lb. With the nickel price languishing at about Dollars 2.81 a lb, the closure of higher cost mines would continue, he suggested. World demand (excluding the CIS, China and former Comecon countries) totalled 1.4bn lb last year, down from 1.525 lb in 1991, while stocks of more than 180m lb in London Metal Exchange registered warehouses were 'very high', he said. Cuts in defence spending would continue to hurt the industry as weapons manufacturers were big consumers of nickel.  -----------------------------------         LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS        (As at Monday's close)  ----------------------------------- tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium  +3,325 to 1,653,875 Copper     +7,675 to   327,100 Lead         -125 to   234,300 Nickel       +786 to    82,950 Zinc       +3,925 to   550,525 Tin          +725 to    17,860  -----------------------------------</p>

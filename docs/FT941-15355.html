			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Country gent in exchange of fire: Is the new chairman of the London Stock Exchange the right man for the job Mr John Kemp-Welch, the joint senior partner of Cazenove and Company whose appointment as chairman of the London Stock Exchange was confirmed this week, combines the patrician charm and driving ambition common to many partners in his stockbroking firm. He can appear a self-effacing countryman, whose main interests are walking near his Perthshire home and shooting gamebirds. But as joint senior partner since 1980 of London's most conservative and discreet stockbroker, he has shown business acumen. While rival brokers have expanded recklessly and experienced volatile swings in profits, Cazenove has developed more gradually. Its partners are proud of the fact that, as far as they know, the firm has never made a loss in any quarter in its 170-year history. In the past two years it has earned more than ever before, they say - though figures have never been published to show the firm's performance. The recent fortunes of the Stock Exchange have been less blessed. Most damaging was the cancellation last March of the Taurus project to modernise the antiquated system for settling and registering share transactions. This prompted the resignation of Mr Peter Rawlins as the exchange's chief executive. New and powerful competitive challenges to the exchange have also emerged. Continental bourses, such as in Paris, are taking active steps to regain the cross-border trade in shares - involving investors from their own countries  -that they have lost to London. Attempts are also being made by Tradepoint and other financial services companies to establish systems for buying and selling UK shares in direct competition with the exchange's own system, called Seaq. Meanwhile, the exchange has been slow to agree a plan to establish a market for shares in young companies. This market would replace the Unlisted Securities Market, which the exchange has decided to close in 1996 because it has lost its distinctive identity. So the appointment of Mr Kemp-Welch comes at a delicate moment in the exchange's 220 year history. The choice of the 57-year-old Cazenove man represents a serious desire by the exchange and its members to modernise the institution, but it also marks a recognition that some of its traditions must be preserved: it was his ability to preserve parts of Cazenove's culture while adapting the firm to unprecedented changes in market practices that has given Mr Kemp-Welch the best track record as a business manager of any recent exchange chairman. Cazenove was, for example, the only leading firm to retain a partnership structure at the time of the 'Big Bang' deregulation of the London financial market in 1986. 'I can't think of anyone better to do the job,' commented Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of Hoare Govett, one of Cazenove's rivals, whose father was Mr Kemp-Welch's predecessor at Cazenove. 'But I was quite surprised he took it.' This surprise stems from a longstanding reluctance on the part of successful brokers to become intimately involved in the management of the exchange because it was regarded as dull and boring. The chairman of a rival securities firm said: 'There used to be a widely held view that the market was pretty robust, that it would look after itself and we could just concentrate on making money. But we have all woken up to the fact that the success of each firm depends to a considerable extent on the efficiency of systems operated by the exchange.' For instance, the system for settling transactions and recording share ownership has been in need of replacement for a decade. So the collapse of the Taurus project fully to computerise the operations has been a painful lesson. It cost the exchange and its members hundreds of millions of pounds, and showed individual firms that complacency about the exchange could be dangerous. Another reminder of the need to be involved in the exchange's affairs came in November, when the ageing Seaq system for displaying share price information to members broke down for four hours when a computer component failed. The current chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who stands down on July 14, has been criticised by some City firms for such failures. He is regarded as having been slow to react to warning signs that development of the settlement system was running into trouble, and should perhaps have started work earlier on a new trading system. The chairman of a leading securities firm said: 'Poor old Andrew relied far too much on Peter Rawlins to look after the nitty-gritty.' Sir Andrew did, however, oversee the abolition of the cumbersome Stock Exchange council, comprising 32 representatives of member firms, and replaced it with a 16-member board, made up of the heads of top broking firms, a handful of exchange executives and influential representatives of banks and fund management groups which use the exchange's services. Superfluous jobs have been eliminated, as have a raft of committees and sub-committees. 'Some of the credit for that must also go to Peter Rawlins,' said Mr Kemp-Welch. The new chairman is hesitant to go into too much detail about how he sees the future of the exchange. 'I am six months away from taking up the post so my view must be broad brush,' he said. Another reason for not making too many pronouncements is that he has not as yet discussed the division of responsibilities with the new chief executive, Mr Michael Lawrence, who has been poached from the Prudential Corporation, the big insurer. 'The chairman's main role must be to make sure the board is functioning properly, that it is getting the information to allow it to make the right decisions,' Mr Kemp-Welch said, who believes the exchange has only three core functions: Organising and regulating trading in the UK's central securities market; Consolidating and improving the exchange's position in trading international securities; Acting as the listing authority for companies whose shares are traded on the exchange. This means that it is supposed to vet the auditing procedures and governance of those companies, though it has often been attacked for being reluctant to take tough action against offenders. On the other hand, Mr Kemp-Welch believes certain elements of the exchange's regulatory functions should be transferred to another authority, probably a strengthened Securities and Investments Board. These would include monitoring share transactions for signs of illegal insider dealing - the current system has been singularly unsuccessful in prosecuting suspected insider dealers. He was also noncommittal on whether to fight for a prominent role in managing or owning the new share settlement system, called Crest, which has been developed at the Bank of England's initiative since the collapse of Taurus. 'I am very cautious on commenting for political reasons,' he said. 'The exchange may have a role.' This view is contrary to that of many investors and securities firms. The highest priority, he said, is to head off the threat from Tradepoint and rival trading systems. As one former investment banker said, the exchange will 'live or die on what its customers feel about it'. If that is the key to success, then Mr Kemp-Welch could be viewed as suitable for the job, because Cazenove has been successful in generating goodwill among its clients (the companies which it advises on takeovers and for which it sells securities, and the investment institutions buying these shares). Many outsiders tend to see it as cliquey and nepotistic, however. After 13 years at the helm, Mr Kemp-Welch and his fellow senior partner Mr Anthony Forbes announced last April that they would stand down the following April. Under them, Cazenove has consolidated its position as the leading broker to UK companies. It has 222 quoted UK companies as clients, far more than any rival, a large proportion of which are part of the FT-SE 100 index of leading companies' shares. Cazenove was able to rely on its closest customers among investment institutions when it needed to raise money to preserve its independence at the time of Big Bang. A handful lent the broker Pounds 32m of capital in the form of subordinated loan stock. The interest on the stock is linked to the firm's profitability. However, the levels of profits are not disclosed, merely whether the year has been good or bad. Since it is normally a good year - in 1992 the institutions received the maximum interest rate of between 20 and 25 per cent - they have not exerted pressure for greater financial transparency. At the exchange, however, Mr Kemp-Welch will have to be far more open. The chairman typically has to be a figurehead for the securities industry and the City of London, making speeches and lobbying the government. Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Barings' merchant bank, said: 'That's the side he will find most unfamiliar.' Mr Kemp-Welch's character is marked by stubbornness: junior partners at Cazenove note that he can be rather dictatorial. At the age of six, he lost an eye. But Mr Kemp-Welch said the handicap gave him an incentive to prove himself at his public school, Winchester, and may have been what has fuelled his drive to succeed: 'The only time I missed it (the eye) was when playing racquets. However I still played.' Friends say he is a remarkable shot. He comes from a wealthy family - whose fortune stems from ownership, during the 19th century of the Schweppes' patented process for putting fizz into soft drinks - and his father was the second most powerful partner at Cazenove after Antony Hornby in the immediate aftermath of the second world war. Though all Cazenove partners have the right to introduce one son or daughter into the firm, Mr Kemp-Welch's father would not bring him on board until he had proved he could survive elsewhere. So in 1954, at the age of 18, he became a messenger at Hoare &amp; Co, working for the most aggressive stockbroker of the time, Kit Hoare. He joined Cazenove in 1959. More than 30 years later, Cazenove remains a uniquely English institution. Its senior partners are educated at just two schools, Eton and Winchester, and came from a handful of families. While securities markets have become more international, it has opened foreign offices only gradually. It has no offices at all in continental Europe. Though this means that Cazenove has avoided the overheads carried by more expansionist firms, such as S G Warburg, it has also meant it is tarnished by a 'Little England' image. Rivals say in the long term its prospects are limited by its concentration on domestic business. In that sense, the choice of Mr Kemp-Welch as Stock Exchange chairman is a risk. The future prosperity of the exchange and its members depend to an significant extent on its ability to serve continental investors - and the Cazenove charm will be far less relevant when it comes to meeting this challenge than an ability to understand their needs.</p>

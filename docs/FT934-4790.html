			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Technology: Charged up for battle - The war between re-usable and disposable batteries is getting fiercer Christmas is coming and the credit card bill is getting fat. Come New Year and the expense will continue with the never-ending demand for batteries to power games computers, remote control racing cars or the latest in walking, talking dolls. Increasingly advanced technologies and the growing demand for 'green' products, however, means that 1994 could be the year when it becomes fashionable to recharge spent batteries rather than consigning them to the dustbin. Traditionally, rechargeable batteries have commandeered just a fraction of the market, 2 per cent of consumer battery sales in volume terms in 1992. The result is that 12bn batteries every year end up in landfill sites worldwide. Several products launched this year have not only fuelled consumer interest, but sparked a war of words in the seemingly staid world of the battery maker. The third largest US battery maker, Rayovac, which owns the Vidor battery company in the UK, has thrown down the gauntlet with Renewal, a re-usable alkaline battery system which will be on sale in the US for Christmas. Until now only nickel-cadmium batteries have been re-usable - not alkaline batteries, which make up the bulk of the disposable battery market from manufacturers such as Duracell or Ever Ready. The renewable alkaline batteries can be used at least 25 times, but only the special Rayovac brand can be used in the Renewal charger and they cost about twice as much to buy as disposable or 'primary' batteries. The two Renewal chargers costs Dollars 15 (Pounds 10) and Dollars 30. The Renewal batteries have the advantage over their nickel-cadmium counterparts that they can be charged to 1.5 volts - the same as primary batteries. They are also ready charged on the shop shelves, so desperate parents can slot them into battery-powered toys without waiting hours. And there is no 'memory' problem, where a battery will only fully recharge if the battery is completely spent. Rayovac believes a further advantage is that they lose power gradually, so that consumers are warned that they need to charge the battery as the tape in the personal stereo begins to slur. Nickel-cadmium batteries lose power suddenly. Manufacturers of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, such as Ever Ready, which is the market leader in the UK, believe their technology is still the best on offer. They hit back at detractors who say that because nickel-cadmium batteries supply a constant 1.2 volts they are unsatisfactory for use in the most power-hungry toys, such as video games machines. Both disposable batteries and rechargeable alkaline ones begin to lose their power as soon as they are used, so it is not long before the power drops below 1.2 volts, they point out. Each nickel-cadmium battery can be recharged 1,000 times, making them very economical. Japanese electronics specialist Panasonic is so convinced of the future of rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries in Europe that it has recently launched its first rechargeable product, called Rechargeable Nick. Two R6 Rechargeable Nick batteries, say Panasonic, will power a personal stereo for three years, provided that the batteries are removed and recharged every night. The alternative is to use 540 disposable batteries. A more controversial method of recharging batteries was launched in the UK in August when Kleeneze Holdings, which produces the Innovations catalogue found in many of the UK's Sunday newspapers. The company introduced a machine which recharges all the commonly available primary batteries - alkaline or zinc chloride. Only the button types which power watches and cameras cannot be put in the Battery Manager. Although the Battery Manager was first on to the market, Andy White, product development manager at the Innovations Group, says that there are 40 or 50 international patents outstanding on similar developments. Most battery chargers work in a similar way, essentially a technology devised in the 1940s. When a battery is used the metal from the electrode is dissolved in the electrolyte and dissipated. To recharge the battery the metal particles are plated back on to the electrode - in the same way as silver plating cutlery. The variations in the way the machines work centre around the speed and power at which the batteries are recharged and the control mechanisms used to prevent the batteries exploding. The control mechanisms in the latest chargers incorporate microchips to ensure consistency. Reaction to the Battery Manager from primary battery suppliers was swift. A spokeswoman for Ever Ready says the company is still concerned about the safety of recharging primary batteries which are sealed, so preventing the escape of gases produced in the process. Consumers who re-charge their Ever Ready primary batteries in a Battery Manager automatically invalidate their guarantee if things go wrong, she says. 'Once a year someone in the world claims to have found a way of recharging primary batteries,' says a sceptical Peter Galazka, European marketing manager for Duracell. 'Innovations is the latest in a long line of them.' Galazka is also concerned that the Innovations product could cause confusion and persuade consumers to recharge primary batteries in machines designed to charge nickel-cadmium batteries. That could easily result in the batteries leaking and in extreme cases, exploding. Nevertheless, in the four months since its launch, sales of the Battery Manager have been brisk, with 200,000 chargers ordered. Previous to that, by comparison, Ever Ready reckons that only 66,000 nickel cadmium battery chargers in total were sold in the UK. Innovations has been a victim of its own success, however. Sales of the Battery Manager have been so brisk that Innovations has only been able to ship 70 per cent of the chargers ordered, says White. Whether the new breed of battery rechargers will dent the ever-growing market for primary batteries is debatable. Galazka believes that consumers will be disappointed with the performance of recharged batteries, in particular about the time each battery lasts between charges. All the battery and recharger manufacturers acknowledge that the biggest problem is consumer inertia and the 'hassle factor' as Galazka puts it. 'Actually,' says the Ever Ready spokeswoman, 'people are just lazy.'</p>

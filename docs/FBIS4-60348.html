			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Supporter of Terrorism"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. State Department recently published a  report in which it accused seven countries as the main  supporters of terrorism.    The U.S. authorities have included Iran among the seven  countries, and have levelled their strongest attack against the  Islamic Republic of Iran.    The report claims Iran trains what the American authorities  call fundamentalist terrorists, and dispatches them to the other  Islamic countries.    A cursory glance will reveal that all of the 7 countries  included in the list are those Third World countries that are  not prepared to give in to the American global superpower role,  and oppose Washington's expansionist policies.    CIA has been the greatest center for training terrorists,  and  it has frequently resorted to devilish plots such as coup  d'etats including the 1953 coup in Iran and the coup engineered  against the legitimate government of Dr. Allende in Chile in the  70s -- and assassination of numerous political figures around  the world.    In fact coup d'etats and assassinations have been among the  basic components of the American foreign policy in the decades  after World War II.    The relation between the American government and the  terrorist groups is an undeniable fact. How else could one  explain the meeting of the American Vice-President with a  terrorist group whose acts of terrorism have been proved on the  basis of evidences provided by the U.S. Government itself.    Thus it is quite obvious that Washington's attempt in  accusing Iran and six other countries of giving support to  terrorist groups is only meant to divert world public opinion  from its own activities.    Syria is also accused of support for terrorists mainly in  connection with its activities in Lebanon. But political  observers have no doubt that this is a clear case of blackmail.  In other words Syria will automatically be crossed off the list  of governments supporting terrorism as soon as Syria has  accepted the Zionist aggression in the Golan Heights.    So on the eve of Christopher's new round of trip to the  Middle East with the mission of putting pressure on Syria and  making it accept the imposed peace arrangements, it is  understandable why Washington brings out such accusatory reports.</p>

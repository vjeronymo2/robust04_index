Saudi Arabia's cold reception for King Husayn on his first  visit since July 1990 before the Gulf crisis was reflected in  Saudi newspapers, which ignored the trip altogether.    The Jordanian monarch was taken aback and cut short his  visit, during which he had also been expected to visit Moslem  holy sites in nearby Medina, an Arab diplomat said, declining to  be named.    Arab diplomats had said the two monarchs were to meet in  Mecca, western Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd was also staying.  But neither Saudi nor Jordanian officials confirmed that such  an encounter was scheduled.    And yet the Saudi monarch late Tuesday received two  governors  from the Emirates, Shaykh Saqir Bin-Muhammad al-Qasimi and  Shaykh Hamid al-Nu'aymi, who were also on pilgrimage to mark the  final days of the fasting month of Ramadan.    On arrival in Jeddah earlier the same day, King Husayn was  greeted at the airport by the deputy emir of Mecca, Prince Sa'ud  Bin-'Abd-al-Muhsin. The same official saw him off.    In Amman, a senior official in Jordan's royal court played  down the snub but Western diplomats criticized Riyadh's attitude.    "The aim of the king's visit to Mecca was purely religious"  and no request was made for a meeting, the official said,  declining to be named. However, "a gesture of courtesy (from  King Fahd) would obviously have been welcome."    But a Western diplomat said the Saudi monarch's attitude was  "an insult which shows the Saudis in an extremely bad light."    "By travelling to Saudi Arabia, King Husayn held out his  hand  to King Fahd who turned it down, contrary to the traditions laid  down for a head of state and Arab customs," another diplomat  said.    King Husayn's last visit came just two weeks before the  Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.    Amman-Riyadh ties soured amid Saudi charges that Jordan  backed Iraqi President Saddam Husayn during the Gulf crisis.  King Husayn also opposed the US-led military campaign which  expelled Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991.    A Mecca encounter during Ramadan with King Fahd, the  custodian of Islam's holiest sites in western Saudi Arabia, was  expected to clear the way for a normalization, Arab diplomats  said.    Since the Gulf war, Amman has sought to resume normal  contacts with Riyadh, which had punished Jordan by halting its  annual financial aid of 200 million dollars and oil shipments,  and closing its markets to Jordanian goods.    After King Fahd sent his Washington ambassador to see King  Husayn recovering from an operation in a US hospital in August  1992, Jordan's monarch moved swiftly to announce that their  misunderstanding was almost over.    But the Saudis -- whose Amman ambassador has yet to return  to  his post after having been recalled in October 199O -- insist on  a public apology from Jordan for its stand on the Gulf crisis, a  demand which King Husayn has criticized.    An Arab diplomat pointed out that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat,  who was also snubbed for three years because of his pro-Iraqi  sympathies, managed to meet King Fahd during a similar  pilgrimage to Mecca in January.    But the start of a Palestinian-Saudi normalization only came  after PLO officials made their apologies to Riyadh, which before  the Gulf crisis was a key financial backer with its oil wealth.    For Jordan, ties with Saudi Arabia have traditionally been  complicated because of old rivalries between the two ruling  families.    While King Fahd is custodian of Mecca and Medina, King  Husayn  is a grandson of the Sharif of Mecca, Husayn, who was chased out  of the Hejaz in the 1920s by the Sa'uds after his Hashemi family  had ruled in Mecca since the 11th century.    Only last month, Amman brokered a peace deal to resolve the  political crisis in Yemen, a country which Riyadh considers to  be in its sphere of influence.</p>

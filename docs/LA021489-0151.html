			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> N.Y. ASSEMBLY REJECTS HONOR FOR REAGANS  </P> <P> New York's Democrat-controlled Assembly rejected, after rancorous debate, a  resolution honoring former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, for  their eight years in the White House.  </P> <P> "He made selfishness the national byword," said Democratic Assemblyman Anthony  Genovesi. "He made it legitimate for people to say 'I don't give a damn, I'm  not my brother's keeper.' "  </P> <P> Genovesi's remarks, which drew hisses from Republicans, echoed other Democrats  who said Reagan's America left out the homeless, the poor and organized labor.  </P> <P> Monday's vote was 78 to 58. Only two Democrats voted for the resolution.  </P> <P> The resolution said "mere words cannot express the debt owed nor may brief  phrases make manifest the leadership rendered."  </P></p>

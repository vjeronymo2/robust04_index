Banking and law enforcement authorities last week conceded  that dirty money did enter the banks' washing machine.  Officials, however, attributed blame to what they say are gaping  loopholes in existing regulations--mainly the failure of banks  to share information, the failure to freeze accounts pending an  enquiry to determine the source of income and the introduction  by some banks of "exemption lists of preferred clients."    Preferred customers are not required to sign the necessary  declaration forms for deposits exceeding TT$10,000 per  individual and TT$40,000 per company.    Bankers, moving independently of government, last November  signed a money laundering agreement making it mandatory for  employees to report suspicious deposits, sale of travellers  cheques and wire transfers. These reports must be made to the  Office of Strategic Services (OSS), headed by Lance Selman.    Several bankers, requesting anonymity, said they have not  only reported suspicious transactions to the authorities but  have turned down accounts, some well over TT$10 million.    Victor Mouttet, a commercial and retail manager at Republic  Bank, who monitors banking records on a daily basis, said  Republic lost two substantial accounts this year because it  demanded transparency records from the depositors in question.    One individual account was in the vicinity of $200,000 to  $300,000 and the other, he said, was by a company in the sum of  TT$10 million.    Mouttet said reports were made to the authorities but  Republic has had no feedback on where the investigation, if any  had been undertaken, has led to.    "We just go as far as putting them (police) on notice," he  said in an interview last week.    Nearly all of the six commercial banks said they have  reported suspicious transactions to the police but checks with  the authorities revealed that there has been not a single arrest  related to money laundering or questionable deposits.    Deputy Commissioner of Crime Selwyn confirmed that there  have been no drug laundering arrests. He said if there is an  investigation underway, he is unaware of it.    The November 1992 agreement, which is self-regulatory,  depends entirely on bankers' discretion to report the movement  of large deposits or transactions to law enforcement authorities.    Bankers themselves said the agreement is difficult to  police.  Some said they don't know when they should make a report. They  said it was difficult, if not, "indelicate" to subject everyone  including known and trusted customers to transparency  requirements, particularly "eminent" and "respected" business  people.    Big name business clients, they said, often make large  deposits of varying sums of money and are annoyed by attempts to  establish transparency.    Bankers and law enforcement authorities were reluctant to  give even a rough estimate as to how much dirty money they  suspect were laundered following liberalisation of foreign  exchange controls.    Finance Minister Wendell Mottley, in a post-floating of the  TT currency address to a PNM party meeting in May, said that  "millions and millions of U.S. dollars which had been stored in  jars, pitchoil tins, safety deposit mattresses and in pillows"  found its way into the commercial banking system. Bankers,  however, say the majority of this money--about TT$80  million--included the return of capital flight.    Suresh Maharaj, managing director of Citibank, said his bank  has lost accounts because of requests for information on the  source of deposits.    He, however, noted that Citibank, in addition to local  banking regulations, is subject to stringent US controls and  checks by US Federal Reserve Inspectors.    Some bankers said less ill-gotten gains are entering the  banking system and are in fact being traded on the open market  for the purpose of luxury items such as cars, real estate,  jewelry and pleasure boats.    Asked whether the illegal money would not enter the banking  system at some point in time--either by the car dealer or real  estate agent, assuming they are paid in cash--one banker said:  "Yes," but noted that "it may be that the bank is in the habit  of handling large cash deposits from a particular car dealer so,  no, a large cash deposit may not necessarily arouse suspicion or  be reported to anyone."    Frank Mouttet, President of the Chamber of Commerce said he  was not at all satisfied with the present drug money laundering  regulations.    Attorney Douglas Mendes says it is not enough to just ask  the  banks to divulge information on the movement of currency,  transfers and deposits over a certain sum.    He said law enforcers should be given the authority to  freeze  accounts until they are able to determine the source of income  and whether taxes have been paid on it.    Tom Cash, special agent of the US Drug Enforcement  Administration Miami Office with responsibility for the  Caribbean, said last month that attempts by the DEA to follow  the trail of laundered drug money have been frustrated by the  failure of banking officials to volunteer information.    The DEA office last year captured US$279 million from drug  raids and busted money laundering activities in the Miami  district alone. Cash said this figure could have been  significantly higher had there been more co-operation from  banking officials.    He said it was the DEA experience that assurances made by  bankers to volunteer information was a myth and warned that  governments should watch closely bankers who declare that they  don't need regulatory laws. Cash named bankers and lawyers as  the people who profit most from drug money laundering.    Bankers countercharged that if blame is to be apportioned it  should be laid at the door of law enforcement authorities.    Bankers argued that the authorities know who the dealers are  but for their own private reasons prefer to shake down "the  small fellas on the block."</p>

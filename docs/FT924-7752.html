			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Revenue flop may cost 1,000 jobs UP TO 1,000 staff may lose their jobs at the Inland Revenue in the next few months because demand by the public for two tax initiatives has been lower than expected. In spite of the Revenue's first and highly-ambitious advertising campaign, which has cost it nearly Pounds 11m over the last two years, demand for the services of its claims offices around the country has failed to reach anticipated levels. On Thursday evening the Revenue issued a statement that the operations would be reorganised, with a reduction in staff and a 'rationalisation' of offices. The plan should save about Pounds 10m a year in salaries. By the end of the financial year in April 1,000 jobs will go, resulting in the closure of four offices and reallocation of space, since a further 15 offfices will no longer carry out repayment work. Up to 400 jobs will be created in the five remaining offices - Belfast, Bootle, Glenrothes, Leicester and St Austell. But unions expect that about 600 jobs will go from the Revenue, in spite of attempts to avoid compulsory redundancies. The Revenue's claims offices have dealt with two types of repayment demands created by programmes in the last two years. The first is for tax credits on share dividends from up to 2.5m married women below the tax threshold - claims which have been possible since the introduction of independent taxation in 1990. The second is for an estimated 15m non-taxpayers claiming back tax on bank and building society interest, which since last year has been paid net of basic rate tax to all but those who specially register to receive interest gross. More than 7m people have now registered to receive interest gross, although according to a recent Revenue survey about 1m of these were not eligible. The Revenue estimated that there would be about 8m claims - covering all of the remaining 15m non-taxpayers who were not registered and eligible for claims. In the event it now expects no more 2m claims this year. Officials concede that the level of response has been disappointing. They spent Pounds 7m on a television campaign early last year to highlight the interest repayment programme and Pounds 3m on leaflets. They spent almost Pounds 1m on newspaper advertisements early this year, and plan another campaign early next year. No one knows exactly what went wrong, although among the suggestions are ignorance of the programmes, apathy, a belief that repayments amount to charity, or a desire not to draw attention. The Revenue says it has never before undertaken such a significant campaign, and so it had no comparisons against which to measure the response. One official said: 'We have to plan on the basis that everyone will claim.' That is little consolation for those losing their jobs. Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation, said: 'We're sorry to see offices being closed and even more sorry to see jobs being lost. But these are just the first of many. The government is embarking on a major reorganisation which will reduce the services available to taxpayers.'</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Aids epidemic poised to sweep the developing world: 'In some Ugandan villages there is no one between 20 and 40, only children and grandparents' IN the red light districts of Ivory Coast's capital, Abidjan, the virus that causes Aids is running rampant. Among prostitutes on the city's streets 88 per cent are HIV-positive. Among their clients, who pay less than Dollars 4 a time, only a quarter are willing to use condoms, the best method of preventing sexually transmitted diseases. The effect of such levels of infection among prostitutes is wreaking a devastating effect on Abidjan's more general population. One in six pregnant women is now HIV-positive. Most say they have slept only with their husbands. Although HIV and Aids remain a significant problem in the western world, delegates at the annual Aids conference in Berlin this week were repeatedly told the epidemic is going to hit the developing world disproportionately hard. About 90 per cent of the 14m people estimated by the World Health Organisation to be infected by the virus live in developing countries. It calculates most of the 40m people infected by the end of the decade will be in the developing world. The sheer scale of the problem in Africa, Asia and Latin America requires the world's attention. Suggestions that the scale of the epidemic in Africa has been exaggerated were dismissed by the continent's health workers. 'It is merely cynical to say there is no epidemic. In some villages in Uganda there are no people between 20 and 40, only children and their grandparents,' argues Mr Elhadj Assy, an executive of the international council of Aids service organisations. 'It is time to recognise that the virus, illness and epidemic exist.' But although the prevalence of Aids is well documented in Africa, the most rapid increases in the disease are occurring in other developing regions. 'While Africa suffers the explosion of Aids cases as a result of infections ten years ago, it is in south Asia and south-east Asia that we are seeing a rapid increase in infection,' warned Dr Michael Merson, director of WHO's global programme on Aids. WHO estimates there are 1.5m infected by HIV in south-east Asia, and 1m in south Asia, mostly in India. 'The growth in south and south-east Asia can only be described as explosive,' warned Dr Merson. 'In Thailand, for example, in early 1990 there were more than 50,000 infected people. By late 1992, there had been a ten-fold increase with an estimated 450,000 infected,' he said. Studies in Thailand's northern districts show that 7 per cent of military recruits were HIV-positive. In Bangkok, the Siriraj hospital reports the number of pregnant women infected increased by 60 per cent between the last quarter of 1991 and the same three months in 1992. In India, too, the rate of increase of infection is alarming. More than 30 per cent of prostitutes in Bombay are HIV-positive, and the prevalence in the general population has increased from 1.67 cases per 1,000 in 1991 to 23.07 per 1,000 last year. 'The epidemic has the potential to reach unprecedented levels in India,' warned Dr Shiv Lal, a director of India's national Aids control organisation. The epidemic is striking hardest in those countries least equipped to cope with the disease. In many of these countries primary health care is minimal and services have been overwhelmed. WHO calculates that in some African cities, up to 70 per cent of hospital beds are taken up by patients with Aids-related diseases. The Zambian health service, for example, has been engulfed by the demands of the country's 200,000 patients with Aids or Aids-related diseases. The annual cost of treating them is Dollars 64.4m, money that the country can ill afford. In some African states, lack of resources is assisting transmission of HIV. Delegates were told that in Cameroon there were insufficient funds to establish safe supplies of HIV-negative blood. As many as a quarter of patients, unable to pay for the blood offered to them to be tested, accepted potentially contaminated blood. Scientists at the conference admitted the chances of finding a cure or vaccine to combat HIV in the medium term were remote. The chances of finding anything that was affordable for developing nations was even less likely. WHO believes the main priority must be to prevent the epidemics in the developing world spiralling out of control. It has called for Dollars 2.5bn a year to invested in anti-HIV programmes in developing countries  - a 10-fold increase on current spending. The organisation calculates this could bring Dollars 90bn of savings in direct and indirect costs by the end of the decade, by preventing 4m infections in Africa, a similar number in Asia and 1m in Latin America. Dr Merson claims: 'The initiative would provide a significant return in financial terms, but above all an incalculable yield in diminished human suffering.'</p>

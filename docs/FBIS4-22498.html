			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Grukalenko: "I Am Chasing After a </F> Locomotive, Chained to it by Handcuffs"; foreword by Eduard  Mokhorov, correspondent of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA, Bryansk]    [Text] Almost 7 years ago our newspaper (at that time  SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA INDUSTRIYA) published "Notes of a  Businessman." Anatoliy Nikolayevich Grukalenko, a young  entrepreneur, was their author. At that time (1987) the concept  of "private initiative" was almost abusive. Grukalenko's frank  account of some secrets of the Uyut Cooperative's commercial  activity produced a shock in society.    Fellow-citizens brought up in the spirit of their times saw  in the activity of the beginner cooperative owner an  encroachment on the economic and moral principles of socialism  and an insult to public morality. Grukalenko, I want to remind  readers of this, bought at the state price a large batch of  sports shirts, which were lying on the counter, improved the  unmarketable goods, putting a striking design on them, and very  quickly, without any trouble, sold all the items on the kolkhoz  market--at a price triple that of the state.    Anatoliy Nikolayevich received a verdict from enraged  readers: He is a speculator and a swindler. One high-ranking  party official was outraged more than others. True, by the irony  of fate this custodian of principles subsequently became an  exchange dealer.    After "Notes of a Businessman" A. Grukalenko appeared in the  pages of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA more than once. I read his notes and  involuntarily compare many of his plans, thoughts, and hopes of  those days with today. How naive all of us were in the sacred  belief in the force of private initiative during those first  years of Gorbachev's perestroyka! And how many honest, noble  impulses were buried during the subsequent era of cynical  political mongering, money-grubbing, and large-scale shock  therapy.    Having made money on sports shirts, the cooperative owner  gave the entire profit, down to the last kopeck, for charitable  purposes. Grukalenko conducted the experiment with sports shirts  by no means for the sake of personal gain, but only in order to  force the local sewing factory, which, according to the plan,  produced on a large-scale goods that no one needed, to operate  differently.    I confess that today "Notes of a Businessman" evoke in me  sometimes nostalgic feelings about the lost illusions and  sometimes also a smile. I recall the enthusiasm with which he  dealt with the problem of the processing of dumped industrial  waste. He established a semiprimitive enterprise and engaged in  the manufacture of jewelry and all sorts of other trinkets. He  promised readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA: "In a few years we will  fill counters with goods that are not even available in the  West."    A very self-confident young man--you and I would say today.  In fact, in 1987 the beginner entrepreneur boldly undertook many  risky projects--he believed in his star. He did not want to know  anything about Marxist initial capital accumulation. One day in  the morning he came out to the street. He saw under his feet a  kopeck dropped by someone. He picked it up and it dawned upon  him: "Here is my capital. I will go to the bank, open my  personal account, and this kopeck will be my first deposit. You  are laughing? Never mind, in 2 or 3 years this kopeck will grow  into millions. I will have my own business and will open my own  factories and stores. I will become a rich man."    I carefully followed our debutant entrepreneur. Yes,  according to many external criteria, Anatoliy Nikolayevich  turned out to be a successful businessman. He tested himself in  many fields. He was one of the first to become a broker on the  commodity-stock exchange. Then he was co-founder of almost the  first provincial private bank in the country. Together with  other enthusiasts he established the All-Russian Union of  Cooperative Owners and then the Congress of Business Circles and  the Union of Entrepreneurs. He founded a network of small  enterprises. He participated in the establishment of the  Niva-Kapital Check Investment Fund.    The kopeck once found on the street grew into rubles and  turned into quite a sizable initial capital. Then there was  privatization--breath-taking opportunities for an enterprising  person. Grukalenko decided not to miss his chance. Having  overtaken his competitors, he leased a barbershop with the right  of a subsequent buyout. He acquired rights to a bakery. He  leased a store temporarily and opened his own office. Finally,  he got the opportunity to become the owner of a large restaurant.    But today, not without a sigh, Grukalenko says: "Then people  not only listened to our opinion, but also took it into  consideration."    An entire era lies between "then" and "today." Russia got to  know inflation and economic ruin. Millions of people were left  out in the cold and lost their secure future, their savings, and  sometimes even their homeland.    It seems, however, that the universal impoverishment has not  affected our hero. He looks at the future boldly and confidently  and his accumulations, being constantly in motion according to  the well-known formula "commodity-money-commodity," are not  devalued in the abyss of inflation, but, conversely, increase.  According to all criteria, Grukalenko is precisely the person on  whom reformer Gaydar counted and whom he cherished in words.  Yes, incidentally, Anatoliy Nikolayevich established the  Foundation for Support for Reforms and the President in his  native Bryansk approximately 1 year ago.    We have not seen each other for a long time. Not only our  paths, but also our views of many things in this life, have  parted. Therefore, I was somewhat surprised when Grukalenko  himself telephoned me a few days ago.    "I would like to tell you a little about my life," he said  straight to the point.    We met. In my opinion, his story will be interesting to  readers of RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. I think that it will also be of  interest to politicians who failed, but understood nothing.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   In 1992, when privatization began, I decided to invest my  savings in a barbershop and a bakery. Having paid a sizable sum,  I acquired the right to lease these facilities. The starting  price of the bakery was 23,000 rubles. However, it cost me  100-fold more, because there were many competitors at the  auction. And so, I bought a scale, a counter, shelves, and a  signboard for 2.2 million rubles. The store itself did not  become my property, but the right to trade there was sold to me.    Then an opportunity arose to acquire a restaurant not on a  leasing basis, but for my ownership. This cost me more than 3  million rubles.    A restaurant is a large enterprise. We service about 2,000  children with school lunches. There are also ordinary guests.  However, in order that this public catering establishment may  bring not only losses, but also income, I decided to open an  evening coffee house there.    It seemed to me that, having finally become a real estate  owner, I would acquire complete independence and would have an  interesting and profitable business. I recall that in 1987 Artem  Tarasov hurled a popular phrase, which the entire country  repeated after him: "Our Soviet system has come to the point  where I, as a cooperative owner, cannot be dismissed from my job  even by the country's president."    I can confirm: According to the law, neither President  Yeltsin nor the local governor can deprive me of the rights of  an owner. Everything seems to be clear as far as the president  is concerned. However, there are forces, which are not even  under his control.    Alas, I did not become an independent owner with full  rights,  as this was assumed at one time. As soon as a well-to-do person  acquires an enterprise for ownership, he himself immediately  becomes the object of solicitations and often of persecution on  the part of a large, well-organized, greedy corporation of  officials. At all times this mob of inspecting, controlling, and  supervising officials lived rather well and fed on facilities  under state ownership. It became so intertwined with these  facilities and got so accustomed to considering them almost its  own personal profitable property that even under privatization  conditions it did not intend to part with the unwritten rights  and privileges.    Before me my restaurant functioned in very good order for  more than 20 years, but only after it became private property,  suddenly, it was discovered that as a facility it operated with  gross deviations from existing rules. Almost on the first day I  was told that, according to instructions of the  sanitary-epidemiological inspectorate, fire safety, and tax and  other services and according to decisions and instructions of  municipal authorities, this public catering enterprise must be  closed immediately. It turned out that partitions, windows,  walls, and doors were not built properly. Electric wiring was  not good enough and the roof was not made from the right  material.    I, the owner, was very quickly convinced that an official  from any department (there are a dozen such departments) at any  moment and for any reason could issue an order to close my  enterprise and even to alienate it as an object of ownership. I,  as an owner and employer, could not even appeal the decision of  a certain official in court. And if I tried to seek the truth,  next time even more devastating, new fines would be imposed on  me.    The sanitary epidemiologist's assistant makes a decision to  close the restaurant. This lady acts according to the  instruction. Previously, when the enterprise belonged to the  state, for some reason she did not pay attention to this  instruction. And it was of interest to no one that during the  stoppage of the enterprise closed owing to an official's  arbitrary rule the owner incurred huge financial losses on the  maintenance of the building and on municipal and other services.  Having no income, he paid wages and taxes.    Following the first wave of inspectors the tax service pays  a  visit. It checks the activity of the enterprise during the  previous year, when the restaurant was still municipal property.  The previous director and accountant have long been dismissed  and the new administration and owner are just beginning to get  to the heart of the matter. However, no one is worried about  this. In reports of more than 1 year's standing the official  detects a mistake in the writing off of transport costs and  immediately a fine of 600,000 rubles is imposed on me. I try to  explain that I have nothing to do with the activity of the  previous administration, because 1 year ago I was not the owner  of this property. The inspector goes into indescribable  raptures: "Ah, it turns out that you are a private enterprise.  Then, in addition to the fine, you will have to pay another  200,000."    After several days a new commission came and discovered that  not long before privatization restaurant workers received a  bonus of 3,000 rubles each, but deductions into the pension fund  were not made from this sum. A fine of half a million rubles was  imposed on me, the owner. After a few days I was invited to the  rayon administrative commission. I went with the hope: They will  understand and will revoke the unjust decision. However, they  summoned me and the restaurant director for a totally different  purpose. Both of us were handed fine notices on account of the  same sanitary state. I and the director were fined the  equivalent of 20 salaries, that is, 290,000 each. "But I have  already been fined half a million," I tried to explain myself.  In response I heard: "The oblast authority fined you, but the  rayon budget must also be replenished."    In the first 2 months alone the restaurant brought me fines  amounting to 3 million. Not to mention the fact that I bought a  hopelessly unprofitable facility and realized that at first I  would have to invest a great deal of money in this production  unit with the income obtained from other enterprises. I planned  to make major repairs and to renovate equipment and the  interior. But the excessive, at times openly fiscal, fines  wrecked all plans.    I realize that both the rayon and the city budget are  supported by these very fines and without these proceeds there  will be nothing with which to pay wages and bonuses to the  officials themselves. In Russia their apparatus is growing to  the size of a malignant tumor. Previously, deductions from the  profit of plants and factories were the sources of replenishment  of the budget. Today, however, state and privatized enterprises  curtail production. Consequently, the private entrepreneur can  be the source of replenishment of the budget. And so, they begin  to rob our brother blind.    Our ruin is of absolutely no interest to anyone. My accounts  are in the records. For the second month I cannot pay wages to  my workers. However, this, too, is of no interest to officials.    In addition to the army of supervising bureaucrats, we are  being overpowered by municipal service enterprises, as well as  all kinds of firms and offices, without the knowledge of which  the entrepreneur does not dare to take a step. These are  monopolists setting enslaving prices of services, which at times  the real estate owner, possibly, did not suspect before. For  example, one enterprise for the entire city has the right to  service cash registers and to issue a certificate concerning  their installation. This sphere of activity is a gold mine. If a  bakery does not have a cash register, the first tax inspector  will impose a fine of 3 million on the owner. Taking advantage  of the opportunity, monopolists inflate prices of cash registers  to 600,000 rubles. Another several hundreds of thousands must be  paid for a certificate for the installation of a register. They  will not even come to make the installation for you, but you  will have to pay in full for the certificate. Whereas previously  my barbershop brought at least some income, now it must work for  half a year for the cash register alone.    Of course, monopolists live in grand style at our expense.  Their workers receive bigger salaries than those of ministers  and almost every month make "business trips" to foreign health  resorts. But I, in order to make both ends meet, am beginning to  reduce work places and to lower people's wages. In my restaurant  people earn only from 16,000 to 37,000. Moreover, my personal  income, despite the fact that I work 14 to 18 hours daily, have  no days off, and have not had a leave since 1987, hardly totals  00,000 [as published] rubles. If we are to believe official  statistics, this is much less than the average wages throughout  Russia.    At one time, having embarked on private entrepreneurship, I  set for myself the goal of becoming a proprietor, an owner  independent of the state and society. Was it realized? Formally,  the goal, seemingly has been reached, but, in fact, I do not  feel that I am an owner or a free person.    Seemingly, privatization has been carried out in our  country.  Seemingly, private enterprise has finally appeared. In our  country, however, the official bureaucratic state apparatus, not  people from the "middle" class, who with their labor and  enterprise have accumulated and saved up some capital, has  become the true, real proprietor and owner of everything that is  called real estate. As a rule, officials' actions are not  subject to an appeal in court.    Not only the state budget is being replenished at the  expense  of such business people like I. We might as well admit, everyone  wants to live and officials go away from inspections by no means  with empty bags. This is customary. From the experience of many  entrepreneurs, my acquaintances, I know: There are many forms of  hidden extortion. Everything seems like some ritual sanctified  by the traditions of Russian hospitality. Victims do not protest  requisitions. They are even grateful to those that take them.  However, the takers themselves, in order that they may not be  suspected of self-interest, having taken, drunk, eaten, and  carried them away, are not ashamed to write a negative report  and to exact a fine: The pike is in the sea in order to keep the  crucian awake.    The law reads that the entrepreneur himself is responsible  for his activity and, consequently, has the right to  independently establish the procedure and conditions of work at  his enterprise. However, here, too, I, as the owner, am tied  hand and foot by instructions, orders, and the official's  personal benevolence and mood.    In order to open an evening coffee house in my restaurant, I  wasted a month on all kinds of formal agreements. As it turned  out, officials have the right to impose their terms on me: How I  should work, what staff I should have, and in what I can and  cannot trade. All the rules of the game, including the recording  and reporting procedure, change almost every week.    Next, let us take the commitment to lessees, which  guarantees  the right to buy out an enterprise within 1 year. A year passed,  but instructions about the buyout procedure did not arrive. In  the meantime rents rose significantly. Entrepreneurs, not  through their fault, cannot become owners of leased enterprises.  It is advantageous for officials to maltreat us. We, nominal  owners, are in permanent bondage to them.    Nor did the party nomenklatura, which during these stormy  years displayed a surprising capacity for mimicry, lose its  positions. As soon as the party lost its power, they appeared at  the exchange. When the exchange ceased to be a source of income,  everyone moved to banks, to the tax police, to the pension fund,  and to other soft jobs.    I look back at past years. I did not take a single kopeck  from the state, but conscientiously replenished the treasury,  paying taxes. I have created about 50 work places and each of my  workers supports a pensioner. Moreover, together we support more  than one highly paid official, who pokes fun at us.    However, I am tired of fighting a system, which has quickly  established itself on the wreckage of the old society, has  already managed to utterly ruin the people, and now is also  getting to me. There is one prospect before me: I will reduce  work places and am already beginning to curtail business. At any  moment I can be declared bankrupt and everything that I have  acquired can be taken away from me.    Will other stronger and more prosperous people replace me?  Yes, there are such people. I know that these people are not  burdened by my concerns about how to make ends meet. Those that  take away abroad tons and cubic meters of the riches of Russian  land do not know my problems. Perhaps they are Russia's true  masters?</p>

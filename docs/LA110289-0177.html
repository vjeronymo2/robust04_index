			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE UNIVERSITY TRUSTEES BOOST TUITION BY 4.8%  </P> <P> California State University trustees approved a 4.8% tuition increase Wednesday  for most of the system's nearly 370,000 students in a move expected to generate  $16 million in new revenue.  </P> <P> CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said the hike was consistent with the Maddy Act  of 1984 that provides for fee increases in line with rising costs.  </P> <P> Fees will climb from $708 to $744 a year for students taking more than six  units. Students taking fewer than that will face an $18 increase -- from $408 a  year to $426, or 4.4%. Non-resident tuition will remain at $189 per semester  unit and $126 per quarter unit.  </P> <P> "We are still at the very, very lowest (in student tuition costs) compared with  other state university systems," said Steve MacCarthy, a spokesman for the  system. "We probably are still in the bottom 5% in terms of student fees."  </P> <P> MacCarthy said students at Penn State, for instance, pay $3,754 per year in  fees, and their Illinois State counterparts pay $2,249. The figures are $1,754  at Louisiana State University and $1,350 at the State University of New York,  he said.  </P> <P> Had the increase proposal been rejected, he said, the additional funding would  have come from the state's general revenue fund.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Nesvizhskiy report from St. Petersburg under the </F> "Proximity" rubric: "Christian Democrats of all Countries Unite  in St. Petersburg. The RCDU Has Established Contacts with the  Russian Proletariat"]    [Text] Leaders of Christian Democratic parties (CDP) from  over 20 countries have opened their congress in St. Petersburg  under the motto "Christian Democracy Today." According to Andre  Louis, vice president of the Christian Democratic International,  its main goal is to "devise a joint strategy of the Christian  Democrats in a fast changing world."    Within the three "post-Soviet" years the Christian Democrats  have managed to find a niche in the legislatures of many former  Soviet republics. At the end of 1992, leaders of the Christian  Democratic Unions [CDU] of Russia and Armenia, and also the NDP  [expansion unknown] of Georgia announced the creation of the  East Europe Christian Democratic Union, later joined by the  Ukrainian Christian Democrats and the Belarusian People's Front.  At the conference the East Europe CDU applied for collective  membership in the CDI; to all appearances, they will be admitted  in the near future.    It was decided to continue a dialogue with the Muslims by  holding the fourth round of talks in Manila between the CDI and  the RABITA (World Moslem League). At the same time, appeals  were made to the RABITA, the Roman Catholic, and the Russian  Orthodox Churches to send their representatives to the former  Yugoslavia, a move that could help establish religious peace in  the country.    Members of the East Europe CDU agreed to exchange  parliamentary missions. In the view of Gleb Yakunin, cochairman  of the Russian Christian Democratic Union [RCDU], the Russian  Christian Democrats have great chances of success, because "the  country is leaning toward Christianity." This forecast was  echoed by Vitaliy Savitskiy, chairman of the State Duma  organizing committee on relations with religious organizations,  who said: "The RCDU was the first non-Marxist party to  establish close contacts with the working movement and the first  Russian party to forge ties with parties in the former USSR that  share its views."</p>

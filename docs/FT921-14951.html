			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Polly Peck directors face US legal action FOURTEEN former directors of Polly Peck, the collapsed fruit, electronics conglomerate, face possible legal action in the southern district of New York from Lindner Fund, one of the top US mutual funds. Lindner's action, which includes the company itself, as well as many of its directors and Stoy Hayward, its auditors, was launched shortly before Christmas. Among those named is the Polly Peck former chairman, Mr Asil Nadir, and Mr David Fawcus, the former finance director. Mr Paul Hibbs, senior partner at Stoy Hayward, said: 'As far as we are concerned, it has no foundation at all.' The petition filed with the court claims that shareholders' rights suffered because of misleading information in the company accounts. Polly Peck, one of the star performers on the London stock exchange in the early 1980s, went into administration in October 1990 with debts of Pounds 1.15bn. Since then it has emerged that many of its main subsidiaries were much less profitable than its published accounts suggested. The case is the the second to be brought against Polly Peck's auditors. Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of three administrators running Polly Peck, lodged a writ in the High Court in London on December 18 claiming damages from Stoy Hayward for 'negligence and/or breach of contractual duty of care' on Polly Peck's accounts for the year ended December 20 1985. Touche Ross is considering issuing writs related to the company's accounts for later years. There is also a separate legal action to recover funds allegedly belonging to the company from Mr Nadir and his mother. Mr Nadir also faces 72 theft charges and four of false accounting, involving Pounds 155m of company funds in a prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office. Polly Peck's administrators are trying to get the US action adjourned.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Book Review: Elegant exorcism of central bogeymen Islam or Nationalism? By Ahmed Rashid Zed Books, London, New Jersey, and Oxford University Press, Karachi. Pounds 37.95 (Dollars 59.95) hardback, Pounds 14.95 (Dollars 25) paperback. 276 pages On a bleak border post in Tajikistan, a clutch of Russian 'peacekeep-ers', caught up in a civil war, was recently shot dead. The deaths went almost unnoticed in the west, where most governments still look on Central Asia much as Marco Polo did centuries earlier: exotic, dusty, far away and prone to blood-letting. But as the five ex-Soviet Central Asian states grapple with their new independence, violent events are starting to alarm outsiders. Russia has stepped up its demands for western approval for its role as 'peacekeeper' in the area. So where is this turbulent region heading? The answer to that question has consequences not only for Russia and for Central Asia's neighbours, such as Iran, but also for the west. The diagnosis in Ahmed Rashid's book, which provides the general reader with the first readable, thorough account of the region, is not entirely encouraging. The collapse of the Soviet Union has tipped Central Asia into economic decline. But in contrast to other regions, the Central Asians have only a minimal sense of national identity. None of the five states of Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan or Uzbekistan demanded independence, but they were tipped into it by the Soviet collapse. With powerful neighbours vying for influence in the region, the states' new-found freedom has left some of their governments looking distinctly dazed. Faced with this uncertainty, the focus of the west has been on two bogeymen. One is Islamic fundamentalism, which alarmists mutter could radicalise these Moslem republics as they shrug off their communist past. The second is nationalism, which, it is feared, could lead to inter-ethnic conflicts in an area of rising populations and scarce land and water. The strength of Rashid's book is that it challenges both of these familiar bogeymen. Nationalism, he points out, is not a good way to understand a region that has historically been dominated by a shifting patchwork of tribes and kingdoms. Central Asia's leaders are trying to create states based on boundaries arbitrarily carved out by Stalin, so national identities remain unstable. This point is worth stressing. As nationalism replaces communism as the west's favourite demon, it is often forgotten that nationalism does not operate the same way in all the east European and ex-Soviet 'nations'. Many Central Asians still see their first loyalty as being towards a clan or particular region - and only second towards a nation. Consequently, there is as much conflict and rivalry within these nations as between them. The advantage of this is that none of the simmering rivalries in the region has yet created a full-blown conflict between republics. Its drawback, however, is that it leaves Central Asians facing a post-colonial identity crisis. And in an area where most of the population adheres to Islam, the question is: could fundamentalism emerge to fill the void? Rashid's approach towards this second bogeyman is insightful, partly as a result of his background as a Pakistani journalist who has worked for western newspapers. He combines the political perspective of an outsider with sensitivity towards Moslem culture. Islam, Rashid acknowledges, has enjoyed a renaissance in Central Asia since independence. But this does not mean that the region is uniting around a single revolutionary flag. 'Radical' Islamic movements have emerged in some of the rural valleys of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. But the more mystical - and tolerant - strand of 'sufi' Islam is also playing a key role in the revival. Meanwhile, Central Asia's governments remain secular in their outlook. Fundamentalism could, Rashid acknowledges, gain more supporters if the economy deteriorates. Republics have come to independence with little industry and few transport links. Most of the regimes remain authoritarian. And though Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have made some steps towards the market economy, reform has barely begun in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Meanwhile, outside aid has been minimal. Though foreign companies vie for Kazakhstan's oil reserves, Turkmenistan's gas and Uzbekistan's tobacco and cotton, most western investors remain nervous. But if Central Asian governments begin to embrace political and economic change, decline might be reversed, particularly in the resource-rich republics of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, Rashid concludes. The region is blessed with a literate population, a culture which is not averse to the market, and reserves of oil, gas, gold and cotton. But if Central Asian governments cannot - or will not - act, then a cocktail of social pressures and worsening economic conditions could create grinding instability, particularly in the poorer rural areas of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. This second scenario would, as Rashid points out, be a tragedy for Central Asia. What perhaps he fails to stress sufficiently is that it would also be of concern to its neighbours. Large Russian populations live in Central Asia, and Russia retains tens of thousands of troops in the region, ostensibly to promote 'stability'. So far the soldiers have succeeded in bringing a lull in Tajikistan's civil war, by effectively propping up the authoritarian government. But Russia has little inclination to become involved in a second Afghan-style conflict, irrespective of whether the west would tolerate such an engagement. And though the 'Afghanistan' scenario is remote, the possibility that an unstable Russia could be faced with further turmoil on its southern flank is reason for the west to keep watching Central Asia - and to welcome Rashid's well-written account.</p>

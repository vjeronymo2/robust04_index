			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TONY HOPE RETURNS TO CALIFORNIA POLITICAL SCENE -- IF NOT CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Tony Hope, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1986 and is entertainer Bob  Hope's son, has gained a nomination to the state Republican Central Committee  -- possibly with an eye toward a future congressional bid.  </P> <P> But while the action signals Hope's return to the California political scene,  it does not necessarily reflect a return to California. He apparently resides  in Washington.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) said Tuesday that she recommended  Hope, whom she has known for many years, for the party post last month. He is  expected to be confirmed to a two-year term when the state GOP gathers Feb. 18  for its next convention.  </P> <P> "He called me and told me he was now working in the district and he'd like to  be active in the party," Wright said. "I was looking for someone to appoint."  </P> <P> The 1,380 to 1,400 members of the Central Committee elect party officers,  including the state chairman, and can amend party rules. In addition, the  courts last year ruled that state parties have the power to endorse candidates  in primaries; the Republicans chose not to do so in 1988.  </P> <P> Hope, 48, an attorney, works for Mutual of Omaha and resides in Washington, two  Republican officials said. He moved to Northridge temporarily in 1986 when he  ran for the GOP nomination to a 21st District seat vacated by Bobbi Fiedler.  Hope was upset in the Republican primary by then-Simi Valley Mayor Elton  Gallegly, who won the general election and was reelected last November.  </P> <P> Gallegly seized on Hope's absence from California for 10 years, characterizing  him as a carpetbagger who was trading on his father's name and fund-raising  ability. He was aided by the disclosure that Hope had not registered to vote  for 10 years.  </P> <P> This time, however, Hope's absence from the state is not likely to matter.  There is no residency requirement in the Republican Party bylaws for  appointment to the state committee.  </P> <P> "They have to be a registered Republican," state Republican Party spokesman  John Kurzweil said of prospective members. "I think that's it."  </P> <P> Hope could not be reached Tuesday.  </P> <P> He does not have a California driver's license, according to state Department  of Motor Vehicles records, and is not registered to vote in either Ventura or  Los Angeles counties, officials said.  </P> <P> Wright's office was unable to provide an address or phone number for Hope on  Tuesday. Kurzweil said his impression was that Hope lives and works in  Washington. Another prominent Republican said that Hope lives in Washington and  travels to Southern California frequently for Mutual of Omaha.  </P> <P> Hope's government credentials include service on two presidential commissions.  Former President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the Grace Commission, which was  mandated to pinpoint waste and fraud in the federal government. Ex-President  Gerald Ford named him vice president of the Overseas Investment Corp. Hope is a  graduate of Georgetown University and Harvard Law School.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Additional Appointment  </P> <P> In nominating Hope, Wright used an additional appointment she was awarded  because the percentage of the vote she received last November exceeded the  percentage of the Republican registration in her district. She had a total of  nine appointees.  </P> <P> Gallegly said Hope's appointment could be a precursor to a second congressional  bid if another district is created in Ventura County when the state Legislature  and governor redraw district boundaries after the 1990 elections.  </P> <P> "He said he hadn't gotten it out of his system," Gallegly said. "He might run  again" if a new seat is established.  </P> <P> Gallegly said he has made amends with his former opponent, who attended one of  the congressman's fund-raisers and visited him in his Washington office after  his election.  </P> <P> "I think he has a contribution to make," said Gallegly, who also has nine  appointees to the GOP Central Committee. "I wish he would have called me. I  might have made the recommendation instead of Cathie."  </P></p>

Ford, which is vying for the prestigious Jaguar name with  rival General Motors, said it had doubled its share holding to 10.4%. Ford said  it had bought or agreed to buy 19.04 million Jaguar shares by the end of  trading Monday. Ford, the world's No. 2 car maker, has said it aims to boost  its stake in Jaguar to 15%, the maximum allowed by Britain's Conservative  government when it privatized the firm in 1984.  </P></p>

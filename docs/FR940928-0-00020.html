			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement of Consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, the order provides that for a supply plant to be considered a pool plant, a minimum percentage of the total quantity of milk received at the supply plant must be transferred or diverted to and physically received at pool distributing plants regulated under the order or disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area. This provision is subject to the following two conditions: (1) Not less than 45,000 pounds of Grade A fluid milk must be shipped from the supply plant to a pool distributing plant during either September, October, or November; and (2) shipments used to determine qualifying percentages must be milk transferred or diverted to and physically received by pool distributing plants, less any transfers or diversions of bulk fluid milk products from such distributing pool plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule temporarily revises the minimum requirement from 40 percent to 30 percent for the months of September through November 1994, from 30 percent to 20 percent for the month of December 1994, and from 35 percent to 25 percent for the months of January and February 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase or decrease the required shipping percentages for supply plants by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments or to prevent uneconomic shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The temporary revision was requested by Brewster Dairy, Inc. (Brewster), a proprietary handler who operates a pool supply plant regulated under the order. Brewster contends that in Fall 1993 the plant was unable to accept surplus distributing plant milk associated with Order 36 and still meet supply plant qualifications. Consequently, milk from a distributing plant located 10 miles from Brewster had to be diverted to a manufacturing facility 92 miles away. At the same time, Brewster had to procure surplus milk from greater distances to fulfill manufacturing obligations. Brewster contends that this situation represents inequitable and inefficient movements of milk for both supply and distributing plants, undertaken to meet order shipping requirements. Brewster asserts that the same inequitable and inefficient movements of milk are expected again for Fall 1994. Thus, Brewster contends, a reduction of supply plant shipping percentages is necessary to prevent uneconomic and inefficient shipments of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Milk Marketing Inc. (MMI), a dairy farmer cooperative representing 1,350 dairy farmers whose milk is pooled under Order 36, supported Brewster's request for reducing shipping percentages for pool supply plants. MMI's comment stated the cooperative supports Brewster's request for the same reasons MMI gave in a recent continued reduction of shipping requirements for cooperative association reserve processing plants (59 FR 48557) in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk order. In this continued reduction, MMI's comments included a description of milk marketing conditions for June 1994 that show milk production for the market increased over 4 percent from the same month of the previous year, representing 12 million additional pounds of milk in the Order 36 pool. For the same month, Class I sales decreased by nearly 2.5 percent from June 1993, representing a reduction of approximately 3.4 million pounds of Class I sales. As a result of the market's increasing production and declining Class I use, nearly 15.5 million more pounds of milk had to be used in manufactured products than in the same month the previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the current supply and demand relationship for the market, the supply plant shipping percentages should be reduced for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. A reduction of the shipping percentages will contribute to orderly marketing in that costly and inefficient shipments of milk from distant supply plants will not be necessary. Thus, dairy farmers who have supplied the market will continue to have their milk pooled under the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal set forth in the aforesaid notice, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the supply plant shipping percentage set forth in &sect;1036.7(b) should be reduced to 30 percent for the months of September, October, and November 1994, reduced to 20 percent for the month of December 1994, and reduced to 25 percent for the months of January and February 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

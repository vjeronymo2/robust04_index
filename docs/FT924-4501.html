			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour-union link strained THE Labour party's relations with the trade unions came under further strain yesterday, with the AEEU craft union's dissent against the outline final report of the party committee reviewing union links. It said it would, if necessary, produce a minority report to the National Executive Committee. Mr Nigel Harris, the AEEU official who sits on the union links committee, said the union strongly objected to dropping the idea of one-member-one-vote for the election of leader and deputy leader and for the selection of parliamentary candidates. The union links committee report instead backed the idea of a new category of 'registered supporter' - union members who want to do more than pay the political levy but do not want to be full members - who would have a role in the elections for the leadership and for local candidates. That idea is backed by several members of the committee, by the GMB general union and Nupe the public-services union, and by senior Labour party officials. Mr Harris said it was unworkable and undemocratic. He also said it would revive the spectre of 'entryism' and provide ammunition for Conservatives who are keen to force unions to change to a system of 'contracting in' to the political levy. Mr Harris said that several other members of the committee, including Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, rejected the idea of registered supporters and also pointed to the public support for one-member-one-vote from Mr John Smith, the party leader. The issue threatens to create a new fault-line within the party, but a new draft of the final report due to be presented to another meeting of the links committee today is unlikely to include any fundamental change. Mr Harris says, though, that if the final report, to be sent to the NEC in January, does not include the option of one-member-one-vote, those who support the idea will produce a minority report.</p>

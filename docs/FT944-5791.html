			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (20): Intriguing success stories - France / A relative lack of activity but the future looks good The market for management buy-outs has generated some intriguing success stories in France over the past few years: a radio station with the slogan 'all the pops and none of the flops'; a rubber boots business; and a company providing artificial insemination for animals, to name just three of the more bizarre. But perhaps more significant than the quirky nature of any of the particular examples is the fact that those involved in the sector can quickly call to mind all the transactions that have taken place. One of the reasons is the relative lack of activity in France. Compared to the UK and the US, France has a long way to go to catch up. Edmund Truell, managing director of Hambro European Ventures, says: 'We have done four transactions in the last two years.' That is a figure of which he claims to be proud in a division which only expects to carry out three or four across Europe each year. 'The market is under-developed. 'We find France a good market to operate in compared with the southern parts of Europe,' he says. 'It has relatively clear-cut legal, accounting, tax and other information requirements and a strong code of conduct. You can resort to the courts if you need.' However, he also says: 'The standard of confidentiality is lower than in the UK. Everyone knows about your deal before you do.' He adds that it is important to use 'political savvy' and work close with local French partners. 'The attitude of 'the Brits are here, get out of the way' does not go down well.' Mr Truell says the bulk of the transactions in France of which he has experience are an amalgam - with the owners wanting to expand capital and strengthen management. 'They are very rarely simply management-led acquisitions,' he says. 'They normally leave the existing owners with a significant stake. It gives them two bites of the cherry and avoids a too lengthy debate about value.' 'The French market is very much smaller than the UK,' says George Elliston, a partner of Domino, a Paris-based corporate finance boutique. 'The culture is just not there to go in to companies to talk about financial leverage. At some stage you need to have a management taking the initiative by coming to you saying we want to do an MBO. It just doesn't seem to happen.' Arnaud Limal, managing director of Schroeders in Paris, says: 'There has certainly been a tightening of credit. The financial conditions are a lot tighter than in the UK. It has been less part of the culture to consider buy-outs from companies.' That is not the complete story, of course. Ciclad, a French company, is raising FFr300m (Dollars 59m) for a new fund which will invest in MBOs. Created in 1988 with supporters including IDI, a development capital company which was itself an MBO from a government agency, it has invested in some 40 others. Thierry Thomann, one of the partners, stresses that leverage is much less important in French buy-outs. 'We don't have lots of asset stripping,' he says. 'We invest development capital and are active partners in companies.' But he concedes, too, that 'we started rather later in France than in the UK'. He says there is now a 'real market of managers who want to buy their companies and don't just want to be employees'. But he adds that this has only started to come to fruition, where a few years ago the idea of a family company selling out was considered as a failure. One of the traditional problems for the growth of MBOs in France is that the law prevents bankers securing their loans against the assets of the target company. They must instead rely on cash flow from the holding company making the acquisition. That can act as a disincentive to potential financiers. However, Jean Bereget, head of acquisition finance for Paribas, defends this system. 'What's the use of choking a company if the financial side doesn't go well?' he says. 'If there is a fruit tree that has been producing a good crop for 60 years, we want to be reimbursed from the fruits, not by burning the tree or cutting it down to make planks for furniture. This system preserves the operating side of the company where otherwise there could be a financial temptation to cut it down.' For critics of the current French system, however, the law makes the merging of holding and target companies more difficult than some other jurisdictions. This can have important tax implications and make the process of consolidating the two cumbersome. In addition, the disappointing performance of the French stock market - especially in the past two years - has made the exit route through quotation less easy than in other countries. 'It has been difficult to exit, and a lot of funds have not been able to turn their position around,' says Mr Limal. All this is clearly beginning to change. The classic tale told by corporate finance advisers is of a market bulging with potential MBOs. France is particularly well endowed with a small- and medium-sized business sector (the 'PME' or petit et moyen enterprise) of profitable, privately-held companies. Many were founded after the second world war, and their creators are now reaching retirement age. Lack of interest by their children - or a reluctance to deal with such a succession process - means that there is suddenly enormous scope for managers or employees to buy out the company from its original owners. 'I think you can expect growth in MBOs in France,' says Frederick de Broglie, managing director of 3i France, the venture capital company. 'It's a question of culture. There is an awareness by subsidiaries now that MBOs are a way of becoming rich and becoming your own boss.' There are really exciting prospects for companies in the FFr200-300m range,' says Hambro's Mr Truell. 'I am optimistic. There are relatively few people doing MBO advisory work in France - and long may it continue]'</p>

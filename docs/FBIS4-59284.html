			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The first press festival ended this afternoon  with a speech by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and the  presentation of prizes to the outstanding press in the country.    In his speech, the president considered the progress of the  country's press to be towards perfection and described the press  festival as a necessity for this stage in the era of the  reconstruction of the country.    Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed the need for press freedom  in  the country and added: Press freedom in Iran is at a very high  level. Even those in the press who do not have a friendly  approach enjoy the same freedom.    The president stressed the need for the press to come to the  aid of the government when necessary and added: When the  British Government embarked on a hue and cry against us in the  current month [Iranian month beginning 21 April] as a preemptive  action after a bugging device was discovered at the Iranian  Embassy, the press did not show any perceptiveness [hassasiyyat  neshan-nadadand]. Professionals realize the press should come to  the aid of the government at such times. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wheat stocks set for 14-year low World wheat stocks are set to fall to their lowest level for 14 years after a drop in international output this year together with a continued rise in consumption, according to the latest report by the International Wheat Council. The IWC has cut its estimate of world stocks at the end of the 1994-1995 season from 114m tonnes to 107m tonnes - the smallest carry-over since 1980. This compares with a carry-over of 129m tonnes from 1993-1994. 'The international supply position for wheat continues to tighten,' the report says. The wheat council's latest estimate for world production in 1994-1995 is 2m tonnes lower than a month ago at 534m tonnes, which compares with 558m tonnes in 1993-1994. Falling production and stock levels have pushed world wheat prices higher in the past few months by at least Dollars 20 to Dollars 130-Dollars 135 a tonne. This was against a background of improved prospects for trade, especially with China, and a further trimming of estimated supplies in drought-affected Australia, as well as in Canada, where stocks are also low. But the IWC says that the fall in stock levels will not necessarily mean serious wheat shortages in future. The northern hemisphere is now making planting decisions on the basis of current high wheat prices.</p>

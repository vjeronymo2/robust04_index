(TSI). The Application for Refund was submitted by Energy Refunds, Inc., a private filing service. The applicant claimed that TSI purchased 28,243,240 gallons of Gulf petroleum products and asked that the refund check be made payable to Stanley Cofall. Mr. Cofall could not demonstrate that he was presently eligible to receive a refund on behalf of this corporation. In addition, under Case No. RF300&hyph;10119, Leaseway Transportation Corporation was granted a refund based on purchases of 40,933,031 gallons of Gulf products made by the corporation and its subsidiaries which include Transportation Supplies, Inc. Mr. Cofall was therefore denied a refund in this proceeding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Gulf Oil Corporation/West Penn Power Company, 12/17/94, RF300&hyph;20131  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted in the Gulf Oil Corporation special refund proceeding by West Penn Power Company. In considering the claim, the DOE noted that pursuant to Pennsylvania regulations for public utilities, West Penn Power Company did not employ a monthly fuel adjustment clause during the refund period. The DOE found that the company therefore could not pass through Gulf's alleged overcharges to its customers on a dollar for dollar basis. Accordingly, West Penn Power Company was treated as an end-user in this proceeding and was granted a total refund of $9,238.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Quantum Chemical Corp./Wilcox Oil Company, 12/17/94, RR330&hyph;1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bill T. Wilcox submitted a Motion for Reconsideration of the DOE's denial of an Application for Refund that he had submitted on behalf of Wilcox Oil Company (WOC) in the Quantum Chemical Corporation Refund proceeding. In its denial of the original application, the DOE found that the WOC was a corporation whose stock had been sold, and that the right to a refund had transferred to the purchaser of the stock. However, based on information submitted by Mr. Wilcox in his Motion for Reconsideration, the DOE found that the WOC functioned as a sole proprietorship of Mr. Wilcox prior to its incorporation. Accordingly, the DOE found that Mr. Wilcox was the proper recipient of a refund for WOC's purchases from Quantum that occurred prior to the incorporation of WOC in December 1979. Mr. Wilcox was therefore granted a refund of $109. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 -->  Texaco Inc./Ronnie's Texaco et al., 12/15/93, RF321&hyph;14226 et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning seven Applications for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. Subpart V special refund proceeding. The application for purchases made by Art Cement Products, Inc. (Art) (Case No. RF321&hyph;16588), was filed by RECOLL Management Corp. (RECOLL). Art is in bankruptcy, and the New Bank of New England is one of its creditors. RECOLL is acting on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the bank's receiver. The trustee in the Art bankruptcy case stated that the bank has a security interest in all of Art's assets, and he requested that the refund due Art be made payable to RECOLL. The DOE has previously indicated that where a firm is in bankruptcy, the refund will be paid to a creditor if the creditor demonstrates a clear right to the refund. See Texaco Inc./General Gas &amp; Oil Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 22 DOE &para; 85,130 (1992). That is the case here. Accordingly, Art's refund was granted to RECOLL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

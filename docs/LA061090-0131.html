			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE UPGRADE MAY START IN YEAR  </P> <P> Repair work on City Hall and other city buildings and bridges could begin  within a year as a result of Tuesday's passage of Proposition G, a $376-million  bond issue to upgrade aging municipal structures to meet earthquake standards,  according to Los Angeles city officials.  </P> <P> The ballot measure, which required a two-thirds majority for passage, won with  72% of the votes cast.  </P> <P> Almost one-third of the money -- about $112 million -- will be earmarked to  repair the historic 27-story City Hall. Also on the priority list of projects  are 136 multispan bridges, including several built in the 1920s that link  downtown with the Eastside.  </P> <P> A total of 459 city-owned bridges are scheduled for repairs.  </P> <P> "The measure will allow the city to make necessary repairs for the movement of  emergency vehicles during and after a major earthquake," said City Councilman  Richard Alatorre, the proposition's author and chairman of the council's Public  Safety Committee.  </P> <P> He added that the measure will also allow strengthening of buildings vital to  maintaining public order, such as police and fire stations and those frequently  used by the general public. In the last category, he said, are the Anderson  Memorial Senior Recreation Center in San Pedro and the outdoor 6,200-seat Greek  Theater in the Hollywood Hills, where the stage needs strengthening.  </P> <P> Also considered of particular importance are the 11 historic structures --  including the Avila Abode, the city's oldest building -- at Olvera Street, the  aging Mexican marketplace north of the Civic Center. About $16 million has been  set aside for seismic work there.  </P> <P> The city would be "exposed to a great deal of liability" at Olvera Street if  there is a substantial loss of life due to an earthquake since as many as 2  million people visit the tourist spot each year, Alatorre said.  </P> <P> Deputy City Engineer Rodney Haraga said the repair work authorized by the  proposition on 84 buildings and 459 bridges should be completed in five to  seven years.  </P> <P> He added that the design work on City Hall, completed in 1928, has not begun.  </P></p>

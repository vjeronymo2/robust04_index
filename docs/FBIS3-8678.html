This was the  reason we put several questions to SDL Chairman Peter Weiss.    [Correspondent] Mr. Weiss, only two weeks ago you feared  most  what would happen after D day (?in terms) of responsibility and  the takeover of power. Has there been a change in the situation  within the opposition over the past two weeks that would make  you ready to take over the entire responsibility, not just the  power, from the previous government?    [Weiss] I would like to point out that we held intensive  talks with both the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  and other opposition parties. We were seeking ways out of the  crisis. The offer I made to the prime minister today was voiced  during our talks. A signal was sent to me that it was possible  to hold talks with the HZDS. I would also like to pay a visit  to the president. We could continue the intensive work carried  out by the experts from opposition parties, who managed to agree  on the basic priorities of the government, which will be an  interim government. The main role of this government is to  prepare early parliamentary elections.    [Correspondent] Am I to understand that now, shortly before  1800 after the end of today's debate, the HZDS said it was ready  to form a government with you without Former Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar?    [Weiss] I would not say so. There was a readiness to hold  talks, and I think that is what is important. [passage omitted]    The president informed me that, as is customary, he would  ask  someone from the HZDS, which is the biggest group in the Slovak  parliament, to try to form a government for this interim period.    [Correspondent] Mr. Weiss, do you not fear that the  parliamentary opposition needed the SDL to remove Vladimir  Meciar's government and that, figuratively speaking, the SDL  could be a ladder for the opposition achieving power? Or, in  other words, are you not concerned that a right-wing coup could  take place now?    [Weiss] That is not what I fear because the SDL would not be  able to agree on this kind of (?policy-related) solution. Also,  right from the beginning, we insisted on holding early  elections. We rejected as absolutely unrealistic that this  interim government could stay in power until the spring of 1995.  We adopted an accommodating position regarding the opposition,  regarding the date of the elections. At the moment, we are  going for early elections. We have been promised that the bill  on reducing the election period should go through the  parliament. A new situation will arise if this bill does not go  through. We will be forced to resort to other means, such as a  referendum. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you have any guarantees that the new  Cabinet will survive at least until early elections?    [Weiss] Those guarantees are to be found in broad  cooperation, in a willingness to engage in a dialogue, and in  outlining good priorities for the [new] Cabinet.    [Correspondent] Does this mean that those agreements will be  confirmed in writing? Do you consider that form of confirmation  a sort of coalition agreement on a broad basis?    [Weiss] I think it is always very good in politics to have  agreements in writing.    [Correspondent] When are you going to see the president?    [Weiss] As soon as possible.    [Correspondent] That means when?    [Weiss] This evening.    [Correspondent] Who do you intend to include in the  government of a broad coalition from among parliamentary parties?    [Weiss] I think it is not possible to exclude anybody in  advance. However, I think that, during today's deliberations of  the National Council of the Slovak Republic, some stances were  voiced. We naturally count on the participation of opposition  parties.    [Correspondent] Including Hungarian ones?    [Weiss] Talks with those parties have not concerned their  participation in the Cabinet. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] When do you think early elections will take  place?    [Weiss] I think they will take place at the beginning of  October at the latest. Even if a referendum takes place,  elections could not take place before September. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Following today's events, is the  parliamentary opposition going to consider a change in the post  of the chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic?    [Weiss] My view is that, so far, no reasons have emerged for  us to leave the principle chosen after the elections, which is  that the National Council bodies are to be elected on the basis  of proportional representation. The HZDS continues to be the  strongest political parliamentary group, and, if no  extraordinary political circumstances emerge, I do not see any  reason to abandon this principle.</p>

This authority has been delegated to the Under Secretary of NOAA. The U.S. Commissioner to the IWC has primary responsibility for the preparation and negotiation of U.S. positions on international issues concerning whaling and for all matters involving the IWC. He is staffed by the Department of Commerce, and assisted by the Department of State, the Department of the Interior, the Marine Mammal Commission, and other interested agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each year, NOAA conducts a series of meetings and other actions to prepare for the annual meeting of the IWC, which is usually held in the spring or summer. The major purpose of the preparatory meetings is to provide for input in the development of policy by members of the public and non-governmental organizations interested in whale conservation. NOAA believes that this participation is important for the effective development and implementation of U.S. policy concerning whaling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person with an identifiable interest in United States whale conservation policy may participate in the meetings, but NOAA reserves the authority to inquire about the interest of any person who appears at a meeting and to determine the appropriateness of that person's participation. Foreign nationals and persons who represent foreign governments may not attend. These stringent measures are necessary to promote the candid exchange of information. Such measures are a necessary basis for the relatively open process of preparing for IWC meetings that characterizes current practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The tentative schedule of meetings and deadlines, including those of the IWC and deadlines for the preparation of position papers during 1994 is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> January 3, 1994_Publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> the Agency views on: (1) The current population levels and annual net recruitment rate of bowhead whales, (2) the nature and extent of the aboriginal/subsistence need for bowhead whales, (3) the level of take of bowhead whales that is consistent with provisions of the IWC aboriginal/subsistence whaling management scheme, and (4) a list of documents reviewed by NOAA and used by the Administrator in formulating these views. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 11, 1994 (2 p.m., room 6009, Herbert C.

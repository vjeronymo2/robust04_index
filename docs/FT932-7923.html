			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / MacGregor moves to placate Tory rebels MR JOHN MacGregor, transport secretary, last night met Conservative MPs in an attempt to head off a threatened rebellion next Monday over the privatisation of British Rail. Sir Keith Speed, Conservative MP for Ashford, said before the meeting that he was prepared to vote against the government if ministers did not back down. He could threaten the Conservative's 18-strong Commons majority if joined by more than a handful of colleagues. At least eight Tory MPs have signed a series of amendments intended to guarantee the future of concessionary fare schemes for pensioners and young people, and of the London travelcard. The MPs also want BR itself to be able to compete for passenger service franchises. Mr MacGregor last night hinted he would try to head off the rebellion by making clear that concessionary fare schemes and the London travelcard were likely to remain commercially attractive after privatisation. He said on BBC radio: 'Just as it is happening at the moment and there is advantage in it, so there will be in the future.' Mr MacGregor remained strongly opposed, however, to any move towards allowing BR to bid for franchises - which he believes would undermine the main objective of the bill, the transfer of the operation of rail services from the public to private sector. Instead BR managers are being offered financial incentives to launch management buyouts. Mr MacGregor's stance appeared unlikely to satisfy Sir Keith, who complained that private finance was unlikely to be forthcoming for management buyouts. Government business managers will be working hard during the weekend to persuade other Conservatives not to defy the government.</p>

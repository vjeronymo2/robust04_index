			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Cocoa prices reach 5-year highs THE COCOA market this week resumed preparation of the launch pad for its widely-expected blast-off into regions unknown to most of the present generation of traders. A Pounds 69 aggregate rise took the March futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange to Pounds 1,040 a tonne, the highest second position price since July, 1988. Some traders expressed doubts about the timing of this week's advance - just as the west African harvests were getting under way - and did not rule out a temporary setback before expected resistance between Dollars 1,050 and Dollars 1,060 a tonne was overcome. For the longer term, however, there was general confidence that a major bull market was going to develop as continuing supply deficits ate into the excessive stocks that were built up in the 1980s. London trade house GNI said this week that it could see cocoa prices tripling over the next three years. This week's price rise was topped off by a Pounds 21 jump yesterday in response to renewed buying from one US trade house in particular. The LCE coffee futures market also had its tail up for most of the week  - the January delivery position rising Dollars 107 to reach Dollars 1,317 a tonne at one point. However, a retracement yesterday afternoon left the price Dollars 54 up on balance at Dollars 1,264 a tonne. The rise was encouraged early on by news that the Brazilian government had last Friday bought 51,000 bags of coffee (60kg each) for its export retention stockpile, taking the total to 76,500 bags. However, that still left the Brazilian purchasing programme - part of a concerted effort by producers world-wide to boost coffee prices by holding 20 per cent of production off the market - considerably behind schedule. And some traders remained sceptical about the effectiveness of Brazil's participation in the international scheme. LCE raw sugar futures regained some of last week's setback, but in late trading yesterday the March position was 0.1 off at 10.55 US cents a pound, up 0.34 from the end of last week. The earlier rise had gained momentum on Thursday after London trader C. Czarnikow revealed that it had raised its estimate of the 1993-94 stocks drawdown to 2.28m tonnes from the 1.8m it had predicted in August. The gold market ended what had been a comparatively quiet week with a flurry of activity on Thursday and yesterday as repeated attempts were made to find a firm foothold in fresh high ground. On Thursday the price failed to better the recent high of Dollars 378.50 a troy ounce, however, and yesterday's renewed advance stalled just short of Dollars 380. By the close it was back to Dollars 378.60 an ounce, up Dollars 1.35 on the day and Dollars 3.40 on the week. Dealers told the Reuter news agency that heavy US investment and professional buying pushed prices upwards but previous resistance held and profit-taking eroded the gains. 'It has been threatening a test of Dollars 380 all week,' one dealer said, adding that Dollars 382 was now the near-term target. Silver prices followed a similar pattern but in a more exaggerated fashion, and the spot price in London ended 18.5 cents to the good at Dollars 4.72 a troy ounce. In addition to recent strong demand from India and the Far East, silver benefited this week from a renewed surge of buying by US investment funds, dealers said. At the London Metal Exchange, nickel was easily the strongest market. What dealers described as a 'correction' to the oversold condition that developed last week lifted prices by more than Dollars 100 a tonne in the first half of the week. Then came a minor retracement, ironically coinciding with a very bullish supply/demand projection by Inco of Canada, the world's biggest nickel producer. But the buyers were back yesterday and the three months delivery price closed at Dollars 4,727.50 a tonne, up Dollars 134 on the week. The Inco announcement suggested that a big cut in Russian nickel production and exports had brought supply and demand of the metal virtually into balance. And it predicted that the market would be in deficit next year. Mr Peter Salathiel, the company's executive vice president of marketing, projected that total exports of Russian nickel to the west would fall by 40,000 tonnes to a 'miserly' 80,000 tonnes in 1994. The copper market had a much less happy time as what dealers termed 'shaky technicals' pushed the three months position down Dollars 17.25 on the week to Dollars 1,649.50 a tonne at yesterday's close, despite news of a third consecutive fall in LME warehouse stocks. But that was still Dollars 20 above the low point reached on Wednesday. Aluminium put in a parallel performance, three months metal ending Dollars 13.25 down at Dollars 1,063.25 a tonne after dipping to Dollars 1,046 on Tuesday. Dealers attributed the metal's lacklustre showing to disappointed selling following its failure last week to break resistance at Dollars 1,080 a tonne, exacerbated by Far Eastern selling and trade offerings. There was support, however, on dips towards Dollars 1,050 a tonne, they added. Zinc prices were held within a narrower range as three months metal registered a net fall of Dollars 8 to Dollars 946.50 a tonne. The market took little notice of a warning on Monday that the Budel smelter in the Netherlands, which accounts for about 5 per cent of western world supplies of zinc, would have to close by the middle of 1995 if no agreement about waste storage could be reached with the Dutch authorities by the end of this year.  ---------------------------------      LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------- Aluminium  +25,425 to 2,352,225 Copper        -600 to   585,825 Lead          +350 to   298,400 Nickel        +120 to   118,014 Zinc        +1,625 to   847,475 Tin           -115 to    19,440  ---------------------------------</p>

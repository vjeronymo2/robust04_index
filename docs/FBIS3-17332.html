			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Yegor Trubnikov: </F> "Zhirinovskiy Did Not Come, But Rally Was Held"]    [Text] A rally was held on Sunday at Vladivostok's central  square under the traditional banner "In Defense of Human  Rights," with (by approximate count) about 1,000 persons  participating.    The information that in connection with certain political  events Vladimir Volfovich himself was planning to be in  Vladivostok and take part in the rally came early Sunday morning  from the Russian radio, which could not fail to increase city  residents' interest in the planned event. It would be unfair to  say, however, that people came ONLY to see Zhirinovskiy--those  who gathered here were sincere, convinced supporters of Viktor  Cherepkov and the former masters of the Vladivostok mayoralty.    The absence of the promised LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party  of  Russia] leader at the rally did not disappoint those present:  The famous extravagant and original thinking of the latter was  more than compensated for by the speakers, whose expressions far  from always could be defined as parliamentary language. Which in  turn may prompt another series of court hearings on cases "in  defense of honor and dignity" of a number of high-ranking  persons in the kray administration. After two hours of debates,  a resolution was adopted, expressing the resolve to continue  fighting for human rights in Vladivostok.    The rally ended without incidents.</p>

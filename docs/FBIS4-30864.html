			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["From the appeal" issued by organizers of the Surany </F> meetings of Slovaks from southern Slovakia and addressed to the  chairman and deputies of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic: "We Propose a Referendum!"]    [Text] The organizers of the, by now six, Surany meetings  of Slovaks from southern Slovakia (Eva Garajova, Zdenka  Anettova, Andrej Strycek, and Stanislav Bajanik) have addressed  an appeal to the chairman and deputies of the National Council  of the Slovak Republic [NRSR]. It states:    ``The agenda of the 32d NRSR meeting includes two important  items -- the so-called bill on bilingual signs and the so-called  bill on [birth and marriage] registers. We draw attention to  the fact that these laws constitute only another partial  solution to the entire language problem. Leaving aside the  initiatives of the Slovak Heritage Foundation, there have been  six meetings of representatives of Slovaks from southern  Slovakia at Surany devoted to this issue. At these meetings  they repeatedly warned that the social, civic, and also  political situation in southern Slovakia continues to pose a  permanent threat to the language and ethnic sovereignty of  Slovaks in their own state. Approximately 500,000 citizens of  Hungarian nationality, but more than 1.2 million Slovaks, live  on the territory of southern Slovakia, leaving aside members of  other nationalities and ethnic groups. Therefore, it would be  democratic if not only political parties, but all citizens  living in the region, made decisions on its major problems. We  recognize the language rights of all our fellow citizens.  However, we cannot accept rights going beyond the framework of  established European norms. Their realization in our conditions  would jeopardize the standing of members of the Slovak nation.  Moreover, a return to names and designations [of communities]  from the time of pre-1918 Hungary and from the history of  Horthyite Hungary is inadmissible. We cannot accept the  disappearance from the Slovak south of names and designations  after Slovak national figures.    ``Entries in [birth and marriage] registers in the language  of the minority clash with the codified standard of the state  language. Interference with this standard is inadmissible in all  advanced countries.    "We appeal to you to postpone the planned partial solutions  and to deal with the language problem comprehensively, in a  separate NRSR law on the protection of the state language and in  a law on the status of ethnic minorities. In those two laws,  the problem of designating place names should be tackled  exclusively by means of transcription of the official name into  the minority language. Should the NRSR fail to accept this  proposal, we consider it necessary that this sensitive and  serious problem be dealt with democratically -- by means of a  referendum."    Eva Garajova, Andrej Strycek, and Stanislav Bajanik  yesterday  personally visited NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic in this matter.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal officers made whopping seizures on two different coasts when they found  drugs hidden in trucks on board ships. In Columbia City, about 30 miles  northeast of Portland, Ore., officers confiscated about 25 tons of hashish  concealed in flatbed trucks offloaded from a docked sea vessel, the 158-foot  Lady Brigid. Seven people were arrested in the $156-million seizure called the  largest of its kind on the West Coast. The "high-grade" hashish was believed to  be from the Middle East. It was concealed in a false compartment, officers  said. Near Tampa, Fla., agents found 824 pounds of cocaine concealed in a truck  shipped from Honduras and 23,000 pounds of marijuana was seized on a fishing  boat. The cocaine was worth about $5.6 million wholesale.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: MORE WESTWARD TILT  </P> <P> "Metropolis: The Architecture &amp; Design Magazine of New York" is looking  beyond the Hudson, in response "to the desire for greater editorial and  advertising coverage of California," says publisher Horace Havemeyer III, in  the March issue.  </P> <P> The magazine offered a tease for its expanded coverage in its January/February  issue with an article on how MacArthur Place, a proposed Orange County  development of Bell Canada Enterprises master-planned by New York-based urban  designer M. Paul Friedberg, will cope with the car. It was the sort of article  that serves a pre-leasing and pre-approval publicity effort well, albeit  beginning with an obligatory freeway scene.  </P> <P> In the current issue, there is an interesting, if dated article on the home as  a workplace, using, among other examples, two engagingly designed, awkwardly  styled townhouses in Hollywood Heights, fashioned by the Santa Monica-based  architecture firm of Koning Eizenberg.  </P> <P> And we always thought Metropolis is where the director Fritz Lange lived when  he was not here visiting the studios. So much for parochialism. SAM HALL KAPLAN  </P></p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Clinton unveils compromise plan for US forestry US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled his plan to bridge the chasm between environmentalists and loggers over the timber harvest in the endangered old growth forests of the Pacific north-west. The plan will allow about 2bn board feet of Forest Service timber sales from the region this year, as previously arranged sales move through the pipeline, but would then settle on a much lower timber harvest of some 1.2bn board feet a year. This would be one third of the yield reached in the late 1980s but would allow more timber to be cut than at present, with logging held up by a variety of court orders. Mr Clinton said he would also restore the ban on exporting raw logs from publicly owned land, a moved designed to create jobs in north-west wood processing plants. The plan will satisfy neither side in the long-running battle over the remaining acres of north-western forest, where the intensive logging allowed under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush has slowed to a trickle as the courts have held the government to its obligation under the Endangered Species Act to protect the habitat of the dwindling population of northern spotted owls. Mr Clinton said the plan was scientifically sound and complied with the law. While the proposed annual yield is smaller than timber interests had wanted, the plan does not have some of the protections environmental groups had sought; it would, for example, allow some salvage cutting and thinning in protected areas of owl habitat. The administration plan offers Dollars 270m of economic aid next year to help the region adjust to reduced timber harvests, and Dollars 1.2bn over five years, creating jobs in watershed restoration and ecological preservation. 'Had this crisis been dealt with years ago, we might have a plan with a higher yield and with more environmentally protected areas. We are doing the best we can with the facts as they now exist in the Pacific north-west,' Mr Clinton said yesterday. Lumber prices rose sharply in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in anticipation of lower timber harvests under the Clinton plan, moving limit up ahead of the announcement. But they fell back later. Mr Clinton also announced that he would seek additional funding from congress to pay for flood damage in the upper Mississippi basin, where governors of five states have sought aid for farmers whose crops have been washed out.</p>

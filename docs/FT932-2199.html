			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Trying to open up an old market - Nick Garnett on the struggles of a shop for the elderly 'IT GIVES ME a lot of pleasure seeing elderly people using things I've sold them. I have just seen a man, who has difficulty walking, with a shoppers' trolley designed so that you can sit on it. If I hadn't sold that to him he would not have been out that day and he certainly would not have been shopping.' Annette Dand puts a finger on one of the blessings of running some types of small business. Serving the public often generates gratification, which is just as well for Dand because the main point of owning a company - making money - has proved elusive. As a single parent with a young daughter and a divorce behind her, Dand was looking for a venture that would allow her flexibility in taking time off. In 1987 she set up Nanas &amp; Papas, a shop in Leicester selling items for senior citizens. The business has survived, no mean achievement in light of the recessionary death rate among new shops. But in the year to January 1992 pre-tax profit was just Pounds 6,000 on a miserly turnover of Pounds 44,000. Dand has been dependent on maintenance from her husband. These figures paint an overly bleak picture of the company's finances. During the past six years Dand has been able to generate enough gross profit to buy close to Pounds 30,000 of stock. Paucity of stock and of capital at the beginning of the tiny company's life is partly blamed by Dand for the venture's snail's pace growth. 'I started with Pounds 4,000 of my own money. The banks didn't really want to know. Funnily enough one bank told me that if I invested Pounds 6,000 they would loan me a similar amount. I'm not much of a gambler and I'm glad I didn't borrow because of the way interest rates went up. But how can you start a business properly with just Pounds 3,000 of stock?' Dand chose premises on the edge of Leicester where customers can park. The 270 sq ft retail unit carried a yearly rent of Pounds 5,000 (now Pounds 6,000). 'There are shops catering for children and I didn't understand why there were not more shops selling things for elderly people. There is a huge market out there.' As the UK's population includes more than 10.5m of pensionable age, that is probably true. Boots, the chemists, recently introduced a catalogue on gadgets for the elderly and disabled. Nanas &amp; Papas started selling gift items suitable for the older generation, but shifted when a salesman brought in cheap, patterned dresses, perfect for the elderly age bracket and offered them on sale or return. 'They sold really well. So I decided not to sell to people buying gifts for old people but direct to elderly people themselves.' Nanas &amp; Papas sells needle threaders, walking sticks that double as seats, trays for carrying one-handed, electric plugs with handles and cutlery with fat stems for arthritic fingers. There are liberty bodices, socks without elastic for sufferers of thrombosis, pullovers with seams at the front to fit droopy shoulders, bed booties to prevent heel sores, and support tights that help ease varicose veins. Shoes come with wider and deeper fittings than normal. You can also buy oddities like carpet bowls and easy-to-read thermometers . 'The biggest problem was finding suppliers. If you have a dress shop you can just go to a clothes fair. I literally walked round other shops selling some of these things and went to fairs and exhibitions for gifts, shoes, equipment for the disabled and other things I sell.' Another difficulty was locating wholesalers prepared to supply her. 'I wanted some magazines for the elderly but I'm not a newsagent so I couldn't go to a wholesaler. I couldn't use a chemist suppliers because I'm not a pharmacist. I also buy small quantities so I cannot benefit from volume.' Clothing provides the biggest chunk of revenue and margins there are healthy. But most of the gadgets sell on mark ups of about 30 per cent, low for retailing. Advertising has proved a headache. 'It is difficult to advertise to old people. They don't seem to believe anything unless it is passed on by word of mouth. It is also very expensive.' Dand spends about Pounds 1,000 a year on it. A pensioner working on commission travels for her to all the area's residential homes. Dand says that while lack of capital has been a drag on the company's growth, the business could soon earn her about Pounds 10,000 a year. She wants to expand either through mail order or franchising. 'I've found the suppliers so much of the hard work has been done.'

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / The Business Traveller: How to tackle the touts - What can you expect when you step off the aircraft in Latin America? Stephen Fidler guides you to the hotel As Latin America opens up its markets and enjoys an investment boom, more and more foreign business travellers are heading south. They are discovering that the spirit of commerce is thriving in airports all over the region: local 'entrepreneurs' offer to carry suitcases, ferry them to their hotels, or provide other services. Particularly for the traveller who does not speak the local language, it can be a stressful experience. It can be even more disorientating in the northern winter, when the heavily clad voyager exits into the tropical heat of the southern summer. The good news is that, in most of the region, immigration and customs facilities have much improved in recent years. Land crossings may be different, but the airports in most Latin American capitals are not too difficult to cope with. In most places, you can forget about the caricature of a soldier picking through your belongings and awaiting a bribe. Most countries now have red or green customs channels. Others operate a system of random customs checks: travellers press a button, which shows green, for go, or red, at which point you are directed to a desk to answer a few questions and have your luggage looked at. There are exceptions, but most customs officers do not appear to be too worried about visiting foreign business people. There can still be awkward moments, in both passport and customs areas. Some business people say you are less likely to be bothered by customs if you go to Venezuela on a tourist rather than a business visa, for example. Having several computers with you might attract the attention of customs officers in Brazil. But it is outside the customs hall that the main action starts. Of all the most common business destinations in Latin America, the airport where you are most likely to be hassled is Caracas. It is usually hot and sticky, overcrowded and full of locals eager to help with your luggage. In addition, the system of booking an official taxi at most Latin American airports - where you buy a ticket at a booth - seems not to work in Caracas. The booth is there, right next to the bureau de change on the way out, but it usually proves impossible to communicate - in any language - with the people behind the counter. They nod their head or point their lips - this latter gesture is a Venezuelan peculiarity - in the direction of the touts you have been fending off for the last five minutes. When you get outside, you will probably find a 1970s American gas-guzzling car - petrol is still only 5 US cents a litre in Venezuela - to transport you to the hotel. It is best to fix a price beforehand, if you can. Venezuelans pay about Dollars 18; visitors should pay no more than Dollars 25. Drivers may try to charge multiples of that to business people travelling in twos or threes. Don't let them. Be ready, if you arrive during the day, to put up with the miserable traffic jams. If your reception at Caracas airport seems overenthusiastic, it tends to be the opposite in Bogota, where visitors sometimes have to roam the airport looking for a taxi. Once I succumbed to the entreaties of the owners of an unmarked vintage Lada, of whom I was deeply suspicious but who turned out to be charming and drove me to the hotel for a pittance. Taxi drivers in the Colombian capital are all said to carry guns, so I have resolved not to argue with them too vigorously. This can be tough: on one occasion, my cab drove into the side of another taxi at a crossroads and, when I got out, the driver demanded the fare - even though I was still a long way from my destination. I paid. Lima worries some travellers - one US immigration official in Miami (in Miami, mark you) once told me I was going to the 'most dangerous place in the world'. Now the threat of terrorism has receded (not disappeared), the Peruvian capital's airport, though in a perpetual state of reconstruction, is not too much of a hassle. If a taxi is not available, many hotels run buses to and from the airport. Santiago, now overcrowded but soon to open a brand new terminal building, Buenos Aires and Montevideo offer few perils to most travellers. In Mexico City and both of Brazil's main entry points, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, it is a good idea to seek out the taxi booths. In Mexico City one is located just outside the terminal building, while in Brazil the booths of competing taxi companies are indoors. The taxis are clean and safe, the drivers know roughly where they are going, and you can usually pay in local or US currency. Latin America is not like Switzerland: not even in Costa Rica and Uruguay, the self-styled 'Switzerlands' of Central and South America. The best way for the visitor to reduce airport stress is not to fight the local ambience but to enjoy it. While airport entrepreneurs certainly want your money, most prefer to obtain it legally.</p>

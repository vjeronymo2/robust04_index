He  expressed such an opinion after the Visegrad Group summit  attended by President Bill Clinton on Wednesday.    Olechowski said that the "Partnership for Peace" had a  significant influence on European security and stressed that  only democratic countries could take part in this process.    The "Partnership for Peace" initiative consolidates the  possibilities of preserving and restoring peace at the time of  crisis and also gives Poland an access to NATO technologies and  information, as well as to Western early warning systems.    The foreign minister also recalled that Poland signed  treaties with all the neighbouring countries apart from  Lithuania but he stressed that negotiations on the  Polish-Lithuanian treaty were under way and are expected to be  concluded at the end of January.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kiyoshi Iijima, member of the Posts and </F> Telecommunications Advisory Council, and Masayuki Fukuoka,  professor of political science at Hakuo University, by AERA  editor Nobuo Kobayashi; date and place not given]    [Text] Ichiro Ozawa's Strategy    [Kobayashi] Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa tried  to spur the next move to realign political forces. What was his  scheme?    [Iijima] The object of his strategy is to provoke further  splitting of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Ozawa knows  very well what "politics by numbers" is, because he grew up as a  member of the LDP's most powerful faction headed by Kakuei  Tanaka. This is why he is most concerned about the LDP's  strength, which is still above 200 seats in the 511-member Lower  House. This is also why he played the Watanabe card during the  search for a new prime minister [Ozawa tried to split up the LDP  by offering the premiership to LDP faction leader and former  deputy prime minister Michio Watanabe]. Ozawa wanted to preserve  his party leader, Tsutomu Hata, as a future choice for prime  minister, because a "behind-the-scenes strongman" really gives  full play to his ability only when the prime minister is  selected from another political group. Unfortunately, Ozawa was  forced to play the Hata card. Now that he has used up this  precious move, he cannot let the new administration be  short-lived. He thought that the policy accord reached by the  coalition parties was not enough to support the Hata  administration. He keenly felt it was necessary to unite  coalition members into a parliamentary group. This is why he  schemed for the formation of a parliamentary group, called  Kaishin [Reformation]. However, he made a big miscalculation:  The Kaishin project brought about the Social Democratic Party  of Japan's [SDPJ] pullout from the ruling coalition. Ozawa  expected the departure of some SDPJ members who have been  reluctant to participate in the ruling coalition, but he thought  there would be no more than 10 defectors.    [Fukuoka] Ozawa's strategy is aimed at taking control of the  Diet through the influence of Shinseito, which holds only  one-eighth of the seats in the powerful Lower House, by forming  a chain of majority. First, Ozawa wanted to make Shinseito the  largest party in the ruling coalition. Then, he wanted to unite  Shinseito with other parties, such as the Japan New Party [JNP]  and Komeito, to hold 160-180 seats in the Lower House. At the  same time, he wanted to split up the LDP so that his newly  formed party could become the largest single party in the Diet.  By playing the Watanabe card, Ozawa tried to kill two birds  with one stone. Playing the Watanabe card was intended to  trigger further splitting of the LDP, while keeping the Hata  card for later use. Ozawa also wanted to alienate SDPJ Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama [who is a member of the party's left wing]  from the Democrats [a study group consisting of rightist members  of the SDPJ].    However, his calculation went wrong. He could neither  dismantle the LDP nor preserve the Hata card. Moreover, the  SDPJ bolted from the coalition. Ozawa did not anticipate how  SDPJ lawmakers would feel when they abruptly learned about the  formation of Kaishin. Thanks to his rationalistic idea, 99  percent of his plan was successful. However, he made a mistake  at the last moment because of his impetuousness. This brought  about his own ruin.    [Kobayashi] Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] Chairman Keigo  Ouchi decided to join other coalition parties in forming the new  parliamentary group, although he had once placed greater  emphasis on cooperation with the SDPJ and New Party Sakigake.  Why did he change his mind?    [Iijima] Ouchi felt more and more isolated within the ruling  coalition since Sakigake decided to support the Hata  administration from outside of the cabinet. He quickly came  round to the idea of creating a parliamentary group, Kaishin,  because he did not want to join hands with the SDPJ without  Sakigake's presence. Ouchi and DSP Secretary General Takashi  Yonezawa met with Ozawa on 23 April to wrap up their discussions  about Kaishin's formation.    [Kobayashi] May I ask you a simple question? Why does not  Ozawa become prime minister, since he is believed to be the most  influential politician?    [Iijima] It is not correct to say that he would not make  himself prime minister. I should rather say that he cannot  become prime minister, because a strong leader provokes strong  antipathy. Moreover, Ozawa has not yet managed to remove all  apprehensions regarding his health condition [several years ago  he was hospitalized because of heart problems].    Ozawa believes that quality can change quantity. At the same  time, he thinks that the converse is also true. This is why he  seeks too much after quantity. However, quantity and quality  are also contradictory to each other, because what we gain in  quantity we may lose in quality. Ozawa is shy and sensitive by  nature. He does not like to do something striking before  others. He came to acquire the undemocratic way of jumping to a  conclusion by ignoring the process, because he received his  political education from powerful LDP leaders. Although he  fears the LDP's strength in terms of the number of seats in the  Diet, he looks down on each LDP member.    [Fukuoka] I strongly feel his enthusiasm in defying  postwar taboos. Ozawa served late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka,  former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and former Deputy Prime  Minister Shin Kanemaru. All during this time he saw that the  LDP has always managed to steer clear of such questions as the  rice issue and the interpretation of the Constitution's  war-renouncing article. He saw Japanese politics being left to  the mercy of the bureaucrats. This is why he has a preeminent  fighting spirit. He built his own logic by listening to others,  particularly to bureaucrats. His concept of an "ordinary  nation" is an example. Communism has Marx as its matrix. In the  same way, Ozawa's ideology has its own matrix. Ozawa denies  everything outside his framework. For example, Ozawa looks the  other way when reporters ask him about a subject that is  unfamiliar to him.    As he was close to former LDP power broker Shin Kanemaru, he  knows the pleasure of being a behind-the-scenes strongman.  However, at this moment, being a behind-the-scenes strongman  should be a pain rather than a delight, because the political  scenario turned out to be the worst.  <H5>  The Lifeline of the LDP and SDPJ </H5>   [Kobayashi] Ozawa maneuvered behind the scenes to support  LDP faction leader Watanabe in his bid for prime minister. What  frustrated his plot?    [Iijima] The major cause of his failure was that Yasuhiro  Nakasone, Noboru Takeshita, and Kiichi Miyazawa have presented a  united front against him. Ozawa thinks that the end justifies  the means. He set forth an unreasonable argument that Watanabe  would be automatically considered a pro-reform leader if he left  the LDP to join the ruling coalition. Such an argument was  inadmissible to the three ex-prime ministers.    Miyazawa made every effort to prevent his faction members  from deserting, without concealing his grudge against Ozawa, who  had maneuvered behind the scenes to pass a no-confidence motion  against Miyazawa's government. Nakasone dissuaded rank-and-file  members of the Watanabe faction [which is the former Nakasone  faction] from leaving the party, by relieving them of their  anxiety. Nakasone apparently said that he would help them win  re-election.    [Fukuoka] The LDP itself has no strategy. However, the  three ex-prime ministers, who have managed to make Ozawa play  the Hata card, are now examining the possibility of paving the  way for a dissolution of the Lower House. The day his  government comes to an impasse, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will  be forced to dissolve the Lower House instead of having his  cabinet resign, because the ruling coalition has no more  alternatives for prime minister.    The three ex-prime ministers are probably aiming at killing  the political reform legislation by driving the Hata  administration into a corner and by forcing the prime minister  to dissolve the Lower House.    [Kobayashi] Why did the SDPJ bolt from the coalition?    [Iijima] The proverb says, "A baited cat can grow as fierce  as a lion." This applies exactly to the SDPJ. During the  discussions for building a policy platform for the new  government, the SDPJ could not but make vital concessions to  preserve the coalition's unity. The SDPJ also came very close  to being forced to admit Watanabe into the coalition. The SDPJ  was really humiliated. As a reaction, it opted out of the  coalition. It made the decision in one stroke, after it was  deprived of chairmanship of the meeting by coalition  representatives, and after it realized that it might receive  fewer cabinet posts and fewer parliamentary vice-ministerial  posts under the new government.    [Kobayashi] Sakigake had planned to form a grand alliance  with the LDP and SDPJ under the banner of "Protection of the  Peace Constitution." Was the plan really realizable? Will this  scheme come to the fore again in the near future?    [Fukuoka] If Sakigake wants to form an alliance, it has to  prove that it will sacrifice its own interests for the public  good and that it will treat its coalition partners with due  respect. Otherwise, the alliance is not possible. With the  SDPJ's departure from the ruling coalition, the formation of a  liberal alliance between Sakigake and the SDPJ is now possible.    Many SDPJ lawmakers have received a considerable number of  phone calls from their supporters, who favor the formation of a  new government free from Ozawa's influence.    Meanwhile, Sakigake's move to form an alliance for  protection  of the Peace Constitution with some LDP members has not vanished.    [Iijima] I think Sakigake's plan to form an LDP-SDPJ grand  alliance was superficial. Unlike Ozawa, Sakigake leader  Masayoshi Takemura has a too optimistic way of thinking. To  begin with, Takemura thought that if he could persuade former  Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda [a well-known LDP reformist]  into becoming the leader of the alliance for protecting the  Peace Constitution, many other LDP members would follow suit. I  just cannot understand how he can view things as being so simple  and so easy.    [Fukuoka] Morishige Goto, chairman of the 1-million-strong  All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, is eager to  have Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi as a new leader. Goto  hails from Hokkaido, while the Workers' Union belongs to the  Japan Trade Union Confederation or Rengo, the umbrella labor  union group that supports both the SDPJ and DSP. Yokomichi  might become the leader of the liberal forces advocated by  Sakigake. However, on the other hand, Rengo is still in contact  with Ozawa. Rengo is now caught in its own schemes.    Another Political Crisis May Arise in June    [Kobayashi] What is the Hata administration's character?    [Iijima] It is a government controlled by Shinseito. It is  clear that the Hata administration differs from the Hosokawa  administration in character. As a behind-the-scenes strongman,  Ozawa of today is too much in the forefront. There are also too  many shaky factors.    In terms of policy, Ozawa has a tendency to advocate  categorical cooperation with the United States. However, Prime  Minister Hata has slightly different ideas.    [Fukuoka] As foreign minister, Hata was a politician  following in the footsteps of the bureaucrats. However,  concerning Japan's wartime responsibility, Hata's view is rather  close to that of Hosokawa's. Hata values cooperation with the  United States, but he also has his own point of view regarding  Asia. There is a great possibility that friction might arise  between Hata and Ozawa. Will Hata be able to make decisions as  a top leader if such occasions arise? That is the question.    [Kobayashi] Prime Minister Hata was obliged to form a  minority government. Many people think that it will be  short-lived.    [Fukuoka] The situation is that a no-confidence motion  against him can pass the Diet at any time. The LDP will  probably maneuver to pass the motion at an early stage so that  the next general election will take place under the old  electoral system of multiseat constituencies. Another change in  government might happen after the end of June.    [Iijima] The Hata administration might end as a government,  the sole mission of which is to pass the long-stalled fiscal  1994 budget bills. Within the LDP, there is now a widespread  view that the Lower House will be dissolved in July and that the  next general election will be held under the old multiseat  electoral system.    The LDP foresees that the ruling coalition will be forced to  scrap its tax reform plan, which is expected to be presented by  the end of June, because it will certainly be opposed by the  SDPJ. This would give the LDP an opportunity to present a  motion of no- confidence.    [Fukuoka] After the enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget, the  implementation of tax reforms will become a crucial issue. I  also think that people will start crying for an early election  focusing on the tax issue. There might be a general election  under the old multiseat system, in the character of a  quasi-plebiscite on the tax issue. The view regarding the next  political crisis is based on these factors.    If the next general election is held under the multiseat  electoral system, most of the 50 LDP candidates who ended up as  runner-ups in the last election are expected to make comebacks.  All of them might not remain with the LDP, but it is probable  that the LDP will get about 25 more seats in the Lower House.  Ozawa is aware of that, but the problem is that he does not  have any good moves to make. The day the Hata administration  comes to an impasse, it will hardly be possible for Ozawa to  tide over the crisis by having the cabinet resign as a makeshift  measure. The only way left is to split up the LDP somehow or  other so that the framework of the coalition can be changed. If  it is not possible, dissolving the Lower House for a general  election is unavoidable. However, since the LDP does not have  any workable strategy, the question is whether the Hata  administration will be able to avoid a deadlock until summer or  not.    [Iijima] I doubt if Ozawa really thinks highly of Hata and  if he really wants to make the Hata administration a  full-fledged government.    Probably, Hajime Funada [Ozawa's close aide] is Ozawa's real  choice for future prime minister. It seems to me that Ozawa is  trying to preserve his influential power until Funada gets  trained to be an executor of national reformation.  <H5>  What Will Political Realignment Bring? </H5>   [Kobayashi] What will be the pivot in the next phase of  political realignment?    [Fukuoka] As Sakigake has been saying, there was a  methodological problem. At least, it is certain that Ozawa's  top- down approach to decisionmaking, his way of making a tool  of Watanabe, and his quantity-oriented approach, are  undemocratic.    Policy goals will no longer be the pivot in the next phase  of  political realignment. The new pivot will be such factors as  the method or the sense of values.    [Iijima] People will care more about political ideology.  Freedom is contradictory to equality in some respects.  Protection and regulation are aimed at equalizing some one with  another one. Ozawa wants impartiality and equality.    Impartiality indicates equal opportunity. Here, the  principle of competition comes into play. We should be aware  that competition might bring about unequal results. The idea  that opposes equal opportunity is equal results.    As for foreign policy, there is the U.S.-oriented diplomacy  against the diplomacy focusing on China and other Asian  countries.    A two-party system will probably take shape after two or  three elections are held under the new single-seat electoral  system.    [Fukuoka] Shinseito's and Komeito's constituencies are  basically different. So I do not understand why the LDP does  not devise a stratagem to divide the Shinseito-Komeito bloc.    Tax reform will be the next pivot. If the Government wants  to introduce the principle of free competition, it will have to  lighten the middle class's tax burden. If indirect taxes are  increased, this will automatically cast a heavier burden upon  people in the lower income brackets.    [Iijima] If the LDP remains as it is, it will dwindle away  into nothing. There is no powerful leader capable of  supervising some 200 LDP members of the Lower House. Since the  party has so many members with so many different ideas, I think  the LDP would better effect divorce by agreement to form two  different parties.    If the party bears a different name, people will regard it  as  a new party, even if the personnel are the same. For instance,  Shinseito was formed by those who defected from the LDP faction  once controlled by Shin Kanemaru. In the last general election,  Shinseito's polling score increased about 20 percent compared  with the previous election.    [Fukuoka] So you propose a fake divorce?    [Iijima] Whether or not the LDP will be able to cope with  Ozawa's strategy will depend on if the LDP effects divorce by  agreement, or if it breaks up after falling into Ozawa's snare.    The LDP can split into two political groups on its own  initiative. The first group would associate itself with the  SDPJ, and the second group would try to form an alliance with  the first group and the SDPJ. Some LDP members are already  moving into this direction following the departure of the SDPJ  from the ruling coalition.</p>

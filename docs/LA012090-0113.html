			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: FIVE BASKETBRAWLERS ARE PUT ON PROBATION  </P> <P> Five members of the North Carolina A&amp;T basketball team were put on  probation Friday for their part in a brawl in which seven people were injured.  </P> <P> The five players will be allowed to play in the next game.  </P> <P> Under NCAA rules, if a player is involved in a first-offense fight, he is  placed on a one-game probation. A second fight results in a one-game suspension  and a third means suspension for an entire season.  </P> <P> North Carolina A&amp;T Coach Don Corbett said at a news conference Friday that  he would review videotape of Thursday night's home game against North Carolina  Central, and would determine if further action is necessary. No action has been  taken by North Carolina Central.  </P> <P> Seven people -- two city police officers, one campus security officer and four  students -- were treated for cuts and bruises and released, said a spokeswoman  for Moses Cone Memorial Hospital in Greensboro, N.C.  </P> <P> "My first recollection was somebody left Central's bench without a uniform on,"  Moss said. "I saw the guy leave the bench and then everybody got involved.  </P> <P> "I want to look at the game film to see who ran onto the floor from each bench  because there's a rule about that."  </P></p>

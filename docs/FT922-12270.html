			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Post-modern test for government: America If we want to continue to be number one, we need to transcend the legacy of modernism - modern thought and modern institutions, including bureaucracy. You know how different American society is today compared to 1960 or even 1970. We're different; we're post-modern. Yet the government has not kept up. People sense it intuitively: modern government is trying to run a post-modern society, and it is failing.' I quote from a speech by Mr James Pinkerton, a policy adviser at the White House. Mr Pinkerton, a conservative, is in the vanguard of a cross-party movement urging a wholesale reform of the US public sector. The closest thing to a bible for the movement is a new book, Reinventing Government, by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler (Addison Wesley, Dollars 22.95). Prominent figures praising the book include Governor Bill Clinton, the leading Democratic presidential contender, who has described it as a 'blueprint' for the revitalisation of government. The first powerful critique of modern bureaucracy dates from the 1960s when US economists James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock invented a doctrine known as 'public choice'. This highlighted an apparent inconsistency in market economics. Traditional theory assumes that individuals seek to maximise their personal well-being: consumers maximise utility or satisfaction while businessmen maximise profits. Strangely, however, economists assumed that when individuals became bureaucrats, they would work for the broader public interest. Public choice says this is a naive assumption. Bureaucrats are as self-serving as anybody else. They are typically interested in retaining their jobs, gaining promotion and expanding their sphere of influence. In tightly run organisations, they will mainly seek to please their immediate superiors. But often, if they cannot be fired, they will please themselves. The last thing we should assume is that civil servants are motivated only by the goals of their distant political masters. Such arguments helped justify the Reagan-Thatcher assault on big government. The post-modernist critique of government is less harsh. Rather than directly impugning the motives of civil servants, it claims they are trapped in organisational structures that no longer function. What is meant by post-modern? Mr Pinkerton offers a few colourful examples. 'Network TV is modern - you watch what they put on. Cable is post-modern - you have a choice. The postal service is modern. Faxing and E-mailing are post-modern. Plastic surgery is modern. Staying out of the sun is post-modern.' Modernism, which dates from the late 19th century, is thus associated with mass production, uniformity, and predictability; post-modernism with flexibility, choice and personal responsibility. 'Our thesis is simple,' write Osborne and Gaebler: 'the kind of governments that developed during the industrial era, with their sluggish, centralised bureaucracies, their preoccupation with rules and regulations, and their hierarchical chains of command, no longer work very well.' They regard modern bureaucracies as a hangover from the days of Henry Ford, who pioneered assembly-lines and other techniques of mass production. In industry, post-modernists' battle cry is 'flexible specialisation': small companies with highly qualified, adaptable workforces are seen as more likely to cope with competitive threats and rapid technological change than Fordist dinosaurs. But what would post-modernist policies mean for the public sector? Osborne and Gaebler try to dissolve apprehension by stressing their deep faith in government and their admiration for individual bureaucrats. They set out 10 principles for reform which are too tedious to repeat. Most have a familiar ring for those who lived through the Thatcher years: for example, treat people as customers, encourage competition between service providers, decentralise decisions and focus on outcomes rather than inputs. Their view that government 'should steer not row' is still radical in a US context: remember that the UK education and health care reforms of the 1980s were a bigger challenge to the status quo than anything attempted in America. In the US the litmus test will be education. The high school system - set up at the turn of the century to prepare students for big business - is quintessentially modern (as opposed to post-modern). In most areas, children are allocated to large schools run on rigid, bureaucratic principles by school boards. Post-modernists favour the introduction of a voucher system giving parents freedom to choose schools and headteachers much greater autonomy. If the high schools are eventually overhauled along such lines, the US will have rejected the existing public sector paradigm. There is a kernel of truth in the public choice and post-modernist critiques, which share a distrust of current arrangements. But the former is too cynical - there is such a thing as a public service ethic - while the latter probably exaggerates the pace at which society is changing. In the long-run, however, as more people get wealthier, the demand for customised products and services will grow, forcing a less monolithic approach in the bits of the public sector that survive.</p>

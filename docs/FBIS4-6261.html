At the end of the visit, the head of the group wrote in the  visitor's book that the studio is a comprehensive creative base  showing how excellent the Korean art and fine arts are.    Former Prime Minister of Egypt Aziz Sedky said all the works  of the studio fully show the Korean art which is very excellent  and charming.    The group visited the Pyongyang metro.    After the visit Mark P. Barry, director of Research of the  Summit Council for World Peace, said this metro is the most  beautiful, excellent and clean in the world.

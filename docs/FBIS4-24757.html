			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, June 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton  arrived here today to begin a week-long commemoration of the  50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Europe during the  Second World War.    Italy is the first stop on his European trip, which also  takes him to Britain and France.    During the three-day stay here Clinton will meet Italian  President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Prime Minister S. Berlusconi  to discuss bilateral relations between the countries, the  current situation in Europe and particularly that in Bosnia.    The two will also examine the preparations for the summit of  the Group of Seven industrialized nations to be held in Naples,  Italy, next month.    Clinton is also expected to reaffirm his support for the new  Italian Government.    According to sources Berlusconi will stress that Italy  should  not be excluded in efforts to settle the crisis in Bosnia. He  will also point out to the U.S. President that Italy would not  be idle in the process for a proposed increase of permanent  seats in the U.N. Security Council.    Clinton will lay a wreath at the tomb of U.S. soldiers in  Nettuno, who landed there in World War Two.    Political pundits say that Clinton's Europe trip is designed  to reaffirm trans-Atlantic ties and to boost his image back home  which has been adversely affected recently by a series of  personal and public crises.</p>

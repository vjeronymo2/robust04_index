			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / People: Argyll Tony Frendo, managing director, finance and administration, and a main board director at ARGYLL, the food retailing group, is resigning at the end of the month to pursue other business interests. Frendo, 46, says that after 20 years with two companies - 10 with Sir James Goldsmith's Cavenham group, and 10 with Argyll - and after more than eight years in the same job, he is looking for a new challenge. At Argyll, such a challenge might have been presented by the chief executive's job, but that role recently went to Colin Smith, previously finance director. 'I have got to the point where I would like more variety,' says Frendo. 'I would like to move away from a mainstream job with one company, to taking up a series of directorships, working with different people.' He says an example of that might be representing a venture capital business on the board of another company. He believes he has a number of skills to offer, especially in integrating new acquisitions. At Argyll, he was deeply involved in integrating Safeway, acquired in 1987. As for as his immediate plans, Frendo says he is 'pursuing a number of things, but they are at an early stage'.</p>

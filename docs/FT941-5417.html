			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Rise in fears for future of manual jobs Britain's manual workers have grown increasingly pessimistic over the past month about job prospects, according to the latest in a series of monthly surveys for the Financial Times, published today. The survey, conducted by MORI, the pollsters, for Industrial Relations Services, the pay and employment analysts, showed that while 48 per cent of all workers said they were very or fairly concerned about becoming jobless in the next 12 months - compared with 44 per cent in January - as many as 58 per cent of manual workers asked in February were worried about their employment. This compared with 47 per cent of manual workers who expressed concern in January. An upsurge of anxiety has also occurred among workers aged between 35 and 54, with the proportion expressing concern rising by 11 percentage points to 54 per cent. By contrast there was a decline in concern among the over-55s from 41 per cent to 34 per cent in January. Forty-five per cent of those aged under 34 were worried, a percentage point less than in the previous month. The rise in anxiety has been greatest in the Midlands, where the proportion has risen from 41 per cent to 52 per cent. This may reflect local worries about job losses in after BMW's decision to acquire Rover. Today's figures also confirmed a trend that has been persistent since the survey began last April, which is that part-time workers appear less worried about redundancy than those in full-time jobs. Last month 49 per cent of full-time workers were worried about losing their job compared with 42 per cent in part-time employment. A further sign of a deterioration in expectations of recovery can be found in MORI's so-called 'misery index' which is compiled from both its economic optimism index and its fear of redundancy survey. The higher the index, the more miserable the public. Last month the overall index stood at 34 per cent, the second highest figure  -after October's - since the survey began. Misery is worst among manual workers, with a figure of 41 per cent, compared with 36 per cent in January. The survey is based on interviews between February 24 and February 28 with 1,007 adults aged 18 and over who work full-time or part-time across 149 constituency sampling points in the UK.</p>

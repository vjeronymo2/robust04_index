			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives markets provided one of the few areas in which would-be investors in UK equities could register their opinion of the Budget speech yesterday, writes Terry Byland. The December Footsie future was active in after-hours' trading, successfully warding off minor profit-taking to show a final reading of 3,190, a premium of 20 points against the official close on the cash market. With fair value now estimated at around 2 points, even less in some quarters, the contract was signalling a strong start for share prices today. Trading volume, brisk ahead of Mr Clarke's speech, increased sharply as he addressed the House of Commons, and the December contract finally returned total turnover of just above 20,000 deals, the highest for many months. Many of the late deals reflected position-taking by equity marketmakers ahead of today's opening of business in the stock market. Earlier in the session, the contract had moved from 3,150, with a pause for profit-taking in the early afternoon. Traders expressed caution at the close, commenting that equity prices would be vulnerable today if there were any sign of demand slackening. In traded options, business was moderate, and died away before the chancellor spoke. Volume of 45,791 contracts compared with 47,118 on Monday. The Euro FT-SE option topped the actives list, recording 3,834 deals. Among individual stock options, Lasmo (3,215 lots traded) had another busy day as oil prices weakened. British Steel (2,722), BP (2,611) and GEC (1,256) were also active.</p>

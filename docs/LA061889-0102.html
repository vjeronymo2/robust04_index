			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MEDICINE BEHIND BARS: QUALITY CARE IS ELUSIVE, DESPITE LAWSUITS;  </P> <P> HOSTILE PUBLIC, SHORTAGE OF GOOD DOCTORS AND NURSES WORSEN PRISON PROBLEM  </P> <P> Medicine behind bars begins with the fundamental paradox of caring for misfits  banished from a society that couldn't care less about their well-being.  </P> <P> This and a heap of more specific problems add up to a constant struggle.  </P> <P> Doctors and nurses, in great demand in the outside world, must be recruited to  work for civil service wages in steel-barred surroundings. The National Health  Service Corps, a federal program that allowed doctors to pay off education  loans by working in prisons, was dismantled by the Ronald Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> Convicts bring a hodgepodge of untreated ailments into prison. Overcrowded  cellblocks sizzle with fear of AIDS, tuberculosis and other contagious  diseases, and prisons are being forced to open costly geriatric wards for  graying inmates with heart or lung disease and other chronic conditions.  </P> <P> One source of relief from many other societal ills, the state legislator, has  been more likely to dole out condemnation than compassion for criminals -- who  cannot vote.  </P> <P> Inmates' advocates say that quality medical care in prisons remains elusive  despite court orders, national guidelines and more money grudgingly given.  </P> <P> "There's a general contradiction in providing health services and locking  people up in steel cages. Prisons deform everybody," said Robert Cohen, former  medical director at New York City's Rikers Island Prison and an expert medical  witness.  </P> <P> Armond Start, medical director of the Wisconsin prison system, added: "Prisons  are the most anti-therapeutic places there are."  </P> <P> Most Americans seem indifferent to what happens inside prisons.  </P> <P> "Prisoners are a pariah kind of constituency," said Edward Koren of the  American Civil Liberties Union. "We treat them like garbage. You leave it  outside in the trash can and don't want to see it again. Nobody cares -- unless  it comes back again."  </P> <P> Minnesota inmate Henry Jackson, a 69-year-old sex offender who has diabetes and  high blood pressure, said: "We're just dogs. We're nothing."  </P> <P> Medical care for inmates is a legal obligation, however.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that "deliberate indifference to serious  medical problems of inmates constitutes cruel and unusual punishment." The  decision made prisoners the only U.S. citizens who are guaranteed medical care  at government expense.  </P> <P> Having the right to care does not guarantee Mayo Clinic-style treatment,  however. No federal or state authority has spelled out what constitutes  adequate medical attention, so it remains a matter of court interpretation.  Since 1982, only 10% of the nation's 600 prisons have complied with guidelines  offered by medical professionals.  </P> <P> The following court cases illustrate some of the problems in prisons since the  guidelines were issued:  </P> <P> * Six inmates in a Pittsburgh prison died within the last two years under  "appalling, shocking and dangerously inadequate" conditions, according to  Cohen, who testified in May in a federal lawsuit brought by several inmates.  Cohen said that one AIDS-afflicted prisoner died of pneumonia, a diabetic died  from lack of insulin and the other deaths resulted from improper diagnoses and  treatments of heart attacks and cancer.  </P> <P> * In Minnesota's Stillwater Prison, a third of the 1,200 inmates and at least  five guards contracted tuberculosis between 1982 and 1986. The first case was  not diagnosed until six months after the inmate sought treatment, and  corrections officials waited until two years after inmates filed suit to test  for the airborne bacterium in the prison.  </P> <P> * A 25-year-old convict died in May, 1987, after suffering an asthma attack at  Deer Island House of Corrections, a pre-Civil War lockup near Boston. According  to a pending wrongful-death suit, the man was turned away from the infirmary at  the 8 p.m. lockup, and the guards who dragged him to his cell ignored agony so  intense that the inmate urinated as he was hauled up three flights of stairs.  </P> <P> * Hospitalized inmates from Rikers Island were shackled to bed frames and  watched by guards until 20 months ago. Among them were AIDS patients, pregnant  women and life-support patients.  </P> <P> "They were too ill to get out of bed, much less get out of the building," said  Dale Wilker of the Prisoners Rights Project, which sued to have the shackles  unlocked.  </P> <P> * At New York's Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, several patients  had to be hospitalized because dentist Donald Collings' drill slipped in their  mouths while he was drunk, according to a 1984 suit filed by the Prisoners  Rights Project. Collings resigned and the state paid damages of $650,000.  </P> <P> Medical care remains a frequent topic of lawsuits filed by U.S. inmates, whose  numbers reached a record 627,402 in January.  </P> <P> Courts have ordered eight states and Puerto Rico to improve the medical care in  their prison systems, and are demanding corrective actions at individual  prisons in 30 other states. Lawsuits are pending in five states, according to  the ACLU.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Obvious Improvements  </P> <P> But there is unanimous agreement that prison medical care has improved since  the courts got involved.  </P> <P> Robert Brutsche, who retired last year after 19 years as medical director of  the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said the quality of care "improved by light  years. The changes are like night and day."  </P> <P> One indication of progress is the amount of money being dedicated to the  problem. The states spent $80 million on prison health care in 1975 and $215  million in 1980, according to a survey conducted by the Associated Press. The  costs this year will be about $1 billion, or about 8% of the $16 billion it  costs to house inmates, according to national estimates.  </P> <P> Michigan spends the most, an average of $7.58 a day, for its inmates' medical  care, according to Corrections Yearbook. Hawaii spends the least, $1.14 a day.  The national average is $3.57.  </P> <P> The tide began to turn 15 years ago, when federal Judge Frank Johnson found  "barbarous" and "shocking" conditions in Alabama and for the first time placed  an entire state system under federal control.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge's Complaints  </P> <P> Johnson said that "unsupervised prisoners without formal training regularly  pull teeth, screen sick-call patients, dispense as well as administer  medication, give injections, take X-rays, suture and perform minor surgery."  </P> <P> The conditions, which inmates' attorney Matthew Myers called "symptomatic of a  national crisis," included these atrocities:  </P> <P> * A quadriplegic's bedsores developed into open wounds and became infested with  maggots. His bandages weren't changed in the month before his death.  </P> <P> * An inmate who required intravenous feedings received no nourishment for three  days before he died.  </P> <P> * An inmate who had suffered a stroke was forced to sit on a bench so he  wouldn't soil his bed. He fell so frequently that his legs became swollen and  crippled, and he died a day after one leg was amputated.  </P> <P> Alabama improved conditions enough that federal control was lifted last  December. One problem Alabama shared with other states was that unlicensed  doctors were hired to practice on inmates. It was the first state to contract  with a private company that supplied licensed physicians; now, all or part of  medicine in the prisons of 29 states is handled by such contractors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doc Holiday Syndrome  </P> <P> "The norm 15 years ago was a broken-down doctor with an institutional license,  someone who couldn't practice on the outside because he was too old, too sick  or an alcoholic," said Dr. Jay Anno of the National Commission on Correctional  Health Care.  </P> <P> At about the time the courts began demanding improvements, health-advocacy  groups were reacting to conditions exposed through rioting at several prisons,  including the 1971 uprising at Attica, N. Y.  </P> <P> In 1982, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care identified 71  minimum standards for medical care in prisons. About 60 prisons have met the  standards.  </P> <P> The guidelines recommend medical screening of all incoming inmates, daily  access to sick call, 24-hour nursing care in hospital wards and uniform  licensing standards and regulation of doctors, nurses and other personnel.  </P> <P> While most state prisons now employ only reputable physicians, problems with  doctors persist. Many facilities have hired graduates of foreign medical  schools who understand little English.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Communication Difficult  </P> <P> "That doesn't necessarily mean they're quacks. Their English is terrible and  they have a hard time communicating," said William Rold of the Prisoners Rights  Project in New York.  </P> <P> Prison doctors may also treat ailments for which they have no training. In the  1970s, a gynecologist did dental exams at Bedford Hills, the Prisoners Rights  Project said. In another New York prison, a pathologist practiced general  medicine and a pediatrician served as an internist.  </P> <P> Low salary is one of the biggest barriers to attracting doctors.  </P> <P> Hawaii, for example, pays prison doctors $35,000 a year -- and a third of the  nursing jobs in Hawaii prisons are unfilled.  </P> <P> "What doctor in his right mind would want to practice medicine for  civil-service pay under harsh conditions for a group of patients that doesn't  like or trust him?" Curtis Prout, director of the internship program at Harvard  Medical School, asked.  </P> <P> Or, as Dr. Ronald Shansky, medical director of the Illinois prison system, put  it: "No one goes to medical school and says, 'Boy, when I get out, I'm going to  go to a prison and make my mark.'

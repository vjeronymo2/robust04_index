BRIEFING;  </P> <P> VITRO EXTENDS ANCHOR GLASS OFFER  </P> <P> Vitro S.A. of Mexico said today it is extending until next Thursday the  expiration of its $280-million, $20-a-share, cash tender offer for Anchor Glass  Container Corp., which has resisted the bid.  </P> <P> Last month, the board of Tampa, Fla.-based Anchor Glass concluded Vitro's offer  was inadequate and adopted a "poison-pill" anti-takeover plan. The matter is  now before a Chancery Court in Delaware, where Anchor Glass is incorporated.  </P></p>

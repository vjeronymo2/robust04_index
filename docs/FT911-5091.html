			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / ICL complains to Brussels over state aid to Bull ICL, the UK-based computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan, has written to the European Commission and to the British government complaining about state aid to Bull, the French computer maker. Commission officials said yesterday they expected further complaints from other European computer manufacturers. The Commission has already begun examining the French government's proposed FFr4bn capital injection to Bull, which lost a record FFr6.8bn last year. Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL's chairman, said in letters to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner in charge of competition policy, and to Mr Peter Lilley, the UK trade and industry secretary, that aid to Bull would distort the European computer market. He also said that French state aid to Bull could encourage other computer companies to seek grants from their own governments. The letters added that allowing state aid for Bull would be contrary to the EC's commitment to establishing an open and competitive single market. Bull greeted the ICL complaint with open irritation. 'Such a letter could not have been drafted in London, but by Fujitsu,' said a senior company official. ICL's relations with other European computer companies have suffered since it was purchased by Fujitsu last year. Europe's biggest semiconductor research project, the Joint European Submicron Silicon (Jessi) initiative, last month expelled ICL from three of the five projects in which it was participating because of its Japanese links. ICL was also expelled from the European Information Technology Round Table, a lobby group, last January.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Clouds over Australia-NZ trade relations - 'Open skies' freeze is latest sign of slower integration The decision by the Australian government last week to freeze moves towards 'open skies' with New Zealand underlines the extent to which progress in the broader trade relationship between the two countries has stalled. Precisely why the Australian authorities chose to deny Air New Zealand's right to fly domestic Australian routes from today, which it was not, in any case, planning to do immediately, is not clear. The official explanation is that the two countries have yet to set up the borderless visa and customs arrangements which were due to accompany 'open skies' and to reach an agreed stance on airline ownership and control matters. But this is not the whole story. One possibility is that the Australian government wants to protect Qantas, the country's flagship carrier, before floating its 75 per cent interest in the airline next year. A second view is that the Australian authorities are more interested in achieving a further rationalisation of Australasian air services - perhaps via an alliance between Air New Zealand and Ansett, the Australian carrier that already flies domestically within New Zealand. This would extend the duopoly in the Australian market across the Tasman. The stalling in the broader trade relationship between the two countries is in sharp contrast to the 1980s, when big steps were taken towards the creation of a single trans-Tasman trade bloc. In 1983, the two countries signed a 'Closer Economic Relations' (CER) pact under which they pledged to create a trans-Tasman free-trade zone for manufactured goods. The CER was reviewed in 1988 and the date for free trade brought forward by five years to July 1990. At that stage, the two countries also agreed to free trade in services, except for certain exempted sectors such as aviation and telecommunications. They also promised to deepen the trade relationship through the harmonisation of business law and quarantine/customs procedures, and pledged to remove technical barriers to trade, such as product standards laws. Since then, the tempo has slowed, leaving some important issues unaddressed. There has, for example, been no visible progress on key taxation matters - such as mutual recognition of franking credits to stop double taxation of dividends paid by trans-Tasman companies - or on corporate/business law. Explanations for the change in pace are various. First, while benefits of the CER have accrued to both countries, New Zealand is widely thought to have been the greater beneficiary. Australia is New Zealand's biggest buyer of manufactured goods, taking about a fifth of its exports. By contrast, New Zealand accounts for about 6 per cent of Australia's exports. Indeed, five years ago Australia's Bureau of Industry Economics forecast that New Zealanders would get around eight times more benefit per head than Australians. On a longer-term view, 30 years ago, Australia exported to its neighbour four times the amount that it imported. The balance has shifted dramatically in New Zealand's favour: in the year to June, Australian exports to New Zealand were ADollars 4bn (USDollars 2.9bn) and its imports were ADollars 3.2bn. That said, the rate of growth in Australian exports to New Zealand (about 19 per cent) has outstripped import growth (15-16 per cent) over the past two years. Nevertheless, some New Zealanders suspect Canberra may have decided that the uneven benefits had gone far enough and that, in the case of the 'open skies' policy, separate though it is from the CER, it was time for redress. A second factor is more political. The relationship between Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, and Mr Jim Bolger, his New Zealand counterpart, is supposedly cordial. Nevertheless, Sir Frank Holmes, professor emeritus with the Institute of Policy Studies in Wellington, thinks that the last Australian election, when the Liberal party endorsed much of New Zealand's hard-nosed economic reform programme, soured Mr Keating's attitude towards Australia's neighbour. There is a feeling that Mr Keating would now like to widen the gap between the two. A third factor may be that both countries are looking towards the fast-growing Asian markets for further export growth. This tends to dim-inish the significance of the trans-Tasman relationship - although the CER has been promoted as a model for the region and there are joint efforts to link it to Afta, the free trade agreement between the Association of South-East Asian Nations. At the same time, New Zealand and Australia are competing to sell themselves as English-speaking gateways into the region. In New Zealand there is some disquiet. There is talk of a new lobby group to give the CER a new push. Mr Ted Woodford, the former New Zealand high commissioner in Canberra, said recently that it had lost its momentum and that it was important for moves to be made at a political level to reinforce its good features. The aviation dispute seems a step in the wrong direction.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Chase recovery continues with 29% rise in profits A 29 per cent rise in Chase Manhattan's third-quarter net profits showed that the recovery is continuing at the big New York bank that has spent the past two years slashing costs and changing its strategy. Chase, which has reduced its workforce by 8,000 people and reorganised itself to concentrate on retail banking in the New York area and wholesale banking globally, turned in Dollars 176m (Pounds 102.3m) of third-quarter net income. This translates into earnings per share of 94 cents, compared with 79 cents a year ago. Although the Chase results were helped by an increase in net interest revenues - from Dollars 863m a year ago to Dollars 898m in the third quarter just ended - the bank is still coping with higher bad debt provisions, especially related to its loan exposure in the depressed US commercial property market. The third-quarter provision for possible loan losses was Dollars 320m, compared with Dollars 265m a year ago. The bank said it expected such provisions to continue at relatively high levels. Net loan write-offs totalled Dollars 321m, almost half the Dollars 656m level of a year ago. At the end of September Chase had Dollars 7.4bn of domestic commercial property loans on its books, down from Dollars 8.9bn a year ago. Some Dollars 2.23bn of these loans were classified as non-performing, down slightly from Dollars 2.36bn a year before. For the first nine months of 1992 Chase achieved Dollars 470m of net profits, up from Dollars 385m in the same period last year. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 915m, up from Dollars 770m in the same period of 1991. However, net loan write-offs in the first nine months of 1992 fell to Dollars 912m from Dollars 1.6bn in the first three quarters of last year. Mr Tom Labrecque, chairman, said the third-quarter results reflected the bank's programme of building its core businesses. He said Chase had further strengthened its capital base, reaching a Tier One ratio (capital as a percentage of net risk-weighted assets) of 6.5 per cent, up from 5.2 per cent a year ago. Chase's return on assets rose to 0.71 per cent from 0.53 per cent in September 1991. The bank's return on equity was 12 per cent, up from 10.5 per cent a year ago. Wall Street reacted favourably to the Chase earnings figures, marking the bank's share price Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 23 3/8.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Airtours warns of higher interim losses Airtours, the travel group, yesterday warned shareholders to expect a significant increase in half-year losses as a result of recent acquisitions. Mr David Crossland, chairman, told the AGM yesterday that while bookings were up, new acquisitions meant that seasonal profit fluctuations were likely to be higher. Holiday companies usually incur losses over the winter months and make their profits in the summer. In the first six months of last year, Airtours recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 15.9m, including nearly Pounds 9m spent on its unsuccessful bid for rival tour company Owners Abroad. Full-year pre-tax profits increased by 25 per cent to Pounds 45.5m. Mr Crossland said holiday bookings for winter 1993-94 were currently up 46 per cent on the same time last year. Summer 1994 bookings were ahead 56 per cent. Over the past two years, Airtours has purchased Aspro, a tour operator, and the Hogg Robinson and Pickfords travel agency chains. Hogg Robinson and Pickfords have been combined to form a chain called Going Places.</p>

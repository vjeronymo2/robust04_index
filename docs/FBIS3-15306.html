The press service cites the legal  findings of Pavel Yefgrafov, head of the Crimean Supreme Soviet  State-Legal Department, which note that "in view of the internal  discrepancy between the Ukrainian Constitution and legislation,  it is extremely difficult to bring the Constitution and  legislation of the Republic of Crimea into line with them." The  press service has accused the Ukrainian Supreme Council of  attempting to take even limited sovereignty away from the  Republic of Crimea.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLANE-NOISE STUDY AT EL TORO CREATES LAND-USE DOUBTS  </P> <P> A new study projecting future aircraft noise around the U.S. Marine Corps Air  Station at El Toro is causing concern among public officials and developers who  fear that the findings could upset land-use plans and halt nearby home  construction.  </P> <P> Both the city of Irvine and the Irvine Co. have expressed reservations about  the Marine Corps draft study, which is the first step in a formal reassessment  of the El Toro base's impact on surrounding communities when the base replaces  older aircraft with new fighters.  </P> <P> Under Orange County and Irvine land-use policies, the so-called "noise  contours" around airports and military air bases limit the development of  homes, and to a lesser extent, offices and stores. The noise lines look much  like elevation contours on a topographic map.  </P> <P> Military and city officials have three noise-measurement plans before them: one  measuring aircraft decibel levels the current way, the second measuring noise  on an "average day," including holidays and weekends, and a third that measures  noise on an "average busy-day" basis. The latter would register more noise and  the "average-day" measurement would gauge the least, officials say.  </P> <P> "We like to be able to rely on (noise) lines that hold up over time," said  Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. "This has been the continuing problem with the Marine  Corps. . . . The rules of the game seem to change every five years, based upon  new studies. . . . That kind of development renders the whole planning process  somewhat of a joke."  </P> <P> Larry Thomas, an Irvine Co. vice president, said, "What up until now has been a  certainty, with respect to the (planning) interests of the city and the company  and the Marine Corps, now potentially has been made more uncertain. . . . It's  the prospect of that uncertainty . . . that has gotten our attention."  </P> <P> City and county officials have said the new noise contours could prevent  residential development of property owned by the Irvine Company west of the  so-called El Toro "Y" freeway interchange.  </P> <P> It also could affect some development in the Aliso Viejo and Foothill Ranch  communities, officials said.  </P> <P> However, Col. Jack Wagner, community plans and liaison officer for Marine Corps  bases in California and Arizona, said the new noise lines will have little  impact on nearby neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "They're planting a lot of bum soup in the community," Wagner said. "The number  of (aircraft) operations is declining. The noise lines are shrinking more than  they are increasing. . . . What's the complaint?"  </P> <P> The noise study is the first step in a formal process to reassess the  relationship between the air station and the surrounding residential and  commercial areas. Known as the Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ)  program, the reassessment should be completed by September.  </P> <P> Both Orange County and Irvine will base many planning decisions on the noise  study, which will include the new noise contours. Although the Marine Corps  provides the data, the planning decisions are the responsibility of the local  governments.  </P> <P> The Marines undertook the new study because they are retiring older A-4 and A-6  attack aircraft and replacing them with the modern F/A-18 Hornet fighters,  which have different noise characteristics.  </P> <P> The draft noise study projects 65,187 annual jet operations at El Toro  beginning in 1992. The figure includes landings, takeoffs and overhead  maneuvers. A 1981 study projected up to 72,000 annual flight operations for the  foreseeable future, but flight operations dipped significantly in 1986, 1987  and 1988 as the Marines retired older aircraft.  </P> <P> Local officials are uncertain about what the study will mean for land-use  planning largely because of a new wrinkle introduced by Navy officials here.  The Marine Corps is officially a part of the Department of the Navy.  </P> <P> The complication is a new, alternative noise measurement included in the El  Toro draft study that differs from measurements used in previous studies.  Current noise contours and the land-use plans based on them were last  established in the 1981 study.  </P> <P> The previous studies based noise contours on aircraft landings, takeoffs and  training maneuvers conducted during an "average day" of operation. Because very  few flights are scheduled at El Toro on weekends and holidays, the average-day  noise level is significantly lower than the level on a normal operating day.  </P> <P> While the new study also includes an average-day measurement, it adds an  additional measurement of noise levels on an "average busy day," when normal  operations are being conducted. Contours for the average busy day are, by  definition, larger and include more area than contours for the average day.  </P> <P> The key line on the new noise maps is one that measures the area where the  aircraft noise level is 65 decibels or greater. County and city planning  policies, based on state noise standards, generally prohibit residential  development within the 65-decibel line, and restrict commercial development in  the area.  </P> <P> The average-day 65-decibel line in the new study actually encompasses a smaller  area than the existing 65-decibel line set in 1981, Wagner said.  </P> <P> However, the 65-decibel line for the average busy day in most areas lies well  outside the existing boundary, raising the possibility that local governments  would restrict development in a larger area than previously planned.  </P> <P> "What is the real noise impact on the ground to the people who are hearing the  noise?" asked Alan Zusman, the Navy's noise-measurement study manager. Zusman  said the Navy's goal is to come up with the best available measurement of the  impact of aircraft noise on the people who hear it in surrounding areas.  </P> <P> The "average-day" measurement may underestimate that actual impact, Zusman  said. "So we decided another way to do it was look at the average busy day,  when a station is in normal operation."  </P> <P> But Wagner at El Toro said the Marines will recommend that local governments  adopt the more lenient average-day standard because that was the method used in  the last noise study.  </P> <P> "The previous AICUZ (noise-measurement) studies have served the city and the  county and the Marine Corps well for land-use planning purposes for over 15  years. Let's not change techniques if they've served us well," Wagner said.  </P> <P> "You have to compare the average day with the average day," he said. "Do not  look at . . . average busy day. The final line will be based on average day, it  will not be based on average busy day."  </P> <P> The head of Orange County's Environmental Management Agency, Michael M. Ruan,  said the county probably will go along with the Marines' recommendation.  </P> <P> But Irvine officials are not so sure.  </P> <P> "We are looking at it from a health and safety standpoint," said Peter Hersh,  Irvine's manager of planning services. "We want to see if we are justified in  distinguishing one (standard) versus the other. We want to get all our facts  together before we decide which one we are going to base our land-use policy  on."  </P> <P> Added Mayor Agran: "What I'm looking for is a legitimate methodology that bears  some relationship to the real world, and in the real world, people are  frightened, they are annoyed and they are pointing the finger politically when  there is an unacceptable level of noise.  </P> <P> "If the Marines are telling us the (noise) footprint should be larger, they may  well be right. But what we have to do is get from them reliable figures . . .  that will hold up, not just for a year or two, but forever, for our planning  process."  </P> <P> In addition to raising concerns about the two different noise standards,  officials have suggested that the Marine Corps noise study, which is based on a  computer model, ignores test data indicating that the noise levels actually are  much lower than the computer has projected.  </P> <P> EL TORO AIRCRAFT NOISE CONTOURS  </P> <P> A Marine Corps study projects areas to be affected by noise when the El Toro  base replaces older attack aircraft with modern F/A-18 Hornet fighters with  different noise characteristics.  </P></p>

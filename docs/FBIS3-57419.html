			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 25 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Dmitriy Volkogonov,  who yesterday was relieved by presidential decree of the duties  of defense and security advisor to the Russian president,  proposes to continue to carry out his previous functions but on  a "freelance" and unsalaried basis. As a deputy of the State  Duma, he may not simultaneously be in state service,  Colonel-General Volkogonov told the ITAR-TASS correspondent  today.    "In consultation with Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Gaydar, we  decided that I should stay in the Duma, because the "Russia's  Choice" group I belong to is relatively small," Dmitriy  Volkogonov said. In addition, he will continue work in the  three presidential commissions researching into cases of missing  foreign citizens and of Russian Federation citizens who  disappeared in unexplained circumstances outside the former  USSR, and into the use of and declassification of the  presidential archive.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Manila, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- While meeting today with  a Supervision Ministry delegation headed by Vice Minister He  Yong from China, Philippine Vice President Estrada said the  Philippine Government always attaches importance to developing  friendly relations with China.    Estrada noted that since the origin of Philippine-Chinese  relations goes back to ancient times, and since over half of the  Philippine people have Chinese blood in their veins, there is no  reason not to maintain a friendly relationship between the two  countries.    He Yong relayed Chinese Vice President Rong Yiren's  invitation to Estrada to visit China, which Estrada accepted  with pleasure.    He Yong and his party arrived in the Philippines on 5 April  at the invitation of the Interior and Local Governments Ministry  of the Philippines.    This is the first time the Chinese Supervision Ministry has  sent a delegation to visit the Philippines. The aim of the  current visit is to establish contacts between the  administrative supervision organs of the two countries and to  lay a foundation to enhance cooperation and exchanges in the  sphere of supervision between the two sides in the future. The  delegation will depart the Philippines for Thailand on 10 April.</p>

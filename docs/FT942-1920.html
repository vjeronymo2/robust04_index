			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Battle for Channel 4 funds stepped up Channel 4 and the independent television companies yesterday stepped up their battle over several hundred million pounds in advertising revenues, Raymond Snoddy writes. Sir Michael Bishop, Channel 4 chairman, and Mr Michael Grade, chief executive, met Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, to persuade him to remove the present funding arrangements. They say this could result in Channel 4 paying Pounds 500m to ITV over 10 years - money that will go straight to ITV profits rather than funding programmes. The complex safety net formula was designed to protect Channel 4's remit for innovative programming. Of all Channel 4 revenue above 14 per cent of total UK non-satellite television advertising, half goes to ITV, 25 per cent is kept by Channel 4 and 25 per cent goes into a reserve fund. If revenue falls below 14 per cent Channel 4 is compensated out of the reserve fund and then directly by the ITV companies. Last year Channel 4 paid the ITV companies Pounds 38.2m. The figure is expected to be Pounds 50m this year. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV companies, said the present funding arrangements had to be maintained in the face of growing competition. The safety-net arrangement had been part of the invitation to bid for new franchises.</p>

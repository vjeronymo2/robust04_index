			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Whitehall consultancy use faces big shake-up A radical reorganisation of the way the government hires consultancies is recommended in a Whitehall report likely to be published in the next few days. The report suggests that the Cabinet Office's efficiency unit should take a central monitoring role. The planned shake-up follows the disclosure that the government is spending more than Pounds 500m a year on outside consultants with little effort to track spending or assess value for money. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, has accepted advice from Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, that the unit should act as a clearing house for departments planning to use consultancies. It will be expected to check the reliability of the consultancy and prevent duplication in departments by co-ordinating information on consultancies across Whitehall. Ministers are concerned that little attempt has been made to find out whether other departments have done similar work with consultancies that could be used instead. While the efficiency unit will not be controlling the use of consultancies, its central monitoring role is expected to give departments less room for manoeuvre when commissioning consultants. The report is also sensitive to the fact that departments and agencies can identify just Pounds 10m in savings a year by bringing in external consultants to improve civil service management. It says that departments do not use consultants only to save money. A direct comparison of the identifiable savings against the amount spent on commissioning consultants is misleading, it says. Civil servants are concerned that they could be accused of re-writing the report following the disclosure that consultancies are yielding so little in savings. They say that they have only been fine tuning the study's conclusions and have not changed any of the figures. Every government department will be expected to draw up its own action plan to deal with the problem. These will be expected to improve the tracking of expenditure on consultancy and its benefits. Ministers want civil servants to adopt the best practice of the private sector by working more closely with consultants to maximise benefits. A senior Whitehall official said the report aimed to 'change the culture and practice' in the use of consultancies. 'We are currently spending far too much on far too little' he said. 'Ministers are determined to have some control on the spiralling cost of consultancies.'</p>

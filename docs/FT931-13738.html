			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Car makers lower EC sale target EUROPEAN car makers are lowering their forecasts for new car sales in west Europe because of the prospect of declining economic growth in the European Community. EC sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles (up to 5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) are forecast to fall by 7.5 per cent this year to 12.84m from 13.9m in 1992, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The German vehicle market is expected to suffer one of the sharpest declines, with a fall in sales of around 10 per cent. EC governments should offer subsidies and tax incentives to stimulate sales of electric cars, according to a report by members of the European Parliament. The report calls for action to encourage a switch to 'cleaner' cars in order to ease the burden placed by exhaust emissions on towns and cities. The report claims that an achievable target for the use of electric cars in towns is 7 per cent of total vehicle volume by 2002. Studies show that 80 per cent of car journeys cover fewer than seven miles, says the report. Most electric cars would have a range of between 70 and 140 miles before batteries needed recharging.</p>

The biggest deal of the week saw hostilities renewed in the international chocolate war. The offer by Kraft General Foods International, part of the Philip Morris Group of the US, for Freia Maribou of Norway, continues the consolidation and concentration of the industry over the past five years. If it succeeds, the combination of Freia, Kraft and Jacobs Suchard, through which the offer is being made, will create Scandinavia's leading branded confectionery group. The deal needs government approval and could be blocked by the Hershey group which has an 18.6 per cent stake. Elsewhere, the week had a distinctly oriental flavour. The biggest new UK development was the swoop by Hongkong Land for up to 29.99 per cent of debt laden but asset rich property developer Trafalgar House. The move could be described as another example of a Keswick-controlled British Hong Kong company preparing for 1997 by going home, an attempt to asset strip or a way to unlock shareholder value, depending on one's point of view. Dutch electronics group Philips is preparing to manufacture lighting products in Japan for the first time, by taking a 70 per cent stake in Kondo Sylvania from GTE Sylvania of the US. The week's developments in the international airline industry saw renewed efforts in the US to stop British Airways taking its planned stake in USAir, and Ireland's Guinness Peat Aviation create a joint venture with Air Ukraine.</p>

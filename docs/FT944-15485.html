			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Highland advances to Pounds 42.5m - Whisky producer hints at diversifying into other spirits Highland Distilleries, the independent Scotch whisky producer, reported yesterday a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 42.5m for the year to August 31 and hinted that it was thinking of diversifying into other spirits. Despite its success from focusing on Scotch, 'we see ourselves as a premium spirits company. If there are opportunities in other spirits, we wouldn't say 'no',' Mr Brian Ivory, chief executive, said. 'Other spirits would give our sales and distribution another sector of the market,' said Mr John Goodwin, chairman. Neither he nor Mr Ivory would be drawn on which drinks Highland was looking at or whether it would buy or build brands. 'We're working very hard on this and within the next year, we'll come out with something,' Mr Goodwin said. Despite difficult conditions over the past year, Highland's Famous Grouse Scotch brand, accounting for three quarters of group operating profits of Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.5m), held its second place in the UK market behind Bell's, but its share slipped to 13.8 per cent (14 per cent). It increased exports by 14 per cent in volume terms and 24 per cent by value. Sales of new fillings and mature whiskies were steady, but profits were lower in the latest financial year. Orders for new fillings this year were up 11 per cent. Income from associates rose to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 9.8m), reflecting a larger contribution from Robertson &amp; Baxter, a distiller, and the first time equity accounting of Highland's 50 per cent interest in the North British grain distillery. With Christmas threatening to bring another whisky price war, Highland expressed confidence in its strategy of maintaining its premium market position. Highland planned to use the same approach as last year when it maintained its premium pricing and refrained from joining its rivals' discounts for buying multiple bottles. Turnover rose 3 per cent from Pounds 171.1m to Pounds 175.8m. A 5.5p final dividend is proposed, making 7.26p (6.6p) for the year. Earnings per share were up 9 per cent at 21.9p and the company is proposing to buy back up to 5 per cent of its shares. COMMENT Highland has proved again the wisdom of focusing on Scotch and the Famous Grouse brand. The strategy will face another test this Christmas when the group will defend its premium market position against price-cutting competitors. But the brand's inherent strength is likely to produce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 46m this year for earnings of 23.7p and a prospective p/e of 17.6. This is expensive relative to the market and the suggestion of broadening the drinks portfolio might undermine the shares until Highland's strategy is clarified. With these uncertainties, the shares fell 14p to 419p yesterday.</p>

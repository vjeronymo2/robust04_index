			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkmenistan has resumed gas exports to Ukraine in  full after the Russian and Ukrainian state gas companies reached  agreement on the terms of gas delivery via Russian territory on  Saturday, a Russian company official told Interfax.    Turkmenistan ceased gas exports to Ukraine early this year  after Kiev's failure to service its gas bill of 600 million  dollars. Until recently, Moscow was helping Ukraine by stepping  up its own gas exports to that country under a deal the two  sides struck in the Russian capital on March 10.    It is now known that Russia and Ukraine are due to start  talks in Moscow on Tuesday to discuss the whole range of  bilateral relations including Kiev's failure to service its debt  for gas imports from Russia.    Kiev does not follow the schedule of debt repayment put down  in a protocol the two sides signed on April 12, a senior  official of Russia's Gazprom company said.    He also said that Belarus' gas debt did not increase as fast  as Ukraine's and Moldova's debt (Russia cut back gas exports to  Kishinev [Chisinau] by 30 percent in April).    The official said Moldova was holding talks with a number of  European banks to try to get loans to be able to repay its debt  to Moscow.    Under bilateral agreements, Russia's gas exports to Belarus,  Ukraine and Moldova this year will run at 16.4, 54.8 and 3.1  billion cu meters respectively.</p>

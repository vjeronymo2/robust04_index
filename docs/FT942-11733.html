			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P warns over Japanese banks' asset problems Asset-quality problems at Japanese banks, which face increasing bad-loan levels, will take several years to resolve, according to Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency. While the pace of increases in problem loans has slowed, the agency estimates that problem loans at 23 leading Japanese banks totalled Y30,000bn to Y35,000bn (Dollars 275bn to Dollars 321bn) for the business year ended last March - a substantial deterioration from the Y13,700bn in bad loans disclosed by 21 leading banks last September. The official figure given by the banks only includes loans to now-bankrupt borrowers, or those who have not paid interest for more than six months, while S&amp;P broadly considers loans with the likelihood of becoming loss-making. The credit agency recently downgraded its debt ratings on many of the leading Japanese banks due to the mounting pressure the banking system faces. 'Japanese banks' biggest challenge now is how to extricate themselves from problem assets as quickly as possible without reporting red figures,' S&amp;P says. But without the prospect of a significant rebound in core earnings in the near term and with the equity market remaining sluggish, the clean-up process is expected to reduce financial flexibility as banks try to rebuild their balance sheets and cope with financial reform. However, due to the increasing transparency of the banks' asset problems and the slowing of the increase in new problem loans, the agency predicts that future downgrades of banks' ratings are less likely. The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, the bad-loan purchasing organisation, said it bought Y65.1bn worth of bad loans from banks at a price of Y22.9bn during April. The company, set up by a consortium of banks, said it purchased a total Y4,585.1bn worth of bad loans backed by real estate collateral for Y2,253.9bn since it started operations in March last year. But only Y37.68bn has been recovered through sales of the real estate due to the slump in the property market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Geng Jun (5105 6511)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--According to  the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, from March  1992 to the end of last year, the Shenzhen city industrial and  commercial administration department investigated and handled a  total of 109 cases of foreign exchange black-market transaction  and cracked 132 "illegal foreign exchange transaction shops."    The State Administration for Industry and Commerce's  analysis  of these cases indicates the following special characteristics  of "foreign exchange black-market transactions":    1. Foreign exchange transaction shops are established  illegally and operate without licenses. All the "foreign  exchange black- market transaction shops" that were investigated  had not registered with the industrial and commercial  administration department, but they dealt in illegal foreign  exchange business under such names as "futures transaction  department," "investment company limited," "international  banking center," "representative office," and "liaison office."  For example, Shihua Commodity Futures Transaction Division,  International Banking Information Center, and Bailigao  Investment Company Limited were all operating without  registering with the industrial and commercial administration  department.    2. They use advanced means to run illegal businesses, such  as  laser teleprinters and computer display units. As for  telecommunication equipment, they use mobile phones and walkie-  talkies. Whenever they sense any trouble, the shop owners will  run away with account books and cash and hide out. Soon after a  black- market shop is closed down somewhere, another new shop  opens somewhere else.    3. In a certain sense they are cheating their clients. These  illegal foreign exchange black-marketeers use official seals  they made on their own without authorization. Claiming  themselves to be "foreign exchange transaction agents," they  lure clients into dealings. Usually they charge their clients  80 to 150 yuan for transaction of a lot (1,000 shares). And  they remit the cash they collect from their clients soon after  transaction, while the so- called "international financial  market information" reflected in their computers is all outdated  information. For example, a client coming to Shenzhen from  somewhere else in China, was lured into foreign exchange  transaction by a "Fuxing Trading Company" and a "Zhuhai Trading  Company," which were established by two Englishmen. He first  invested HK$100,000 [Hong Kong dollars] in the business. Then  the agent lied to him that his investment had earned him an  equal amount of profit. Feeling that it was easy to make money  from foreign exchange transactions, the investor invested  another HK$100,000. However, a few days later, the agent lied  to him that the foreign exchange market had slumped and all his  capital, HK$200,000, had been lost in the business. In order to  recover his loss, the client invested an additional HK$700,000,  and again all his money was lost in one month. When he realized  that this was but a fraud, the cheats had already run away with  all the money.    4. The agents cheat their clients, and the clients in turn  cheat other clients. The pay an agent gets is proportional to  the number of his clients and the amount of transactions he  manages to conclude. Therefore, some innocent young people  tried very hard to push others to invest in foreign exchange  business. Some of them first cheated their families, relatives,  and friends, and then induced them to cheat other relatives and  friends. Thus they started a chain of fraud.    The State Administration for Industry and Commerce believes  that the main reason why "foreign exchange black-market  transactions" persist despite repeated bans is because no strong  action has been taken to fight these activities. The existing  laws and regulations do not set any concrete penalties against  black-marketeers, hence the law enforcers have no rules to  follow in this regard.</p>

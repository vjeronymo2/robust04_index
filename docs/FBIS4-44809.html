			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "Bull and Ilog Team Up"] </F>   [Text] When Herve Yahi announced the "merging" of  Bull-Cediag's and Ilog's constraint programming activities last  week in Paris, the director of Bull BPA (Business Process  Automation) probably sounded the death knell of the French  manufacturer's artificial intelligence products business.    Indeed, the software program Charme--a product of research  Bull conducted in the late 90s [sic] in the Munich ECRC with  Siemens and ICL--was one of the last pride and joys of the  Cediag product catalog, which also features the Kool expert  system generator. According to Herve Hayi, Charme racked up  sales of Fr7 to 8 million a year in 1992 and 1993, out of the  tiny Fr60 million generated by all artificial intelligence  business.    The deal is a lucrative one for Ilog. The "merger" product  Ilog Solver (which Bull sold under the name Bull Solver) will  benefit from the constraints expertise of Bull teams. Moreover,  it will be virtually the only program of its kind in a promising  market, especially internationally. The only solid competitor  today remains Cositech, whose boss Mehmet Dincbas and product  Chip also came out of the ECRC.    Finally, according to Ilog CEO Pierre Haren, the "merger" of  Ilog's and Bull's two product lines is taking place without  money changing hands. In other words, his company is picking up  several years of investment by the French computer manufacturer  at little cost.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> MERCHANTS ASK CITY TO EASE SIGN LIMITS  </P> <P> Camarillo merchants displeased with city sign restrictions want the right to  use neon signs and banners now banned without special permits.  </P> <P> Retailers have complained to the city and the Camarillo Chamber of Commerce  since inspectors began issuing citations and warnings this summer. Some  merchants were cited for longstanding practices, said Gary L. Wartik, chamber  executive director.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the ordinance is well-intentioned, avoiding sign blight like in  L. A.," said Wartik, who is fielding members' complaints for a negotiating  session with the City Council next month. "We don't want garish displays or  billboards, just improved visibility for businesses in town."  </P> <P> The council has responded in part to complaints by easing restrictions on  sidewalk sales, previously limited to twice a year with a special-event permit.  Planning Director Anthony Boden said that under new guidelines, retailers could  hold sidewalk sales every weekend without a permit.  </P> <P> Retailers also take issue with a prohibition on signs covering more than 25% of  storefront windows, and then only as sales or special-event announcements. Neon  beer signs and banners are banned under the ordinance, except "Grand Opening"  banners that must come down within 30 days, Wartik said.  </P> <P> Boden maintained that Camarillo's size limits on store-name signs -- one square  foot for every two feet of storefront -- is among the least restrictive in  Ventura County.  </P> <P> "We just want to maintain some standards," Boden said. "We don't want sidewalk  sales becoming permanent sales that spill into the parking lot."  </P> <P> Bryan Terhune, manager of a Pay Less Drug Store on Las Posas Road, was warned  about regularly selling garden-shop items from its sidewalk. He has not yet  withdrawn the plants and ornaments.  </P> <P> "We had the best garden sales last year of any store in our district, which  includes Los Angeles and Orange counties," Terhune said. "It would definitely  restrain our trade to remove things that I and my customers find attractive."  CHRISTOPHER PUMMER  </P></p>

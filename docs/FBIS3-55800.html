Independent Publications Denied Registration"]    [Text] The new year has brought no faster democratic  change in Uzbekistan, where a virtual end has been put to  freedom of speech. A repeat registration of the mass media was  completed by the republic's State Press Committee in the first  10 days of December. Contrary to expectations by the numerous  Uzbek opposition, the republic's State Press Committee did not  register a single newspaper whose founder was a journalist  collective or a private person.    In the wake of the "Gorbachev perestroyka," a number of  independent publications are known to have appeared and existed  till late last year. Besides, some former organs of party and  Komsomol organizations, and even of local soviets, started to  publish material in a democratic spirit. Deciding to put an end  to this "journalist laissez faire," the republic's leadership  officially announced that all publications in the republic  should be registered again. As was expected, the only printed  organs that continue to be published are those of power  structures. Having been registered as founders of five main  daily republic papers are the Supreme Soviet, the Cabinet of  Ministers of the republic, the People's Democratic Party --  successor to the former Uzbek Communist party led by  Uzbekistan's president -- and the Republican Fund in Support of  the Press set up in accordance with Islam Karimov's edict. The  founders of oblast, rayon, and town newspapers have  correspondingly become the administrations of the oblasts,  rayons, and towns as in recent Soviet times when the mass media  were fully controlled by the official authorities.</p>

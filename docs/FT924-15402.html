			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Gatt this week THE US and the EC are threatening a trade war. The Gatt system for managing trade according to internationally accepted rules is precariously poised. The time available to settle deepening conflict is dangerously short. More specifically, if there is no significant breakthrough in farm trade reforms during meetings on October 10 and 11 between US and EC officials, trade will be seriously compromised. Some trade negotiators may not recognise how dangerous a stage negotiations have reached. EC negotiators may have taken encouragement from the fact that last Thursday's noon deadline set by Washington for a settlement of the EC-US oilseeds dispute passed without the immediate imposition of trade sanctions. If they believe that they have called the US bluff and won, they are wrong. Thursday's noon deadline was less to do with oilseed sanctions than with the US serving notice that is at the end of its tether with the Gatt dispute settlement system, and is poised to abandon it. Gatt has twice upheld US complaints over the EC's oilseed subsidy regime. The Community's attempt to settle the dispute by offering general compensation may satisfy Gatt obligations, but it fails to deal with the US domestic pressure for compensation specifically to target oilseed farmers. The US view is that the Gatt dispute settlement process has been exhausted by the EC's refusal to meet Thursday's deadline to bow to binding arbitration - and it must 'draw appropriate conclusions'. The US position may be inconsistent (it too has failed to comply with Gatt panel rulings) but its conclusions are clear - unless there is a Uruguay Round agreement giving the Gatt stronger powers to settle disputes, the US will in future use its strength unilaterally. The US already shows an alarming preference for Section 301 of its Trade Act, which enables it to impose its own sanctions on countries which it believes are trading unfairly. Most of its trading partners realise that strong multilateral rules are the only protection against the US using its trading might to act as judge and jury in trade conflicts. While the moral tenor of US comments is tiresome, the general point - that a Uruguay Round settlement is urgently needed to deal with growing strains to the international trading system - must be well taken. The rising tide of disputes such as that over oilseeds can only be properly settled within the context of a wider settlement. Europe's farm trade regime should never be allowed to ruin the wider potential benefits - in services trade, protection of intellectual property rights, and in improved market access - offered by the Uruguay Round. At the forefront of negotiators' minds this weekend should be that none of the problems the Uruguay Round is intended to tackle will go away if negotiations fail.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: BIG CANYON: FOCUS  </P> <P> Resort Living on the Links  </P> <P> With a name like Big Canyon you would expect to see some sort of narrow chasm  with precipitous walls and water flowing through the middle, right?  </P> <P> Welllll, not exactly.  </P> <P> The heart of the Big Canyon neighborhood is a sprawling 390-acre, lush  residential complex and country club. Bounded by four major arterial streets --  Ford and San Joaquin Hills roads on the north and south and MacArthur Boulevard  and Jamboree Road on the east and west -- this "fortress" of foliage and  fairways lies immediately north of the Newport Center Financial Plaza, one of  Orange County's principal commercial and financial centers.  </P> <P> The major open space and recreational amenity is the Big Canyon golf course.  Lakes, creeks and ponds run throughout the 145-acre layout. With the Big Canyon  Country Club acting as the focal point of the complex, the Irvine Co. created a  serene, resort-like homestead.  </P> <P> The club opened in April, 1972, and 2 years later its 500 stockholders bought  the entire operation from the Irvine Co. Today, there are 400 non-equity  members besides the 500 stockholders who operate the club. Professional golfer  Shirley Little is an honorary member. She does most of her practicing on the  blue-green grassy turf of the club.  </P> <P> Built around and throughout the golf course are 500 homes -- 225 of them  townhouses perched on the outer perimeter. Single-family homes are situated  nearer the middle. As befits an ambiance dominated by a country club, many of  the neighborhood's streets are named for famous links -- Burning Tree Circle,  Winged Foot Lane, Augusta Road, Cypress Point and Inverness and Oakmont lanes,  just to name a few.  </P> <P> Home prices reflect what has happened elsewhere in the county. When units went  on sale in Big Canyon in 1972, houses started at $75,000, condominiums around  $65,000. Today, prices for the average four- or five-bedroom home with  three-car garage begin around $800,000, or $500,000 for a townhouse.  </P> <P> Danny Bibb, a Grubb &amp; Ellis real estate agent who has been a resident since  1980 and has sold 100 houses in the neighborhood, describes his customers this  way: "Three-fourth of the buyers have families and most are in the 35- to  55-age group. The majority of homeowners never leave the immediate area -- they  might buy another home smaller or larger, but they usually don't leave."  </P> <P> They are also among Orange County's most affluent residents. Big Canyon is the  third-richest neighborhood in the county, with a median household income  exceeding $100,000 per year.  </P> <P> Big Canyon can also accommodate those who prefer to rent. At the intersection  of Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard are the Big Canyon Villas, not to be  confused with the gate-guarded estates a block away. Seventy-  </P> <P> eight townhouses are for rent only and range from $2,175 to $3,250 monthly.  </P> <P> Most residents in Newport Beach seem to put great emphasis on the harbor area,  but not Big Canyon residents. They opt for grass, shrubs, trees, flowers and,  of course, golf.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.) 3,908  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +30%  </P> <P> Median Age: 45.3  </P> <P> </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino), 94%; Latino, 3%; Black, less than 1%; Other, 3%  </P> <P> </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 44.6 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 45.7 years  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $53,732  </P> <P> Median household: $111,792  </P> <P> Average household: $146,686  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 8%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 10%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 16%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 66%  </P></p>

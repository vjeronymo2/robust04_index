			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para (Brazil), 6 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Juan  Aristides Tavares, Dominican foreign relations secretary of  state, said the Government of the Dominican Republic guarantees  it will maintain its border with Haiti, which was closed in  compliance with the total embargo imposed by the United Nations  on this Caribbean nation.    Tavares indicated to EFE that there is a disposition within  the 24th OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated today in  the Brazilian city of Belem do Para, to ensure the total  effectiveness of the embargo imposed on Haiti in May by the UN  Security Council.    Tavares pointed out that the Dominican Republic is the  nation  most harmed by the Haitian political crisis because both nations  share the island of Hispaniola and also because of the pressures  it has been exposed to in order to implement the embargo.    "No country has had as many problems as we have had. So much  has been demanded of us; it is as if we were the only ones"  responsible for contributing to the crisis, the foreign  relations secretary of state indicated. He added that his  government has supported all resolutions related to issues  approved by the OAS and the UN Security Council.    "Although the embargo has not been completely effective, we  have not violated it intentionally, and, moreover, at this time,  our government has ordered the closing of the border," the  Dominican Republic foreign secretary said.    The Haitian political crisis is the main issue dominating  the  24th OAS General Assembly sessions which will be extended until  next Friday and where 70 proposals related to democracy, human  rights, security, technical cooperation, environment,  counternarcotics, and the economic situation throughout the  American continent will be discussed.    Full compliance with the total embargo, especially the  guarantee that the Dominican Republic will not violate the  350-km-wide border with Haiti, and the rejection of armed  intervention to depose the military coupists are the two main  proposals to be discussed during the Belem do Para meeting.    Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, deposed by the  military in September 1991 and still considered the legitimate  president of Haiti by the international community, participated  today in the Assembly inauguration. Aristide has met with  Brazilian President Itamar Franco.    Secretary of State Tavares pointed out that the OAS and UN  technical observers, who recently visited his country, were able  to ascertain that the total embargo is being implemented "firmly  along the Dominican-Haitian border."</p>

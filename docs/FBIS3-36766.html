			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated  that the Cabinet's main task this year was to combine a  moderately rigid financial stabilization scheme with selective  stimulation of individual industrial branches.    He said that if a moderately rigid credit and financial  policy is pursued, the state budget deficit will stand at  7-7.5% by the end of the year compared to the Gross  Domestic  Product, while the monthly inflation rate will be at 7-9%.    He said that the year 1994 must become decisive in the  implementation of the radical economic reform. If the  government fails to make achievements in the priority economic  branches by controlling budget spending, the forecasts for the  size of the budget deficit in 1995 will not come true, he said.    On Tuesday, Shokhin addressed the congress "Reality and  Prospects for Russia's Economic Development." This forum's  organizing committee is chaired by Secretary of the Russian  Federation's Security Council Oleg Lobov, while the event itself  was prepared by prominent economists Nikolay Petrakov, Leonid  Abalkin and Stanislav Shatalin. The economists participated in  the preparation of a report entitled, Socio-Economic Reforms in  Russia; the Current Situation and New Approaches.    Anther author of the report, Stanislav Assekritov, vice  president of the Reform International Foundation, expects the  report to be discussed by the government at its meeting on  February 24. He believes the document has much in common with  the position of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who, he  said, might "disown the results of the two years of shock  therapy" at that meeting.    So far neither Chernomyrdin nor President Boris Yeltsin have  responded to the report, said Assekritov, who doubts that the  prime minister would make a public statement of his  socio-economic position before Yeltsin gives his message to  parliament on February 18. Only after that "will Chernomyrdin  either do what the president would like him to or will just be  swiping around," Assekritov said.    He said another two reports had been sent to the premier,  one  of them written by former Minister of Foreign Economic Relations  Sergey Glazyev, today a member of the State Duma, where he  represents the Democratic Party, and the other by economist  Yevgeny Saburov, economics minister in Ivan Silayev's government.</p>

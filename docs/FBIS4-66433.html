			<p>Treatment   System   <F P=102> 94FE0402J Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Jan 94  p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 94FE0402J </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NIKKEI SANGYO SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> CSO     [Text] Hitachi Chemical Co., in cooperation with its  subsidiary, Hitachi Chemical Technoplant, developed a wastewater  purification system that efficiently cleans up domestic  wastewater and runs on about 40% less electricity than  conventional systems of its kind. The system simultaneously  performs nitrogen and BOD (biological oxygen demand, a pollution  index) processing. Along with that, the way the system purifies  wastewater results in a shorter process and reduces the area  needed for installation by about 30%. With the increase in  public resources, Hitachi Chemical sees an increase in the  demand for the construction of water treatment facilities. The  company will sell its system to municipalities, and aims for  sales of about &yen;1 billion during FY94.    The system that was developed is a ``go-round-style  intermittent aeration-purification tank HKN-type'' facility made  of steel-reinforced concrete. Two computer systems, the ``DO  controller'' and the ``sludge controller,'' automatically  control the task called ``aeration,'' which purifies the  nitrogen, BOD, etc., by feeding oxygen into wastewater that is  swirled around the purification tank. The aeration can be done  efficiently because the computers determine the amounts of  pollutants in the water by means of sensors, and then the system  feeds in the appropriate amount of oxygen, without wasting any.  The running cost is low because of the 40% reduction in  the  amount of electric power needed.    The system can reduce BOD and nitrogen to below 10 PPM to 15  PPM, respectively, and meets the strictest standards set forth  by the Water Pollution Prevention Act. In the past, the  construction of a tank for that level of purification  necessitated the task of obtaining authorization and designation  by the Ministry of Construction. The new purification tank,  however, is the first of its kind in the industry that only  requires general authorization and general designation, and  thereby obviates the preliminary application work.</p>

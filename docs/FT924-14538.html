			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Greek farmers dump half their bumper peach crop - With falling exports and limited canning capacity, the surplus just keeps growing A powerful smell of fermenting fruit escapes from trucks lumbering up a hillside outside Skydra, the centre of commercial peach-growing in Greece. A bulldozer works full-time at the dump, pushing piles of unsold peaches into an uncultivated valley. This year marked a record Greek peach harvest, estimated by growers at over 900,000 tonnes. But the surplus is also of unprecedented size, with more than half the crop being transported straight from orchards to the dump. Greece, together with the US and South Africa, is one of the world's biggest exporters of canned peaches. Over 90 per cent of the processed crop is sold abroad, much of it to supermarket chains from Britain to Japan. Greece is also a big producer of table peaches. Despite cuts in EC support prices this year and next - both for marketed produce and withdrawals - the surplus will go on rising as more orchards come into full yield. 'The EC support prices were extremely high, even for withdrawal, and until the late 1980s there was always a shortage of industrial peaches. Growers thought production could go on expanding indefinitely,' says Mr Alexander Protopappas of Conex, a processor. The growing is done by 20,000 small farmers in the northern Greek provinces of Verria, Edessa and Naoussa, where a cooler climate favours fruit production. In recent years, there has been a shift to yellow clingstone varieties for processing, considered by farmers a safer option than growing table peaches for the volatile European export market. However, the average orchard size is only about three acres, a factor that contributes to increased surpluses as individual farmers follow their neighbours' example and switch to peach-growing. Peach production has almost tripled since the early 1980s, with new orchards planted on terraces cut higher into the hillsides around Skydra. Production of yellow clingstones will probably reach 650,000 tonnes this year, up from 480,000 tonnes in 1991. Yet processing capacity is stuck at 250,000 tonnes. 'Greek peaches are considered top quality and we'd have no difficulty in raising exports if we had the capacity,' says Mr Eleftherios Saitis of Kronos, another large packer. 'The canned peach market may be stabilising but there's a future in products like concentrate, pulps and peach chips for flavourings.' There seems little chance that capacity will soon increase. Most canneries were set up by agricultural co-operatives a decade ago when farm exports were still subsidized and interest rates for agricultural loans lagged far behind the inflation rate. No longer protected by subsidies, the co-operatives are deep in debt to the state-controlled Agricultural Bank, while private canners like Mr Saitis say they cannot afford to expand with borrowing rates at around 30 per cent. But so long as support prices remain attractive, the growers will go on producing. 'It will be hard to make peach farmers change crops unless the EC starts paying compensation for uprooting trees. Their income is still satisfactory even if they drive their whole crop to the dump,' says Mr Antonis Kanouras of Agrotiki Kolindros, a local growers' co-operative. Nevertheless, there are still shortages at the canneries in July and September, at the beginning and end of the processing season, because growing policies were never co-ordinated with the processors. 'If there were more producers of early and late cropping varieties, we could prolong the season for a few weeks and cover more of the demand for exports,' says Mr Kanouras. However, the industrial peach sector is still well off by comparison with what has happened to producers of table peaches. This year's crop, estimated at 230,000 tonnes plus another 100,000 tonnes of nectarines, was also a record. But a disastrous export season means that the withdrawal rate is even higher than for industrial peaches. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia has blocked the main export route to western Europe. The alternative route to the Munich fruit market, by ferry to Italy or by road through Hungary, takes 24 hours longer and costs one-third more at times of peak demand for refrigerated trucks. Greek peaches normally command premium prices because of their quality. But that edge may be lost after an extra day on the road. Moreover, wholesale prices for peaches have tumbled following bumper harvests across southern Europe. This year, exports of Greek table peaches and nectarines have fallen by 35 per cent to 60,000 tonnes. 'Costs are so high in proportion to prices that the Greek exporters are scarcely breaking even this year. The recession has shrunk demand in western Europe where peaches are seen as a luxury fruit,' says Mr Constantine Karagiorgas of Incofruit, the Greek fruit exporters' association.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esperanza Navarro Francois] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that on  Monday he will announce a decision that "has made him ill."  There are persistent rumors that he will be on leave from the  Presidency and will be replaced by Vice President Guillermo Ford.    "Unfortunately I cannot say much today because I am sick,  probably due to a decision I had to make, which I will announce  Monday on a national network," Endara stressed.    He said that the decision will be announced on a national  network on 18 April at 2000.    In a statement to reporters aboard the National Air Service  (SAN) aircraft, Panama Governor Daphne Clement said Endara will  announce a leave of absence, but she did not specify the reasons.    Endara's remarks came during the inauguration of the Silvio  Salazar Bridge in the Colon Free Zone, which links France Field  with the old section of that commercial center.    In the presence of Vice President Guillermo Ford; ministers  of state; directors of autonomous and semi-autonomous  institutions; provincial, municipal, and religious authorities;  businessmen; merchants; and Colon Free Zone tenants; Endara said  he could not give any further details on his "decision,"  although he admitted it was "tough and controversial."    Endara also said that the decree-law requiring that amounts  exceeding $10,000 be declared when brought into the country is  intended to keep money obtained from drug trafficking or money  laundering from entering the country.    Endara noted that the decree-law was the result of numerous  consultations with the banking sector and the Free Zone and that  its economic impact on both sectors has been analyzed.    Endara did not deny that Finance Ministry officials could be  involved in mishandling funds while carrying out the decree-law,  but he said that this possibility has been reviewed and control  measures implemented.    "It is a tough and controversial measure, but it cannot be  avoided, Endara stressed. [quotation marks as published]</p>

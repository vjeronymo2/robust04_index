			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST DESSERTS FOR TROOPS IN MIDEAST;  </P> <P> BAKING: OPERATION COOKIE DELIVERS: TIPS ON WHAT TO SEND AND HOW TO SEND IT.  </P> <P> "Thanks a million for the cookies. It means a lot for us to know that back home  the people care. It was a nice surprise to receive some home cooking. Operation  Cookie to us deployed servicemen (and women) is a complete success. Keep up the  good work."  </P> <P>  -- Sgt. William Evans, U.S. Air Force  </P> <P> Mail -- letters and packages -- are among the biggest morale boosters to the  men and women involved in Operation Desert Shield, according to reports from  the Middle East. Whether it comes from family, friends or even strangers  doesn't matter; everything is welcome.  </P> <P> Anyone willing to bake and package a batch of cookies can take part in  Operation Cookie, a nationwide grass-roots effort to airlift cookies to the  troops. The endeavor began when Karen Buker, of Federal Way, Wash., posted a  request -- on a national computer bulletin board -- for cookie recipes she  could send her son in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> In response, she not only received recipes but cookies and letters from all  across the United States. When mailing complications arose, Sylvia Mease, a  Florida homemaker, arranged for the cookies to be shipped, space available,  from Patrick Air Force Base. To date more than 500 boxes (weighing between one  and 25 pounds) of cookies have been sent to the Middle East.  </P> <P> Islamic laws are strict, so recipes should not contain alcohol. Buker also  suggests including a note or letter. Send cookies to either Operation Cookie,  c/o Stephen Butler, 4874 Palm Ave., La Mesa, Calif. 92041-3812, or Operation  Cookie, c/o Sub-Trek 1, 190 Malabar Road, No. 119, Palm Bay West Center, Palm  Bay, Fla. 32907.  </P> <P> Packages personally addressed to family or friends are sent via the U.S. Postal  Service to an APO (Army and Air Force) or FPO (Navy and Marine) box in either  New York or San Francisco. The Army Post Office, Air Post Office or Fleet Post  Office will handle delivery from those points. Packages may not exceed 70  pounds or 108 inches total dimension (length and girth combined).  </P> <P> The U.S. Army National Public Affairs Office recommends sending oatmeal,  molasses and sugar cookies, as well as brownies. Other suggested items for  mailing are hard candy, peanut butter, canned fruit and tuna, and unsalted  pretzels and snacks. Basically, food that melts or contains a lot of salt  should be avoided.  </P> <P> When selecting recipes, keep in mind that it takes 10 days to three weeks for  delivery. Fruit cakes and moist quick breads will stay fresh longer and travel  better than yeast breads. Bar cookies are a better choice than thin, or tender  varieties.  </P> <P> The best damage insurance during shipping is a careful job of packing. Begin by  totally covering the item with plastic wrap, then foil. This is relatively easy  in the case of cakes and breads. Bar cookies can be wrapped without cutting;  delicate cookies should be individually wrapped and packed in layers, with  cushioning between. Some items can be baked in inexpensive aluminum pans; after  cooling, the same pans will give extra support during shipping.  </P> <P> Place the items in a sturdy corrugated carton that has all the flaps intact so  it can be securely closed. Since new cartons are not always available, used  cartons are acceptable if checked for flaws. Be certain to carefully mark out  all old addresses to eliminate any confusion. The carton needs to be large  enough to hold the item or items in addition to plenty of cushioning material.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service suggests using polystyrene, excelsior or shredded  newspaper for cushioning. Popcorn is not recommended because it can absorb  hazardous fumes from the aircraft and become toxic.  </P> <P> Cushioning should lightly overfill the container before closure. That way even  after it settles, the item or items will be prevented from moving around during  shipping. When several items are in the same package, they must be protected  from each other too.  </P> <P> Sturdy tape should be used to close the carton. Pressure-sensitive,  filament-reinforced tape or reinforced paper tape 2 inches to 3 inches wide is  recommended by the Post Office. Masking tape is not acceptable because it has a  paper base and breaks easily. For extra strength, start the tape on the side of  the carton adjacent to the closure.  </P> <P> Clearly print the address directly on the box or a firmly affixed label. Use a  felt tip marker or ball point pen to prevent smudging if it gets wet. Include  the full address, including ZIP Code.  </P> <P> String or twine should not be used on the outside of packages. This can get  caught in machinery used in transporting packages to destinations.  </P> <P> Kathie Jenkins contributed to this article.  </P> <P>  This recipe from "City Cuisine" (William Morrow &amp; Co., 1989: $19.95) by  Sue Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken is a particularly good version of an old  favorite.  </P> <P> OLD-FASHIONED PEANUT BUTTER COOKIES  </P> <P> 1 cup unsalted butter, softened  </P> <P> 1 cup granulated sugar  </P> <P> 1 cup brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 2 cups soft peanut butter, smooth or crunchy  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Flour  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> Cream together butter, granulated sugar and brown sugar. Stir in peanut butter  until smooth. Add eggs and vanilla. Mix until well combined.  </P> <P> Combine 3 cups flour, salt and baking soda. Add to peanut butter mixture,  stirring just until flour disappears.  </P> <P> Spoon about 1 tablespoon batter each for small cookies or 3 tablespoons each  for jumbos on lightly buttered and floured or parchment-lined baking sheets.  Dip tines of fork into flour and score each cookie in traditional crisscross  pattern.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 15 minutes for small cookies, 20 minutes for jumbos. Edges  should just begin to turn golden. Remove from baking sheets and cool on wire  racks. Makes 50 small or 18 jumbo cookies.  </P> <P>  The following very decadent brownie recipe comes from "Maida Heatter's Book of  Great Chocolate Desserts" (Alfred A. Knopf: 1980). The author describes them as  "the biggest, thickest, gooiest, chewiest, darkest, sweetest,  mostest-of-the-most chocolate bars."  </P> <P> PALM BEACH BROWNIES  </P> <P> Softened butter  </P> <P> 8 ounces unsweetened chocolate  </P> <P> 1 cup unsalted butter  </P> <P> 5 eggs  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon almond extract  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 2 1/2 tablespoons dry instant espresso or other powdered (not granular) instant  coffee  </P> <P> 3 3/4 cups sugar  </P> <P> 1 2/3 cups sifted flour  </P> <P> 8 ounces walnut halves or large pieces  </P> <P> Invert 13x9-inch metal baking pan. Cover with foil, pressing down around sides  and corners to shape foil like pan. Remove foil. Turn pan right side up and  carefully, without tearing, press foil into place in pan.  </P> <P> Place 1 to 2 tablespoons butter in pan. Place pan in oven while preheating.  When butter is melted, remove pan from oven and use pastry brush to spread  butter over sides and bottom of foil. Set pan aside.  </P> <P> Place chocolate and unsalted butter in top of large double boiler over hot  water on moderate heat or in 4- to 6-cup heavy saucepan over very low heat.  Stir occasionally until chocolate and butter are melted. Stir to mix. Remove  from heat and set aside.  </P> <P> Beat eggs with vanilla, almond extract, salt, dry instant coffee and sugar in  large bowl of electric mixer at high speed 10 minutes. Reduce speed to low, add  chocolate mixture and beat only until mixed.  </P> <P> Add flour and again beat only until mixed. Remove from mixer and stir in nuts.  Turn into prepared pan and smooth top.  </P> <P> Bake on rack 1/3 up from bottom of oven at 425 degrees 35 minutes, reversing  pan front to back as necessary during baking to ensure even baking. At end of  35 minutes cake will have thick, crisp crust on top, but wood pick inserted in  center will come out wet and covered with chocolate.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, remove cake from oven and let stand at room temperature until  cool. Cover with rack or baking sheet and invert. Remove pan and foil lining.  Cover with baking sheet and invert again, leaving cake right side up.  </P> <P> Let cake stand 6 to 8 hours, or preferably overnight, before cutting into bars.  Or refrigerate few hours.  </P> <P> Use serrated bread knife for slicing. If ends are too dark, cut away, then cut  cake into bars. Wipe knife blade with damp cloth after each cut. Makes 24 huge  or 32 large brownies.  </P> <P> Note: Wrap brownies individually in plastic wrap.  </P> <P>  Sally Deveze of San Dimas won a My Best Recipe award for this bar cookie. It  was first published in October, 1988.  </P> <P> SALLY'S FIG BARS  </P> <P> 10 to 12 ripe medium to large figs (or 1 cup dried figs soaked in 3/4 cup water  and drained)  </P> <P> 1/3 cup granulated sugar  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups butter or margarine, softened  </P> <P> 1 1/3 cups brown sugar, packed  </P> <P> 2 cups whole-wheat flour  </P> <P> 3 cups oats  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon baking soda  </P> <P> Peel skin off figs, chop pulp and place in pan with granulated sugar. Bring to  boil. Reduce heat and cook until excess liquid has evaporated.  </P> <P> Mix butter and brown sugar. Stir in flour, oats, salt and baking soda.  </P> <P> Cover bottom of greased 13x9-inch pan with 1/2 pastry mixture. Spread fig  filling evenly over top. Cover with remaining pastry mixture, pressing down  lightly on surface.  </P> <P> Bake at 400 degrees 20 to 30 minutes. While still warm, cut into bars. Let cool  in pan before removing bars. Makes about 32 bars.  </P> <P>  Digging into The Times Food section files, we uncovered a healthy drop cookie  dating back to 1978.  </P> <P> MOLASSES OATMEAL COOKIES  </P> <P> 2 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  </P> <P> 1 cup apple juice  </P> <P> 1 cup molasses  </P> <P> 2/3 cup oil  </P> <P> 2 1/2 cups diced, peeled apples  </P> <P> 1 cup sunflower seeds  </P> <P> 3 cups oats  </P> <P> Combine flour, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves in bowl. In another bowl mix  together apple juice, molasses and oil. Stir until blended.  </P> <P> Add flour mixture to liquid, 1/3 at time, blending well after each addition.  Fold in apples, sunflower seeds and oats.  </P> <P> Drop by tablespoons onto greased baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees 12 to 14  minutes or until lightly browned. Makes about 4 1/2 dozen.  </P> <P>  The original name for these cookies was Neiman-Marcus Squares, but they  disappeared with such speed that reader Connie Hankins' family renamed the  recipe. It was first printed in December, 1986.  </P> <P> VACUUM CLEANER COOKIES (Neiman-Marcus Squares)  </P> <P> 1/2 cup margarine (not butter), melted  </P> <P> 1 (18.25-ounce) box yellow cake mix  </P> <P> 3 eggs  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound) box powdered sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup flaked coconut  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans  </P> <P> Combine margarine, cake mix and 1 egg. Stir together until dry ingredients are  moistened. Pat mixture into bottom of well-greased 15x10-inch jellyroll pan.  </P> <P> Beat remaining 2 eggs lightly, then beat in cream cheese and powdered sugar.  Stir in coconut and nuts. Pour over mixture in jellyroll pan, spreading evenly.  </P> <P> Bake at 325 degrees 45 to 50 minutes or until golden brown. Cool pan on wire  rack to room temperature. Makes 4 dozen bars.  </P> <P> Note: Use plain cake mix, not that with pudding added. Do not use whipped  margarine.  </P></p>

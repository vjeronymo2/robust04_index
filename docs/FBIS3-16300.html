Under the new constitution, Belarus is to become a  presidential republic. It is declared "a unitary democratic  social law-governed state", with man regarded as the highest  value of society and the state.    Belarus sets the goal of becoming a nuclear-free and neutral  power.    The republic's president will also be the head of the  executive branch. The parliament is to be reduced to 260  deputies from the present 360 lawmakers. It will remain  semi-professional, that is part of deputies will work full-time  in the parliament's standing commissions, while the rest will  combine their deputy's posts with some other jobs.    The parliament ruled that presidential elections should be  called before this July, while elections to a new parliament are  to be held not later than this year.    The new fundamental law of the Republic of Belarus is to  come  into force from the date of its publication.</p>

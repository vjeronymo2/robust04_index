			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / French fashions show first deficit The French fashion industry, traditionally one of the most prestigious elements of Gallic commerce, last year recorded its first trading deficit. France's women's wear manufacturers saw the balance of trading swing from a surplus of FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) in 1992 to a FFr321m deficit in 1993 according to figures from the Federation Francaise de la Pret-a-porter. Every area of the industry has been affected, from mass-market manufacturers to France's exclusive fashion houses, which face fierce competition from Italian rivals and the increasingly influential young Belgian designers. The chief problem for French fashion was the downturn in demand from its main European markets, notably Germany where sales of French women's wear fell by a third. Sales were affected by the gloomy economic environment and by the franc's strength against other European currencies, which made it more difficult for the French to compete against the Italians. The extent of the fall in sales to Europe was magnified by changes in the European Commission's method of compiling statistics, but these changes simply exaggerated the underlying negative trend. French fashion did benefit last year from an increase in exports to the fast-growing Asian economies, such as South Korea and Taiwan. Business was little better on the home front. Sales of French women's wear fell by 1.7 per cent last year in France itself. The only areas of the market to show growth were hypermarkets and mail order catalogues, which specialise in selling cut-price fashions.</p>

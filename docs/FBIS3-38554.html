			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn -- Education Minister Rainer Ortleb (Free  Democratic Party of Germany) resigned today. In a short  statement by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] to  Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the 49-year-old minister declared that  he decided to take this step upon the advice of his doctor.  Thus, he submitted a request to the chancellor requesting his  discharge from the minister's office to the federal president.    Ortleb informed FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel that he has also  resigned from his position as FDP chairman in  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. According to FDP spokesman  Hans-Rolf Goebel, Kinkel took note of the two decisions with  regret and respect and thanked Ortleb for the work he has  performed. Kinkel expressed the hope that Ortleb will continue  to make his "indispensable contribution" to completing German  unity in the party's Executive Committee and the Bundestag group.    In November, Ortleb was hospitalized because of a  circulatory  collapse and later because of pneumonia. At the beginning of  January, however, he resumed his official duties. According to  information received by DPA, State Secretary Fritz Schaumann of  the Education Ministry (FDP/47) and FDP Deputy Chairman Wolfgang  Gerhardt are considered possible successors.</p>

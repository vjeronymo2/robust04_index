			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Yong (7115 8673), WEN YI BAO editor in chief: </F> "Life Makes the Tree of Literature and Art Evergreen--Studying  Mao Zedong's Assertions on How Life Is Related to Literature and  Art"]    [Text] An important contribution Mao Zedong made to  Marxist theory on literature and art lies in his applying the  theory of reflection in dialectical materialism to resolving the  relationship between literature and art on the one hand, and  life on the other, the fundamental issue in literary and art  creation; he regarded the theory of reflection in dialectical  materialism as the theoretical basis for resolving the  relationship between literature, art, and life. The theory of  reflection in dialectical materialism falls into the category of  the Marxist theory of cognition, of which Marx, Engels and Lenin  all offered explicit and full discussions; however, it was Mao  Zedong who was most thorough in applying it to the arenas of  literature, art, and aesthetic theory. He was certain that life  "provides literature and art with an inexhaustible source, their  only source. Life is the only source, for there can be no  other." That was the view of a firm and thorough materialist.  In the history of Marxist thinking on literature and art, no  one before Mao Zedong had applied the Marxist, materialist  theory of cognition and made such profound, scientific  assertions and explicit explanation on the relationship between  literature, art, and life as he did. However, Mao Zedong was  simultaneously a great dialectician, while ascertaining that  life was of a primary nature, and literature and art of a  secondary nature, he fully expounded that literature and art  could and ought to be "on a higher plane, more intense, more  concentrated, more typical, nearer the ideal, and therefore more  universal than actual everyday life." That was also the  offspring of Mao Zedong combining Marxist theory with social  practice in China as well as practice in literature and art.  Some people groundlessly regarded the Marxist theory of  reflection and its application to literature and art as the  "theory of reflection through direct perception of the senses."  We have only to read relevant works by Mao Zedong himself to  find out that he was very certain about the truth that life was  the only source of literature and art, a materialist concept  that could never be shaken; furthermore, he fully affirmed the  dynamic role of literature and art in life, and the subjective  aspect of the writer in literary creation. Those people who  regard the theory of reflection, and its application to matters  of literature and art, as the theory of reflection through  direct perception of the senses which is a negation of the  subjective aspect deliberately distort the Marxist theory of  reflection, or at least lack genuine understanding of the  Marxist concept on this issue.    In the past, writers and artists who did not entirely  neglect  life could see consciously, or at least through practice, that  literary and artistic creation could not be independent of life.  For example, Chinese painters who specialized in the genre of  portraying nature did not directly express social life, but the  majority of them saw the importance of "learning from nature";  otherwise, they could not really have any true artistic  accomplishments in portraying nature. There were cases of  following in the footsteps of ancient artists; however, those  painters who failed to pay attention to observing nature but  simply followed in the footsteps of ancient artists, and did not  see nature as the inspiration for their own creation would  inevitably create only impoverished works, and their works could  not have genuine artistic life.    We naturally cannot rest satisfied with the simple  materialist understanding of ancient writers and artists in the  relationship between art and life. Every person who believes in  historical materialism acknowledges that history was a creation  of the people, and history was mainly the producers' history.  When Mao Zedong set forth the proposition that our literature  and art reflect the life of the people, his view was by no means  without foundation; it was just the true face of history. If  our literature is truthful, and falls in line with the true face  of history, we can only place the truthful reflection of the  people's life above all else. It cannot be otherwise,  especially when history has developed to an era of the people's  revolution under proletarian leadership.    In past Chinese literature, there were many works that  portrayed the life and suffering of the working people in  poetry; but in novels, such works were few aside from "Outlaws  of the Marsh." Lu Xun shared that view. Aside from the "Book  of Odes" and much folklore in its wake, the poet Bai Juyi wrote  many works reflecting the people's sufferings; however, he could  not avoid looking down at the impoverished with sympathy and  pity typical of the literati and officialdom in feudal China;  literary works in this category can be said to have an "affinity  to the people." Furthermore, not only works that give a direct  portrayal of life at the lowest depth have an "affinity to the  people." This issue should not be grasped in a simple and  narrow view. But in the history of Chinese literature, it was  none other than Lu Xun who was the first to genuinely portray  images of peasants, such as sister-in-law Xianglin and Runtu,  who were genuine Chinese peasants, not those in the eyes of past  literati and officialdom in feudal China. But even Lu Xun  mainly succeeded in portraying the sufferings of the oppressed  peasants; in that aspect, he was extraordinarily profound and  truthful. The peasants of Lu Xun's pen were mainly of the  suffering class, they had not yet awakened, and were not a  revolutionary class. Mao Zedong explicitly set out the need for  literature and art to depict the new mass era, and the new life  of workers, peasants, and soldiers; that should be viewed as an  important revolution in literary and artistic thinking.    In the era of the people's revolution, especially in an era  when the masses have already grasped political power and become  masters of the country, literature and art must appear in new  features if they are not to be divorced from life, peasants,  workers, and the army.    It was precisely because of this that Mao Zedong's call that  "China's revolutionary writers and artists, writers and artists  of promise, must go among the masses; they must for a long  period of time unreservedly and wholeheartedly go among the  masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, go into the heat of  struggle, to the only source, the broadest and richest  source...." was not just a periodic need, not just a "war-time  policy for literature and art," as some people put it, or only  applicable to past rural environment, but the party basic line  for literature and art, which is grounded on Marxist basic  tenets. In the 50 years since the publication of "Talks at the  Yanan Forum on Literature and Art," the great accomplishments in  Chinese revolutionary literature and art are the victory of the  party basic line for literature and art as well as Marxism.    Of course, we should always bear in mind that the reflection  we refer to in the arena of literature and art is aesthetic  reflection, and a particular way of grasping the world. Every  step taken in this arena contains expressions of the unique  imagination, feelings, and sentiments pertaining of the writer  himself. In this arena , it is utterly impossible to implement  compulsion and to achieve mechanical balance with other  ideological arenas; freedom of creation to the maximum must be  insured on the basis of a common revolutionary orientation and  thinking. That was a point Lenin did not forget even when he  stressed that literature must adhere to the principle of party  spirit, with clear and explicit affirmation. On the issue of  literary and artistic creation, Mao Zedong set out the principle  of letting a hundred flowers bloom, which precisely contained  the same thinking as Lenin's. While adhering to the ideological  universality of literature and art in the past, the neglect of  the particularity of literature and art was an important  ideological root cause of "leftist" dogmatic errors. Such  "leftist" dogmatic thinking had negative effects on normal  development in creation. Under the prerequisite of opposing  bourgeois liberalization and adhering to the correct ideological  and political orientation, it is necessary to continue to weed  out such "leftist" dogmatic thinking.    Proceeding from this understanding, what enables us to  correctly resolve the issue of reflecting people's life is  primarily to reflect the life of workers, peasants,  revolutionary armymen, and revolutionary intellectuals. On this  issue of the relationship between the requirements history has  bestowed on literature and art and "self-expression" of writers  and artists, the belief that literature and art should be and  mainly is "self expression" was comparatively popular a few  years back, with comparatively strong voices. In fact, all  spiritual products are stamped with the producers themselves,  namely, the "self" expression of the producers. It is the more  so with artistic production. Artistic products always bear  sharper particular personal experiences, feelings and sentiments  than other spiritual products. The reason art cannot be  repeated probably lies here in the main. Even with the same  subject matter, in works portraying the same hero, even by the  same author, it can hardly be a complete repetition. It is so  with the writer's literary creations, the composer's musical  pieces, the painter's artistic works, and the playwright's  scripts; it is so with the performing artist, too. An actor  worthy of the name of an artist, or a fine, outstanding  conductor of an orchestra, even when he was playing the same  role or the same piece of music over and over, will offer new  variations and new creations every time; that was a fact that  the majority of the audiences already knew. We cannot generally  oppose "self expression," the question is what sort of "self."  Any writer of whatever class has his own "self," and will  inevitably express his own "self"; the "self expression" of a  writer taking the people's position naturally shares the  people's feelings and sentiments; have we not come into contact  with many good lyric poems and songs? A poet or a composer who  takes the people's position, and shares the thinking and  emotions with the people, when he gives expression to his  personal feeling is giving expression to the popular feeling at  the same time. In fact, many of Mao Zedong' poems are  "self-expressive," or expressing the "self" at the same time;  has this not most satisfactorily explained this issue? We do  not approve of and oppose only the "self expression" that is  divorced from the people and even stands in opposition to the  people. There were actually quite a few of works of "self  expression" in this category sometimes in the past. Such "self  expression" can in no way express the essential things of life.</p>

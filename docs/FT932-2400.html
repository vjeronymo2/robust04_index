			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Money Markets: Day for rate bears THE OUTLOOK for cuts in short-term rates in the UK and Germany dampened yesterday following another set of very good British economic indicators and a decision from the Bundesbank to leave its official rates unchanged, writes James Blitz. For most dealers the Bundesbank's decision was the focus of the day. But the biggest price action yesterday was in short sterling interest rate futures, which fell back very sharply at the front end, reflecting a growing view that base rates will remain unchanged this year. The trigger for the setback in sterling futures was a very surprising set of jobless figures, showing a net drop of 26,100 on the month when a 7,000 rise had been expected. This was the fourth successive drop in unemployment and another sign that the government was under no pressure to ease monetary policy. The news led to a sharp fall in the September contract from 94.25 to 94.14. The contract moved down further to close at 94.11 after the Bundesbank left policy unchanged. However, rate cut bulls could find some pickings in the late 1994 contracts, which rose yesterday after the retail price index came in as expected at 1.3 per cent for May. The news on inflation led to a substantial advance in the gilt-edged market and this helped the June 1994 contract to record a rise of 4 basis points on the day at 93.79, as dealers took the view that a sharp upward movement in interest rates might not be needed to prevent the economy overheating. The cash market was less volatile, with three-month money rising  1/16 percentage point on the day to 5 15/16 per cent. The Bank of England appeared highly accommod-ative in the removal of a Pounds 1bn daily shortage, offering a repo in the early round. The Bank may have wanted to compensate for the upward slope in rates later in the day. But one dealer dared to wonder yesterday whether a 25 basis-point cut in base rates might be in the offing, as sterling closed at DM2.51. The Bundesbank's decision to leave its official rates unchanged was a source of disappointment although, in the absence of the M3 money supply figures for May, the reasoning was hard to divine. The September Euromark contract slipped back 2 basis points to close at 93.25.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- For the first time since  Edouard Balladur became prime minister a year ago, a majority  (54 percent) of Frenchmen do not believe the conservative  government is moving in the right direction, a survey showed.    The survey, carried out after local elections last weekend  and due to appear in the PROFESSION POLITIQUE magazine dated  April 8, shows a 10 percent rise in dissatisfaction with the  government since a similar survey carried out at the beginning  of March.    In the intervening period, there has been criticism of his  handling of plans to cut the minimum wage for young people which  led to a wave of violent protests across France.    The survey was carried out among a representative sample of  805 adults contacted by telephone on Monday [28 March].    It found that the government's rating fell fastest among  right-wing voters (from 82 to 69 percent) while his rating among  people with left-wing sympathies remained practically unchanged  at 18 percent.</p>

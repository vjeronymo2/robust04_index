			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Profit-taking erodes gains in US stocks Wall Street INVESTORS took some profits yesterday, after Tuesday's record-breaking gains, to leave US share prices slightly lower at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average receded 6.42 to 3,704.35 and the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.93 to 464.81. The American SE composite finished 2.19 off at 472.54 and the Nasdaq composite, hardest hit by selling, fell 9.33 to 762.36. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 319.6m shares. The markets opened weaker, with the Dow posting a double-digit loss in the first hour of trading as investors took the opportunity to book some of the profits earned on the previous day, when the Dow broke through 3,700 for the first time in its history. The main attention of dealers and investors remained the Nafta vote in the US congress, which was scheduled for late last night. Since the weekend, hopes have been rising that the House of Representatives would vote to approve the trade pact, but there was enough uncertainty surrounding the final outcome to persuade many participants in the markets to stay on the sidelines until after the result was known. Bond prices were higher in early trading, which provided some support for stocks, but the Treasury gave back most of its gains soon after midday. In early afternoon trading the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond was little changed at 6.15 per cent. Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 and RJR Nabisco held firm at Dollars 6 1/2 in heavy trading after broking house Merrill Lynch lowered its ratings on the two stocks from 'neutral' to 'below average'. American Brands, the other main cigarette producer, dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 in sympathy. An upgrade from Merrill Lynch, however, lifted IBM, which added Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 53 5/8 on 4.4m shares dealt as the broking house's computer industry analyst rated the stock a 'long-term buy'. Hong Kong Telecom ADRs dropped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 57 1/8 as investors reacted to news that Morgan Stanley had recommended to clients that they reduce their weighting in Hong Kong stocks in the wake of the big gains that the colony's market has recorded over the past few months. General Motors remained strong following the recent positive auto sales data and a forecast from the group's chief executive of a return to profits next year. The stock climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 . Canada TORONTO lost further ground in busy trading amid nervousness ahead of last night's Nafta vote in the US and continued concern over the Canadian government's deficit. The TSE 300 index finished 20.7 lower at 4,236.5 and declines led rises by 477 to 334. Volume came to 69.5m shares valued at CDollars 722.7m.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BERGESON'S STANCE ON ABORTION RIGHTS  </P> <P> Thank you for the article (I can't believe I just wrote that) about Marian  Bergeson ("Bergeson Stands Tough on Abortion," Feb. 8). It is nice to know that  at least one candidate running for state office has genuine conviction,  integrity and veracity.  </P> <P> She is not going to do the flip-flop on the abortion issue like so many other  Republicans.  </P> <P> I believe the real reason so-called "pro-life" candidates have lost in some  major races is because they have wavered or been weak on the issue; therefore,  the pro-life constituency wasn't enthusiastic about supporting or even voting  for them.  </P> <P> The Times has pointed out -- more than once -- that Bergeson and John Seymour  (her opponent in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor) are very  similar in most aspects other than abortion.  </P> <P> Even if I were for abortion, I'm not sure I'd vote for Seymour. It's obvious he  switched positions for pro-choice votes. How can you trust a man like that?  Will he alter his views on other issues for the sole purpose of winning votes?  (Can you imagine him and Sen. Pete Wilson running California? The two do more  flip-flops than a fish out of water!)  </P> <P> BRENDA HESTER  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

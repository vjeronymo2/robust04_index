			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Gloom abates in finance sector MOST FINANCIAL services firms are experiencing lower than normal business volumes and are no more optimistic about their prospects than they were three months ago, according to the latest quarterly survey of industry trends. The survey, conducted by the Confederation of British Industry and accountants Coopers and Lybrand, found, however, that 25 per cent of the 309 institutions surveyed in December were more optimistic about business prospects, up from 3 per cent in the previous quarterly survey conducted in September. The only sector of the financial services industry reporting a decline in optimism was life insurance, where more than half of those surveyed expect growth to be constrained by the prospect of new legislation. Overall, 41 per cent of respondents reported a rise in non-performing loans in the previous three months and 28 per cent said they expected a further rise in the next three months. Financial Services Survey Number 13, December 1992. Coopers and Lybrand, Plumtree Court, London EC4A 4HT. CBI Members Pounds 32, non-CBI members Pounds 53.</p>

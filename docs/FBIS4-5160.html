			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Cho Il-min, chief of  the Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National Democratic  Front (Hanminjon), issued a statement Tuesday on the lapse of  one year since the great leader President Kim Il-song put  forward the historic "10-point programme of the great unity of  the whole nation for The Reunification of the country."    The statement says:    The internal and external situation urgently demands that  the  Korean nation implement on a higher level the ten-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by  respected President Kim Il-song.    Now that the Kim Yong-sam regime is totally blocking the  people's movement for independent reunification and persisting  in confrontation with the North, the entire Koreans in the  South, North and overseas must unite more closely than ever  before, smash the separatist moves of the anti-reunification  forces and make a breakthrough for reunification with their own  efforts.    Especially, the people in the South must demand an immediate  end to the anti-North nuclear racket and "international  cooperation system" of the United States and its followers which  may lead to a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.    When the entire nation courageously rises up in struggle to  implement the ten-point programme of the great unity of the  whole nation under the leadership of general Kim Chong-il,  closely rallied around President Kim Il-song, the lodestar of  national reunification, a new phase for national reunification  will be opened up.    The entire members of Hanminjon, together with the 70  million  compatriots in the South, North and overseas, will vigorously  fight to valiantly smash the nuclear war provocations and  separatist acts of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam  group and promote peace and independent reunification of the  country in hearty response to the ten-point programme of the  great unity of the whole nation put forward by the great  president.</p>

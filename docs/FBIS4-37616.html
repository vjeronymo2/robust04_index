			<p>BFN     [Text] Haifa Port Director (Mandi Zalsman) has revealed  that a team of Jordanian businessmen recently visited Israel and  expressed interest in the facilities provided by the Port of  Haifa to act, in the time of the desired peace, as an outlet for  Jordan on the Mediterranean.    In statements to our correspondent Shafiq Mansur, the Haifa  Port director said the Jordanians showed they are very well  aware of the achievements scored by the port and the development  projects there. The team asked if Haifa Port can provide  services such as storage, shipping, and unloading of Jordanian  goods and containers and if there was a plan to set up a free  zone in Haifa Port.</p>

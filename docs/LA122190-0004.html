			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ENERGY POLICY AND NUCLEAR PLANTS  </P> <P> Your editorial ("New Designs Are Great, but Where Does the Waste Go?" Dec. 10)  states "the new designs look good on paper." I don't know whether to laugh or  cry.  </P> <P> I can assure you that the old designs looked good on paper, too. I know. I was  a quality control inspector at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS).  </P> <P> I started out enthusiastic about an industry that promised to deliver us from  dependence on fossil fuels. Over time, I learned that the builders and  regulators of nuclear energy have been unable or unwilling to transform a good  plan into a good, safe nuclear generating plant.  </P> <P> A part of the reason is that the pro-nuclear groups (builders, operators and  the naive public and politicians) overstate the benefits and minimize the  problem of nuclear energy production.  </P> <P> I am a witness and can document numerous instances of intentional obfuscation  and cover-ups.  </P> <P> How many people who support nuclear energy realize the plants must be shut down  after only 30 or so years? They will have absorbed enough radiation to be  dangerous for thousands of years. The costs to decommission are not included in  the estimated cost of building or operating the plants. As you have correctly  pointed out, spent fuel is another problem the pro-nuclear voices are silent  on.  </P> <P> America needs a cohesive, effective, environmentally benign energy policy.  Where are the leaders with enough vision to make this issue a top priority? The  nation that solves the complex problems of energy and environment will be the  nation that leads the world during the 21st Century. Sadly, the U.S. plods  along without direction and without a vision.  </P> <P> GREGORY W. SPEARING  </P> <P> Wilmington  </P></p>

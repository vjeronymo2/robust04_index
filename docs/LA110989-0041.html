			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: PESKY SUITORS NEED A GUILTLESS 'NO'  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am a 39-year-old single professional, not currently  dating anyone, and generally satisfied with my social life (or lack thereof). I  work hard at a job I enjoy, keep up my own house and yard, and volunteer with  several organizations. My free time, which is too little and very precious, is  spent with friends and family, around my house, and doing all sorts of projects  that give my life meaning.  </P> <P> I don't enjoy casual dating for the sake of dating. Even though I would love to  meet someone special, until I do I simply don't want to go out with a man just  because he wants to go out with me.  </P> <P> I recently experienced several awkward phone calls, during which a gentleman  was unable (or unwilling) to take my hint that I was very busy. Now I have  found myself again accepting an invitation because I don't know how to say no  without sounding rude.  </P> <P> Should I feel guilty when my friends chastise me for not giving the man a  chance? What can I say to avoid unwanted dates, yet not insult the "suitor"?  With the occasional egoist who plows unrelentingly on with invitations that are  never accepted, do the standard rules of politeness apply?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Standard rules of politeness always apply, but the standard  rule for ridding oneself of a pest is an insistently firm, "I'm so sorry, but I  really can't," repeated as often as necessary. If you don't know how to say no,  Miss Manners fears what the next step would be, after you accepted these or any  other dates.  </P> <P> As to whether you need feel guilty, certainly not. Miss Manners has always  failed to understand why anyone would engage in such an unrewarding emotion.  One's time is surely one's own to dispose of.  </P> <P> If your friends really believe that you are offhandedly rejecting acquaintances  you would value, they should invite you to visit them at the same time that  such a candidate does. You would presumably spend a pleasant evening, because  you at least enjoy their company, and you could judge, with more to go on than  a telephone call from a stranger, if they were right.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- As a busy high-school teacher, I have little time to  entertain. But a night-before-the-elections dinner seemed like an opportunity  to invite some interesting guests.  </P> <P> Three close friends were invited, plus one university professor and his wife,  who had previously been guests in our home. They accepted. I also invited  another professor from the same department, with the hope of becoming better  acquainted with her; she seemed to be a fine and interesting person who would  be a special sort of guest. She left a message on our answering machine  requesting directions to our home. The final guest was to be a newcomer to the  university, from a different department, who I thought would enjoy meeting the  other guests. This guest also indicated an intention to come.  </P> <P> The professor and his wife called at 4 on the afternoon of the party to say  they would be unable to come (car trouble), and, oh yes, the other professor  had a paper to write and wouldn't be coming either.  </P> <P> My husband and the remaining guests were uncomfortable with the obvious  overabundance of food, but we all put on a jolly face. Underneath that facade  was my chagrin. Had I somehow been presumptuous in my invitation to senior  academicians?  </P> <P> If I wasn't in error, then the people from the university must be judged to be  incredibly insensitive. I had so looked forward to a lovely party, and had  spent a great deal of time and money preparing for it.  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- As you well know, these people were simply rude, and in a  regrettably common fashion. Had they been snobbish, which is what you mean by  raising the question of presumption on your part, they would not have accepted  your invitation.  </P> <P> Sudden death, preferably one's own, is the only legitimate excuse for throwing  over a dinner party at the last minute. (Miss Manners trusts that you made it  clear this was a dinner party, not simply a huge drop-in-if-you-can  television-watching preelection party.)  </P></p>

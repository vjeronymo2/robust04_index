However, he said his party was willing to cooperate with the  new government despite the Hungarian parties not being members  of the government coalition. The previous cabinet of Vladimir  Meciar rejected any dialogue, he added.    Zolyomi said he agreed that the ethnic Hungarian parties  held  the balance of power in the Slovak parliament.    Premier Jozef Moravcik said that the coalition parties  expected the above mentioned cooperation. A hierarchy of  problems solvable before early elections, to be held at the end  of September and beginning of October, has been created,  Moravcik added.</p>

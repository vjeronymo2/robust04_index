			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Japanese group may sue over County Hall delay THE JAPANESE company bidding to develop London's County Hall is considering suing the government over what it claims are losses it has incurred while waiting for confirmation of its plans for the landmark site. The Osaka-based Shirayama Corporation is furious at the government's continued failure to rule out a rival bid from the London School of Economics. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, decided earlier this week to allow the London School of Economics to submit a formal bid to move to County Hall, opposite the Houses of Parliament on the south bank of the river Thames, in spite of the government's agreement with Shirayama for a hotel complex on the site. The LSE, which is based in cramped premises off Aldwych, has been given until the end of the month to submit a fully-costed scheme, after which Mr Howard will take a final decision. The existing sale contract, agreed by Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary until the election, gives the government until the end of the year to withdraw from the scheme. Mr John Ashworth, director of the LSE, said a formal bid 'would be forthcoming'. Since it is unlikely to match the Shirayama bid - believed to be between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m net - much will depend on the balance of ministerial forces in its support. Earlier this month Mr Makoto Toyota, Shirayama's London agent, said he was 'sick to death' at the continued uncertainty and 'desperate' for an early decision. Matters came to a head when Mr Takisha Shirayama met Mr Howard this week, to be told the government had still not made a definite decision on the sale of the building, which is owned by the London Residuary Body on behalf of the London boroughs. According to the Environment Department, Mr Howard has since written to Mr Shirayama saying that he 'understood the concerns that were expressed and recognised the need to settle the uncertainty as soon as possible'.</p>

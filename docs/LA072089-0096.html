			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE BEATS BALLARD, 249-214, TO WIN EL PASO BOWLING TITLE  </P> <P> Tony Westlake rallied to defeat Del Ballard Jr., 249-214, Wednesday night to  win the $130,000 El Paso Open, his second Professional Bowlers Assn. tournament  victory.  </P> <P> Westlake trailed by 17 pins after five frames, before unleashing six  consecutive strikes to close out the match before Ballard rolled his final  frame. Westlake, who collected $20,000, also got a big break in his comeback  when Ballard left the difficult 7-10 split in the seventh frame and failed to  convert it.  </P> <P> "I knew I had a chance when he left that 7-10," Westlake said.  </P> <P> Ballard, who is second to Mike Aulby on the PBA earnings list with $182,330,  settled for second-place money of $10,500.  </P> <P> To earn the right to meet Ballard, Westlake beat Dave Ferraro, 213-206. Like  the championship game, Westlake rolled two strikes in the last frame to outlast  Ferraro.  </P> <P> "It was hard to bowl against him. He's my best friend on tour. But, you're out  here to make a living," Westlake said.  </P> <P> Ferraro, who earned $7,000 for finishing third, won two matches before losing  in the semifinal. To gain the semifinal, Ferraro eliminated Walter Ray Williams  Jr., 215-203, and opened the stepladder finals by relegating Ron Williams to  fifth place, 239-234.  </P> <P> Fourth place was worth $5,500, while fifth received $4,500.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE  </P> <P> A former Santee man was ordered Tuesday to stand trial on charges of committing  58 robberies throughout the county.  </P> <P> Paul Bresney, 38, is accused of being the "Walk to the Back" robber, in which  the bandit told his victims in various stores to go to the back of the store  while he made his getaway.  </P> <P> Many of the victims were teen-agers or young adults who were working alone at  the time of the hold-ups, which began Jan. 3 and ended with Bresney's arrest  April 21 in North Park.  </P> <P> For each day of the seven-day preliminary hearing, dozens of witnesses lined  the hallways waiting to testify. San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick set  a June 20 arraignment and trial-setting appearance in Superior Court for  Bresney, whom police have identified as a transient.  </P> <P> The judge continued bail at $100,000, and Bresney has not been able to post it  so far. Patrick dismissed seven counts because of insufficient evidence after  three counts were added to the original 62 charges.  </P> <P> About one-third of the hold-ups occurred in East County, but some occurred in  Clairemont, Poway and North County.  </P></p>

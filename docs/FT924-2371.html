			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stock dividends; a smart option? / A look at potential costs for those tempted to take bonus shares SHAREHOLDERS in public companies are more and more frequently being given the opportunity to take their dividends in bonus shares rather than cash. Opting for shares will certainly help the company's coffers but the advantages for the individual shareholder are rather more questionable. The practice of offering 'stock dividends' was popular in the 1960s and early 1970s when dividend income was taxable at rates of up to 98 per cent. The attraction of stock dividends was that they escaped income tax and were subject only to capital gains tax on disposal - but this loophole was closed in 1975. There will rarely now be a tax incentive for shareholders to take shares rather than cash and they may be worse off. The pros and cons can best be understood in the context of the treatment of cash dividends. When a company declares a cash dividend, it has to pay advance corporation tax at one-third the amount of the dividend. The shareholder then pays income tax on the aggregate of the dividend and the ACT but gets a tax credit equal to the amount of ACT paid. Take the case of a higher-rate taxpayer who receives a Pounds 75 dividend. The company must pay ACT of Pounds 25 and the shareholder will be taxed on Pounds 100. His basic rate charge will be wiped out by the Pounds 25 tax credit, leaving him liable only to higher rate tax of Pounds 15. Suppose, instead, that our shareholder opts for shares worth Pounds 75. The ACT rules apply only to cash dividends but stock dividend legislation provides for the share value to be grossed up at the basic rate of tax so the effect is the same as ACT on cash dividends. The recipient of the shares is therefore taxed on income of Pounds 100. There is no ACT-linked credit; instead, the legislation gives a specific dispensation from basic rate tax. So the net outcome for a 40 per cent taxpayer will be exactly the same as if he had taken the money - a tax liability of Pounds 15 on a benefit of Pounds 75. This is on the assumption that the tax charge will be based on the amount of the cash dividend foregone. But if, by the time the shares are issued, their market value is 'substantially' higher or lower than the cash equivalent - interpreted by the Inland Revenue as 15 per cent either way - the relevant figure will be the actual market value. This rule had a harsh impact on those who stampeded to take up stock dividends in the final throes of the 1987 bull market. Shares issued in those heady days often raced over the 15 per cent upper threshold but, after the Black Monday crash, were worth far less than the cash dividends that had been on offer. Shareholders ended up with the worst of both worlds - a smaller benefit and a larger tax bill. Market volatility can work both ways. But the salutary experience of investors in 1987 does highlight the fact that stock dividends are 'dry' income - triggering a tax liability but no liquidity with which to settle it. The absence of ACT on stock dividends is a clear advantage for companies, particularly for the growing number which do not have sufficient UK profits to absorb all the ACT which they pay. There is also an advantage in issuing more paper rather than having to part with hard cash. For shareholders the only tangible advantage is that it is a cheaper way of acquiring shares than buying them on the market, avoiding brokers' commission and 0.5 per cent stamp duty. Furthermore, the entry price will usually be the middle quotation for the stock rather than the higher 'offer' price on a market purchase. For non-taxpayers there is a serious drawback. A stock dividend means no ACT and therefore no tax credit. This makes no difference to taxpayers; the specific exemption from basic rate tax on stock dividends has exactly the same effect as the tax credit. For a non-taxpayer, this exemption has no value. A non-taxpayer receiving a Pounds 75 cash dividend would not only be exempt from tax but could also claim a Pounds 25 rebate from the Revenue. But if he elected for a stock dividend, his right to a repayment would disappear. This applies to anyone outside the income tax net - children and other low-income individuals and also tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds and charities. For those who remain undeterred, the worst shock may come when they sell the shares. The capital gains tax rules for stock dividends are labyrinthine. If the CGT liability itself does not eliminate any benefit from taking shares rather than cash, the extra fees payable to your accountant for undertaking the calculation almost certainly will.

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Allianz/Dresdner Germany's number one insurer and number two bank may have perfectly good grounds for refuting last month's Federal Cartel Office ruling that their ties are in breach of local competition law. The implication of their joint statement that Allianz's 22.3 per cent stake in Dresdner is merely a routine equity investment, though, will doubtless be taken with a pinch of salt. That said, the document is significant for the way it highlights the relative long-term attraction of shares over bonds, a traditionally non-Germanic view which has quietly been winning converts in Frankfurt this year. As for the links which have caused the fuss, Allianz's rivals are certainly entitled to be worried about such a powerful presence on the national market. There is another way for the authorities to deal with this, however, and that is to devote less effort to keeping foreign companies out of their home territory. In a genuinely liberal European market big combinations such as Allianz/Dresdner, ING in the Netherlands and UAP/BNP in France should not be a threat.</p>

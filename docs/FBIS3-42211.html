			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Algiers, Jan 31 (AFP)--Unidentified killers  murdered the national secretary of Algeria's Rally for Culture  and Democracy (RCD), Rachid Tigziri, early Monday outside his  home in an eastern suburb of Algiers, family sources said.    A cultural association representing Algeria's original  Berber  inhabitants, from whom the RCD draws its support, blamed the  "odious crime" on "terrorists" in a statement.    Tigziri was the first national official of a political party  to be murdered since armed Islamic fundamentalists began waging  a guerrilla war against the state two years ago. Numerous  intellectuals have been assassinated as part of a campaign of  fear.    The attackers slit Tigziri's throat as he was heading for  his  car outside the building in Bach Djarah, one of the strongholds  of Islamic fundamentalism in the region around the capital.    Formerly a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Labour,  Tigziri had been economics spokesman for the RCD, led by Said  Sadi. Tigziri, 42, was married and had no children. [passage  omitted]</p>

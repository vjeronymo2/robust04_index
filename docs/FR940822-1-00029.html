			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Limitations of existing measurement techniques in distinguishing between elevated radon concentrations and radon attributed to natural sources. Therefore, the staff does not propose to establish a separate standard for radon. Instead, exposure to radon at decommissioned sites would be controlled by requiring the licensee to reduce the residual concentrations of radon precursors like uranium, thorium, and radium to levels within the limit for unrestricted use and, using the ALARA principle, toward levels which are indistinguishable from background levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 16. Environmental and Social Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters recommended that the NRC develop standards for protecting natural ecosystems in addition to standards protecting humans. Others expressed concern for environmental protection without recommending for or against establishing separate environmental standards. A large number of commenters recommended that protection of human health is sufficient to protect any known ecological system. Therefore, only a standard for protecting humans is needed. Commenters stated that this is the view of the International Commission on Radiological Protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters recommended that case-by-case consideration should be given for special environmental and social/cultural issues associated with homeland, historical sites, and Native American lands because they contain religious sites and sacred areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters cautioned against establishment of unnecessarily restrictive decommissioning standards that could cause severe environmental damage trying to clean up soil and vegetation to background levels because these actions could totally change a site's ecology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC considered the possible need for radiation standards specifically designed to protect the environment. This analysis is reflected in the draft GEIS. Based on this analysis, the staff concludes that the radiological criteria in the proposed rule which are designed to protect public health should also provide adequate environmental protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the NRC staff recognizes there may be environmental or cultural issues associated with a particular decommissioning action which require special consideration. These issues can best be handled on a site-by-site basis as part on the decommissioning plan review process and as part of the Commission's environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Where necessary, opportunity for public comment and use of the Site-Specific Advisory Board will provide a mechanism for local citizens and other affected parties to be directly involved in addressing these issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 17. Recycle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments were offered for and against whether NRC should permit recycling of contaminated materials. Those in favor recommended recycling to save resources. Those opposed recommended against recycling to limit public risk. Other commenters stated that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recommended that the maximum dose to any individual from recycled material not exceed one millirem per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the proposed rule does not specifically address recycle, the NRC staff believes the radiological criteria in the proposed rule provide reasonable assurance that future inadvertent recycle of soils or structures following decommissioning of a site will not adversely affect public health. The analysis which supports the rule, although it does not specifically take recycle into account, is based on prudently conservative scenarios which tend to overestimate expected public doses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In cases where the licensee achieves residual radioactivity levels that are indistinguishable from background, the potential doses from inadvertent recycle are expected to be insignificant. In cases where the residual radioactivity cannot be reduced to the point that it is indistinguishable from background, the licensee will have to consider inadvertent recycle when conducting the ALARA analysis for the site. Therefore, steps can be taken on a site-specific basis to impose additional restrictions if inadvertent recycle appears to pose a significant potential problem at that site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission plans to consider separately the issues of how to deal with cases where the licensee proposes to release material containing residual radioactivity intentionally for reuse or recycle either as a part of decommissioning or ongoing operations. In the interim the Commission will continue to be review these actions on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Currencies The currency market appears unnecessarily confused about the effect of a German steel strike. Ahead of the ballot result, worry that industrial unrest would worsen German economic weakness pulled the D-Mark sharply down. The currency rebounded, apparently on expectations that the Bundesbank will stay as tough as ever. There is little logic to the notion that a weak economy implies a weak currency, unless it also means a relaxation of monetary policy. That is scarcely Germany's case, since money supply is growing outside its target range. The bank's preoccupation is not just with steel but the entire wage round, which means high rates well into the summer. Currency investors may, however, have misread the trend in interest differentials. Expectations of a sustained dollar recovery this year rest on the assumption that the interest differential with Germany will soon narrow. But high German rates are only one side of the equation. Futures markets may be projecting tighter US monetary policy once economic recovery sets in during the spring or summer. But though the Federal Reserve hints that rates have bottomed, it would take a formidable resurgence of inflationary fears actually to raise them as the presidential election campaign hots up. The dollar's peak yesterday at over DM1.62 thus looks overdone. So does City chatter about lower UK rates. Not only is there too much domestic political risk; renewed dollar weakness against the DM could also renew strains within the ERM. Though 10 pfennigs above its D-Mark floor, sterling is not as secure as it looks.</p>

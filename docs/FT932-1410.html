			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Late Rosyth bid for Trident refit expected to fail THE TWO-YEAR battle over the future of Britain's naval dockyards reaches a climax today with a growing assumption among politicians and defence officials that Rosyth's eleventh-hour bid to win the Trident refit work will fail. There was widespread expectation that the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth would be chosen to refit the new submarines. MPs and ministers yesterday appeared resigned that the surprise cut-price scheme submitted by Rosyth on Tuesday, which slashed more than Pounds 70m off its previous investment plan of around Pounds 130m, would not succeed. The ministerial committee, chaired by Mr John Major and involving a dozen cabinet members, which is dealing with the issue spent almost two hours discussing it yesterday. The feeling that Rosyth's new Pounds 60m plan had arrived too late was reinforced by news that the committee will meet again this morning. However, Babcock Thorn, which manages the Rosyth yard, said last night it had received no indication that its late bid had been rejected. Downing Street signalled that the aim was for the cabinet to take the final decision today about which yard should become the sole UK site for refitting and refuelling nuclear submarines. On that basis, an announcement would be made to the House of Commons this afternoon. Rosyth's last-minute bid to swing the verdict involves only half the investment cost foreseen in Devonport's latest plan. But Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, was believed to be reluctant to consider such a bid at this stage. Defence officials indicated it could not be accepted without asking Devonport to submit a bid on the same basis, using an emergency dock to carry out part of the refit work. This would entail further delay. 'We want to get on with this decision,' one Whitehall official said. 'There's an overwhelming desire to get it done.' Scottish Tory MPs met the prime minister on Tuesday, after his return from Copenhagen, to re-emphasise the case for Rosyth. Some of the MPs who have been lobbying for Rosyth have been angered by the yard's tactic in making the new offer, which is seen as weakening the earlier submissions. Rosyth now has three proposals on the table: a fixed-price Pounds 267m plan for completing a new twin-dock facility on a partly constructed site next to the current dockyard; a Pounds 120m-Pounds 130m plan for upgrading existing docks; and its latest Pounds 60m scheme.

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Liechtenstein gets to grips with European integration PROMOTERS OF the cause of European integration seem to be in trouble everywhere - even in tiny Liechtenstein. Last night it was the turn of Prince Hans-Adam, head of state in this principality wedged between Austria and Switzerland, to suffer a humiliating climbdown over a European issue after an extraordinary confrontation with his 25-member parliament. Early this week the Liechtenstein government, which is responsible to the parliament, made a decision of which the prince disapproved. The prince, who has responsibility for foreign policy under the constitution, responded by threatening to dissolve parliament yesterday. Behind this tussle - the timing of a referendum on ratifying the treaty forming the European Economic Area - lies the dilemma of an affluent tax haven coming to terms with the trend to greater European integration. The EEA, a treaty that would bind the seven countries of the European Free Trade Association in an economic union with the European Community from January, is seen by most Efta countries as a mere step towards full EC membership. But most people in Liechtenstein regard it as at best a necessary evil. The principality's prosperity derives largely from its role in helping rich people hide their fortunes from tax collectors. Liechtensteiners fear this will be compromised by closer ties with their neighbours. However, the principality has a customs and currency union with Switzerland, and since Switzerland has taken steps towards joining the EEA and ultimately the EC, Liechtenstein has felt obliged to follow. Until August, the plan was to wait until the Swiss held their referendum on ratifying the EEA - now scheduled for December 6. But Prince Hans-Adam then proposed that the principality hold its referendum before the Swiss had theirs. He believed the principality needed to keep its options open. If the people rejected the EEA, the government might apply for full EC membership. But if the rejection came in late December, it might be too late to join the other Efta countries applying for EC membership. Out of step with his people, the prince finally agreed last night that the Liechtenstein referendum will follow the Swiss one.</p>

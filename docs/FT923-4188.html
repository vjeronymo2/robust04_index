			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Interest rate questions loom beyond the Maastricht vote With the scales tipping in favour of a Yes vote in the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20, European equity strategists are looking beyond the poll to the question of a cut in German interest rates. There appears to be agreement among them that European bourses have fallen too far since the Danish referendum in June. In spite of the short-term risks connected to the referendum result, current levels offer a good buying opportunity for longer term investors, they say. But the interest rate prospect is less encouraging. Merrill Lynch recommends reducing high cash positions and re-allocating funds back into European equities, towards Germany and Sweden in particular. On balance, it believes that markets have now more than discounted a realistic assessment of the uncertainties which they face. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is also of the view that European markets appear oversold and that they are better underpinned by fundamental value than other markets. It notes that France has outperformed Europe in July and August and expects it to do well as support for a Yes vote recovers. Germany has underperformed, it says, but may outperform in the next month as weak German growth resurrects the possibility of a rate cut. Mr James Cornish at County NatWest says Maastricht is not the only consideration. In view of the slowdown in the US economy, underlined by last week's weak August employment figures, and increasing political worries ahead of the presidential election, County's forecast of the dollar at DM1.45 at the end of this year shows little improvement on the current level. Therefore, prospects for equity markets are likely to be similarly restrained. The other underlying problem is German interest rates, and with German M3 unlikely to come down to within reach of the Bundesbank's target range until the winter, only the collapse of the west German economy into recession could force an early fall in German rates. 'Accordingly, we believe that interest rates in Europe are at best condemned to stay near current levels until the end of the year,' Mr Cornish says. On the other hand, Mr Adrian Phillips, head of European research at Baring Securities, says that however distant a cut in German rates might be, bond markets are prepared to discount it well in advance. Therefore, Barings would recommend purchases of high-quality, interest rate-sensitive stocks. CCF and Societe Gene-rale in France, UBS in Switzerland, ABN-Amro in the Netherlands are among Baring's favourites, as well as Ambroveneto, for investors brave enough to venture into Italy. While the influence of the referendum appears to be waning, it still influenced European trading last week, France and Spain leading the way with strong positive performances. But Italy suffered another dreadful week, culminating in Friday's lifting of the discount rate to its highest level since 1985, in an effort to protect the lira. Generally robust senior bourses left the FT-Actuaries Europe index 1.6 per cent higher on the week, a performance matched by the World index. Spain's rally pre-empted a French endorsement of Maastricht. The market gathered strength during the week, with the general index ending 5 per cent higher. Mr Stephen Hughes at Nikko Europe says that Madrid was partially inspired by the return of institutional investors, looking to buy for the short term. The recent clutch of better than expected interim results highlighted undervaluations in several shares, which contributed to the rise in volume as buyers returned. The release of August inflation figures, expected early next week, may prompt some investors to take early profits, Mr Hughes says, since the increase in the VAT rate, introduced at the start of the month, is likely to result in a rise in the CPI of up to one percentage point. Scandinavian markets continued to be dragged lower by a spate of bad news, especially from the financial sector, and according to some analysts there seems to be little prospect of the gloom lifting in the short to medium-term. Mr Gordon Maclean, Scandinavian analyst at Robert Fleming, sees little prospect of an upturn in the economy or in corporate earnings this year. Signs of a recovery in the US economy have not fed through because of the weakness of the dollar, while in Sweden and Finland, pressure on domestic currencies led to a sharp increase in short-term interest rates last week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                    % change in local currency**  sterling** US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of  Start of    Start of                                           1992      1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +1.10    -0.16  -31.45    -15.07     -13.97      -8.25 Belgium       +0.65    -5.83   -9.92     -6.89      -5.92      +0.34 Denmark       -4.67   -13.27  -31.05    -26.04     -24.58     -19.57 Finland       -3.70   -20.50  -42.99    -29.33     -29.73     -25.06 France        +4.20    +0.05   -2.66     +1.19      +2.97      +9.82 Germany       +1.86    -5.14  -11.39     -5.99      -4.69      +1.65 Ireland       -0.92    -2.44  -17.49    -12.43     -11.60      -5.71 Italy         -6.70   -12.08  -31.78    -25.95     -25.69     -20.75 Netherlands    0.00    -1.67   -2.97     +1.30      +2.58      +9.40 Norway        -6.45   -11.15  -39.58    -23.35     -22.90     -17.77 Spain         +5.51    +0.69  -19.48    -12.39     -13.05      -7.26 Sweden        -1.58    -7.43  -21.33     -7.12      -5.96      +0.30 Switzerland   +1.63    -2.43   +2.56     +6.39      +8.03     +15.22 UK            +2.02    +0.07  -12.76     -5.94      -5.94      +0.33 EUROPE        +1.58    -2.17  -11.91     -5.81      -5.13      +1.18 Australia     -1.92    -4.29   -5.72     -9.66     -19.75     -14.42 Hong Kong     +1.47    -3.74  +40.16    +32.11     +24.66     +32.96 Japan         +3.27   +21.46  -16.79    -15.85     -19.94     -14.61 Malaysia      +1.40    -1.59   +1.63     +1.58      +4.01     +10.93 New Zealand   +1.15    -4.66   -2.35     -8.36     -13.94      -8.19 Singapore     +0.67    -5.19   -9.91    -13.83     -18.07     -12.61 Canada        +1.62    +1.12   -3.30     -2.83     -12.08      -6.24 USA           +0.59    -0.44   +7.35     +0.05      -6.20      +0.05 Mexico        -1.09    -7.27   +7.30     -5.20     -11.88      -6.02 South Africa  +1.44    -7.16   -7.92     -9.17     -28.44     -23.68 WORLD INDEX   +1.57    +3.93   -5.55     -6.35     -10.46      -4.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 4th 1992.

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Ashdown plan aims to dull Labour's rising star Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday unveiled his strategy to take the Liberal Democrats out of the shadow of Mr Tony Blair's Labour party by staking out a distinctive political agenda for the next general election. In a personal political manifesto designed to provide 'signposts' for his party, Mr Ashdown insisted that Mr Blair's election as Labour leader would strengthen rather than weaken the Liberal Democrats' electoral appeal. Welcoming the decision of Mr Blair and his fellow Labour modernisers 'to copy' many Liberal Democrat themes, Mr Ashdown said that the latest upheavals in British politics could only benefit a third party committed to change. But he refused to drop the official party line - privately dismissed by many of its senior figures - that the Liberal Democrats might co-operate with the Conservatives after an inconclusive general election. Mr Ashdown's policy statement, which will provide the focus for political debate at next week's annual conference in Brighton, casts the Liberal Democrats as the party best able to manage change in a rapidly changing world. Setting out the central planks of policy, Mr Ashdown said that the party had to take as its starting point the acceptance of a market-based, enterprise-driven economy, to enable Britain to compete in the global economy. It should also sketch out policies which involved building on, rather than dismantling, the government's reforms of public services. Above all it should focus on making the services democratic and accountable. Mr Ashdown said the party should widen its traditional commitment to constitutional reform by embracing new forms of democracy, including using national and local consultative referenda to 'reconnect people with politics'. The policy statement, Making Change Our Ally, says that Britain must also accept a pivotal role in Europe with a clear commitment to build a democratic federal structure. On the wider international stage Britain should play a leading role in reform of the United Nations to create the new world order promised - but not delivered - by the end of the cold war.</p>

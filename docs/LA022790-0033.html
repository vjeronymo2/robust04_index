			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PUBLIC ENEMY: POWER TO THE MUSIC;  </P> <P> RAP: THE GROUP WAS SENSATIONAL ON A PURELY MUSICAL LEVEL, BUT THE POLITICAL  SPEECHES WEREN'T QUITE AS GOOD.  </P> <P> Public Enemy, the controversial but acclaimed New York rap group, demands to be  judged on two score cards -- one for its music and one for its politics.  </P> <P> In the group's first Los Angeles-area appearance since a national furor over  anti-Semitic remarks by one of its members in a Washington Times interview last  May, Public Enemy was sensational on a purely musical level Sunday night at the  Palace in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The most commanding moments of the group's nearly two-hour performance -- most  notably, a closing barrage of such anthems as "Don't Believe the Hype" and the  Grammy-nominated "Fight the Power" -- generated in the jammed club the  emotionally-charged atmosphere associated with the Clash, the rock group that  was also known for its political fury. On a scale of 100, rate Public Enemy's  music at the Palace 95.  </P> <P> But the rappers' continuing insistence on having two spokesmen -- a sort of  good-cop and bad-cop of human relations -- has already caused one major  incident (the May interview) and represents a time bomb that could well explode  again.  </P> <P> Chuck D., the group's leader and main rapper, deals in provocative and  sometimes inflammatory images, but there is usually a sense of poetic vision  and control behind his impassioned remarks.  </P> <P> Not everyone in the audience is going to agree with his conclusions about race  relations in the United States, but he offers arguments that generally deserve  consideration.  </P> <P> On the other hand, group member Professor Griff -- who gave the Washington  Times interview and has since disavowed the anti-Semitic remarks -- can carry  on like a loose cannon on stage.  </P> <P> At the Palace (where the group returns tonight), he made sweeping statements  that ranged from petulant to bizarre -- outbursts against everything from the  evil media that misrepresents him (shades of Spiro Agnew?) to a theory about an  AIDS conspiracy against minorities.  </P> <P> As long as this odd couple demands to be judged as a single entry, give Public  Enemy's politics a cautionary 50.  </P> <P> Headlining a benefit for sickle-cell anemia research on Sunday, Public Enemy  opened with a nearly 10-minute commentary by Griff before Chuck D. and sidekick  Flavor Flav came on stage. As usual, members of the S1W security force stood  behind the rappers, holding imitation Uzis, a symbol of strength and  determination.  </P> <P> But the real strength is in the torrent of beats delivered by turntable whiz  Terminator X and the equally compelling verbal assault by Chuck D., who shows  increased charisma and power as a performer.  </P> <P> Though the group has a new album due in April, the emphasis Sunday was on  previously released material. But the rappers frequently broke from the music  as Chuck D., mostly, and Griff delivered speeches.  </P> <P> While many of the calls for increased black consciousness and unity drew  raised-arm salutes from both whites and blacks in the audience, the most  spontaneous applause followed Chuck D.'s comments about the evils of drug  dealing in the black community.  </P> <P> His most provocative remarks came during a pause in "Fight the Power," a song  featured in Spike Lee's film "Do the Right Thing" and the best single of 1989,  according to the nation's leading pop critics in a Village Voice poll.  </P> <P> Delivering a lengthy address as he paced back and forth, slapping the  outstretched hands of fans pressed against the front of the stage, Chuck D.  explained a line in the song that refers to Elvis Presley and John Wayne as  racists.  </P> <P> He said he was referring to Presley and Wayne as symbols of white heroes rather  than attacking the individuals -- references to underscore different cultural  perceptions of whites and blacks in a land that he sees as overrun by racial  injustice.  </P> <P> In a comparison that is bound to trigger resentment against the group in a time  when flag-burning is such an issue in the country, the rapper -- trying to  further explain the sense of alienation he feels as a black man in the U.S. --  said that the American flag has so little meaning to many blacks that it "might  as well be a swastika."  </P> <P> He followed by describing an interpretation of the red, white and blue: the red  representing "the blood" shed by blacks, the blue representing the suffering  that is reflected by the "blues we've been singing the past 400-some odd years"  and the white representing "the obvious."  </P> <P> At the end, just before fire marshals began clearing the crowded club, Public  Enemy was joined on stage by Los Angeles rapper Ice-T, who seconded Chuck D.'s  imagery, declaring that most holidays have little meaning for most blacks.  </P> <P> Public Enemy's mix of music and politics has established the band as the most  creative force in rap, but it's a risky mix. Chuck D. alone is an artist of Bob  Marley-like power. The next evidence of how well he handles that power will be  revealed when Public Enemy's next album, "Fear of a Black Planet," is released  in April.  </P></p>

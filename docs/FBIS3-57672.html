			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Digest" column: "Dialogue" between the </F> newspapers SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO (Zhirinovskiy's Falcons) and  ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI (Caucasian Military Gazette)  containing quotations by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and Zurab Gagnidze,  chairman of the National Ideology Party of Georgia (NIPG)]    [Text] [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Tomorrow, we will turn off  the power in the Urals and it will be dark everywhere -- in the  Baltic republics, the Caucasus, and Moldova. Everyone will shut  up. Telegrams will be sent to the Kremlin: We surrender. Where  is the Russian sanitary corps?" (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy [V.Z.])    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] The NIPG was the only  party in Georgia that congratulated Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on his  election success. The telegram states, in particular: "The  successful outcome of the elections manifested the aspiration of  the Russian people toward independence. We wish you success in  following this course. We hope that the victory of the LDPR  will have a positive influence on the achievement of genuine  freedom in Georgia...."    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "We have so many bacteriological and  chemical weapons that we can contaminate the entire planet. We  will infect everyone. We will have a crater but the whole world  will perish. In two weeks...." (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "Certain politologists  call Zhirinovskiy a fascist out of ignorance. In actual fact,  he is not a fascist but a nationalist in the best sense of the  word." (Zurab Gagnidze [Z.G.], chairman of the NIPG, candidate  of philosophical sciences)    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Furthermore, we are not seeking  praise. However, the fact that President Saddam Husayn received  us as the leaders of an opposition party and did not receive  anyone else -- I was the first Russian received by him after the  war.... He received me because a friend had arrived, a person  whose position was well known. We exchanged gifts." (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKASKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "I believe that Gaydar is  a bigger fascist...." (Z.G.)    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "We can frighten [them]. I can tell  you straight away: I will blackmail them. I'll tell them: If  you start interfering in Russia's affairs in the south, we will  take effective measures.... We already have military platforms  in space. They don't know where they are. The weapons are ready  there and targeted on the United States. If Yeltsin tells them  that he has apparently given instructions to remove some of  those weapons targeted on the United States, I, on the contrary,  can tell Clinton that we have targeted all our weapons on  America...." (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "The LDPR is trying to  preserve the national originality of its people...." "One can't  help being attracted to.... The main thing is the struggle  against American aggression. For a long time now, the Russian  and Georgian intelligentsia have been alarmed by the spiritual  expansion of the United States." (Z.G.)    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "Troubles for Russia have always come  from the south. All corruption began in the south when Stalin  created favorable conditions for his native Georgia. This  despot ruled Russia for 30 years during which time Georgia  became perverted and tainted with corruption that spread to  Armenia and Azerbaijan and subsequently to the East and central  Asia; it crept to the surface and finally engulfed the whole  country." (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] Correspondent: "Aren't  you afraid that Zhirinovskiy will carry out his promise to  create the provinces of Tiflis and Kutaisi on the territory of  Georgia?"    [Gagnidze] We have to understand one another and locate the  painful spots....    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The most effective method -- perhaps  the only method -- of putting an end to the bloody conflicts in  the south and the Near East is to create a so-called `sanitary  corridor' and, thereby, separate the irreconcilably bellicose  countries. Russia is required to implement this division, a  country that, in the process of historical development, has been  called upon repeatedly by countries in the East to act as an  arbitrator and protector (defender) of weak [states] who have  been subject to the aggression of neighboring peoples. This was  the case with Georgia and Turkmenistan that voluntarily attached  themselves to Russia...." (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "One would like to  believe that all his recent assurances are sincere...." (Z.G.)    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The small nations can raise an  objection; they will say that they also would like to have their  own states. My answer will be: You should have thought about  this a few centuries ago." (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "I am very sorry that  Shevardnadze has refrained from giving an assessment of the  victory of the liberal democrats." (Z.G.)    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The ideal variant would have been to  preserve the Russian empire. Some people do not like the word  "empire" but I like it very much. It is a normal good word."  (V.Z.)    [ZAKAVKAZSKIYE VOYENNYYE VEDOMOSTI] "In such conditions, our  party has every reason to rely upon the support of the broad  mass of the people. Let no one be worried by our small numbers.  It is not a matter of quantity. The Communist Party suffered a  crisis due to the excessive increase in the number of its  members. The main thing is that there is support for our  party's ideology. The future is ours." (Z.G.)    [SOKOLY ZHIRINOVSKOGO] "The principal aim is the restoration  of the Russian state (within the borders of the USSR)" -- from  the LDPR program.</p>

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TONY SERRA  </P> <P> I spent 15 years in the world of drugs, six of those years with drug smugglers  and dealers.  </P> <P> I watched my friends go from vital, creative human beings to zombies. I watched  them get murdered, overdose, go to jail and destroy their families.  </P> <P> Every time Tony Serra gets his drug clients off, he might as well hand them a  shovel to dig their graves and the graves of the people they sell to.  </P> <P> Last week another person I cared about died -- another person with a name, a  face and loved ones. Maybe that's "small" to Tony Serra because it isn't  happening to his family.  </P> <P> PAMELA BARRETT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- A white paper on the  situation of Chinese women issued here today says that in  comparison with women's exclusion from social life in old China,  New China has enabled women to make conspicuous progress in all  aspects of society.    It singles out the fields of education, science and  technology, culture, sports and public health as areas in which  women excel.    The Chinese Government has exerted great efforts to promote  women's education. In 1992 the attendance rate for girls from  seven to 11 years old had risen to 96.2 percent from less than  20 percent before the founding of the People's Republic of China  in 1949, the white paper issued by the Information Office under  the State Council says.    The proportion of females in middle schools, colleges and  postgraduate schools has reached 43.1 percent, 33.7 percent and  24.8 percent respectively. From 1982, when the academic degree  system was resumed, to 1993 some 1,149 women were awarded  doctorates, making up 9.4 percent of total Ph.D recipients.    The paper goes on to say that China also pays special  attention to promoting adult and vocational education, and  eliminating illiteracy among women.    Over 13 million women are enrolled in institutions of higher  learning. Over the period of 45 years since the founding of the  People's Republic, more than 110 million women illiterates have  been taught to read, reducing the female illiteracy rate from 90  percent in 1949 to 32 percent in 1993.    According to the paper, the Chinese Government has attached  great importance to training women scientists and technicians,  trying to improve their working and living conditions and  encouraging and supporting them in their scientific research.    In 1993, China had 8,097,000 women scientists and  technicians, making up 35 percent of the total, the white paper  says.    The paper also gives an account of the achievements made by  Chinese women in education, culture and arts, physical training,  and maternity and child care.    It says that between 1949 and 1993 Chinese athletes won 775  world championships, of which 460, or 59 percent, were won by  women.    However, the paper says that, owing to historical reasons  and  the constraints of the level of social, economic and cultural  development, some problems continue to impede women's full  participation in social life and must not be ignored.    It notes that, in particular, the majority of women have a  low level of education and in some rural areas, especially in  remote or border regions, female children are not fully  guaranteed their right to education. The government and social  organizations are adopting measures to overcome these  inadequacies, the paper says.</p>

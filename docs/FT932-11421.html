			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (1): Sensitive barometer - Belgium's prosperous and populous Flemish region is seeking new ways to exploit its trading advantages within the EC without aggravating separatist tensions or far-right extremists. As Antwerp takes its turn as the cultural capital of Europe IF PEOPLE beyond Belgium's borders know anything about Flanders, it is probably that it was once a bloody first world war battlefield. Nowadays, however, most Flemish people want the northern half of Belgium to be synonymous with economic and industrial progress, culture, and free trade, washed down with a large draught of political autonomy. 'The golden passport to Europe' is the slogan chosen by the Flemish external relations administration to promote the region. This should be a good year for the public and domestic image of Flanders. Antwerp took over from Madrid at the end of March as Europe's cultural capital. Flanders Technology International - an international science fair, showcase for the region's high-tech industries - celebrates its 10th birthday in Ghent this week. Meanwhile, the national parliament is passing a series of measures which will devolve even more power to Belgium's regions - Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels. And the Flemish regional government has launched 'Vlaanderen-Europa 2002', an ambitious effort to lay out a strategy for Flanders over the next decade, placing the region at the heart of a tripartite decision-making structure: local authorities, regions and the European Community. But even in 1993 Flanders is a battlefield for opposing forces. On the one side, the reasoned discourse of the majority, talking moderation and federalism, Belgian-style; on the other, the more strident tones of minority separatists and nationalists. The challenge for the Flemish moderates is to neutralise their more extreme opponents without inflaming the debate still further by raising their own voices. If mainstream Flemish politicians and businesspeople are to be believed, Flanders is on the brink of a new era of prosperity, built on the same basis as the Flemish booms of the middle ages and the 16th and 17th centuries: location and trade. The geographical bad luck which brought German and allied armies together in northern Belgium during the Great War, is now a boon. More than half the population of the EC lives within 500 miles of Antwerp, Flanders' first city and principal port. Flanders is less than half the (limited) territory of Belgium, and well over half the population - but its borders are open and transport infrastructure is good. Flanders' roads, waterways and railways help export 75 per cent of what the region's companies make. In some sectors, such as basic metals and textiles, nearer 80 per cent of what is produced is sold beyond Belgium's borders. Per capita, Belgium is the largest car exporter in the world: Flanders is a production base for Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo; Ghent and Antwerp provide distribution centres for Honda and Mazda respectively. But because it is responsible for 70 per cent of all Belgian exports, Flanders is a very sensitive barometer of the state of the European economy and world trade, and the region's great ports are its needle. As Mr Jan Devroe, president of the Antwerp Port Authority, puts it: 'Everything which affects the free market and limits it, affects us.' For the time being, recession is taking the shine off the golden passport. Unemployment in Flanders is running at a lower rate than in the poorer region of Wallonia, but it is growing faster, as the foreign companies which are among Flanders' largest employers begin to cut back. Public investment is at a historic low across Belgium. To the frustration of even moderate Flemish politicians and economists, the far-reaching reforms of the Belgian constitution which will formally change the country into a federal state, will give little new fiscal and financial autonomy to the regional government. Instead, the reforms are whetting Flemings' appetite for even more independence, part of a continuous and sometimes painful process of emancipation which began almost as soon as Belgium was declared independent in 1830. This tendency is easily exaggerated. For example, Flemish politicians from the main political parties cast doubt on the simplistic perception that the constitutional changes will inevitably precipitate an acrimonious break-up of Belgium, creating a west European parallel for the Czech-Slovak split. 'There is a basic conviction that the largest powers will go to the north and the south, but there's also a major part of the Flemish population which says we should maintain the kingdom,' explains Mr Luc Van den Brande, minister-president of the Flemish government - a coalition of socialists and Christian Democrats like the national administration. If Belgium is to achieve this peaceful goal, however, there will have to be a great deal more co-operation between the regions than has been evident to date. Diplomatic relations within Belgium often seem to be trickier than between regions and third countries. In recent months, for example, Mr Van den Brande has managed to arrange talks with the prime minister of the Netherlands in The Hague, but he and his Walloon and Bruxellois counterparts have struggled to organise a meeting in their own country. If internal relations do break down, then it is clear that Flemings and Walloons will be only too ready to blame one another for the disintegration of the state. Mr Guy Verhofstadt, leader of the opposition Flemish liberal democrats - now Flanders' most popular party - warns that financial imbalances between the two regional economies could be the catalyst for a split: 'If there is not a will to start up a new dialogue between the regions and communities about the financial problems in this country I think you will see a growth of separatism in this country in the next few years.' That would play into the hands of extremists on both sides of the Belgian linguistic divide, but particularly in Flanders, where the far-right Vlaams Blok party gained a shocking 10.4 per cent of the regional vote at the last national elections in 1991. The vote was partly an expression of discontent with the political establishment, but it also reflected many ordinary Flemings' suspicion of the openness which has characterised Belgium and Flanders since the second world war, a suspicion now being fuelled by recession. That is part of the reason why the Flemish government has pinned its hopes on an outward-looking strategy which 'appeals to the Flemish population to work towards a new Flanders in Europe.' Interestingly, Vlaams Blok also talks about the region's future in European terms. But when Mr Karel Dillen, a Blok Euro-MP, says he wants to 'make Flanders European' - as he did at last month's session of the European Parliament - he means he wants to expel non-EC immigrants, many of whom, ironically, were brought in as cheap labour by Flemish companies during the booming 1960s. Mr Van den Brande rejects such calls-to-arms. 'We're trying to mobilise our population, instead of regressing and building a new wall around Flanders. It's essential that we're open to other cultures,' he says. But what is already clear is that Flemings will never be comfortable with a strong international economic identity, if it is won at the expense of Flanders' vibrant historical and cultural heritage.</p>

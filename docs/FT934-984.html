			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / US telecoms controls face overhaul: Clinton administration aims to ease competition rules The Clinton administration aims to introduce legislation next month overhauling the tight controls on competition in the telecommunications and information industries. Faced with advancing technologies that have blurred the traditional lines between sectors such as local and long distance telephone, or cable and broadcast television, the administration plans to rewrite the 1934 Communications Act that still provides the framework for most of the rules governing telecommunications. The new legislation would also ease restrictions imposed by the 1982 court judgment that broke up the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly into a group of 'Baby Bells' providing local telephone service and a separate AT&amp;T offering long distance service. Vice-President Al Gore yesterday outlined the administration's ideas on telecommunications reform, and was expected to give greater detail at a speech in Los Angeles on January 11. Mr Gore's aim is to establish new regulatory models that will take technological changes into account and pave the way for much more open competition in all sectors. 'The desired end point is to move to a point ultimately where any company can offer any services through any network to any set of consumers,' an administration official said. The administration is expected to draw heavily on separate bills that have already been introduced in Congress. One Senate bill would allow the Bell companies to offer cable television, while also requiring all telephone service providers to open their networks to rivals, and guaranteeing universal local telephone access. Separate bills in the House would progressively ease the ban on Bell companies making telecommunications equipment or offering long distance service and allow telephone and cable companies to compete in each other's markets. Officials say that developments such as cellular telephone networks and fibre optic television links have made it possible to have full competition in every segment of the telecommunications business, so that the rigid rules designed to prevent abuse of the local telephone monopoly were no longer as necessary. 'Everything we do now through wires in the ground we are going to do in the air, and everything we do now in the air we are going to do through wires in the ground,' an administration official said. Some of this blurring of lines is already in progress with moves such as AT&amp;T's Dollars 12.3bn deal to buy McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest US cellphone operator, or the proposed Dollars 22bn takeover of Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable television company, by Bell Atlantic, one of the Baby Bells.</p>

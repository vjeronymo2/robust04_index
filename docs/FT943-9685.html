			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / World Trade News: China may get time to meet Gatt obligations China may be granted a breathing period on entry into the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, to give it extra time to meet all criteria for membership, Mr Winston Lord, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said yesterday. China, which was previously a member of Gatt but quit after the communists came to power in 1949, wants to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation, the post-Uruguay Round Gatt, which comes into being on January 1 next year. China's Gatt negotiators say their entry would be set back five to 10 years if the period of grace was refused. Mr Lord, speaking in Hong Kong, said: 'We would recognise that in the Gatt, they (China) would have the right in certain areas to a transition period before they're fulfilling their obligations.' He said the issue which had to be addressed was the extent to which China was a developing country, rather than an advanced developing country. 'The honest answer is, I think, somewhere in between,' he said. 'But we also believe that China is already an economic powerhouse in many ways . . . and therefore it's somewhat misleading to suggest that China is like any other poor developing country and therefore should get all the exemptions of these developing countries,' Mr Lord said. 'So we have to strike a balance.' Mr Lord also said the Clinton administration was conducting a review of its policy on Taiwan, the first comprehensive re-appraisal since the late 1970s. But he stressed that, while the United States needed to strike a balance, it would adhere to its One China policy, based on the three joint communiques with China and the Taiwan Relations Act. Any adjustments in policy resulting from the review, which would be concluded soon, will be in line with the existing framework, he added.</p>

			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> The Tony-winning musical "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" has taken another detour en  route to the Shubert Theatre here. The hit Broadway show, which had been  scheduled to open next April, has been postponed until May, 1991, the producers  announced Thursday. The troupe that will bring the show here will first play  Japan in February, 1991. One of the show's original producers is a Japanese  firm, the Suntory Corp. A brief statement from the producers offered no  explanation for the postponement but assured audiences "with certainty" that  the scheduled openings will take place. Ahmanson Theatre subscribers, who have  been offered the Robbins show as part of their season, should stay tuned.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

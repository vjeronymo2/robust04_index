On this day, the  state is supposed to recall its littlest citizens, its own  future; but because of various circumstances it does not recall  the basic principle which was still in use until quite recently:  "Everything the best for the children."    However, doctors are providing accurate statistical data,  showing that every year, as a result of the ecological  situation, the health of the children is getting worse. At this  time, we do not have a state concept of what needs to be done to  stop this process.    Since I have a direct relationship to studying the influence  of the ecology of the city of Kiev on the state of health of its  younger population, I wish to share with my readers some of my  own observations on this subject.    First of all, let us turn once more to the sad, even  terrible  statistics on the ecological status of Ukraine, so that we can  once more convince ourselves as to what we have come to by our  brutal approach toward nature. And toward ourselves as well.    Today, the atmosphere of Ukraine is the most polluted among  all the countries which used to belong to the USSR. Over 40  percent of the territory of Ukraine, air pollution is two to  three times greater than the levels in Europe. Every year, over  110,000 different enterprises send into the atmosphere tens of  millions of tons of chemically harmful materials ejected from  means of transportation. In this way, there are almost 300  kilograms of poisons for every citizen of Ukraine.    It is known that 38 percent of incorrect physical  development  and growth of a person is conditioned by the surrounding  environment. Negative genetic changes accumulate in the  hereditary material from air pollution. If these changes reach  30 percent, the nation must disappear--this is a biological law.  For example, this level has already reached 19 to 24 percent for  the Donetsk-Prydniprovsk region.    If the pollution of the atmosphere is 1.2 to 1.5 times  higher  than the acceptable levels, it causes significant strains on the  organism's defense system; if it is more, it leads to illness of  the immune system.    The ground of Ukraine is significantly polluted by wastes,  and by the uncontrolled use of mineral fertilizers. Vegetables  grown with them, and fruits with high levels of nitrates and  nitrites, have a very negative effect on people's health. Add  radionuclides to this, of which there is quite a bit in plants  and animals, and the water--and we have a picture of the effect  of the environment on our health that is not at all exaggerated.  In fact, materials from water without adequate purification make  up almost 40 percent of industrial wastes. The water plants of  the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad, Rivne, and Ternopil oblasts do  not meet sanitary rules. In almost all local drainage waters,  there is a large content of heavy metals.    And this is only a few lines for the ecological "portrait"  of  Ukraine, without even touching on the Chornobyl disaster. How  could the people be healthy? But let us return to the statistics.    The general level of illness of the population is 634.7 per  1,000 people. As a result of ecological disasters, the life span  in Ukraine has decreased to 68 years (60 years for men, 75 years  for women). Ukraine is in 32nd place in the world, according to  this indicator. We have the lowest birth rate among the  countries of the former USSR (14.5 to 15 children per 1000  people, in 1991). And this tendency is getting worse. In the  last three years, child mortality in Kiev in the first year of  life has grown thus: 1990--12.6, 1991--13.3, 1992--16.4 per  1,000 births.    The high level of child mortality is explained by the  increased number of children who are born sick. In the last 10  years, the births of children not capable of life has grown by  65 percent. If in 1985 14.5 percent of newborns in Kiev were  sick, in 1992 24 percent were. Especially worrying is the early  mortality of infants that do not survive their first year. It is  one and a half times higher than for the republic as a whole.  And one more troubling number: out of 1,000 births, an average  of 20 are deformed. Also, the level of mental illness is  increasing among children.    The health of an infant, usually, is transferred to the  school and older student years. By the end of middle school,  various chronic illnesses are noted in 46 percent of the pupils,  and in 50 percent morphological and functional problems are  present. Today, 5 to 8 percent of the graduates can be  considered healthy.    Children with chronic pathologies now make up 23.4 percent,  and those with two chronic illnesses, 13.5 percent. About 80  percent of pre-school children have health problems. Over a  third of students in schools and professional and technical  institutes suffer from nervous or psychological disorders.    Today in Ukraine, one family in 8 to 12 is childless. And  one  girl in five to six has health problems which might effect her  reproductive function.    In Ukraine, for more than three years the population has not  reproduced itself; the nation is dying. The state of health of  the nation is a mirror of the nature of Ukraine. The statistics  are not reassuring. No matter what we wish, the situation will  not soon get better. But what is there to be done now, when  eight years have passed since the disaster at the Chornobyl  nuclear power station?    I will begun with something concrete and current: it is  necessary to lower steadily the level of toxic substances in the  organs and tissues of children, to the maximally safe levels.  These poisonous substances essentially get into the organism  through eating and drinking. With prophylactic methods, the  child (and the adult) can be healthy even in today's unfavorable  ecological conditions.    The effectiveness of such prophylaxis depends on resolving  several problems. It is necessary to have simple and reliable  methods for detecting risk factors for the endoecological  pollution of the organism, a method of removing from it the  ecological poison in a controlled way, and means for renewing  its defense functions.    Concepts for such a program were developed in the Institute  of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, together with  a numerous team of doctors. Later, this program began to be  introduced through a newly formed civic structure: the Institute  of Ecology of the Person.    In the program, fundamentally new methods of investigating  the endoecological pollution of children were developed, which  in the majority of cases do not have analogs in the classical  diagnoses. Besides this, a series of effective methods of the  endoecological purification of the organism were developed,  which can be recommended to parents for use in the home.    In the year and a half that the introduction of this program  has been allowed, more than a thousand children of different age  groups and in different ecological circumstances both in Kiev,  and outside it, have gone through dispensary investigations.  Today, certain generalizations can be made.    Few children with ecologically pure organisms were found.  They made up an average of 20 percent of those studied. In  general, the health of the children of Kievans is now  practically the same, as that of the children, who were moved to  Kiev in 1986 from the 30 kilometer zone. In fact, three or four  years ago there was a quite noticable difference, in the better  health of the children of Kievans.    Investigations show that the basic reason for this is the  uncontrolled influence of the surrounding  environment--ecological poisoning.    The complex methods which we developed, which are chiefly  connected with the utilization of prophylactic phytotherapy,  make it possible to purify the organisms of children from  ecological poisons by 85-90 percent. This works best when, for a  period of two or three days before the application of the  phytotherapy, the children take synthetic enterosorbents, or  better, natural ones. After this, prophylaxis by  phyto-preparations is applied for two or three weeks. A  necessary condition at this stage is control over the organism  of the child, in order to make certain of the effectiveness of  the application of the methods of the prophylaxis, for each one,  individually.    In the process of the investigation, certain general special  points appear. The ingestion of radionuclides has the greatest  effect on the gastrointestinal tract (over 60 percent), on the  liver (20 to 30 percent), the kidneys, and the urine bladder,  since in some children an increase in the radioactivity of urine  is noted. This rule is clearly noted: in relatively identical  ecological conditions, younger children, for example pupils in  the first and second grades, have a pollution of the organism  two to two and a half times greater than the older pupils. It is  possible that this shows that the child, as he is growing,  accumulates more radionuclides and other harmful substances.    A basic point in this work is carrying out the controlled  prophylactic purification of the organism, and proof, that after  two or three weeks it will really be purified and reach a state  of relative norm. In this case, it is necessary only to carry  out, regularly and periodically, such prophylaxis either in home  conditions, or in kindergartens, and in schools as well.    Considering the very important, main role of the mother in  strengthening the health of a child, we are convinced that good  results can be achieved when diagnosis and purification of the  organism, and the renewal of its protective functions, is  carried out simultaneously by the mother and her child. This is  especially the case for small children. Indeed, this concerns  the ecology of the family. When the constant prophylactic  purification of the organisms of all members of the family is  looked after, this will be a healthy family. We think that it is  through the ecology of the family that it is possible to look  for the survival of the nation in these complex ecological and  economic circumstances.    There is yet one more side to this matter. It is necessary  for all of the state's pre-school and school institutions to  move to regulated and controlled ecological conditions. The  first results of this work in two rayons of Kiev show the great  usefulness of the organization of ecologically pure  kindergartens. Moreover, it is possible to carry out in them the  ecological education of the children, which is an important  factor in ecoprophylactic endeavors.    Since vacations are coming, children and parents are trying  to begin to get healthy. It would be worth recalling a few  pieces of advice which can be useful in purifying the organism  from ecological poisons.    Occasionally we remember general health-giving, vitamin, and  herbal teas. There are many recipes for them. Each family can  choose several types of such teas for itself. There are many  medicinal herbs, which people have used for thousands of years,  and which have curative force because they purify different  organs and tissues. For example, broth from the leaf of the  coltsfoot facilitates purification of the kidneys. Tea from the  leaf of the red bilberry purifies the walls of the blood  vessels, the liver, and the kidneys.    In the summer and fall, each family can prepare for itself  an  adequate quantity of medicinal herbs, in the necessary  assortment, for the winter. They are especially necessary for  children.    Food is also important in making children healthy. To some  degree it has to be divided up. Foods that have a lot of protein  (meat and fish), and those largely made up of carbohydrates  (kasha, bread, baked goods), must be used separately, in one and  a half to two hours.    In all of this, regular purification of the bowels,  especially the large bowel, can never be forgotten. We recommend  that all people, children, have cleansing enemas at least once  every 10 or 12 days. The means for this procedure are simple,  and there are different ones; every family knows how to do this.  Let us remember an old truth: if a person takes care of the  cleanliness of the large bowel, he will avoid almost all  illnesses linked with environmental pollution.    It is possible also to make quite a few recommendations  concerning general health. There are physical cultures that we  have half-forgotten, and the applications of baths or saunas,  when through the pores of the skin various toxins come out of  the body. It is important to be aware that the health of our  children is first of all a concern of the family and its  relationship to ecology. The sooner we understand this in the  contexts of one family, village, city, oblast, and the country  as a whole, the better we will protect our children from  illnesses.    Life itself demands that more new professionals join our  medical services, especially physician-ecologists. At every  children's polyclinic, offices for the ecology of the mother and  child should be created, special centers, where each family  could always have consultations on the ecological pollution of  the organism of the child. An example could be the office of the  ecology of the mother and child, which has operated already for  almost a year in the First Children's Polyclinic of the Moscow  rayon of the city of Kiev. This office is one of the agencies of  the Institute of Ecology of the Person. But if our efforts are  not supported by morally and financially on the state level,  they might come to nothing.    We have to do all this so that the children of Ukraine will  grow up healthy and strong. In this is the future of our state.  And the nation. In its entirety. Let us consider this on the  anniversary of the Chornobyl catastrophe.    From the editors. In future work, the author plans to give  more concrete recommendations for purification of the organism  of the child from radionuclides.</p>

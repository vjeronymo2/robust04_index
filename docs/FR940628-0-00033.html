Therefore, the Secretary has deleted this provision from the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 682.401(c)(8) has been deleted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.405&blank;Loan Rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that a defaulted borrower be afforded only one opportunity to benefit from an agency's loan rehabilitation program. The commenters believe that a borrower who defaults again subsequent to rehabilitation is not likely to be a good candidate for loan rehabilitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary points out that pursuant to section 428F(a)(1)(A) of the HEA, a borrower may request to have a defaulted loan rehabilitated and after the borrower has made 12 consecutive monthly payments, the guaranty agency must, if practicable, sell the loan to an eligible lender. Once a borrower's loan is rehabilitated, the borrower is no longer considered to be in default on the loan and regains eligibility for all program benefits. Section 428F(b) of the HEA allows a borrower with one or more defaulted loans to regain eligibility for Title IV student financial assistance after the borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments. The Secretary notes that section 428F(b) was amended by the 1993 Technical Amendments to specifically permit borrowers to receive this benefit only once. However, no such limitation was placed on the benefits of rehabilitation. In determining whether rehabilitation is practicable, a guaranty agency should determine whether a borrower who has made 12 consecutive monthly payments is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation. A borrower's previous experience in the loan rehabilitation program may be a factor considered by the guaranty agency in making this assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 682.405(a)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters suggested the regulations should be revised to allow guaranty agencies to consider whether the borrower is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation. The commenters noted that the Dear Colleague Letter (GEN 92&hyph;91 dated October 1992) provides that ``In determining whether a sale is practicable, a guaranty agency should determine whether a borrower *&blank;*&blank;* is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation.'' The commenters believed that the guaranty agency should have the discretion to deny borrowers access to its rehabilitation program if it believes existing circumstances so warrant. The commenters suggested, for example, if there is a judgment against a borrower, the original terms of the promissory note may have been altered, and the original note may be nonexistent. The commenters believed that it is overly burdensome, if not illegal, to rehabilitate a loan if a judgment has been issued against the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary interprets section 428F of the HEA to require that the rehabilitation program must be available to all defaulted borrowers even if a guaranty agency has previously been able to secure payment from the borrower only through involuntary means (e.g., through a court-ordered judgment, Internal Revenue Service tax offset, or wage garnishment). The Secretary expects guaranty agencies to provide, on an unsolicited basis, information on the loan rehabilitation program to all defaulted borrowers. However, the Secretary does not expect that payments made on the loan through involuntary means be counted toward the borrower's required 12 consecutive payments for rehabilitation. The Secretary believes that the defaulted borrower must initiate a voluntary series of payments for this purpose. The Secretary understands, however, that even after the required voluntary series of monthly reasonable and affordable payments, the rehabilitation of the loan through its purchase by a lender may not be possible in all cases. The Department expects guaranty agencies to work diligently to identify lenders willing to purchase these loans, thereby rehabilitating them. However, section 428F(a)(2) of the HEA states that the guaranty agency shall sell the loan,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> if practicable <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  [emphasis added]. The Secretary believes that the agency has the authority in working with its repurchasing lenders to determine if some borrowers are not good candidates for loan rehabilitation because they continue to represent a high risk of default once the loan is purchased. In those instances, the borrower's loan would remain with the guaranty agency and the borrower would continue to make payments on the loan to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

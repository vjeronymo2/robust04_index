			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Creditanstalt director resigns MR RUDOLF GRUBER, a leading figure in Austrian business circles, has resigned as deputy chairman and a director of Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the country's second largest bank. Mr Gruber, who is chief executive of Energie-Versorgung Niederosterreich (EVN), an energy utility, said he had stepped down because the necessary basis of trust between directors had been broken. The move follows criticism of his role in an abortive hostile bid two weeks ago for control of Creditanstalt from a group of Austrian co-operative banks. Mr Gruber was accused of disloyalty to his colleagues for helping prepare the bid and not advising them of it. He said yesterday he had acted in good faith, knowing the bank and the Austrian government were looking for investors to buy out the government's controlling stake. He said he had only acted as an intermediary between the Raiffeisen Zentralbank and the Austrian minister of finance, Mr Ferdinand Lacina. Mr Gruber said that Mr Lacina had taken the responsibility for informing Creditanstalt directors. Mr Gruber intended only to step down as vice chairman but when two motions were put to yesterday's Creditanstalt board meeting seeking his removal, he resigned from the board as well. Z-Laenderbank Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, reports a 16 per cent rise in first-quarter operating profit to Sch909m.</p>

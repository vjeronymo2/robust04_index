			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> A Bird In Hand: Five parrots named Sam, Barney, Miggsie, Loreto and Sharkey  flocked to London's Mermaid Theatre Wednesday to audition for a Christmas  production of "Treasure Island." Despite owners' claims that the parrots could  talk, most of the birds perched on the leading actor's shoulder, could manage  only a series of outraged squawks or deposit droppings on his pirate costume.  "It might be safer with a stuffed parrot," said British television star Frank  Windsor who will play the one-legged pirate Long John Silver. "But it would be  a very boring show."

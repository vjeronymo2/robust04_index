			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Inaugural speech by Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina </F> at the National Stadium in Tegucigalpa--live]    [Text] Mr. President of the sovereign National Congress and  Messrs. Deputies; Mr. President of the Honorable Supreme Court  of Justice and Messrs. Magistrates; Your Excellencies heads of  state and government and Vice Presidents; Your Excellencies and  honorable heads of special missions; national, civilian, and  military authorities; Mr. Archbishop of Tegucigalpa and bishop  of Honduras; Messrs. Representatives of the country's organized  groups; special guests; Messrs. Representatives of the local and  foreign media; Honduran people: [shouts, applause]    This prelude to the third millennium is a unique time in  man's history; it is his time of freedom, freedom before nature,  because a formidable breakthrough in the development of science  has unleashed a spiral of technological miracles that constantly  revolutionize our methods of production, life, and thought;  freedom so that every nation may seek a better future, because  not only have the markets reached world proportions, but, above  all, hopes have reached world proportions; freedom for every man  and woman to seek their own destiny, because all of the old  dogmas have capsized, and the irrepressible tide of freedom has  defeated totalitarianism and authoritarianism throughout the  world.    To state it is a time of freedom is tantamount to saying it  is time for great moral decisions; hence, at this very moment  mankind has again chosen between civilization and barbarism,  between a rational dialogue, as in Central America, the Middle  East, and South Africa, and the demential option of a new age of  violence, as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Georgia; between the  suicide of continuing to extinguish and poison our planet and  the clear awareness that either we all survive or no one  survives; between the myopic lack of solidarity among nations,  such as the myopic decision to drown poor countries with the  burden of foreign debt, or to deny them access to the markets of  the rich countries, and the lucidity [applause, shouts] the  lucidity [repeats himself] of knowing that the poor people of  the world will respect no borders pretty soon; between the  rarefied air of the government's corruption and the fresh breeze  resulting from the moral anger of a citizenry that is ousting,  in one country after another, ministers, heads of state, and  political regimes. [shouts, applause]    It is time for man's freedom, time for great moral options.  That is why the moral revolution begins today in Honduras for  all our people! [applause, cheers; crowd chants "Reina! Reina!  Reina!"] Ladies and gentlemen, the moral revolution is much  more than a campaign slogan. It is the foundation and keystone  for building a new Honduras. The moral revolution means values  will again be more important than interests and that the  people's desires will always prevail over personal interests.  The moral revolution means that Honduras is declaring itself of  legal age, and its people have chosen to play a leading rather  than a supporting role in their own history. The  majority--underprivileged until yesterday--has decided to take  control of their destiny. [cheers, applause]    The moral revolution is a daily, constant effort that should  be exerted not only at the government level but also in all of  the actions of our public and private life. The moral  revolution means all state officials--from the president to the  most modest official--will dedicate their efforts to serving the  people rather than using their position to get richer and  helping their closest friends get richer. [shouts, cheers,  applause] The moral revolution means Honduras will truly be a  legal state, where the law is the only arbitrator of the  people's actions and where the authorities are never able to  abuse their power to violate citizens' rights. [shouts,  applause, cheers]    The moral revolution means placing once again the Honduran  woman and man in a prominent position. It means recovering our  fellow citizens' personal values and self-esteem. It means all  the authorities' actions will be at the service of human  development, and that our country's riches and potential are  based on the talent, tenacity, and honesty of its people rather  than in the abundance of its natural resources. It means  recognizing that Honduras is not so much a poor country but a  country that has been poorly managed. It means [cheers, shouts]  in sum, we are not interested in economic development per se.  We are interested in the development of our people, by our  people, and for our people. [cheers, applause]    Ladies and gentlemen, the moral revolution means a new pact  between the Honduran people and their government, a pact to  rationalize the size of its administration and simplify its  procedures to have honesty instead of corruption, encouragements  instead of obstacles to private initiative. [cheers] We will not  continue to confuse the state with bureaucracy. Above all, the  state will be the expression and guarantee that Honduras has a  national unity. Honduras has a national identity, and Honduras  has a national purpose. The state is the Honduran essence in  action; it is the future about which we all have dreamed and the  future we will all build.    Furthermore, the state is the sovereign rule of the law.  Therefore, with the authority I have as a lifetime jurist and  invariable democrat, today I assert before the world: There  will be no more impunity for human rights violations in  Honduras! [applause, shouts]    My government will not allow personal interests to prevail  to benefit the upper class, nor will it allow discrimination to  exclude the lower class. The state guarantees a free and just  existence for each and everyone. It does not signify choosing  between a neoliberalism without soul and interventionism without  a future. It involves an effort to merge all the possible  markets with all the state that is necessary. It signifies  trying to respect and stimulate the free initiative of our  businessmen and our workers, so that our agriculture and  industry will compete openly but on an equal and effective  footing with the other nations.    It involves having the state, enterprise, and unions become  partners in achieving a new place for Honduras, within the world  economy. This was done by countries which, as the so-called  Dragons of Asia, did not have more wealth than we do up until a  few years ago. We will do so to defend our agriculture up to  the phase of processing and commercialization, where the largest  part of the aggregate value is generated. We will do so, to  diversify farming and artisan exports, to reconvert industry or  to consolidate ecotourism. It means, above all, an effort to  progress from formal democracy to real democracy. Hondurans  will not only be equal before the law but equal in life, to  break that infamous encirclement in which hunger, poor health,  and ignorance have so many of our fellow citizens trapped  [applause] so that we may look into the eyes of our children and  tell them there is an opportunity for everybody on earth.    Ladies and gentlemen, I have never been a salesman of  dreams.  I am not unaware of the tenacity, complexity, or the extent of  the problems of our Honduras, nor have I been a collector of  recriminations. The people already had their say in the  administration of my distinguished predecessor, whom I warmly  embrace on this symbolic day of our republican life. [applause]    The people know how difficult the economic, social,  financial, and foreign exchange problems the new administration  will have to face. I did not promise rivers of milk and honey.  I offered to change the shamed face of our fatherland. I  offered the dignified austerity of a government that will work  with as much tenacity and honesty as do the peoples of the  Republic of Honduras. [applause]    I promised not to take into consideration how state  decisions would affect or not affect my personal interests and  those of my relatives and friends. I promised to govern for all  Honduras, and I will govern for all Honduras. [applause] It is  the only thing I can do after being in love for such a long  time, always in love with my Honduras, my fatherland.    I give you my word of honor before God, the people and  history that I will succeed in the plan that I have undertaken.  I am going to defeat corruption in Honduras. [applause, cheers]  I am going to implement social liberalism. I am going to carry  out a moral revolution for all our people.    I pledged to do this and the time has come to begin  fulfilling my solemn promises to the people. The administration  of all properties I own will be crystal clear. The president of  the Republic will not be directly or indirectly involved in  private businesses or companies. [applause, cheers]    The members of my government cabinet must present sworn  statements of their current assets and liabilities, and they  will refrain from conducting business deals with any state  institutions. [applause] In the next few hours I will appoint a  special auditor for each public institution. [applause] I will  end the confidentiality with which certain budget entries have  been handled for some time. [applause, cheers] I will impart  precise instructions to the state's comptrolling and inspection  bodies. I will not hesitate to report any attempt to shelter  the corrupt with the blanket of impunity. [applause, cheers] I  will send to Congress a bill for a code of ethics for government  employees.    I have nominated individuals of undisputed moral integrity,  as well as of the highest intellectual qualifications and the  most recognized professional backgrounds, for the Supreme Court  of Justice.    I will convoke the Higher Council of Economic Planning to  begin the great process of national dialogue.    We will immediately and drastically begin cutting all  superfluous spending by the Honduran state. [applause]    With the patriotic participation of the Armed Forces, we  will  define its role in the new scenario of peace, democracy, and  development. I respectfully greet the chief of the Armed Forces  of the Republic of Honduras. [applause]    We have already initiated the dialogue with multilateral  credit organizations to clear the horizon in matters pertaining  to currency exchange and to prevent the need to service the debt  from suffocating urgent social problems. Under the personal  direction of the president of the Republic, ministers for  economic and social issues will form a special council with new  methods to coordinate social and economic issues into a single  policy.    We will increase social spending until we bring it to 35  percent of the state's budget. [applause] The savings derived  from the austerity program and the cuts in superfluous spending,  as well as the funds received from international cooperation,  will be earmarked for priority programs of human development,  food security, basic health, basic education, productive  employment, and housing.    Distinguished delegations from friendly countries and  international organizations, you are cordially welcome in this  land of liberty and tolerance called Honduras. [applause] It is  true that in the struggle that brought mourning to our neighbors  during that suicidial decade of the Cold War, Hondurans were  forced to assume leading roles that we did not seek and did not  want. But the wounds from that episode have already healed.  Democrats throughout the world have a fatherland here in  Honduras. I hope that Hondurans will continue to count on  international solidarity to make this fatherland a pillar of  democracy and development.    Once more we can walk together with our Central American  friends to consolidate our democratic accomplishments, to  eliminate extreme poverty, to foster the economies, to protect  the environment, and to adopt an emergency program that avoids  any setback for the peace for which we worked so hard. We can  now walk together to deepen economic, political, and social  integration with greater participation by civilian society and a  better articulation of regional institutions.    We can be present for the processes of continental  integration and inter-American forums and those of the  international community without being haunted by the specter of  old suspicions. Honduras has chosen to be genuinely free,  socially just, and politically sovereign. Honduras has chosen  to come of age.    Fellow countrymen: Today we bid paternalism farewell. The  tasks ahead are too beautiful for any Honduran to renounce the  adventure of participating in their implementation. These tasks  are too great for the shoulders of Carlos Roberto Reina alone.  They are too great for a government team. These are tasks that  can have but one size, the enormous size of Honduras, a Honduras  that will keep its appointment with destiny and at long last  cease to be the hesitant and uncertain fatherland that used to  pain Francisco Morazan so deeply. [cheers]    That is the reason for the great national agreement I  proposed as a candidate and that I begin to promote today as the  president of all Hondurans. [cheers, applause] Being a Liberal  is a way, my own way of loving Honduras, but there are other  ways to love it. There is the Nationalist way, and there are  other ways of expressing the same love for the fatherland. Let  us work together, said a wiseman in ancient China on the  threshold of the first millenium. A people that remains  together for year will be strong for five years. A people that  remains together for five years will be strong for a century.  But a people that remains united for a century will be strong  forever! That is the new Honduras I am proposing in this solemn  ceremony. [applause]    Honduran brothers, let us begin now, with God as our  witness.  Let us begin! Good health to you, Honduran brothers. Good  health to you, visitors to Honduras. [applause]</p>

If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of sections 406(a), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) by certain accounts (the Prior Plan Accounts) in the Trust of certain limited partnership interests (the Limited Partnership Interests) and an undivided interest in certain real property (the Property Interest; collectively, the Interests) to Otter, Inc. (Otter), a party in interest with respect to the Trust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed exemption is conditioned upon the following requirements: (1) All terms and conditions of the Sale are at least as favorable to the Prior Plan Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction; (2) the Sale is a one-time cash transaction; (3) the Prior Plan Accounts are not required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with the Sale; (4) the Prior Plan Accounts receive a sales price equal to the greater of: (a) the fair market value of the Interests as determined by qualified, independent appraisers; or (b) the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Interests; (5) the trustee of the Trust determines that the Sale is appropriate for the Prior Plan Accounts and is in the best interests of the Prior Plan Accounts and their participants and beneficiaries; (6) the Prior Plan Accounts, prior to the Sale, obtain the written consent of the general partner of each of the limited partnerships involved with respect to the sale of the Limited Partnership Interests; and (7) the other partners of such limited partnerships, as per the limited partnership agreements, are given the right of first refusal with respect to the Limited Partnership Interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Facts and Representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Sammons Corporate Services, Inc. (SCSI), an affiliate of Sammons Enterprises, Inc. (SEI), sponsors a defined contribution plan designated as the Sammons Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Plan), the assets of which are the corpus of the Trust. SEI is the common parent of Consolidated Investment Services, Inc. (CIS), of which Otter, SCSI and many other corporations are subsidiaries. SEI, through various wholly owned subsidiaries, is involved in a variety of industries, including the insurance, cable television, industrial supply and bottled water industries. Otter is engaged primarily in the business of collecting and monetizing debts incurred in oil and gas related transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. As of December 31, 1993, the Trust had total assets of $101,618,265 and 2,242 participants. The trustee of the Trust (the Trustee) is Texas Commerce Bank, N.A., formerly Ameritrust, N.A. The Trustee has the sole investment discretion with regard to the Trust's assets. The purpose of the Plan is to invest primarily in the outstanding stock of SEI (the Stock), which is not publicly traded. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As of December 31, 1993, the Trust held approximately ninety-eight percent of its assets in the Stock. The Trust owns 7.65 percent of the Stock; the balance of the outstanding stock is privately held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The applicants represent that the Stock is qualifying employer securities (QES) within the meaning of section 407(d)(5) of the Act and that the exemption provided by section 408(e) of the Act applies to the acquisition of the Stock by the Trust. In this proposed exemption, the Department expresses no opinion on whether the Stock constitutes QES within the meaning of section 407(d)(5) of the Act or whether the requirements of the statutory exemption, as set forth by section 408(e) of the Act, have been met by the Trust under the circumstances described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. In 1960, Texas Marine &amp; Industrial Supply Company (TMIS), a Texas corporation engaged in the business of selling marine supplies, adopted the Texas Marine &amp; Industrial Supply Company Profit Sharing Plan (the TMIS Plan). In 1971, TMIS was acquired by TMI Supply Company and, as a result of that transaction, became a member of the consolidated group of which SEI is the common parent. Effective 1991, the TMIS Plan merged into the Plan. As a result of this merger, the existing TMIS Plan accounts were frozen and all future contributions under the TMIS Plan were discontinued. The Prior Plan Accounts consist of these frozen accounts which have been maintained as separate accounts for TMIS employees under the Trust and have continued to be invested in assets other than the Stock, such as the Interests described herein below and certain liquid investments in securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Prior Plan Accounts involve forty-three participants. The fair market value of the assets in the Prior Plan Accounts totalled $1,994,394 as of December 31, 1993. The Interests account for approximately twenty-five percent of the Prior Plan Accounts' assets. Several TMIS employees who have substantial amounts in the Prior Plan Accounts are expected to retire in the near future. Therefore, the Trust must convert the assets in the Prior Plan Accounts into more liquid investments to insure that sufficient cash will be available to make such distributions. Because Otter has offered to purchase the Interests at a price higher than any actual or anticipated offers resulting from the Trustee's efforts to sell the Interests to an unrelated party, the Trustee proposes to sell the Interests to Otter for the greater of: (a) The fair market values of the Interests as determined by qualified, independent appraisers; or (b) the Prior Plan Accounts' aggregate costs of acquiring and holding the Interests. The Sale will be a one-time cash transaction, and the Prior Plan Accounts will not be required to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Sale. The Trustee has determined that the Sale is appropriate for the Prior Plan Accounts and is in the best interests of the Prior Plan Accounts and their participants and beneficiaries. However, the Sale will be subject to the Prior Plan Accounts obtaining, prior to the Sale, the written consent of the general partner of each of the limited partnerships involved with respect to the sale of the Limited Partnership Interests. In addition, the other partners of such limited partnerships, as per the limited partnership agreements, must be given the right of first refusal with respect to the Limited Partnership Interests. The inability of the Prior Plan Accounts to sell one of the Limited Partnership Interests to Otter either due to the failure of the Prior Plan Accounts to obtain the written consent of the general partner or the exercise of the right of first refusal by any partner does not preclude the sale of the other Limited Partnership Interest to Otter if the requisite conditions are met. Accordingly, Otter and the Trustee request an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Sale of the Interests under the terms and conditions described herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

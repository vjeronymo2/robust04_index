			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> JORDAN VALLEY OFFERS CLUES ON HUMAN HISTORY  </P> <P> The fertile hills around the ancient settlement of Pella are yielding traces of  a million years of human activity in the Jordan Valley.  </P> <P> Archeologists digging here for 12 years under the direction of Prof. Basil  Hennessy of Sydney University in Australia have uncovered a record of human  existence reaching back to Stone Age hunters and forward to Ottoman times, and  most of the years in between.  </P> <P> "With this single site, we will eventually be able to rewrite the entire  archeological history of northern Jordan," said dig coordinator Alan Walmsley,  also of Sydney University.  </P> <P> Pella, watered by a perennial stream, lies at about sea level in the  once-forested foothills of the northern Jordan Valley, 55 miles northwest of  Amman.  </P> <P> A popular picnic spot, especially when spring flowers carpet the hillsides, it  once straddled ancient trade routes linking Arabia, India and China with Syria,  Anatolia, Greece and Rome.  </P> <P> Villagers now graze flocks of sheep and goats among the remains of Roman,  Byzantine and Islamic buildings that dot the slopes overlooking the Jordan  river.  </P> <P> But the visible ruins, less spectacular than the ancient rock city of Petra in  the south or the Greco-Roman town of Jerash to the east, tell only a fraction  of Pella's story.  </P> <P> "The importance of Pella is that we are establishing a historical and  occupational sequence of the site from the very earliest periods down to the  Ottoman era," said Ghazi Bisheh, director of Jordan's antiquities department.  </P> <P> He said the discovery of an Abbasid settlement at Pella could help to change a  widely held view that Jordan declined in population and importance after the  Abbasids defeated the Omayyad dynasty and transferred the capital of the Muslim  empire from Damascus to Baghdad in the mid-8th Century.  </P> <P> "There's now strong archeological evidence that the decline was not as drastic  or comprehensive as thought," he said.  </P> <P> Occupation at Pella moved slightly north of earlier sites after an earthquake  in AD 747.  </P> <P> "It has given us the best collection of Abbasid pottery and glass in Jordan,"  said Australian archeologist Margaret O'Hea. "We have complete vessels dating  from the 8th to the 10th Centuries, as well as a city street and a courtyard."  </P> <P> The absence of earlier or later remains at the site, just three feet below the  surface, allows precise dating.  </P> <P> "Several seasons of meticulous work at Pella have allowed notable advances in  our knowledge of the ceramic typology of the Byzantine, Omayyad and Abbasid  periods," Bisheh said.  </P> <P> Until geological changes culminating about 11,000 years ago, Pella lay by a  giant lake known as Lissan of which the present-day Dead Sea and Sea of Galilee  were part, Walmsley said.  </P> <P> Stone tools to butcher animals were discovered at a camp used by  hunter-gatherers near Pella around 17,500 BC.  </P> <P> Basalt handmills, mortars and pestles found near Pella point to agriculture  emerging after the end of an ice age brought warmer temperatures. The  650-feet-deep lake slowly receded because of evaporation and movements in the  Earth's crust.  </P> <P> Excavation of a settlement at Wadi Hammeh, one mile from Pella, has shown that  people of the Natufian period around 10,000 BC gathered wild barley and other  plants, hunted gazelle, sheep and goats, and practiced arts and crafts.  </P> <P> Their mudstone slabs engraved with concentric square motifs -- prized finds for  the Pella archeologists -- are among the earliest surviving "rock-art" from the  prehistoric Near East.  </P> <P> By the 16th or 15th Centuries BC, Pella appeared to have been a prosperous  city, trading with Cyprus, Egypt and Syria.  </P> <P> A beautifully carved ivory inlaid box from this period is among a range of  cultural artifacts that include silver and jewelry, cosmetics in alabaster  vessels, conch shells, steatite scarab signets, gold thread and bronze pins.  </P> <P> The city's fortunes ebbed and flowed until it was abandoned for more than two  centuries of Persian rule from 539 BC to 332 BC.  </P> <P> Contemporary historians began referring to Pella again after Alexander the  Great conquered the Middle East in 333 BC and it enjoyed fresh prosperity in  the 2nd and 1st Centuries BC, trading widely and minting its own currency.  </P> <P> It continued to expand under Roman rule in the first 300 years after Christ and  had a population of up to 25,000 in the Byzantine era in the 5th and 6th  Centuries.  </P> <P> Decline linked with earthquakes, invasions and plague affected Pella before the  Muslim army defeated the Byzantines at nearby Fihil in AD 635 and subdued the  city peacefully.  </P> <P> Archeological evidence indicates that a Christian minority coexisted with the  Muslims for centuries after the Islamic conquest, but Pella gradually lost its  importance as a trading center and was abandoned sometime during the 16th  Century.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Criminals Must Face Justice" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA)--Members of Greenpeace,  an international organisation of environmental movement, held an  anti-nuke rally in Samchok, South Korea, together with members  of South Korean organisations of environmental and anti-nuke  movement, at which they urged the puppet authorities to stop the  construction of an atomic power station, sounding warning  against the danger of radioactive leakage from it.    This is an expression of the unshakable will of the members  of Greenpeace and the South Korean people not to tolerate the  criminal acts of the South Korean puppets in dumping nuclear  waste in the sea to destroy the ecological environment of the  Korean nation and mankind, declares MINJU CHOSON in a commentary  today.    The analyst says:    Nuclear waste dumping in the sea by the South Korean puppets  is a heinous crime in reducing the Korean peninsula and its  surrounding waters to a barren region contaminated with nuclear  substance and a wanton violation of the international law and  convention banning nuclear waste dumping in the sea.    It is quite natural that Greenpeace members conducted  anti-nuke activities in South Korea together with the local  people.    If the Kim Yong-sam group continue to dump nuclear waste in  the sea and wreck ecological environment while accelerating the  development of nuclear weapons, ignoring the unanimous protest  of the people at home and abroad, it will face a stern judgement  by the whole nation and the world people.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" of interview with Conrado Seminario, executive </F> director of the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy, IPEN, by  Iris Alegria C.; place and date not given]    [Text] [Alegria] Dr. Seminario, what are the main projects  being developed by IPEN?    [Seminario] Our institute is doing two kinds of  investigations. First, we have the projects for the development  of applied technologies, which provide for various techniques  for testing several materials. These investigations are being  made at the Nuclear Research Center of Peru.    [Alegria] How are those projects financed?    [Seminario] Financing comes from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), while IPEN professionals participate in  the development of projects. The duration of the projects is  generally two to three years.    [Alegria] What are the applications of that research?    [Seminario] It is very important to emphasize that the work  has biomedical, agricultural, and industrial uses. The results  provide techniques that can be used by economic agents in  general, and are a clear example of the transfer of technology.    [Alegria] What other type of research is IPEN doing?    [Seminario] There are other projects, with various  objectives. Among them is the project for food irradiation  technology, in which we are receiving international technical  cooperation.    [Alegria] Is IAEA cooperating in this project?    [Seminario] Right. IAEA has provided the equipment, which  consists of a source of cobalt 60 (a material that emits gamma  radiation) and the electromechanical part. The equipment, worth  $1.5 million, is about to arrive in Peru.    [Alegria] When will project operations start?    [Seminario] We are now building a special facility -- 60  percent of the construction has already been completed -- that  is necessary for the installation of the equipment. We estimate  that construction will end in four months.    [Alegria] And when will the plant begin operating?    [Seminario] By the end of the year, because installation of  the equipment will take four months. Russian technicians will  come for this purpose. It will then be possible to use gamma  rays for food preservation.    [Alegria] What will be the specific applications of the  project?    [Seminario] The plant will have two main uses. First, it  will serve to extend the shelf life of food by inhibiting  deterioration (thus permitting transportation and exportation of  food). On the other hand, it will be used for the  decontamination of vegetables (eliminating microorganisms,  fungi, and bacteria).    I want to emphasize that this plant will also serve to  exhibit the technology of the field and prove the profitability  of nuclear activities. There are many privately owned plants  like this around the world.    [Alegria] What will be the main economic repercussions of  this project?    [Seminario] This technology will permit major progress in  the  manipulation of food, and this will expand the supply of  exportable farm products.    This technique has actually been used, at a laboratory  level,  for the past four years. Unfortunately, the scale at which we  can operate is limited because of the small size of our  equipment.    [Alegria] What specific work has been done?    [Seminario] For example, decontamination of carmine dye for  export. As you know, this product is obtained from an insect  (cochineal), which is found in tuna. The insect has some  "natural" contamination that has to be eliminated in order to  access international markets.    We have also treated lucuma [local Peruvian tree] flour,  cacao, and even murex capsules.    [Alegria] That is, relations with the private sector have  already been established...    [Seminario] Right, and they are quite good. Our facilities  are also used by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries for  the preservation of raw materials (which are very sensitive),  and for the sterilization of products for surgical use.    Nuclear sterilization (or radio sterilization) has great  potential, because this method is more advantageous than the  others. There are currently more than 150 nuclear plants  providing this service throughout the world.    [Alegria] Is irradiation for preserving food also widely  accepted?    [Seminario] Of course. In 1983 a special committee  consisting of FAO, WHO, and IAEA specialists recommended this  for the preservation of food. From that time on, every country  has been studying specific cases to establish its own dosages.    [Alegria] IPEN recently signed several agreements with  Concytec [National Science and Technology Council]. Are any of  the agreements related to food preservation?    [Seminario] Yes. We believe this technology can provide  concrete solutions to the country's food problem. The current  loss of harvested food is over 30 percent, and this percentage  could be reduced by nuclear irradiation.    We should understand that it is more difficult to create new  agricultural zones than to prevent part of the harvested food  from being lost. We are talking about practical solutions. For  example, in the case of fish, the irradiation technology can be  applied as a complement to other conservation techniques to ease  transportation.    [Alegria] What will the agreement with Concytec consist of?    [Seminario] It will serve to complete the laboratory  equipment, and to carry out the research, development, and  dissemination of the project.    [Alegria] What is the professional level of the people  working in the IPEN?    [Seminario] Two training programs have been carried out  since  the institution was created. The first was carried out in this  country, and the second involved a training period in Argentina.    We had a full staff in 1988, and from that time the training  has been constant. We have given master's degree courses at  Peruvian universities. Agreements have been signed with the  Engineering and San Marcos Universities for the implementation  of postgraduate courses in nuclear engineering and nuclear  chemistry.    In sum, I can say that our capability and experience put us  in a good position within the Latin American context.    [Alegria] What is the importance of science and technology  at  the international level?    [Seminario] Very important. The UN Development Program  (UNDP) has adopted the issue of scientific and technological  progress and the modernization of the productive sector as one  of the priority issues for the 1992-1996 period.    This issue was adopted as a result of concerted action by  Latin American countries, which have recognized the urgent need  to develop their own science and technology, to increase  production and competition and to reach the levels of the  developed countries.    [Alegria] Finally, what are the prospects for the use of  nuclear energy in industry?    [Seminario] Since nuclear fission was discovered 50 years  ago, the application to industry of the energy liberated by this  process is so large that there is no area of the technological  field that has not been experimented with. Its application has  therefore benefited man at the industrial level.</p>

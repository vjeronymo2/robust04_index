Ramos said the two proclamations he signed  are based on the recommendations of Justice Secretary Franklin  Drilon, Defense Secretary Renato De Villa, and Rafael Alunan  III, secretary of the Department of the Interior and Local  Government.    [Begin Press Secretary Jesus Sison recording, in progress,  in  English] ...as an anchor of political, economic, and social  stability and development has steadily moved forward with the  overwhelming acceptance and support of the Filipino people. We  shall enhance and hasten this process. We're addressing, among  other things, the legal status of the main rebels and insurgents  who have already returned or have expressed their desire and  readiness to return to the legal fold and join the mainstream of  Philippine society, the president said.    He added: We also recognize that our men in uniform have, or  may have, committed punishable offenses, punishable offenses in  relation to their carrying out of counterinsurgency and law  enforcement operations. An amnesty is extended to them as well,  so as to promote an atmosphere more conducive to the attainment  of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. [end recording]</p>

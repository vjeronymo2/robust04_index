			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SYMPHONY'S POPS SALUTE RINGS FALSE  </P> <P> Since the San Diego Symphony's summer season was announced last spring, the  theme for this week's pops program vacillated between the overtly militaristic  and the benignly nautical.  </P> <P> It started out with a military emphasis, but when the pops program book went to  press last month, "Splash on the Bay" was the chosen theme. Then, in light of  the recent military deployment in Saudi Arabia, guest conductor Andrew Massey  took the opportunity Wednesday night to stress the military character of the  pieces still left over from the original plan. He also dedicated the concert to  the men and women of the American armed forces. Richard Rodgers' "Victory at  Sea" and Franz von Suppe's "Light Cavalry" overture were prominent on the list  of military salutes.  </P> <P> Patriotism did not ensure good music, however. Rodgers' smug orchestral suite,  written for a 1952 television documentary depicting the glories of the American  naval forces during World War II, was the kind of facile, jingoistic music  contrived long after the grim realities of combat had faded. The symphony's  seamless performance did justice to the composer's style, but such musical  platitudes rang false with the threat of war looming in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> The orchestra's most respectable offering Wednesday was Wagner's overture to  "The Flying Dutchman." Despite Massey's ponderous tempo, the orchestra infused  the tuneful composition with shapely melodies and an unusually expansive air.  The brass section, bolstered by the return of principal trumpet Calvin Price,  supplied apt Wagnerian grandeur. Massey and the orchestra also played marches  by Edward Elgar and John Philip Sousa, choices appropriate to the guest  conductor's English origin and his current post as music director of the Fresno  Philharmonic.  </P> <P> On the lighter side, the program included unobjectionable renditions of Percy  Grainger's string arrangement of "Londonderry Air," Lee Holdridge's "Love  Theme" from the movie "Splash" and a pastiche of motion picture themes from the  pen of Franz Waxman.  </P> <P> Alan Menken's five-movement suite from "The Little Mermaid," a saccharine grab  bag of insipid cliches, marked the absolute nadir of pops programming this  season. "The Little Mermaid" should carry a warning label advising its lethal  threat for anyone with so much as a diabetic symptom.  </P> <P> The attendance at Hospitality Point was reported at 1,895.  </P></p>

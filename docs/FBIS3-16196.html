The  press-conference was held following his meeting with Babken  Ararktsyan, the Armenian Speaker of Parliament.    Rasul Guliyev also said that a verbal agreement had been  achieved and according to the agreement Armenian military units  must withdraw from the occupied territories of Fizulinskiy,  Dzhebrailskiy, Zangelanskiy, Kubatlinskiy and certain sections  of Lachinskiy within twenty days after the signing of the  agreement signed. It is expected that the agreement will  require the Armenian forces to retreat inward from the Karabakh  border by ten kilometres. At the same time Azeri forces are  expected to move their forces by ten kilometres in the opposite  direction, thereby creating a buffer zone where international  observers will be stationed. Rasul Guliyev also noted that  opposes the relocation of separate forces in the territory of  Karabakh. [sentences as received]    He also noted that the Lachin corridor would still be  controlled by Karabakh Armenians for the purposes of  communication. At the same time, Armenia will be required to  end the blocade preventing communication between Nakhichevan and  the rest of Azerbaijan.    As soon as the agreement goes into effect, both sides will  discuss the status of Upper Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh]. Rasul  Guliyev didn't tell that whether the discussion would be  conducted in the frame of the Minsk group of CSCE or not.    Remarkably, Rasul Guliyev didn't mentioned the  Kelbadzharskiy  and Agdamskiy regions' setting free from Armenian forces.  Though earlier the government leaders stated the freedom of all  the occupied territories.    As the observers in Baku note the conditions of the peaceful  settlement which Rasul Guliyev notified in Gazakh was proposed  by Moscow. Earlier, Baku opposed this plan and considered it  "humiliating". However, Moscow has refused to amend the  settlement plan and Azerbaijan was obliged to accept it.    In light of this, Russia has taken the next successful step  towards consolidating Transcaucasia. At the same time, CSCE  appears to fulfill the role as on-looker in the region.</p>

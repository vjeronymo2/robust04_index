			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)--AL-AHRAM writes that the  United Nations' efforts to disarm Iraq, which are part of the  preparations to implement long-term monitoring of Iraq's  armament, again raise the issue of controlling nuclear,  conventional, and nonconventional armaments in the Middle East.    The paper recalls the Security Council resolutions that said  disarming Iraq should be part of a process to rid the Middle  East of all weapons of mass destruction and to establish a new  security order in the region.    While acknowledging that the effort to control armaments in  the region is primarily linked with an Arab-Israeli settlement,  the paper, in its editorial today, adds that the part of these  resolutions that has been implemented involves Iraq alone.    AL-AHRAM stresses that the Iraqi threat, which some parties  used as an excuse in the past, no longer exists. It adds:  Further, achieving progress in the efforts to control armaments  will necessarily create a better climate for boosting the  overall settlement process.</p>

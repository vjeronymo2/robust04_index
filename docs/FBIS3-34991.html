			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] India has said it is unfortunate that the U.S.  President, Mr. Bill Clinton, had made common cause with Pakistan  in his remarks on human rights in Jammu and Kashmir. An  External Affairs Ministry statement issued last night said that  Mr. Clinton has not taken into account the proven role of  Pakistan as a state sponsoring terrorism, and no concern has  been expressed for the human rights of the victims of the  terrorists armed, trained, and sent into Jammu and Kashmir by  Pakistan. The statement said that India is committed to uphold  human rights as a part of its heritage and as enshrined in its  Constitution and laws.    On the nuclear front, the statement said India neither had  nor intended to acquire weapons of mass destruction. But  Pakistan's nuclear intentions are well known and had been  confirmed time and again. It said the real danger is not of an  India-Pakistan nuclear exchange, but of nuclear adventurism on  the part of Pakistan.</p>

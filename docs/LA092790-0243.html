			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BRITAIN, IRAN RESTORE RELATIONS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: THE TIES WERE SEVERED WHEN KHOMEINI CALLED FOR THE DEATH OF "SATANIC  VERSES" AUTHOR SALMAN RUSHDIE.  </P> <P> Britain and Iran announced today they have restored diplomatic relations, which  were severed over the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call for Muslims to  kill Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic Verses."  </P> <P> The restoration -- announced at the United Nations by British Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd and in a statement from Iran's U.N. Mission -- said the embassies  would reopen in London and Tehran within a month.  </P> <P> An announcement was also made in Tehran by Iran's official Islamic Republic  News Agency.  </P> <P> The Iranian statement gave no reason for the restoration of relations, saying  only that it was based on "mutual respect."  </P> <P> Hurd said that in recent statements Iran had made clear its respect for  international law and had pledged not to interfere in the internal matters of  other nations. That was taken as an assurance that Iran would not try to send  assassins after Rushdie, who is believed to be in Britain.  </P> <P> Hurd said the other outstanding issues between the two countries, including the  four British hostages held in Lebanon by Islamic fundamentalists loyal to  Iran's Shiite revolution, are better discussed at the full diplomatic level.  </P> <P> Iran has recently been less hostile to the West and has said it is cooperating  with the U.N.'s economic boycott against Iraq, designed to force it to withdraw  its forces from Kuwait.  </P> <P> In February, 1989, Khomeini issued the death threat against Rushdie, saying his  novel, which offended Muslims worldwide, blasphemed Islam. Iranian officials  did not terminate the threat when Khomeini died in June, 1989.  </P> <P> They had demanded that Britain condemn the book as a condition to restoring  relations. That demand was apparently dropped.  </P></p>

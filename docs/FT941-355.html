			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Estates &amp; General cuts loss Estates &amp; General, property developer and investor, cut its pre-tax loss for the year to December 31 from Pounds 26.4m to Pounds 4.51m. The figure was struck after provisions of Pounds 2.21m against UK trading properties and a development in Majorca, and compares with provisions of Pounds 13.3m last time. Group turnover was Pounds 9.45m (Pounds 9.19m) and overheads were cut by 33 per cent to Pounds 1.68m. The company's banking facilities have been extended until the end of June 1995. 'This has been a year in which we have made encouraging progress towards restoring the financial stability of the company,' said Mr Peter Prowting, chairman. He is hoping to achieve 'a balance between rental income and funding costs' in 1995, helped by new lettings and interest rate changes. Losses per ordinary share were reduced to 21.1p against 126.7p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Feb 2, INA -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper of  Baghdad today said the reciprocal obligations of both Iraq and  the Security Council dictate the immediate shifting to the  implementation of article 22 of the council Resolution No. 687  providing for lifting the embargo and allowing Iraq to ensure  its medicine and food needs.    A paper article here today said that any fair observer would  feel astonished over any attempt to move around this reality  with the object of procrastination in lifting the embargo or  employing the sufferings of Iraqi people in cheap compromise and  blackmail leading to materializing rejected political purposes  that go contrary to the Iraqis' right in acquiring independent  well. [sentence as received]    The Iraqi paper referring to statements by some on the  necessity of building confidence and the suspicious calls to  delay the lifting of the sanctions until the conditions of this  confidence were established, said that such statements and calls  fall within manoeuvres of the United States aimed at involving  others into such designs and preventing them from viewing right  and maintain them within the aggressive American objectives that  contradict legitimacy and the principles of right and justice.    AL-THAWRAH said that confidence building between Iraq, the  Security Council and the U.N. Special Committee for the sake of  ending the injustice sustained by the Iraqi people could be  reached through an understanding and an objective and fair  outlook away from all evil purposes and motives.    The paper pointed out that that needs from all concerned  parties recognizing that Iraq had done all what it could to  realize its obligations and pledges.    The Iraqi paper further said that confidence building could  not be established through manoeuvering or attempts to jump over  realities or neglecting the sufferings of the Iraqi children,  women and elderly. This could not also be achieved in lagging  behind this international party or that who had accepted to  become false witness in one of unprecedented humanitarian and  ethical scandals in modern history.    AL-THAWRAH concluded by saying that the United States and  its  satellites do not want to see realities or to have the embargo  imposed on Iraq ending and therefore, the Security Council is  required to take the initiative of implementing its obligations  and putting an end to this flagrant breaching of all legal, just  and humanitarian principles.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT 116, SHE HAS HER CAKE AND HONORS, TOO  </P> <P> The oldest living person celebrated her 116th birthday on Sunday with hundreds  of well-wishers, smiling and eating several slices of cake.  </P> <P> Carrie White didn't seem to notice the greetings sent by Gov.-elect Lawton  Chiles, or the recorded phone call from former President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Once the six-tiered cake was cut, she perked up.  </P> <P> "She's wide awake now," Paul Allen, owner and administrator of Putnam Memorial  Nursing Home, said as hundreds of well-wishers gathered around to watch her  enjoy the cake.  </P> <P> Reagan called about an hour before the festivities began on the lawn of the  nursing home. His remarks were recorded and played back later for the guest of  honor.  </P> <P> "I just want you to know there will be a prayer for you in my heart while I'm  in church," Reagan said.  </P> <P> White was born in Gadsden County, Fla., on Nov. 18, 1874. Ulysses S. Grant was  President.  </P> <P> The Guinness Book of Records identifies her as the oldest living person whose  date of birth can be reliably authenticated.  </P></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Greater changes to NHS urged Too much rust remains in the mechanism of the government's National Health Service reforms and further changes are needed, the free-market Adam Smith Institute argues today. The reforms have led to gains but the institute's report says that old relationships between purchasers and providers had been carried into the new system and many of the same personalities were running the service. The institute calls for district health authorities to be turned into fully independent provident trusts, competing with fundholding general practitioners for the right to purchase health care. This would provide patients with freedom of choice and there was no reason why many aspects of purchasing, including the assessment of local needs, could not eventually be contracted out to non-public agencies. GP fundholders, suggests the report, are likely to lead a movement of structural change away from hospitals, with far more services provided in community clinics. But much of the capital to finance such a shift would have to come from the private sector. The institute says: 'With a decade of experience behind us, it is time to acknowledge the savings in time and money derived from employing private sector management skills on infrastructure projects far outweigh any derived from the idea that the government can always borrow more cheaply. Fundholders have to be allowed full access to private sector capital.' Unhealthy Competition, Adam Smith Institute, Pounds 30</p>

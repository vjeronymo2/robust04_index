			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Concentric maintains growth with 9% increase Concentric, the West Midlands-based engineering group with 60 per cent of its sales in automotive markets, continued its earnings growth with a 9 per cent rise in profits and predicted further gains in 1994-95. The group yesterday announced that pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 were Pounds 10.24m, compared with Pounds 9.36m previously. This puts earnings comfortably above the level of 1990, the peak year before recession. On earnings per share at 12.73p (12.03p), Concentric is lifting the dividend by 5 per cent from 5.86p to 6.15p, with a recommended final payment of 4.29p. 'We are able to be competitive in most countries and our products and technology are considered to be attractive. It is from that secure base that we expect to make further progress this year,' said Mr Tony Firth, the chairman. Helped by expanding sales in North America and East Asia, with a stronger domestic market - 'Europe has been an economic non-event for years,' according to Mr Firth - Concentric's turnover rose to Pounds 127.9m (Pounds 116.4m). Exports accounted for 32 per cent of sales. But like other engineering groups, Concentric is experiencing sustained pressure on its margins. It is, as Mr Firth put it, 'the pig in the middle' of rising raw material prices and the demands of customers to hold selling prices. 'We did quite well to hold our margins,' he said. The pressure on margins led both to further restructuring which cost Pounds 0.4m and to continued capital invest-ment. Concentric last year spent Pounds 7m on investment, compared with Pounds 8m in 1992-93, and expects spending to be maintained around this level in 1994-95. 'If you don't spend a lot of money, you're out of the race,' commented Mr Firth. The group ended the year with net cash balances of Pounds 8.3m, which is Pounds 0.4m less than a year before. The shares were unchanged at 178p.</p>

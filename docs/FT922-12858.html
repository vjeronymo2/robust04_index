			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (3): Superchef from a pig farm - Profile: Alain Ducasse WHEN the first guests checked into the Hotel de Paris in the 1860s they paid FFr5 for a set meal starting at 5.30pm on the dot every day. Today, the hotel's eating arrangements are rather more elaborate. For the past two years the Hotel de Paris has boasted the only three-star restaurant in Monte Carlo and one of the very few along the whole Cote D'Azur, thanks to Mr Alain Ducasse, 34, the superstar chef at the Louis XV. Before Mr Ducasse, Monaco's culinary credentials were lacklustre at best. Monte Carlo has a proud epicurean history. It is, after all, a place where Escoffier cooked. The Hotel de Paris itself swiftly shed its early air of austerity. By the 1880s it had made its name as a place for resplendent meals for which, as one writer noted, its kitchens consumed 700 kilos of beef, 200 chickens, 150 pieces of game, 14 sheep, 150 dozen oysters and 1,400 bottles of liquor daily. But by the late 1980s, Monaco's reputation had waned. The local Monegasque dishes - hearty blends of northern Italian and Provencal cooking - do not tend to lend themselves to haute cuisine. Most of the principality's restaurants dished up undistinguished French and Italian fare. When the Hotel de Paris decided to open a new restaurant, it realised that it needed to be a special place. It head-hunted a new chef who would be capable of making his - or her  - mark in the restaurant world, and found him in Mr Alain Ducasse, then working at La Terrasse along the Riviera coast at Juan les Pins. Mr Ducasse, the son of a pig farmer in the Les Landes region of south-west France, started cooking at the age of 16, going on to work under such famous French chefs as Mr Michel Guerard and Mr Roger Verge. He cites Verge, Guerard and Robuchon as his main influences. His style of cooking is in the modern tradition of classically prepared, traditional dishes with a Provencal twist, rather than the contortions of nouvelle cuisine. The Hotel de Paris, or rather its owner, the Societe des Bains de Mer, has ploughed nearly Pounds 2m into creating the Louis XV restaurant for him. The restaurant, on the ground floor of the hotel with windows looking onto Monte Carlo's Place du Casino, is in the grand 19th-century French style accompanied by a 1,100 sq m state-of-the-art kitchen and the 2,500 wines in the hotel's cellars. Two years ago, the Michelin guide bestowed its coveted three stars on the Louis XV, turning it into one of the elite band of 19 three-star restaurants in France. Gault Millau, the creme de la creme guide which is the bible of France's bon viveurs, rated it 19 out of 20 despite describing the decor as exactly how a Hollywood movie studio would have depicted a 'big French restaurant' in the 1950s. Mr Ducasse, the youngest chef ever to get three Michelin stars, is lauded with all the laurels of a latter-day culinary star in France. He not only presides over a team of 90 at the Louis XV but is a business partner in the restaurant. His picture is plastered all over the glossy promotional literature. And his name is emblazoned on everything from menus, to the petit fours papers and even the cream canopies flapping in the breeze on the Place du Casino facade of the Hotel de Paris.</p>

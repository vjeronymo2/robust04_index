			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / DTI at odds with mergers body on Gas OFFICIALS at the Department of Trade and Industry appear to be in conflict with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over the best way to deal with British Gas, company chiefs suggested yesterday. Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's finance director, said that the MMC's recommendations in its recent report ran counter to submissions made to the Commission by the DTI's oil and gas division. 'It goes against what they said. That's how I read it,' he said, while announcing the company's half-year results. Last month, the MMC recommended that British Gas be broken up by 1997, and that its monopoly of the tariff market for small consumers be removed over the following five years. However, publication of the full MMC report earlier this week revealed that the DTI placed top priority on removing the tariff market monopoly rather than the case for breaking up British Gas. In their submission to the MMC, DTI officials said that as a free market developed and competitors made greater inroads, the question of whether British Gas should be broken up 'seemed likely to assume a smaller importance than during the transition to it'. The key point was to regulate the market in a way which enabled competitors to enter on equal terms, they said. A break-up would also create difficulties, the officials told the MMC. It would require 'a radical overhaul of the legislation', and would be a 'complex exercise with its own transitional uncertainties.' They said it would end British Gas's ability to underpin the domestic gas market during the transition phase, and would increase the market's dependence on new mechanisms which could not be tested in advance. Officials also appeared to support British Gas's contention that a break-up would prevent it competing effectively abroad, where some of its best growth prospects lie. They told the MMC that 'the successful pursuit of overseas gas business in existing market conditions required significant players with live experience in all main areas of the business. There might be a balance to be weighed up between requirements for the home market and requirements for success abroad'. Officials concluded with a warning that some British Gas shareholders might see a break-up of the company as a departure from the spirit of the 1986 privatisation prospectus. The fact that the MMC ignored these cautions and put break-up at the top of the list will pose a dilemma for trade ministers. One option is to reverse the MMC's recommendations and deregulate the market first, leaving break-up till later, if at all. One point of agreement between the MMC and the DTI is that the simultaneous de-regulation and break-up is impractical. British Gas is hoping that ministers will make a decision before Christmas. Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive, said yesterday that he wanted to avoid a prolonged period of uncertainty. Mr Brown said that British Gas has not yet had any contact with the DTI about the report. In the absence of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, who is recovering from a heart attack, the matter is being handled by Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister. The DTI is seeking comments by the end of October.</p>

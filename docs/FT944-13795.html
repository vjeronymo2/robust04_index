			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Observer: Loosened tongues The dangers of drinking on duty, continued. The CNPF, the French employers' body, has just published a list of tips to its members on communicating financial information to the market. A very worthy tome, indeed - nestling within the comments on relations with analysts and the press is 'A risk often ignored: cocktails'. Les cocktails, it seems, offer pitfalls for the unwary, and not just for purists guarding the language. Apparently there is a risk of divulging sensitive information when having a drink after a press conference. Sacre bleu] The French have uncovered another journalistic trick of the trade.</p>

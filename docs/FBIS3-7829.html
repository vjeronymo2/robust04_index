			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Official talks between Albanian  President Sali Berisha and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  were held at the Presidency today. Both presidents assessed the  importance of this meeting both at the bilateral and the  international level. They expressed the opinion that all  possibilities exist between our two countries to strengthen the  economic cooperation with reciprocal profit, which can include  various fields. The signing of cooperation agreements in  tourism, the petroleum industry, and the cooperation between our  universities and that of Zagreb mark the first steps in this  direction. However, this cooperation can be extended in other  fields, such as in agriculture, energy, education, culture, and  more. In this context, it is indispensable to create a judicial  cadre between both our governments.    While treating the situation in the region, both  counterparts  hailed the NATO decision on Bosnia as a deserved response to the  Serb aggressor, something that contributes to reaching a  solution for the conflict there.    I assess your efforts, President Berisha said to President  Tudjman, and I think that the creation of a Croat-Bosnian  federation or confederation, about which talks are being held in  Washington, would bring peace closer and assist in the long-term  stability of the region. In this framework, I consider a  solution to the problem of Kosova as indispensable. We estimate  that, without the solution of this problem, there can be no  solution to the crisis in the Balkans. That is why we request  that the embargo on Serbia should be related to the solution of  the problem of Kosova. We stress that this solution does not  mean a change of borders through force, but a guarantee of the  freedoms and rights of Albanians in conformity with the Helsinki  Act.    President Tudjman said that Croatia is directly interested  in  stopping the conflict and is making all efforts in this  direction. Croatia hopes for positive results from the  agreements signed between the Croats and Muslims in Washington.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sugar transfers stake to Amshold MR ALAN Sugar, chairman and founder of Amstrad, has transferred his entire 35.4 per cent stake in the consumer electronics group to Amshold, a newly-created Jersey-based holding company which he wholly owns. Mr Sugar, who is Amstrad's largest shareholder with 205.6m shares, confirmed last week that he was considering taking Amstrad private again as the group reported an unexpectedly large Pounds 70.95m full-year pre-tax loss and passed its final dividend. Amstrad has been struggling as a result of savage price cutting in the personal computer market and shrinking margins in its satellite business. Mr Sugar is considering the possibility of buying the remaining issued ordinary shares which he does not own at 30p a share, subject to the availability of financing.</p>

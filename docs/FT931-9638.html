			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: Daf - effectiveness of broad view and consensus from bankruptcy Sir, Throwing good money after bad by supporting lame ducks looks like a bad policy. Or as your leader, 'Dutch courage' (February 8), states, supporting 'commercial misjudgments on the scale of those at Philips plainly takes a broad view of economic utility'. Somewhat surprisingly the Dutch industry has fared better than that of the UK, starting from a much weaker base. Could that be because other factors compensate for the lame duck support policy? Or perhaps the UK government saves money by not supporting lame ducks but unfortunately does not spend the savings on strong ducks. Of course, it is hard to predict what will be a permanent lame duck. Almost every enterprise at some point appeared a lame duck. When employment is in decline, a broad view of economic utility may be highly effective. Laurens van den Muyzenberg, management consultant, 11 Charles Street, London W1X 7HB</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (3): Some things are sacred - A storm is brewing over imports of rice Mr Koji Takada, a 44 year old rice farmer in Kitakami, northern Japan, describes the future of Japan's farming as 'grim'. Although more than four generations of his family have been farmers he doubts whether his children will keep up the tradition. He is one of the many Japanese rice farmers who have lost faith in the government's policy, due to last year's decision to open the rice market to imports, and to the confusion following the shortage of domestic rice earlier in the year. Japan will open its rice market to foreign imports next year under the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. For the first six years, imports will have limited access. In the seventh year the market is expected to be fully open. Meanwhile, the rice shortage caused by the exceptionally cold weather last summer triggered a rice shortage row, and the government was forced to import emergency supplies from the US, China, Australia and Thailand. The row over the opening of the market heightened the sense of sanctity of homegrown rice, the cultivation and the harvesting of which remain at the roots of Japanese traditions and rituals. In ancient Japan, rice was not only food to fill the stomach but a symbol of deities, or a means of connecting humans to the gods. The emperor, still considered by many as a living god, today plants rice seedlings in his private rice paddy behind the imperial walls. Later, rice was used as taxes and traded like a currency, and would become a sign of wealth. In medieval Japan, rice and rice cultivation was turned into a cultural symbol by which Japanese would differentiate themselves from the Chinese, Koreans, and westerners, an ideology broadened and popularised by the military government during World War II. Behind the symbolism, however, the opening of the rice market has highlighted the rigidly controlled farming system, which has become inefficient and outdated. Mr Takada's woes are shared with other farmers, who are concerned with the country's agricultural future. The protection of the farmers, whose are votes are highly valued by politicians, has come in the form of farm subsidies. In order to keep afloat the farming sector, which has an annual output of about Y10,000bn, the government pumps in about Y6,000bn. The figure rises to around Y9,000bn if subsidies from local government are included. Others who have benefited from the system have been the 12,000 bureaucrats in the Food Agency, which have nothing to do all year except during the harvest, when they inspect rice. Around 350,000 people are employed by the numerous farm cooperatives, which work as an intermediary between the farmers and the government, selling agro chemicals and farming machinery to the farmers and collecting and distributing the government's payments for rice. But aside from Japanese consumers, who have had to pay around seven times the international price for rice, the farming community has paid the penalty for such distortions. Dependent onsubsidies and the state run distribution system, they have lost control over their livelihood. Farmers cannot buy or sell their land freely due to regulations on farmland transactions, while the state controls every aspect of rice farming from the planting to the retail sales. 'The position of rice growers is little more than that of serfs working on state-owned farms,' says Mr Taro Yayama, a political analyst advocating the farm reforms. And in spite of the government's subsidies, rice production is not profitable. Mr Takada says while his income does not differ from office workers of the same age, after paying for farming machinery, fertilisers and pesticides, sold at higher than market prices by the farming cooperatives, 'there isn't much left to spend'. The result has been a sharp fall in the country's farming population, which has declined from 3.7m in 1985 to 3.1m in 1990. The figure is likely to fall further to around 2.1m by 2000. At the same time the farming population is ageing rapidly and, according to the ministry of agriculture, the number of farmers under 60 in 1990 will be halved in 2000. Not that the government is unaware of the problems. In 1992, the agriculture ministry released a report on food policy, agriculture and rural life. It called for consolidation of smaller farms for a more efficient system. Reform advocates are calling for a more radical reform, including bringing in the market mechanism by deregulating state control, and freely allowing those who want to enter the sector. However, the government has been slow to respond to the need for agricultural deregulation and reform. The new Murayama administration merely followed its predecessors by agreeing earlier this month to the ritual annual increase of subsidies to the farmers. Although Japan still has six years before the official opening of the rice market, with no apparent gainers except consumers from full fledged farm reform, politicians, farmers and agriculture bureaucrats may continue to drag their feet. In the end, like so many other issues, Japan may once again need the help of outside pressure to rationalise the dwindling farming sector.</p>

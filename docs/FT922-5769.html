			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1):  Caught in the eye of a storm - Leading currencies have been buffeted by world upheavals over the past 18 months. A symptom of a recent uneasy calm has been a marked decline in the volatility of the so-called G3 exchange rates - the dollar, D-Mark and yen / Assessment of the future of currency markets in the light of economic and political events THE WORLD'S foreign exchange markets are caught in the eye of a storm. Leading currencies are suspended between geo-political pressures for change on the one hand and, on the other hand, institutional developments in the global banking industry and moves to greater integration in western Europe which argue for calm. A symptom of this unstable equilibrium has been a marked decline this year in the volatility of the so-called G3 exchange rates - the dollar, D-Mark and yen. The dollar's fluctuation range against the D-Mark in the first 4 1/2 months of this year was just 18 pfennigs as it moved between a low of DM1.50 and a high of DM1.68. This, according to Swiss Bank Corp, is less than half last year's trading range of 39 pfennigs and well below the 105 pfennig trading range recorded in 1985, when market conditions were especially turbulent. The movement of the dollar against the yen has been even more subdued - a mere 12 yen between a low of Y123 and a high of Y135, against fluctuation ranges of Y19 last year, Y35 in 1990, Y51.5 in 1986 and Y63 in 1985. The decline in exchange rate volatility has reflected a number of forces in the world economy and banking industry since the mid-1980s. Governments want more stable exchange rates. Although the Group of Seven countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - no longer attempt to peg their exchange rates to each other as after the 1987 Louvre Accord, they act when necessary to combat excessive exchange rate movements. More important perhaps have been regional developments. In particular, the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System has increasingly taken on the characteristics of a fixed exchange rate block. It has attracted new members (Spain, Britain and Portugal over the past three years) and acts as a centre of gravity for non-EC countries such as Sweden, Norway and Finland which peg their currencies to the European currency unit (Ecu) and are seeking closer links to the EMS. ERM rigidity has grown with the adoption last December at the EC's Maastricht summit of plans to move to Emu, or economic and monetary union, by the end of the decade. All industrialised nations put a high priority on combatting inflation. While there has been increased recognition that national economic policy measures must vary to take account of differing conditions, convergence towards low inflation has helped iron out one classic cause of exchange rate movement. Central banks have become more adept at managing intervention. They no longer defend specific currency rates, preferring instead to carry out smoothing operations in the exchange markets. These more refined tactics have deprived speculators of the 'one-way bet' that so often appeared when fixed or semi-fixed rates were defended, only to be abandoned under the pressure of speculative forces. These trends have been reinforced by developments in banking and among other market participants. In general, the currency markets have become more risk averse. Caution has grown with the approach of the end-1992 deadline for international banks to comply with stringent capital adequacy ratios, agreed in 1988. Loan losses incurred during the past three years of slow growth and recession have curbed banks' enthusiasm for speculative foreign exchange trading. But it would be wrong to assume that calm will endure in the foreign exchange markets. Following the collapse of communism and the end of the Cold War, the currency markets, like policy makers, are operating in a world where old certainties no longer hold good. The strength of the US economic recovery is unclear, as is the capacity of Germany to absorb the new eastern Lander without allowing inflation to run out of control. There are doubts whether the authorities in Tokyo will be able to stave off recession while managing the current problem of asset price deflation in Japan. Overshadowing these worries, is the unfathomable outlook for the republics of the former Soviet Union as they embark along the road to the market economy. Large-scale changes in exchange rate relationships may emerge once there are answers to these uncertainties. When determining exchange rates, the market has already begun to look much more closely at underlying economic and political factors than simply at nominal interest rate differentials or the trend lines drawn by chartists. Such considerations lie behind the late spring reappraisal of sterling and the French franc, which has allowed the authorities in London and Paris to bring their official interest rates almost down to German levels. The dollar's reaction to last December's interest rate changes in Germany and the US, when Germany pushed its rates to their highest peace-time levels since the 1930s and the US responded by cutting its discount rate to the lowest level for nearly a generation, provided an early example of this trend. After an initial downwards move, the dollar responded to the yawning 6 percentage-point interest differential in favour of the D-Mark by moving higher. Investors in this case looked beyond the immediate horizon and reasoned that the news was good for the US economy. They also assumed (wrongly as it happened) that the next move in dollar interest rates would be upwards. While fast-moving economic and political changes make smooth running currency markets more important than ever, the general decline in exchange rate volatility has been bad for profits. These factors have reinforced a tendency for trading in the leading currencies to become concentrated among a small number of big, well-capitalised players such as Citibank and Chemical Bank of the US, Union Bank of Switzerland and Barclays Bank of Britain. Trading in leading currencies takes place in a mature market, where information is very rapidly disseminated to all participants and competitive edge is hard to achieve. A strong customer base has become all important, not just for the business that it brings but for the insight it provides on exchange rates movements. As capital flows have supplanted trade flows as the engine of market activity, traders have had to develop more sophisticated services such as options and derivatives to win business from institutional clients. In this very competitive environment it seems that London has continued to build up its position as the world's leading foreign exchange centre, at the expense of Tokyo, where Japanese banks have been hard hit by the asset price fall, and New York, where a lack of liquidity, particularly on Fridays, has forced some foreign exchange banks there to function as niche players. But such concentration of muscle does not mean an absence of business opportunities elsewhere. Markets for so-called exotic currencies, from eastern Asia or Latin America, are becoming more prominent. They offer opportunities for smaller trading companies to operate on their own account and provide some of the excitement that used to characterise the foreign exchange market as a whole in the 1970s and 1980s. In a business that sometimes wonders whether it is in decline, trading in second line currencies will continue to grow. The historic currencies of western Europe may be destined to disappear if plans for Emu are fulfilled. But other currencies will gain importance as the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union embrace the market economy and move towards currency convertibility.</p>

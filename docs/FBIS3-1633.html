			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shanghai, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai  Petrochemicals Co., Ltd., built on waste land with state  investment, is creating wonders with its modern enterprise  system.    Founded in the early 1970s, the company has developed into  the ninth key industrial enterprise of its type in the country,  with an annual sales volume exceeding six billion yuan-worth.    Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji has called on enterprises  across the country to learn from the Shanghai Petrochemicals  Co., Ltd., which has put on a fresh look by introducing the  joint stock system.    And the State Planning Commission has just held a national  seminar at the company on deepening the reform of large key  state enterprises.    In September 1992 the company was designated by the central  government to try out the joint stock system and sell its stocks  overseas.    "It was a huge project for a large state enterprise with  600,000 employees and several billion yuan-worth of fixed assets  to transform into a joint stock company," said Wang Jiming,  chairman of the board of directors and general manager of the  company.    "We know that before the coming into effect the corporate  law  in July this year a registered Chinese enterprise, which plans  to sell stocks internationally, must do good preparation work  strictly in line with the international and standardized  requirements," he said.    It took the company more than half a year to make an  inventory of its stockpiles and capital.    In July 1993 it issued 1.68 billion h-shares abroad, marking  the first time that a registered Chinese enterprise had issued  stocks overseas.    A survey shows that the company collected a sum of 320  million U.S. dollars and 1.62 billion yuan (one dollar equals  about 8.7 yuan) by issuing stocks, thus reinforcing its capacity  for self-development.    Since then, it has received streams of foreign investors and  telegrams of inquiry.    "Everyone has noticed that the image of the company, China's  first one to list stocks in New York and Hong Kong, reflects not  only the company itself but all Chinese enterprises," Wang said.    The company's staff and workers have purchased an average of  1,950 stocks per capita.    "We are now masters of our company, and we work harder and  pay more attention to the company's production and management,"  said Wang Ziqiu, a worker in the company's acrylic fiber mill.    In addition, the Shanghai Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. has  shifted its operational mechanism by adjusting its product  structure to produce items with additional value.    It has cut its administrative organizations from 55 to 19  and  reduced its staff members from 1,270 to 417.    According to Wang, the joint stock system has promoted not  only the development of the Shanghai Petrochemicals Company but  also the income of its employees.    Last year saw the company generate record profits totaling  1.8 billion yuan, and its employees' incomes increase by at  least 30 percent.    Ye Guozhen, a worker at the company's heat and power plant,  said happily that his wage rose from 434 yuan per month in  February last year, just before the company began its reform, to  780 yuan last month.    According to Carol Ruth, chairman of the board of directors  of Dewe Rogerson Company, an agent of the Shanghai  Petrochemicals Co., Ltd. in the United States, people engaged in  international securities transactions agreed that the rise of  120 percent in the price of stocks issued by the company ltd.  "fully reflects the rosy view of China of the international  capital market, and the quality of the key Chinese enterprises."    Following suit, 65 out of 600 key state enterprises have  been  listed on stock markets.</p>

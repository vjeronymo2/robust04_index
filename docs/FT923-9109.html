			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Short dates softer SHORT-DATED rates in the sterling cash market were slightly softer yesterday as dealers spotted signs that the Bundesbank may not raise its emergency Lombard rate again this year. The Bundesbank's decision at its council meeting yesterday not to lift the Lombard rate had been widely expected. But there was speculation, too, that the German central bank could bring forward the date of a rate cut following July's figure for German manufacturing orders. This was down 1.8 per cent from the previous month, heightening signs of a slowdown in the German economy and the need to stimulate growth. The most significant reason for the softening of sterling rates yesterday was the German central bank's decision to provide an estimated DM4bn to DM6bn of short-term funds to the market at a rate of 9.70 per cent. The Bundesbank's decision to drain DM8bn from the banking system on Wednesday had caused deep anxiety, as it pushed call money up to the Lombard rate level. However, there were suggestions that the Bundesbank had withdrawn the cash in anticipation of a flow of liquidity to the market later this month from the banking sector. Yesterday's new injection was probably provided as bridging funding. One-month sterling cash was down  1/16 percentage point to 10 1/8 per cent on the offered side, and three-month cash was similarly lower at 10 5/16 per cent. September short sterling rose 4 basis points from its opening figure to close at 89.61. Cash rates remained bearish further out, however, as the fundamental view on a possible rate cut is still gloomy. One-year money was firmer on the offered side at 10 1/2 per cent from a previous close of 10 7/16 per cent. The Bank of England dealt in Band 1 at 9 7/8 per cent and in repurchase agreements (repos) at 9 15/16 per cent. After fore-casting a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn, the Bank purchased Pounds 50m in the repo. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.2bn. In further operations, the Bank bought Pounds 440m in Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 600m in the repo. The forecast was subsequently revised again, to around Pounds 1.25bn. The Bank purchased Pounds 1m in Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 180m of Band 1 bank bills.</p>

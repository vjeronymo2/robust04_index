			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Air France, Lufthansa shy from hotel merger AIR FRANCE and Lufthansa of Germany have pulled back from plans to merge their hotel operations. The airlines emphasised the merger when they announced plans for closer co-operation in the hotels business at the end of April. Lufthansa said yesterday some form of merger between Lufthansa's Kempinski hotels and Air France's Meridien hotel chain was still an objective. However, co-operation at this stage would be limited to a marketing agreement whereby the parent airlines market each others' hotel subsidiaries. Lufthansa said if this worked out it planned to take the second step of combining the shares into a mutual holding company. However, it said there was no timetable for such a merger. If it happened, the two hotel companies would maintain separate legal status. It was implied in the Lufthansa statement that the German hotel group had worried about preserving its standards in the event of a merger. 'Irrespective of the future structure of the ownership of the joint holding,' it said, 'no major decisions will be made without the consent of Lufthansa, thus guaranteeing the interests of Kempinski. 'Therefore the name of Kempinski, as well as its standards and quality, will be maintained,' it said. Both airlines yesterday denied the two-stage agreement differed from the draft contract agreed on April.</p>

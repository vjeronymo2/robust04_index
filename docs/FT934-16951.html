			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / IRA welcomes Ulster talks THE IRA last night gave its first reaction to the Hume-Adams talks on Northern Ireland, saying they could provide the basis for peace. In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA leadership said it 'welcomed this initiative'. The IRA statement said: 'We are informed of the broad principles which will be for consideration by the London and Dublin governments. 'It is unfortunate that the British government reaction to this initiative so far has been negative, fuelling unionist reaction. Nonetheless if the political will exists or can be created, it could provide the basis for peace.' The statement added that the IRA, its members and supporters had a 'vested interest' in seeking a just and lasting peace in Ireland. But it stressed that they had not budged from their desire for an all-Ireland solution to the Ulster violence. The controversial talks between Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour party leader Mr John Hume and Sinn Fein leader Mr Gerry Adams gained momentum at the weekend after Mr Adams said he is prepared to present peace proposals to the IRA. He told the Irish Times: 'I am quite prepared to go to the IRA with a package if one can be produced. 'I would of course seek a package, which would allow me to make definitive proposals to the IRA in relation to the future conduct of its campaign. Whether I can do that or whether indeed the outcome would be acceptable to the IRA is a matter for all of us to apply ourselves to.' Last week Mr Hume and Mr Adams said they believed a broader negotiating process could begin which could lead 'to a stable and lasting peace'. A report by the two party leaders, containing a number of proposals, is to be discussed with the Irish government later this week when Mr Hume visits Dublin. The Irish government is expected to discuss this later with the British government.</p>

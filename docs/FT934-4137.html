			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Kohl braced for heavy blow from ex-communists The former communist party in east Germany, the Democratic Socialist PDS, was last night poised to deal a heavy blow to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat CDU party in elections in Brandenburg. These were the first local-government polls in the east since unification. CDU federal general secretary Mr Peter Hintze said the PDS surge was 'frightening', and that the result for the CDU was 'absolutely unsatisfactory'. Brandenburg traditionally has had a strong socialist and communist base. However, the CDU and the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the federal government, did not fare as badly as early opinion polls had predicted for the state, which surrounds Berlin. The vote is the first of many municipal and state elections which culminate in federal elections next October. Although local politics played a great part in yesterday's elections, the vote will provide a barometer for Mr Kohl's future support. His CDU-led coalition has been trailing in the opinion polls after several scandals and amid speculation that it might soon fall apart. In Bonn, senior officials shrugged off any suggestion that the coalition was strained to breaking point. But yesterday's elections, in which the governing Social Democrats (SPD) of Brandenburg failed to increase their share of the vote despite the popularity of their leader Mr Manfred Stolpe, suggests that the CDU and the SPD, Germany's two main parties, may be edging towards a coalition after the 1994 elections. After polls closed, computer projections carried out for Brandenburg radio gave the CDU 21.9 per cent, nearly 8 points down from the previous state elections in October 1990. FDP support was put at 5.4 per cent, just below the federal election results, 3 points less than the state elections, and trailing Greens/Alliance 90, which polled 6.3 per cent. Support for the PDS rose to 20.2 per cent, nearly 7 points more than in the state elections and 9 points more than the federal elections. Brandenburg's governing Social Democrats held on to its broad base of support with an estimated 34.3 per cent of the vote, 3 points less than in the state elections and about 2 points more than in the federal elections.</p>

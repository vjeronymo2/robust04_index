			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Finance package for Westminster Scaffolding Westminster Scaffolding has completed negotiations to withdraw totally from its property development interests. It also unveiled proposals for a debt restructuring and an underwritten offer to raise Pounds 2.6m net to finance future growth. The directors said the proposals would put the group on a 'sound financial footing' and enable it to concentrate on its principal business of scaffolding. The Midland Bank is to subscribe in cash at par for 12.5m new ordinary shares, representing 24.83 per cent of the enlarged share capital. The proceeds will be used to reduce the company's debt to the Midland which at September 17 stood at some Pounds 3.54m. Following implementation of the proposals debt to the Midland will remain at Pounds 1.14m. The bank has agreed to provide a continuing overdraft facility up to a maximum Pounds 1.15m for an initial 12 months. The cash call is of 2.6m units at 120p per unit cash. Each unit comprises one A share of 1p to be issued at par; 43p nominal of variable rate stock to be allotted at 42p; 77p nominal of 10 per cent convertible secured loan stock 1995 to be allotted at 77p; and warrants to subscribe for 3.75m ordinary shares for which no specific consideration is payable. Qualifying shareholders can subscribe for one unit for every 10 ordinary share held. The group also reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.41m (Pounds 82,000) for the year to October 31 1991 after exceptional provisions of Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 482,000) and losses of Pounds 524,000 (Pounds 394,000) for the six months ended April 30 1992. The USM-quoted group is also proposing the appointment of Mr Michael Pelham as chairman following the annual meeting later this month. The present chairman, Mr Tom Greenham, intends to step down but remain chief executive.</p>

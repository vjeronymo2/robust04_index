			<p>BFN     [Text] After repeated queries on our part, a few minutes  ago Raycho Raykov, head of the government Press Center, issued  the following announcement:    Having recuperated from his cardiac bypass operation on 12  March, Professor Berov began taking an active part in the work  of the Council of Ministers on 7, 8, and 10 April.    According to information received at 0900 on 13 April from  Dr. Todor Gerasimov, head of Lozenets Hospital, the condition of  the prime minister's cardiovascular system and blood circulation  continues to be stable.    However, on 11 April a change in Prof. Berov's health  condition was noted. The clinical conclusion was that there was  the possibility of hepatitis. Specialized laboratory tests are  under way and the results will be published in a day or two.    According to Dr. Gerasimov, because of the development of a  clinical picture of the hepatitis virus, Prof. Berov is in  quarantine. He will have no personal contacts in the next few  days.</p>

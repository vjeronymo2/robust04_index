			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / EC 'green' laws face UK threat BRITAIN may press for the repeal of some European Community environmental legislation during its presidency of the EC, Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said yesterday. His remarks provoked strong criticism from opposition politicians and environmental groups, who said Britain had failed to meet EC environmental standards on drinking water and clean beaches. Mr Howard said some environmental matters were 'better dealt with at national level'. He added that the government would pursue vigorously the principle of subsidiarity - devolving regulation back from the EC to national governments where possible. 'The EC's environment council has become something of a sausage machine,' he said, referring to the ambitious programme of directives passed in the past 10 years, many of which were never successfully enforced. He added that the UK presidency would emphasise 'the need to put promises into practice'. Mrs Ann Taylor, a member of Labour's environment team, said: 'Michael Howard's re-marks are frightening. We think he is paving the way for a UK opt-out on EC environmental legislation.' She added: 'His remarks call into question this government's commitment to meet EC drinking water standards and clean-beach regulations.' Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, said: 'Mr Howard's remarks are undoubtedly a lowering of environmental protection standards.' Mr Howard would not say which legislation might be considered for repeal. He said: 'Application of the principle of subsidiarity does not mean a weakening of our vigorous pursuit of environmental objectives.' Launching the government's plans for the UK presidency of the EC's environment council yesterday, he said its priorities included regulation on movements of waste, and national targets for carbon-dioxide emissions. The council was also contemplating bringing forward the directive on the phasing-out of ozone-depleting substances by one year, to the end of 1994. One of the UK government's aims was the 'greening of all aspects of Community policy', including agriculture, transport and energy. The environment council, made up of environment ministers from EC countries, will meet in September to consider how to put into practice commitments signed at the United Nations Earth Summit. BRITAIN would like to see a change in emphasis in the use of European Community social funds, moving away from helping dying industries and more towards helping the unemployed return to work, Lisa Wood writes. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, announced the aim yesterday at a press conference on the UK's objectives for its presidency of the EC's social affairs council, which she chairs. The UK will receive about Pounds 400m this year from the fund, more than half of which is spent on schemes for the unemployed. Attention would also be given to assisting labour mobility in the EC.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Persimmon It is a striking sign of the times that Persimmon's Pounds 270m market capitalisation is roughly equivalent to those of Costain and Barratt Development combined. The once mighty have fallen, of course. But investors have chased Persimmon shares to the point where they now yield a fifth less than the market average. Has the enthusiasm been overdone? Admittedly, there was little to disappoint followers in yesterday's news that pre-tax profits dipped 23 per cent in 1991. Falling house prices naturally hit margins, but the underlying position remains enviably strong. Persimmon has bought 5,000 housing plots over the last 12 months, which leaves it with a supply of land sufficient for four and a half years. More to the point, the land bank looks cheap by industry standards - land costs as a proportion of the average selling price last year are estimated at between 20 and 25 per cent. Balance sheet gearing of 8 per cent provides further flexibility to pursue the strategy of a volume player, though that figure is somewhat flattered by sizeable land creditors. One could easily be alarmed by acquisitive noises in yesterday's statement, given Persimmon's sensible and level-headed emphasis to date on organic growth. But perhaps such a reflex was inevitable after Raine's takeover of Walter Lawrence, and will quickly pass. The more worrying issue for the shares is just how fast earnings can resume their upward path, given the prospects of low asset price inflation in the 1990s. Persimmon's volume trend is capable of putting the company into, say, the Beazer league in the foreseeable future, but investors would be wise not to exaggerate the potential margin uplift.</p>

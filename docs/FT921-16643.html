			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Aids threat to African workforce At least 25 per cent of Africa's workforce is expected to be wiped out by Aids by the year 2010, according to the most conservative official estimates of the disease's infection rate, Reuter reports from Dakar. Economists warn that the Aids pandemic threatens Africa with economic chaos beyond anything it has yet endured as it kills 5m or more adults in the next eight years. African officials say the entire world has a stake in helping their countries stem a disease that is already laying waste to some economic sectors of the continent. One in every 40 adults in Africa is already infected with the HIV virus that causes Aids.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Russian congress bows to CIS reality THE Russian congress, the Communist-dominated parliament that last week refused to recognise the Soviet collapse, yesterday acknowledged establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States, AP reports from Moscow. On a vote of 548-158 the Congress of People's Deputies adopted a resolution affirming Russia's membership in the commonwealth, which was created last December. The vote was a victory for President Boris Yeltsin, who has encountered stiff opposition from lawmakers hostile to his market reforms, his sweeping powers and his efforts to co-operate with other former Soviet republics within the new commonwealth. In a largely symbolic protest vote on Friday, the congress refused to recognise the Soviet collapse or accept responsibility for fulfilling arms control and other treaties signed by the former Soviet government. It reversed itself yesterday, accepting the commonwealth as a 'new legal and political form of voluntary union among sovereign states'. The decision by the Russian parliament is unlikely, however, to defuse tensions with other former Soviet republics. President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine yesterday raised the stakes in a territorial dispute with Russia by warning that a proposed referendum on Crimean independence could lead to tragedy and bloodshed, Reuter reports from Kiev. 'A referendum is the tragic path towards a schism in the Crimea. And what that schism would bring, what misfortunes it would cause for the people of the peninsula and others besides, no one may dare to predict,' Mr Kravchuk said. The Black Sea peninsula of Crimea was handed from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 as a gift to mark 300 years of union. Since the breakup of the union last year some Russians have questioned the legality of the transfer, raising Ukrainian fears that Moscow could try to claim the territory back.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, Jan 27, BNS -- The Estonian parliament  today discussed the text of a statement concerning Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's speech, which 30 legislators  submitted on Jan. 19.    Kozyrev's remarks defined the Baltic states as belonging in  Russia's sphere of influence and justified a continued illegal  presence of Russian troops in Estonian territory.    Vello Saatpalu, chairman of the parliamentary Foreign  Commission, proposed to wind up the discussion and prepare a new  statement. Several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction with the  parliament's standing rules under which urgent issues cannot be  added to the agenda, and referred to the example of the  Lithuanian parliament, which reacted to Kozyrev's speech the  same day it was delivered. The Estonian parliament failed to  reach a decision today because the time ran out and the  legislators did not agree to prolong the session. [passage  omitted]</p>

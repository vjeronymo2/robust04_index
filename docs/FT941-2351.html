			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Novell challenges Microsoft with Dollars 1.4bn software deal Novell of the US, the world's leading supplier of computer networking software, is to acquire WordPerfect, another North American company and one of the main developers of word processing software, in an all-share deal valued at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 950m). The transaction will make the combined company the world's second-largest personal computer software company behind Microsoft, also of the US. Revenues of the combined group totalled about Dollars 1.9bn last year, against Microsoft's Dollars 3.75bn Novell and Microsoft, headed by Mr Bill Gates, one of America's richest men, are fierce rivals and Novell officials have played an active role in providing information to the US Justice Department which is investigating Microsoft for possible anti-competitive marketing activities. The deal changes the balance of power in the personal computer business. The key companies are Intel, which makes 90 per cent of the world's microprocessors; Microsoft, which dominates the operating software market; and Novell, which controls the networking market. Microsoft is promoting a new operating system, Windows NT, which it hopes will recapture the networked computers market. Utah-based Novell, which had revenues of Dollars 1.1bn last year, said it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire all WordPerfect's shares for 59m shares of Novell stock and options. It also announced an agreement with Borland International, another leading software maker, to buy its 'Quattro Pro' spreadsheet business for about Dollars 145m cash. Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell president and chief executive, said Novell aimed to accelerate the market transition to networked computers. WordPerfect's word-processing systems and Borland's spreadsheet are typical of the applications which large companies might wish to distribute throughout their organisations across networked personal computers. Mr Ad Rietveld, president and chief executive of WordPerfect, said: 'We are helping Novell create a software powerhouse.' Novell's move, coupled with Microsoft's activities in multimedia, shows how larger software houses, often limited to one successful product, are attempting to lay claim to developing areas.

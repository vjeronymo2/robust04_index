			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / People: Open door for Hopwood at Atreus Geoffrey Hopwood, 48, has been appointed chief executive and given the task of restoring the stock market credibility of Atreus, the shower screen and mirror company which was floated on the stock market in March 1993 but failed to live up to its early promise. Rodney Harnett, the chairman who brought the company to the market, and his finance director, Gerry Ceclich, both resigned earlier this year following a surprise profits warning. The shares, which were floated at 20p and rose to 28p at one stage, have been trading at 12 1/2 p recently. Charles Gillam, chief executive of Turnpyke Group, took over as chairman in the spring, and Andrew Muir, 54, a former finance director of Shanks &amp; McEwan, has been appointed as the new finance director. Hopwood, a Manchester Business School MBA, has spent much of his career in the building products sector. He was general manager of Marley Buildings' buildings division and managing director of Henderson Group's industrial doors division. Hopwood, who had been interested in arranging a management buy-in at one stage, said yesterday that the previous management had tried to go off in too many directions too quickly. The company had a good brand name and he hoped that it would benefit from a 'steadier hand'. Bruce Ledwith and David Howarth, the two founders of the company who retain substantial stakes in the business, continue as executive directors.</p>

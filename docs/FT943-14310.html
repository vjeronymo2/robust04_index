			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Income figures inflame poverty row Controversy over the extent of poverty in the UK was renewed yesterday by government figures showing that the real incomes of the bottom 10 per cent of the population have fallen by 17 per cent since 1979. This maintains a continuing pattern of decline in the income of the bottom group after housing costs. It fell 14 per cent between 1979 and 1990-91, and was 17 per cent lower by 1991-92. Before housing costs are taken into account the real income of the bottom 10 per cent is unchanged since 1979. The figures were published in the government's Households Below Average Incomes statistical analysis. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said that the results 'do not show that the poor have become poorer'. He said spending patterns in the bottom 10 per cent of income distribution suggested that the income figures did not reflect true living standards. The pressure group Church Action on Poverty said poverty had reached scandalous levels. It said: 'Poverty is not an incurable disease. Yet still we have no indication of regret or remorse from the government, nor any signs of a plan to reconnect those who are systematically cut adrift from mainstream society.' The Child Poverty Action Group said that Britain should be 'deeply ashamed' by the problems revealed in the report. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said: 'It is not a fringe that is excluded from increased prosperity, but a great mass of ordinary decent working people.' The government says that the figures reflect factors such as the increase in unemployment during the recession rather than a growth in absolute poverty. However, the report provides further evidence of growing disparity in incomes between the top and bottom groups. The 17 per cent decline in income of the bottom group since 1979 compares with a 36 per cent average increase for the population as a whole, and a 62 per cent rise after housing costs for the wealthiest 10 per cent. Anti-poverty campaigners say this shows the UK is developing into a US-style society with a widening gap between its richest and poorest. In 1979 the proportion of the population receiving less than half average income was 8 per cent before housing costs and 9 per cent after. These proportions rose to 21 per cent and 25 per cent by 1991-92.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TROUBLED WATER(S)  </P> <P> I have yet to determine why almost everyone I've ever met tacks the letter "S"  onto the end (ends?) of words when it is totally inappropriate; (witness: "I'm  Going to Lucky's Market"). However, this may be the final straw.  </P> <P> KCET TV, Channel 28, in an add in the Calendar on March 8 actually touted the  Simon &amp; Garfunkel concert in Central Park as featuring the song "Bridge  Over Troubled Waters."  </P> <P> Puh-lease! It's "Bridge Over Troubled Water." Singular . . . not plural. A  minor point? Yes. But we should all attempt to be as accurate as we can be.  Let's refer to it as Paul and Art presented it.  </P> <P> LARRY D. MARTIN, Anaheim  </P></p>

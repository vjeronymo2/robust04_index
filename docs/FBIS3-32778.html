			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel de la Guardia from the "Evening </F> Information Review" newscast]    [Text] The U.S. State Department is studying the  possibility of reducing restrictions on trips to Cuba by U.S.  citizens. No, it is not a question of easing, even slightly,  pressure exerted on Cuba or of improving relations between  Washington and Havana. It is only a measure that seeks to  minimize the violation of U.S. citizens rights by prohibiting  visits to other countries, in this case Cuba. As is well known,  measures adopted by the U.S. Government to exert pressure and  cause economic damage to the Cuban economy include the  enforcement of severe sanctions on U.S. citizens who travel to  Cuba in defiance of these restrictions. Obviously, the reported  attenuation of those restrictions does not include those who  want to travel to the Pearl of the Antilles as a tourist because  that would represent income in dollars to the Cuban tourism  industry.    Cuban specialists on international relations believe the  elimination of certain travel restrictions to Cuba and the  expedition of possible information exchanges are part of a  system designed to influence the Cuban civilian society and  increase its political influence on the island, as was done in  Eastern Europe. Others believe that, far from contributing to  the improvement of relations between the United States and Cuba,  its real purpose is to weaken Cuba's conclusive arguments before  international organizations, where it has stated the travel  restrictions imposed on U.S. citizens who wish to travel to  other countries for personal reasons are a violation of their  human rights.    Cuba cannot be accused of extreme mistrust because it has  only experienced all kinds of aggression from the United States  for more than 30 years. Besides, Washington officials have made  it clear they are not interested in making any policy changes  towards Cuba as long as Cuba does not adopt changes to resemble  the so-called representative democracies that follow the U.S.  model throughout the world. Cuba has repeatedly stated it will  not tolerate this blatant interference in its internal affairs,  and it cannot accept conditions to establish and maintain  diplomatic relations, or other types of relations, with another  sovereign state.    If the United States eliminates or reduces restrictions on  its citizens so they may travel to Cuba, even with the provision  that they do not to contribute in any way to the Cuban economy,  this would be another step towards reason and wisdom. Cuba has  many friends in the United States and has always been happy to  receive visitors from all nations, whether they sympathize with  Cuba or not, if they want first-hand knowledge of the real Cuban  situation. The Cuban Revolution has always been able to  differentiate between government and people, as far as the  United States is concerned, and Cubans have always felt respect  and sympathy for the U.S. people.</p>

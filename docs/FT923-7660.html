			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: The British disease becomes endemic in a way. The 'surprising' fall in inflation was hailed, as the headlines had it, by the Treasury. The government's policies are working, they said; and that is just the trouble. The danger, as Roger Bootle (Midland Montagu's chief economist) pointed out last week, is not that ministers do not mean what they say (which is what the markets seem to fear), but that they do. They will get their victory, only to achieve a Carthaginian peace. ('They made a wilderness and called it peace,' says my dim memory of the classics.) The fall in inflation is unsurprising because it is the natural result of a slump, as dealers understood last Friday when they marked sterling down. And that means there may be worse to come: not only a fall in inflation, which means a rise in real interest rates, but a greater risk of higher nominal rates, which will rack up real rates still higher. And then, if the French vote down Maastricht next month . . . Ministers are no doubt praying that the French vote will go the 'right' way; but, in fact, it is hard to know which is the frying pan and which the fire. Either we face a full-blown sterling crisis, or else we are stuck with Maastricht convergence conditions, and German monetary policy. Unappetising is a very mild word for it. The Maastricht conditions are bad enough. They are illogical, as the IMF used to be in the worst days of de la Rosiere debt phobia. Now the IMF is more enlightened. It calculates that the rules will reduce growth all over Europe by about 1 per cent annually - bearable in normal conditions, but dreadful in a recession, and probably an under-estimate anyway. They reflect not economic logic, but a mixture of German horror at the Italian national debt, and Dutch Puritanism (always the most extreme in my experience) - a grim combination. German monetary policy, though, is worse. Four years ago, an enlightened veteran of the Bundesbank council explained German monetary policy to an admiring group of central bankers. The great thing, he explained, was to have a clear, consistent policy over the years; and an official able to explain convincingly why, at any given moment, it was not being followed. This seems an ideal blend of apparent rigour and practical common sense. Things have changed, sadly, since then. The policy is no longer consistent, and the commonsense has gone out of the window. The Buba Council has swapped targets, as the Bank of England used to do so regularly; and in doing so, it has adopted a policy, trying to deflate broad money through high interest rates, which can only work (if it works at all) through provoking a sharp recession. This is obvious in theory: high rates make interest-bearing bank deposits more attractive, and market investment less so, so raising rates tends to inflate broad money, as long as the banks still see acceptable lending opportunities, which dry up only in a recession. What is more, this effect has repeatedly been demonstrated by the Bank of England (remember the Thatcher monetary targets?). Mr Paul Volcker fell into the same trap when President Carter turned him loose. He squeezed, and broad money ballooned. His sudden enlightenment exactly 10 years ago, triggered by the Mexican debt crisis (and memorably forecast by Dr Henry Kaufman, with dramatic results on Wall Street) started a worldwide fall in rates, and so ended the worst world recession until this one. An example for Buba, now faced with recession and actual falling prices? Probably not, alas; because Volcker's timely relaxation was sustained until it caused the world asset inflation. Is it ignorance that causes these huge policy errors? Surely not, after all this time. The common factor in all these episodes is not economic doctrine, but emotion. In all of them, the central bank saw itself as the only power able to save its nation from an irresponsible government, and adopted a policy designed to put the government on the rack. This used to be a purely British syndrome. It now seems to be endemic all over Europe.</p>

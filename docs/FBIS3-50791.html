According to the newspapers, in the interview Justice  Minister Correa reportedly said that between October and  November of last year a group of civilians and soldiers  reportedly urged President Itamar Franco to carry out a coup  similar to the one carried out by Alberto Fujimori in Peru, and  to impose strong measures against Congress and the Judicial  Branch.    According to presidential adviser Fernando Costa, President  Franco said: First, he did not attend the meeting. Second, the  justice minister informed the president early this morning that  he never talked about a coup during the interview. And last, the  interview with the justice minister is the justice minister's  responsibility.    Justice Minister Mauricio Correa said today that he did not  talk about a coup during the interview with Manchete Television  Network.    Correa explained that he talked about the government's  projects, and reporter Carlos Chagas asked during the interview  if there was an environment of tension in the country at any  time that could obstruct the constitutional order. The minister  said that between October and November of last year the country  was experiencing a period of extreme concern due to low  salaries, a high inflation rate, and the impasse in the Federal  Supreme Court over the decision on former President Fernando  Collor's political future. In addition to that, said the  minister, the people saw images of the corruption in the country  everyday.    Mauricio Correa said that as justice minister he gave an  interpretation in the interview of what he felt, but that at no  time did he say President Itamar Franco was under pressure:    [Begin recording] In case you saw the interview, I never  talked about a coup that was being hatched inside the  government. I only gave an interpretation of what I felt as  minister; that was my duty. [end recording]    Minister Correa also said that if he is summoned, he will go  to Congress to repeat what he said in the Manchete Television  Network interview. Correa added that the country is going  through a time when things should not be hidden, that this can  even serve as therapy for the future.</p>

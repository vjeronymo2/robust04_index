			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Dow Europe to win Czech holding DOW EUROPE, European arm of the second biggest US chemicals group, is to be chosen over Elf Aquitaine of France by the Czech government to acquire a 36 per cent stake in a Czech chemical business, Chemicke Zavody Sokolov. In what amounts to the largest US investment in Czechoslovakia so far, Dow is paying Dollars 25m for its share stake and has pledged to invest a further Dollars 154m in the joint venture over the next seven years. Of this, Dollars 79m will be spent in the first three years. Dow will also retain the right to increase its ownership to 94 per cent of the Czech company for a total of Dollars 100m. The shares will in the meantime stay in the hands of the Czech National Property Fund. According to Mr Mark Bakal, head of the USAID team of advisers at the Czech Ministry of Privatisation, Dow will agree to operate the Czech company at full capacity and make it the European acrylic centre of the Dow group. The company may also develop its hydrogen-peroxide and chlorate business in Czechoslovakia, depending on future market studies. Unlike Elf Aquitaine, which offered a substantial competing bid for the Czech company, this will be Dow's only plant in Europe which implies significant potential for future growth, said Mr Bakal. Dow and Sokolov also have a 15-year long relationship, with management openly in favour of the American group. Kmart, the US department stores company, is poised to make the first large foreign investment in retail trade in Czechoslovakia, buying six stores in main cities. It will buy 67 per cent of Maj, a large department store in central Prague, for Dollars 9.7m and 97 per cent of five Prior stores in key locations in the country, for Dollars 27.8m. The US company will invest a further Dollars 8.3m to revamp both stores and upgrade the products sold there. This is the second largest US investment in Czechoslovakia after Dow. Last year, Proctor &amp; Gamble acquired a detergent factory for Dollars 20m. Kmart intends to create the first department stores chain in Czechoslovakia selling products with western standards. It also estimates that Dollars 15m worth of Czechoslovak products could be exported back to Kmart stores in the US in the first year of the joint venture. Department stores in Czechoslovakia have been hard hit by the recession since the start of the economic reforms two years ago. The stores Kmart is buying have registered minimal profits following a 31.7 per cent drop in sales for 1991.</p>

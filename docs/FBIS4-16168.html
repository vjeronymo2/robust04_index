			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr -- The stabilization of the  situation around Gorazde is perhaps the most important thing  that was achieved during the two days of talks in Sarajevo,  Vitaliy Churkin, special representative of the Russian  president, said in an interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent  after his return to Belgrade.    There have been no intensive combat actions in the Gorazde  region for over 24 hours now, he continued. True, the Muslims  did make two attempts to provoke the Serbian side into opening  fire but the UN forces' observers cut short these attempts.    I now have assurances from Radovan Karadzic that the Serbian  forces do not intend to make any further attacks or to open fire  on Gorazde, of course, on condition that the Muslim side does  not provoke them.    After my talks in Pale and Sarajevo I have come away with  the  conviction that the Serbian side does not intend to throw down a  challenge to the international community. Its stance makes it  possible to move the negotiating process forward, although  resolute steps are needed on its part to move forward toward  peace in Bosnia, and, consequently, toward the removal of the  sanctions against Yugoslavia, that is how the Russian deputy  foreign minister assessed the results of his meetings in  Sarajevo with the leadership of the Bosnian sides, the command  of the UN forces, Charles Redman, the special representative of  the U.S. President, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the  cochairmen of the Geneva peace conference, and also his latest  conversation with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    I handed over to Milosevic and Karadzic our proposals that  would facilitate the establishment of peace in Bosnia and  progress on the question of sanctions; we will be awaiting their  reply to them.    V. Churkin refuted reports that representatives of the UN  forces were arrested and detained by the Bosnian Serbs. It is  just a matter of restricting their movements, which was a  reaction to the air strikes by the NATO air forces, he said.  Indeed, only vehicles of the Russian battalion of "blue  helmets" are freely allowed through the Serbian part of Sarajevo.    This reaction was also expressed in the refusal by the  Serbian side to hold talks with the command of the UN forces.  I, however, told the people I was talking to that to ignore the  United Nations was not in their interests. But I have no  grounds to insist that they change their stance after everything  that has happened.    The Russian diplomat said that he will remain in Belgrade  for  now.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>   [Text] Israel carried out a new nuclear test in the  Mediterranean early this month. According to our information,  the new nuclear test focused on experiments with new types of  short-range nuclear missiles and other technological weapons and  equipment.    An Israeli technical committee chose the site of the new  nuclear test, preparations for which lasted approximately four  months. The same information indicates that the test aimed to  check the efficiency of three secret Israeli bases that control  the launch of nuclear missiles and weapons. Israel spent over  $30 million on the test and part of the money was used to buy  advanced technological equipment.    Some Arab governments reportedly received important  political  reports on the details of the test. The reports urged these  governments to intervene directly with the United States and  European states to keep the Mediterranean safe from nuclear  tests.    This is Israel's second nuclear test this year.</p>

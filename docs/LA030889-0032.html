			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL TO RESUME TODAY;  </P> <P> KRAFT JUDGE LISTENS TO WITNESSES IN SECRET  </P> <P> For the first time since the murder trial of Randy Steven Kraft began in July,  the judge Tuesday heard testimony from witnesses during a closed-door hearing  and ordered attorneys in the case not to discuss the meeting.  </P> <P> The meeting was held on the record, with a court reporter present, but Superior  Court Judge Donald A. McCartin ordered the record and the clerk's minutes  sealed from public view.  </P> <P> Jurors had been dismissed at the end of court Monday and told not to return  until Wednesday.  </P> <P> Lawyers in the case declined to comment on what took place Tuesday, citing the  judge's order. Nor would they say what impact the subject of the in-chambers  hearing might have on the trial.  </P> <P> Kraft, 43, a Long Beach computer consultant, is on trial in Santa Ana charged  with murdering 16 young men. Prosecutors have told the court that if he is  convicted, they may introduce up to 29 other murders in seeking a death  sentence.  </P> <P> Kraft was present for the closed-door hearing, along with one of his attorneys,  C. Thomas McDonald. Others present were Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown, the  judge and some members of his staff.  </P> <P> McCartin would only say in the open courtroom that the Kraft trial will be in  session today. Defense attorneys had wanted the judge to postpone the trial  until next Monday. But the judge said arrangements had been made so that  further postponement was unnecessary.  </P> <P> The closed-door meeting was highly unusual for McCartin, who was the first  judge in the Kraft case to unseal records that had been closed to the public  for more than five years. Defense attorneys had wanted to leave sealed a list  found in Kraft's car that prosecutors have called a "death list," or raft's own  score card of how many murders he had committed. But the judge ordered the list  unsealed in September after the jurors had heard opening statements.  </P> <P> McCartin has held numerous hearings with witnesses outside the presence of the  jury since the trial began. But those hearings have always been in open court  where the public could view them. He has met in chambers with the attorneys  several times, however.  </P> <P> Four witnesses, three women and a man, were led into the judge's chambers one  at a time Tuesday. It could not be determined whether they had been called by  the defense, the prosecution, or the judge himself. However, after three of  them testified, the district attorney's top investigator on the Kraft case, Dan  Disanto, thanked them for any inconvenience.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has a policy of generally opposing closed-door  sessions. The public's business should be conducted in public, Chief Assistant  Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi has stated.  </P> <P> But Capizzi said Tuesday that exceptions must sometimes be made.  </P> <P> "The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that in some situations it is  appropriate to meet in chambers, and as long as it is evaluated on an  individual basis, we have no quarrel with that," Capizzi said.  </P> <P> The closed hearing came in the middle of the sixth week of the defense's  presentation of its case. The defense is not expected to conclude until the end  of March.  </P></p>

The bank made no provisions for loan losses in the quarter after its non-accruing loans fell to Dollars 430m (Dollars 759.8m). Despite making no provisions, its ratio of reserves to non-accruing loans increased to 87.3 per cent (74.1 per cent). Net interest income rose to Dollars 189.2m (Dollars 173.7m), helped by a rise in credit card assets. Total assets rose by 2.7 per cent to Dollars 16.8bn, and net yield on interest earning assets rose to 4.99 per cent (4.79 per cent). Other operating income fell to Dollars 50.5m (Dollars 82m) because of a one-off gain from the sale of mortgage backed securities last time and a drop in fee income. The tier one ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets, an important measure of capital strength, rose to 9.85 per cent (9.29 per cent).</p>

Air attacks in Bosnia would only exacerbate the  situation and the addressees would not be the ones to suffer  from it, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy declared  in a short interview to MAGYAR HIRLAP prior to his departure  after a visit in Budapest.    [Gyevai] Some Western predictions warn of the possibility of  a war between Russia and Ukraine because of the critical  economic situation in Ukraine. Does Kiev feel such a danger?    [Radetskyy] No, and I find this impossible. The economy is  in a serious state in both Ukraine and in Russia. A war does  not strengthen the economic situation; on the contrary, it  weakens the economy. Therefore, in my view, the predictions you  have mentioned are mere speculations.    [Gyevai] How did Kiev receive the Russian request that the  United Nations authorize Moscow to carry out peacekeeping  activity in the sensitive points of the former Soviet Union?    [Radetskyy] I must say that we have not yet dealt with this  issue. At the same time, we think it is important that every  such peacekeeping mission should take place under UN auspices.  I do not find it expedient to carry out such tasks separately,  especially not in the CIS.    [Gyevai] On what does Ukraine want to focus in implementing  the Partnership for Peace program proposed by NATO?    [Radetskyy] First of all, we have a positive approach toward  the initiative itself. We are in favor of accepting  peacekeeping tasks in various regional conflicts. We discussed  the issue and, in my opinion, this seems to be the optimal and  most acceptable solution.    [Gyevai] What is your opinion of the idea that NATO should  use air attacks as a response to the attack in Sarajevo last  week?    [Radetskyy] I oppose the use of the air force because this  will not solve the problem we are facing. It will not only fail  to solve the problem, but it will even exacerbate the situation.  In addition, such an action would cause civilians, children,  old people, and women to suffer, rather than the warring  factions. I think that we should seek a solution in two  directions. On the one hand, the sides involved in this  conflict should settle their internal differences of views. On  the other hand, this endeavor should be supported not only by  words but also by deeds. However, the supply of arms and  military equipment is not the proper way of support.</p>

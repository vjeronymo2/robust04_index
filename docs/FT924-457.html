			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Travel: Vienna; Sensuousness and coffee shops - Love of socialising and the arts make the Austrian capital an outstanding city THERE is something peculiar about walking through an old city in the dark, late at night. Go there in the daytime and the eye and ear are instantly claimed by the present - crowds, cars, clamour and movement keep the past concealed and at bay. Go there very late, however, and - like some great submarine beast emerging into emptiness and silence - history rises to the surface. In a city such as Vienna, the past sits at the end of every echoing street and catches the innocent wanderer unawares. I arrived in Vienna late one evening and became lost the moment I set foot in it. Dropping my bags at my hotel, I began an exploratory stroll  - usually a few left turns, right turns and a little intuition will lead one to a busy street, a crowded cafe. But my feet took me instead to a place of dark-windowed palaces and baroque boulevards where not a soul stirred. Entranced, I wandered along quiet passageways to empty courtyards, under covered arcades to deserted squares and promenades. I passed silent equestrians: bronze princes and emperors raised high in the dark on granite plinths. There were long stone stairways, columned porticoes, classical statuary, dim vistas of imperial architecture that receeded into the distance. Once, there was a clatter of hooves on cobblestones and a real horse went by, pulling a rumbling fiacre containing a bowler-hatted horseman, a laughing woman in a long gown and a man in evening wear. Seconds later, there was nothing left but a lingering smell of cigar smoke. It was only a late-night tourist jaunt, but it made me feel that a long-dead past had infiltrated the city, spirited away its life and claimed it for its own. By the time I found my way back to my hotel, I was feeling thoroughly spooked. Even here, I lost my way in vast chandelliered reception rooms and miles of vacant, mirrored, fin-de-siecle corridors. Where were the people, the life, the sparkle that makes this one of the most engaging cities in Europe? I found my room, pulled the curtains against the intrusions of the past, and went to sleep. In the morning, it all seemed different. This was no ghost-house but the Hotel Imperial, the most elegant establishment in Vienna, and from its windows I looked out on to a sunny, busy city, one of the great cultural capitals of Europe. On my way down to breakfast, the marble nudes on the staircase looked at me a little less coldly, the gilt-framed imperial portraits on the wall a little less sternly. The whole city exuded gemutlichkeit, that special brand of warmth, happiness and social ease for which Vienna is re-knowned. My first destination was the great complex of imperial buildings I had wandered through the night before. No longer peopled solely by phantoms, the grim, grey Hofburg, the winter palace of the Habsburg emperors, was now enlivened by foreign visitors and weekending Austrians, and I joined them. It is difficult to pack 640 years of Habsburg rule into a single morning, and I did not try. Of the 2,000 rooms in the Hofburg, I visited only a few. I toured two dozen sumptuous state rooms and private apartments last lived in by Emperor Franz Joseph and his Empress Elizabeth. I looked at Belgian tapestries, Bohemian crystal and countless baroque decorative flourishes. In the treasury, I gazed at the 1,000-year-old crown of the Holy Roman Empire, and, in the chapel, at the stalls from which the Vienna Boys' Choir performs every Sunday. Best of all, I spent an hour or so in the ballroom atmosphere of the Spanish Riding School, watching a morning training session of the Lippizan stallions. Here, under the tutelage of elegant riders in cocked hats and tails, the dappled grey Lippizans execute dressage exercises of astounding precision and beauty. Anyone looking for the stylisation and formality generated by the Austro-Hungarian empire will find it, pushed to its limits, in these horses. But they will also find remnants of empire, in less extreme form, wherever they go in Vienna. My impressions of the previous evening were, in the end, not so far wrong. History is a concentrated and invasive element in Vienna. For it is not just the city's history, but the history of much of Europe. It was from Vienna that 55m people, a score of widely varied races and cultures stretching from Spain to Transylvania, were administered. It was to Vienna that some of the most accomplished figures of the age flocked. A city that looks backwards rather than forward, Vienna remains a repository of all these memories. Nor is the Viennese past all one of enlightenment and gaiety. Reaction and intolerance were the less admirable hallmarks of Habsburg domination, from early times through to the heavy-handed, 68-year rule of Franz Joseph, a reign that ended only with the first world war and the dismemberment of empire. Products of a long, intense and sometimes tragic history, the Viennese today remain obsessed with their past. One consequence of this has been the maintainance of a highly conservative Viennese society, the leftover of a political order long gone. Stratified and hierarchical, easily impressed by titles and rank, Vienna lacks the liberal, cosmopolitan atmosphere found in most European capitals. In its place, this tightly-knit, status-conscious city puts great value on cliquish sociability and gregariousness. If Vienna's history has left it with a parochial outlook, it has also stamped it with a genuine cultural and artistic interest not found in other capitals. If morning is the time to visit one of an astonishing number of palaces and museums, the afternoon is a good moment to begin watching Vienna society at play. The popular eating houses known as beisl and heurige, or wine taverns, are both much favoured meeting places. But coffee houses have been institutions in Vienna since retreating Turkish invaders left bags of coffee beans behind; much of the city seems to spend its life chatting, doing business, reading the papers and eating cream strudel in them. If I were Viennese, I would as well. I spent numerous afternoons trying different coffee shops. My favourite? I liked the Cafe Landtmann, a spot preferred by politicians and writers, for its intellectual flavour. But in the end, I would plump for Demel, a place inhabited by sensualists and middle-aged gourmandes, for the flavour of its plum cake. Demel makes the best pastries in Vienna, if not all Europe. But the Austrian capital, in the end, is not baroque palaces, highly schooled horses, art collections, cafe society or pastries. Its heart is its live arts, its evenings of music by the composers - Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Strauss - who lived in Vienna and made it a musical byword. I did not know that I liked opera before; it seemed too much like work. But I got myself into evening dress anyway, and sat in a box at the State Opera for a performance of Mozart's Abduction from the Seraglio. It was as sensuous as Demel's plum cake.

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Finance minister sees no sign of Spanish recovery: Solbes says sharp cut in labour costs is needed THE RECESSION in Spain shows no sign of ending and a sharp reduction of labour costs is required to stimulate the troubled economy, the country's new economy and finance minister has warned. Mr Pedro Solbes also said the European Monetary System could not endure continual crisis and he appealed to the Bundesbank to take the problems of other EMS members into account. Mr Solbes, the former agriculture minister promoted to the economy portfolio earlier this month, indicated there was little chance over the next two years of reducing Spain's budget deficit and said he would amend a package of ambitious targets set by the government for economic and monetary union convergence. The minister gave one of the most sombre assessments to date by a senior minister of the economic problems facing Spain. A technocrat and non-socialist in a Socialist party-led government, Mr Solbes also gave a frank outline of structural reforms and spending cuts that are needed to reduce the budget deficit. 'With the data we have at present, I don't see short-term recovery,' Mr Solbes said. 'It is by no means certain that recession has bottomed out and we will have below-zero GDP growth this year, perhaps minus 0.5 per cent.' The minister said he had to be 'very prudent' over forecasts for 1994 although the government was 'convinced' the domestic economy would improve. 'It is very difficult to suggest figures but we are working on a growth rate of between 1 and 2 per cent,' he said. Mr Solbes will be meeting employers and unions tomorrow for talks on what the government has termed 'a social pact for employment' - a broad agreement on wages and labour legislation that will address Spain's sharply deteriorating job market. Quarterly employment figures due this week are expected to show the loss of more than 100,000 jobs in the past three months and an unemployment level of more than 23.5 per cent. 'My thesis is that wages have to be pegged below inflation levels,' Mr Solbes said. He will also seek at the talks large-scale revision of laws on hiring, job classifications and firing that have helped make Spain's labour costs among the highest in the west. Mr Solbes said he wanted negotiated agreements but stated clearly that if these were not forthcoming, the government would act unilaterally and radically to reform the labour market. 'There is not much time and new wage guidelines must be in place by January 1,' he said. The Spanish peseta has been devalued three times since September. Mr Solbes believed the currency had weathered last week's attacks, falling to just below its central parity rate in the exchange rate mechanism, but he warned a speculative broadside 'could happen all over again'. 'The EMS cannot live in a situation of permanent crisis,' he said. The best way to solve the problems was to move faster towards monetary union. Mr Solbes said he was not confident that meaningful cost-cutting could be introduced in next year's budget. The central government's deficit, he said, stood at 5 per cent of GDP, nearly double the target for 1993, and at between 6.2 and 6.5 per cent if local administration balance sheets were included. Mr Solbes said his main concern was to achieve a 3 per cent budget deficit.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Technology: Not at all quiet on the home front - Multimedia means different things to different people but, everybody wants to be involved Japan's electronics industry, with its leading-edge technologies and manufacturing capabilities, is expected to play a major role in ushering in the age of multimedia. Some companies, such as Toshiba and Sega, are already involved in multimedia tests in the US or, like Matsushita and Sony, have forged strategic deals with US leaders in the field. But when it comes to their own plans to bring multimedia to the masses, Japanese electronics makers display an uncharacteristic lack of confidence. 'I don't think ordinary citizens need so much information,' says Tsuzo Murase, an executive vice president of Matsushita who has played a key role in the company's multimedia strategy. Privately, many admit that they still do not have a very clear idea of what multimedia is all about and where it is heading. 'The word multimedia covers so many things that it is difficult to define,' says Takashi Ochiai, general manager of the personal services division at Fujitsu. 'Telecommunications companies, broadcasters and manufacturers each have different views of what multimedia is.' Opinion is also divided over whether multimedia will take off first as a business tool or as a high-tech entertainment gizmo. But if there is one thing that everyone agrees about it is that whatever multimedia turns out to be, they will want to be involved in it in some way or another. So, overcoming their instinctive reservations, the forerunners in the race to bring out multimedia machines are taking a two-pronged approach of attacking both the home and the business markets at the same time. In the home market, many equipment makers are convinced entertainment games and educational software programs will provide them with an entry into the multimedia market. 'Games are the easiest form of multimedia,' says Mikio Higashi, Matsushita executive in charge of information equipment. The approach taken by this camp has been to bring computing and communications capabilities to the television set. Matsushita, for example, has launched 3DO Real, a machine based on technology developed by 3DO, a US company in which it has a stake. The machine can play CDs, CD-Roms and CD Video. The 3DO Real machine can be connected to cable TV and phone lines. Matsushita plans to enable users to hook up to communications networks in Japan as well as to the Internet. It will also be able to serve as the terminal for multimedia services, such as home shopping and video-on-demand. And once Matsushita comes out with a keyboard for 3DO Real, later in the year, the machine, which Higashi notes has the capabilities of a workstation, will be able to serve as a PC in the home. 'There are so many applications that we don't have to worry about what to do with the machine,' Higashi beams. For the time being, however, Matsushita is hoping that a steady increase in its games titles (see below) and the launch of a game based on the popular film Jurassic Park will boost sales of 3DO Real, which has suffered from having to compete with lower-priced conventional games machines made by Nintendo and Sega. 'Multimedia is a software business,' Higashi says. It will provide Matsushita with an attractive way to use its software assets, acquired through MCA of the US, and most of the profits from 3DO Real will come from the software. 'We want to make 3DO Real a practical product that every family will want.' As services and technologies advance, Matsushita will incorporate the CD-Rom drive and PC board that give 3DO Real its intelligence, directly into the TV, Higashi says. Meanwhile, Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, has adopted a different approach, using a multimedia PC, called FM Towns, and a more consumer-oriented cousin, called Marty, as entries into the home market. The original idea behind FM Towns was to make the PC easy enough for anyone to use. Some 55 per cent of sales have been to home users, 35 per cent to schools and just 10 per cent to businesses. Marty, which was launched last year, connects to a TV and plays the same software as FM Towns. Both FM Towns and Marty use CD-Roms and, in addition to CD-Rom games and data, play music CDs, karaoke CDs and photo CDs. Users can create their own data on screen which can then be captured on a floppy disk. Both also serve as terminals to access a variety of communications networks. In Air Warriors, one of the games applications that can be used either on FM Towns or Marty, the player connects into the communications network and flies his aeroplane through the landscape that appears on screen. If other players connected to the communications network want to join in, they can form a team and 'talk' to each other in much the same way that PC users on a network send messages. Eventually, as advanced telecommunications networks, such as integrated services digital networks, become more widespread, players on the network will be able to hear each other speak, rather than send messages on screen, says Ochiai. FM Towns and Marty will also serve as terminals for services such as screen shopping and video-on-demand. In future FM Towns and Marty are likely to offer the capability to link up with cable TV. Fujitsu emphasises the potential of its multimedia products as an educational tool rather than just a games machine. It also believes they can be used more widely as marketing tools, in showrooms, for example. Meanwhile, both Fujitsu and Matsushita have kept their options open for the business multimedia market. Fujitsu has an installed base of 40,000 FM Towns PCs in the office market while Matsushita recently introduced a PC that can show video and TV on screen. But given the currently low penetration of basic PCs in the Japanese office, the home market in Japan may be a more promising starting point for multimedia. Murase, for one, has put his PC away. 'I never used it and it was taking up too much desk space,' he says.</p>

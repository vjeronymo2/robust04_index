			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  PANEL TO REPRESENT DISABLED PROPOSED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles City Council committee Friday recommended creating a Commission  on Disability to represent the interests of disabled people in city  decision-making.  </P> <P> The council's Public Health, Human Resources and Senior Citizens Committee  voted 2 to 0 to recommend to the full council that it create the commission and  empower it to function "as an integral part of city government."  </P> <P> "This proposal would elevate the commitment of the city to a new level," said  Bill Elkins, an executive assistant to Mayor Tom Bradley who testified at the  committee hearing.  </P> <P> "This commission would send a message to the federal government and to the  state government, clearly indicating that the city of Los Angeles is serious  about its commitment to its disabled community," he said.  </P> <P> Elkins said the commission might also give the city an advantage in applying  for federal grants for programs for the disabled.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA / KEVIN BRASS: SOMETHING TO SAY? BRING IT, AND A  CHECKBOOK, TO KCEO  </P> <P> For $600 an hour, you -- yes, even you -- can have your own radio show.  </P> <P> This is the age when both television and radio are opening their studios to the  public. From community access television channels to "infomercials," those  annoying half-hour advertisements on cable television, the airwaves are filled  with average folks and businesses using the media for their own purposes.  </P> <P> Instead of Big Brother dictating what the audience will see and hear, little  sister, the cousin down the street and just about anybody with a product to  pitch is programming television and radio. Communications experts, the ones who  sit around at schools and seriously discuss the future, warned us this would  happen.  </P> <P> The $600-an-hour deal comes from KCEO-AM (1000), a small North County radio  station that sells air time like a used-car dealership. Weekdays it focuses on  a business and financial news format. But from 8 a.m. to midnight on weekends,  and three hours daily during the week, the programming is supplied by people  willing to pay for the time.  </P> <P> Prices vary, but a prime weekend slot costs about $600 an hour. The producers  can then turn around and sell up to 12 minutes of air time for ads to help  recoup their expenses.  </P> <P> The result is, in some ways, like the block programming of old radio, when  variety was king and stations didn't have a single-format theme. KCEO's program  list is a hodgepodge, a potpourri of bizarre subjects and specialized shows.  Programs cover diabetes, financial planning, thoroughbred racing, the occult  and nutrition, among other topics.  </P> <P> The system has been in effect for about two years, and has been a good deal for  KCEO, which is hardly a ratings powerhouse. It provides programming at no cost  to the station, in addition to guaranteed income.  </P> <P> "We've stuck with it because it's good for us and it's good for people," said  KCEO sales manager Peter Gray, who acknowledged that, "from a financial  standpoint, it can be lucrative."  </P> <P> KCEO's programs are different than infomercials because people don't just  "pitch their wares," Gray said. In addition, independent producers have to  commit to a minimum of 26 weeks of programs, he said.  </P> <P> Of course, the system can lead to some confusion. When Rick Moore, the  communications director at San Diego State University received a call from a  KCEO salesman, he thought he was being asked to appear as a guest on a show.  </P> <P> "It was not clear until he started asking questions that they wanted us to pay  for the time," Moore said.  </P> <P> Gray attributes Moore's confusion to a simple misunderstanding.  </P> <P> In an attempt to eliminate as many misunderstandings as possible, the Federal  Communications Commission has established specific guidelines on these types of  practices.  </P> <P> When any person or company buys time on a radio station, the station must make  the source of the programming clear to the audience, according to an FCC  spokesman. The FCC recently fined a station in Pomona for failing to disclose  that two financial experts had paid for the right to appear on a talk.  </P> <P> Gray said KCEO runs a disclaimer before or after each purchased show: "The  proceeding (or following) program has been sponsored by . . . "  </P> <P> "The idea is to let the public know when they are being persuaded and who they  are being persuaded by," said Roger Holberg, assistant chief of the FCC's  complaint and investigations branch. "There is no distinction made if it is a  commercial or programming with some other intent."  </P> <P> I've seen Michael Tuck, and Herb Cawthorne is no Michael Tuck. But he's trying.  In terms of style, his commentaries for KGTV (Channel 10) are clones of Tuck's  "Perspectives." He cocks his head toward the camera, uses the harsh language  and strikes the same tone of righteous indignation that made Tuck the avenging  angel of the airwaves.  </P> <P> Thus far, though, there has been more style than substance to his commentaries.  Thursday night he discussed a phone scam, complete with still pictures of  Cawthorne dialing the number.  </P> <P> Cawthorne's profound comment: "Is this a rotten, dirty rip-off or what?"  </P> <P> At least in the taped commentaries, he comes across as reasonably articulate,  and he definitely states his position. Cawthorne's work as an anchor is a  different story. Used only on the updates that air on the CNN Headline News  channel, he is almost a parody of an anchor, unsure of when to punch words and  when to pause. He is stumbling and awkward as he struggles with the  TelePrompter.  </P> <P> Tuck's anchor seat at Channel 10 is still warm, but KNSD-TV (Channel 39) is  already promoting Denise Yamada and Marty Levin as "the most consistent anchor  team" in San Diego. At last week's luncheon to promote its fall season, a solid  10 on the schmooze-meter, Levin was referred to as the "senior player" in San  Diego, now that Tuck is gone, and Yamada said that "people come and go, but you  have got to look at who is staying." Apparently Yamada can be counted among  those staying, although there were rumors to the contrary. The station  reportedly picked up an option on her contract earlier this year, and there  apparently are no plans to make a change. "Marty and Denise are our team,"  station General Manager Neil Derrough said. . . .  </P> <P> Leave it to XTRA-FM (91X) to use its most loyal listeners as fodder for pranks  and practical jokes. Last week the station was playing games with callers  requesting songs, putting some on conference calls with other callers and  telling others they had the wrong number. The taped calls were then replayed on  the air. Only 91X would think it logical to play mind games with devoted  listeners. As if the 91X disc jockeys are not annoying enough. . . .  </P> <P> KFMB-TV (Channel 8) has filed a complaint against the San Diego police officer  who climbed on the station's van and put his hand over the camera lens during a  live broadcast from the site of a plane crash on California 163 last Monday.  "We're investigating," said SDPD spokesman Bill Robinson. . . .  </P> <P> KUSI-TV (Channel 51), which had hoped to have a 10 p.m. newscast on the air by  Sept. 10, has pushed back the start-up date. They're now shooting for later  this month. . . . Morning guy Jack Diamond is off the air at KSON-FM (97.3). He  left to take a job with a Top 40 station in Washington, D.C., his home town. .  . . Channel 10 couldn't resist blowing its own horn Thursday night, providing  viewers of the 11 p.m. newscast with exclusive coverage of the station's 6:30  newscast, a "video post card" to troops overseas. "We've done something special  here at Channel 10," anchorwoman Carol LeBeau modestly reported. . . . Call it  counter-programming. KTTV (Channel 11) is airing "Rocky and Bullwinkle" at 11  a.m., opposite the local news. . . . KFMB-FM (B100) and KFMB-AM (760) are  trading news people. Pat Gaffey, once a member of the Morning Zoo, is switching  to the AM; Marilyn Hyder is going to B100.  </P></p>

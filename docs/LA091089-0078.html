			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILSON FIRES UP GOP FAITHFUL BUT ALL IS NOT PEACEFUL IN STATE PARTY  </P> <P> There are two sides to the California Republican Party at this juncture and  both were evident Saturday at its semi-annual convention in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The pragmatic side is represented by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is now a  candidate for governor in 1990. His crowd-pleasing speech left GOP mouths  watering for winning not just the governorship but also for taking control of  the Legislature and sending 12 new GOP congressmen to Washington before the  turn of the century.  </P> <P> Wilson delighted the activists with his prediction that the initiative process  will, in 1990, reform the heavily politicized drawing of legislative and  congressional districts.  </P> <P> Republicans believe that more of their number would be elected to the  Legislature and Congress if the districts were drawn to reflect their  increasing share of the electorate.  </P> <P> If he is to tackle California's problems as its next governor, Wilson told the  partisans here, "I intend to have the help in Sacramento that Gov. (George)  Deukmejian deserves but does not have."  </P> <P> Wilson said he is likely to support not just one, but several competing ballot  measures to strip the Democratic-controlled Legislature of its current power to  draw district lines.  </P> <P> Wilson listed his accomplishments as legislator, San Diego mayor and U.S.  senator going back two decades and predicted that the Democrats will not be  able to nominate a gubernatorial candidate next year who can match his record.  </P> <P> The other side of the state GOP is inward looking and ideological. Here, in the  Hilton Hotel foyers and suites, party activists bickered and argued and called  for purges.  </P> <P> One group of activists, led by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton),  demanded that homosexuals be purged from the party. This is part of what has  now become a years-long and almost wholely unsuccessful crusade by the  conservative congressman against anything having to do with gays.  </P> <P> One of the largest crowds of the weekend, outside of the formal mealtime  speeches, gathered to hear Dannemeyer in a finger-pointing, full-decibel  hallway debate with interloper Gloria Allred, the liberal activist, who  surfaced at the convention.  </P> <P> "I'll put my hand down if you'll put your's down," Dannemeyer said as fingers  went wagging. "You put your's down first," Allred snapped. And so it went.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dramatic Blowups  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Angela (Bay) Buchanan, a candidate for state treasurer, dramatically  produced blowups of notarized documents showing that incumbent Treasurer Thomas  W. Hayes, also a Republican, had throughout most of his life registered to vote  as a nonpartisan.  </P> <P> Buchanan bills herself as "the real Republican," but the use of the documents  left onlookers puzzled because Hayes has the backing of GOP Gov. Deukmejian,  who appointed him and who apparently was satisfied when Hayes registered as a  Republican upon his appointment.  </P> <P> Puzzled about another matter here were state GOP leaders, who admitted that  they could not explain why the party still has no credible candidates for state  controller and secretary of state, two of seven statewide constitutional  offices at stake next year.  </P> <P> At the very least, said former state party Chairman Robert W. Naylor, "you'd  think we would have somebody operating on the 'bus theory.' You know, the  incumbent Democrat may get hit by a bus."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wilson Disappointed  </P> <P> Wilson expressed his disappointment at his failure so far to recruit candidates  to take on Democratic incumbents in the two offices. But he said he will  continue to seek Republicans to take a dare.  </P> <P> "But it's not an easy decision. It can change your life. I know," said Wilson.  </P></p>

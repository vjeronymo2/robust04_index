			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Exploratory missions to be sent as Yugoslavia is suspended THE Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) will dispatch 'exploratory' missions to Serbian-controlled Kosovo, Vojvodina, and Sandjak in a move aimed at deciding what future role the CSCE will play in the region. The announcment, made yesterday by a CSCE committee, coincided with a decision to suspend the rump Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro, until October 14. Several countries wanted Yugoslavia expelled, but Russia vetoed any such move. Diplomats said the compromise would serve as a carrot and stick for Serbia. For instance, western diplomats said if the dismal human and ethnic rights record in Kosovo, Vojvodina, and Sandjak - which have sizeable Albanian, Hungarian and Moslem minorities respectively - did not improve by October 14, there was little chance that Yugoslavia would be admitted. Diplomats said Serbia and Montenegro would not automatically become the legitimate successor to the former Yugoslavia. 'Like any new state, it will have to apply for CSCE membership,' an east European diplomat said.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to meet grain needs in 1994, says farm minister RUSSIA'S new agriculture minister, Mr Viktor Khlystun, said yesterday that his country needed to import 20m tonnes of grain this year but that its own producers could begin to meet domestic needs in 1994. Russia imported 16m tonnes of grain last year. He forecast that domestic agricultural production would rise in 1993 and meet demand in 1994 thanks to fast-track market reforms by the Russian government to redistribute land this year to all peasants and city dwellers who wish to go into private farming. The state is abolishing the old system of compulsory deliveries to the state at artificially low prices to improve incentives to sell under the present system. Peasants in future will be required only to sell 35 per cent of their grain to the state - at market prices. Workers at profitable state and collective farms are being told about the advantages of switching to co-operative, joint stock enterprises or individual holding. But only chronic loss-makers would be forced to abandon the state system imposed by Stalin in the 1930s at great cost to both Russian agriculture and the peasantry. The government said it would cut off subsidies to unprofitable farms - even though some of the 2,500 farms with debts would be allowed to stay if they were viable. 'We are not going to force these stages through but we will bring the philosophy of agrarian reform (to everybody concerned),' said Mr Khlystun, anxious to reassure public opinion that violent Bolshevik-style reform was a thing of the past. He admitted that one obstacle to sweeping market reforms was that parliament had yet to abolish a moratorium on the sale of land in the Russian constitution. For the time being, land can only be sold by peasants who have received a share of state land, to other inhabitants of the same region. But he said he had not found strong opposition to reform plans on a recent visit to farming areas - 'only the doubts and objections to specific points'. The main problem he suggested was a shortage of finance and equipment to help new farmers get started. 'The mood in the countryside is much more stable than in the cities. What worries villagers most is the extremely high price of agricultural machinery and they are also concerned about the shortages of consumer goods on sale in villages,' he said. Mr Khlystun said there was a particularly urgent need for animal feed imports to stem a fall in livestock and dairy production. The minister, who rejected calls for the government's resignation as 'premature', said he also expected food prices in the shops to come down after soaring with radical price reforms on January 2. Although the long-term solution was market reform of agriculture and the trade network, he said some producers were already being forced to lower prices for lack of purchasers.</p>

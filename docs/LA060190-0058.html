			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASA SEARCH CONTINUES FOR SHUTTLE LEAK  </P> <P> NASA workers found a tiny leak in Columbia's rear engine compartment Thursday  but judged it too small to have caused the hydrogen leak that delayed the  shuttle launch.  </P> <P> "The feeling is at this point that's probably not what they're looking for,"  said Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration.  </P> <P> The search was to continue through the day, being halted long enough for  Columbia's on-board fuel tanks to be drained. Officials planned to increase  pressure on the shuttle's external tank, which is filled with helium, in an  attempt to find the main leak, Buckingham said.  </P> <P> The external tank was being filled with more than a half-million gallons of  super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen Tuesday when the leak was  detected. NASA promptly called off the launch and drained the explosive  propellant.  </P> <P> Engineers believe the leak is in or near a 17-inch valve in a pipe that carries  fuel from the external tank to the main engines.  </P> <P> If the leak is detected and repairs can be made at the launch pad, Columbia  might be ready to lift off by the middle of next week. But, if Columbia has to  be returned to a hangar, the delay would be about a month, NASA officials said.  </P> <P> Columbia's astronomy mission, with a $150-million observatory called Astro,  already had been delayed two weeks because of repairs to the shuttle's cooling  system. The latest postponement will mean even more changes to Astro's  observing schedule.  </P> <P> One of the prime targets, Comet Austin, is speeding away from Earth, making  observations more difficult with every passing day. Halley's Comet was to have  been studied had the mission proceeded as scheduled in March, 1986, but the  Challenger explosion pushed the launch date back.  </P></p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP under renewed pressure STORM clouds continued to gather over BP as one securities house came in with the first shot in a hefty reassessment of the oil group's prospects. It was also affected by a feeling that enthusiasm from the US might be on the wane. Mr Fergus Macleod at County NatWest, sending out a preliminary note to clients headed: 'The suffering continues', argued that any improvement in refining margins in the US would be more than offset by falls in Europe and the Far East. He intends to issue an extremely bearish set of forecasts next week. The stock has suffered further on talk that the highly-rated oil analyst from US brokerage PaineWebber had turned negative on BP. It appears that the house did reduce its profit forecast but still rates BP as a buy. US demand, although down on previous days, returned in after-hours trading last night. The shares were down 6 at one stage, yesterday, before closing 3 1/2 off at 242 1/2 p with 9.7m traded. Investors were also said to be switching into British Gas, which fell with the market, ending 2 lower at 243p on turnover of 10.9m shares. Redland surges Building materials group Redland continued to bask in the positive comments from its results on Thursday and successful bid for Steetley. Redland's shares surged 14 to 481p in busy volume of 4.1m. Investor activity was spurred by the lure of Redland going ex-dividend on Monday, with a final payment of 22.3p beckoning. Mr Donald Anderson at Hoare Govett said: 'At 481p I would start to be a little cautious as a buyer, although the shares still promise to be strong performers over the next two to three years.' Banks were weak as their heavy exposure to debt-ridden property groups continued to drag the sector down. The plight of Heron International was the focal point and Barclays was again the main casualty with a fall of 12 to 287p. Lloyds, a strong performer for some time, fell 12 to 348p. Midland lost 3 to 337p despite the support value in its proposed merger with HongKong &amp; Shanghai. Power companies were firmer, apart from the Scottish generators and Eastern Electricity. The latter slipped 14 to 197p as Kleinwort Benson cut its profit forecast for the year to March to Pounds 135m from Pounds 157m, and for the current year to Pounds 180m from Pounds 188m. Scottish Power fell 1 1/2 to 79p and Scottish Hydro eased a penny to 81p, but National Power hardened to 192p and PowerGen added 2 to 203p. Among the regional electricity distributors, London put on 2 to 233p and Manweb 3 to 263p. A weaker dollar held back overseas earners. Reuters fell 14 to 1109p, Glaxo lost 12 to 767p and Wellcome slipped 15 to 1028p. A big line of stock in Vodafone Group found few buyers and the shares fell 6 1/2 to 308p in a thin market in the telecoms network sector. James Capel is believed to have been the seller of 1.2m shares which went through at 308p. South-eastern house builders came under pressure as some in the market felt they would be penalised by a prospective Labour government. Countryside Properties slipped 3 to 97p, Laing (John) shed 8 to 170p and Berkeley Group lost 2 to 231p. Uncertainties surrounding one US account held by a company recently acquired by Steel Burrill Jones reflected badly on the shares which fell 10 to 250p making a slide of 27p in two days. Political and economic worries weighed on food retailers. J. Sainsbury fell 8 to 375p and Tesco lost 7 1/2 to 242p, despite hopes that Tuesday's full-year figures will be good. Tesco is expected to show pre-tax profits of around Pounds 540m, compared with Pounds 417m last year, boosted by an interest saving from its Pounds 572m rights issue in January 1991. Animal feed group and food manufacturer, Dalgety, rose 2 to 381p on the appointment of Mr John West as chairman from September, when Mr Peter Carey retires. ICI, which held a meeting with analysts after the market closed on Thursday, firmed 4 to 1228p. Troubled chemicals group MTM, which slumped by more than 50 per cent on Thursday, lost a further 5 1/2 to 25p. Life assurer London &amp; Manchester fell 14 to 233p as County NatWest advised clients to sell the stock. The house argued that new business growth was slowing, the balance sheet was stretched and the shares too expensive. British Aerospace was resilient, the shares eventually ending only a penny down at 299p, having touched 306p, on the prospect of raising Pounds 400m from disposals. BAe was also helped by confirmation from Trafalgar House, a penny firmer at 111p, that it had bought BAe's stake in the Brooklands property development. No price was mentioned by either party but analysts talked of a figure between Pounds 30m and Pounds 40m. Motor components manufacturer BBA gave up 4 to 110p as part of a block of 2.5m shares continued to overhang the market. The big seller in Siebe was still offering stock yesterday and that sent the shares falling another 14 to 604p. Fears that a Labour government would scale down the Trident submarine programme hurt VSEL and the shares eased another 5 to 265p, with a large part of the day's business carried out via agency crosses dealt. BET fell 7 to 114p on reports of a dividend downgrade by BZW. Turnover reached 5.8m. A Thursday night presentation at SG Warburg lifted airports group BAA 3 to 553p. Two sizeable sellers were reported in Ocean Group ahead of next week's figures and the shares fell 9 to 302p. Scottish Television jumped 40 to 750p after the company said advertising revenue was showing real growth for the first time in nearly two years. 1991 profits were down on the previous year but at the top end of forecasts and the group announced a one-for-one share split. Pearson bounced back 10 to 755p following recent sharp falls. Good two-way business in Ladbroke Group left the hotel and leisure concern 3 up at 214p as investors eyed the chunky dividend on offer on Monday. Turnover was a large 3.2m. Euro Disney continued its volatile ride, the shares slipping back 7 to 1543p. Adverse press and market comment has undermined the stock in recent weeks, although sentiment has been strengthened by the political uncertainty which has affected UK-based stocks. Most observers are waiting for an analysts' visit to the group on Tuesday to see if the bearish mood is continued. Finding support after recent weakness were Rank Organisation, 2 up at 657p and Thorn EMI, 3 ahead at 738p. Hanson saw good two-way business and closed a net 3 down on the day at 209 1/2 p with more than 8m shares dealt. Guinness steadied after Thursday's fall, rising a penny to 540p as Shearson Lehman Brothers re-emphasised its strong recommendation for the stock. Good turnover in the traded options market reflected well on Lasmo. The oil exploration company gained 4 to 190p in the underlying market on turnover of 9.3m, with the equivalent of a further 5m shares dealt in options form. Smith dealt a block of 3m shares earlier this week. MARKET REPORTERS Peter John, Joel Kibazo, Christopher Price, Colin Millham. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (11).

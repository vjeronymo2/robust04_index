			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The types of records that must be kept are specific to the coating or graphic arts line and the method by which it is meeting the appropriate emission limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the rules submitted for approval in the June 12, 1993 submittal have been reviewed and found to be approvable for incorporation into the Michigan ozone SIP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. November 1993 Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 15, 1993 MDNR submitted to EPA a SIP revision to address the remaining deficiencies in the State's VOC RACT regulations which were not corrected by the June 12, 1993 submittal. Listed below are descriptions of the changes this SIP submittal proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Rule 601&blank;(Definitions)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A revised definition for the term ``person responsible'' as used in Part 6 rules has been added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Rule 602&blank;(General Provisions for Existing Sources of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Provisions allowing for alternative compliance methods in Rules 628 and 629 require site-specific SIP revisions when implemented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Rule 624&blank;(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From an Existing Graphic Arts Line)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An unacceptable prorating method for recordkeeping has been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Rule 628&blank;(Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Components of Existing Process Equipment Used in Manufacturing Synthetic Organic Chemicals and Polymers; Monitoring Program) and Rule 629 (Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds From Components of Existing Process Equipment Used in Processing Natural Gas; Monitoring Program)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Test methods have been added which define how the percent VOC in a piece of equipment is to be determined. Provisions allowing reduced frequency of monitoring for low-leaking equipment have been changed to comply with EPA requirements. Wording was added requiring that all equivalent control methods must be submitted to EPA as site-specific SIP revisions as specified in Rule 602. The counties affected by these rules have been listed in the same format as other similar rules, for the purpose of uniformity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Non-CTG RACT Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are 3 non-CTG major sources of VOCs located in Michigan's Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone nonattainment area. These sources are: VCF Films, Inc.; Ford Motor Company's Utica Trim Plant; and the Woodbridge Corporations Whitmore Lake Plant (formerly Johnson Controls, Inc.). The course of action Michigan pursued for these companies was the development of administrative consent orders requiring implementation of RACT-level controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VCF Films, Inc. has entered into an administrative consent order requiring RACT-level controls for VOC emissions for its film casting processes. This order has been submitted as a SIP revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Trade ratification 'a priority' 'The outstanding priority', argued Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in London last night, is 'to ratify the Marrakesh trade agreements so that they can enter into force on the agreed target date of January 1 1995.' Giving the third annual Hayek memorial lecture at the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank, Mr Sutherland said international economic relations would then depend on achieving further cuts in trade barriers and the willingness of members of the prospective World Trade Organisation to abide by the letter and spirit of the new rules. Mr Sutherland pointed out that in industrial countries there would still be tariff peaks in sensitive categories; that average tariffs would remain much higher in developing countries than in industrial ones; that most agricultural tariffs would be significantly greater than on industrial products; and that much negotiation remained to be done in services, starting with financial services. One reason for the spread of illegal obstacles since the late 1960s was the absence of third party complaints against bilateral accords. But, stressed Mr Sutherland, a more fundamental threat to countries' willingness to abide by the rules and disciplines of the new WTO is concerns about implications for national sovereignty. Arguing against this view, he indicated that the WTO did not have the power to impose new trade policy obligations. Amendments of the WTO Agreement that alter the rights and obligations of members are effective only for those countries that have accepted them. Also 'some countries have interpreted the right to refuse panel findings as the prerogative of a sovereign nation. But what this amounts to is a country choosing to be above the law whenever it is inconvenient to observe the law.' More fundamentally, insisted Mr Sutherland, 'if sovereignty is equated with the ability of a government to carry out its legitimate functions, the acceptance of the new WTO rules and procedures by governments around the world will increase the sovereignty of each and every one of them.' Meanwhile, an important challenge would be developing coherence between the Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank and International Monetary Fund) and the WTO. Another priority is expansion of the system, which now has 123 contracting parties, with 19 more - including China, Russia and Ukraine - now negotiating accession or resumption of membership.</p>

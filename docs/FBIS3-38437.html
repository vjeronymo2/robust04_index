Ver." interview with Rete leader Leoluca Orlando; </F> place and date not given: "Orlando: It Is All the PDS' Fault";  first paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction]    [Excerpts] Rome -- Leoluca Orlando took a mouthful, then  said: "Now that we have won on all fronts...." Another mouthful:  "...We must be careful over the issue of candidates...." A  third mouthful: "...because we must offer the voters a credible  progressive alignment." [passage omitted]    [CORRIERE] Why do you say that you have won on all fronts?    [Orlando] Because we have secured acceptance at the  negotiations among the progressive forces of the idea that the  socialist stance is not represented exclusively by [Italian  Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco. Because Craxi, De  Michelis, and Di Donato are no longer present in the new PSI.  Because the impossibility of standing for reelection has caused  La Malfa to veer off toward the Christian Democrats, thus  fragmenting the PRI [Italian Republican Party]. Because my  doubts about [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, who is with the DC  [Christian Democratic Party] and not with us, are now gaining  substance. Are these enough successes? [passage omitted]    [CORRIERE] Let us return to what is happening in Rome. Let  us talk about the progressive forces' candidates in the coming  general election.    [Orlando] I say we must beware of quick-change acts at the  local level. We will pay close attention to ensure that this  danger does not materialize. We will also implement the  following principle rigorously -- each candidate's establishment  at the local level.    [CORRIERE] Do you mean that you will field all the  candidates  in Sicily?    [Orlando] Why not? Will the PDS [Democratic Party of the  Left] not do the same in Emilia? It is a democratic practice....    [CORRIERE] But your allies would not like the idea of a Rete  candidate standing in all Sicily's constituencies.    [Orlando] No, not in every constituency, but in almost all.  In any case, our strength is very well established in Sicily.  We could even compete on our own, but we are not doing so. We  decided to align with other forces: This is the meaning of the  alliance.    [CORRIERE] Is it a government alliance or merely an election  cartel?    [Orlando] It is an alliance that for the present is aiming  at  victory.    [CORRIERE] Yes, but then what? [PDS Deputy Secretary]  D'Alema is talking in terms of a government with [Italian  Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli....    [Orlando] I disagree with approaches to the man who is now  again putting forward the 1960's model of the DC's position as  linchpin. Moreover, there must be rather more respect for the  voters; they must be offered an option characterized by a clear  break.    [CORRIERE] Is it true that Rete has offered to field Naples  District Attorney Agostino Cordova as a candidate?    [Orlando] I spoke with Mr. Cordova over the telephone 10  days  ago, and I certainly could not discuss such matters. We have  not met or spoken since then.    [CORRIERE] Are you also obsessed with fielding magistrates  as  candidates?    [Orlando] Actually, I am opposed to magistrates' standing as  candidates if they are conducting criminal investigations. Or,  rather, I believe that if a judge wants to engage in active  politics, he must first resign. It would be a sign of the  judiciary's independence, and I will be proposing this in the  progressive forces' negotiations.</p>

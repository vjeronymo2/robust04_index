			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / British MPs released by Somalis Two British members of parliament and an aid worker were released unharmed by kidnappers in Somalia yesterday after being taken hostage late on Wednesday night. The two MPs - Mr Mark Robinson, Conservative member for Somerton and Frome and Mr Tony Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie - were kidnapped at Erigavo in north west Somalia while on a week-long fact-finding mission in the country. Mr Jeff Chinnock, an aid worker from the British charity, Actionaid, had been held with them. All three were freed by the Somali gang yesterday after-noon after Mr Ibrahim Egal, leader of the breakaway region of northwestern Somalia, ann-ounced he would order militiamen to attack the kidnappers if the men were not released. There were reports yesterday that the kidnappers were part of the Mous Ismail sub-clan of the Habr Yunis, which is controlled by rebel militiamen and wanted recognition from the local administration. Mr Robinson, 44, is a junior Foreign Office aide and the parliamentary private secretary to Lady Chalker, minister for overseas development. He has worked for both the UN and the Commonwealth. Since November, Mr Worthington has been the Labour party's foreign affairs spokesman on Africa, the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Fleet buyers sustain car market Car dealers yesterday called on manufacturers to stop setting 'unachievable' sales targets. Their call coincided with statistics showing that private buyers appear to be deserting the new car market in growing numbers, although buoyant fleet business is keeping it above last year's levels. Registrations of new cars in September totalled 144,998, a 6.54 per cent increase from the same month a year ago, according to statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. But registrations to private buyers were down by 4.6 per cent compared with the previous September. The Retail Motor Industry Federation, representing Britain's 7,000 franchised dealers, said last night: 'Consumer confidence is now a major problem inhibiting further recovery.' Registrations attributed to private motorists were up 3.4 per cent for the first nine months, but the gain was entirely in the first half of the year. Registrations by fleet buyers were up 22.3 per cent in September compared with a year ago, bringing the fleet market increase to 16.7 per cent over the first nine months. This helped total new car registrations in the first nine months rise 9.48 per cent from the 1993 level. However, an overall weakening trend in the marketplace is evident in the fact that year-on-year growth in the third quarter was only 3.3 per cent, compared with 14 per cent in the first half. Much of the big third-quarter weakening was accounted for by August, usually the main buying month for private motorists, when the new 'M' plate failed to stop registrations of 452,000 falling below the 500,000 which was widely predicted. Yesterday's statistics showed Ford continuing its market leadership with an improved share of 21.66 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

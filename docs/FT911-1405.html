			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' transactions SELLING continues at Birse Group, the construction and property development concern. Five directors sold in March, and since then the price has held up well, tempting three more directors back to the market. The finance director of Birse has now reduced his holding by more than half. At TIP Europe, the container rental group, selling by two directors earlier in April has not affected the share price adversely and the same two directors have completed further large sales. Tony Reiger, chief executive, has now sold more than half his holding, raising Pounds 285,000. The announcement of interim results from printing group St Ives disclosed sharply lower profits, and was followed by two directors' sales. The shares have traded within a narrow range since the beginning of 1988. The entire executive board of Ossory, the property investment company, took up stock to fund the acquisition of the Bovis associate, Intercity Group. Two directors doubled their holdings. The company forecast a final dividend of 45p. The past two years have seen a considerable amount of selling by directors in Clyde Petroleum, all at higher prices. It is worth noting one purchase by Colin Black, a non-executive director. Last week's reported sale of 2m shares in Surrey Group was incorrect. In fact one director purchased 1m shares at a cost of Pounds 63,750.

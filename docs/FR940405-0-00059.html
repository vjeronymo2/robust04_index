			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Openings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters addressed the proposal to prohibit openings that are exposed and are at least 1/4 inch in diameter before the testing from becoming smaller during testing due to the movement of the seating surface relative to the restraint system as a whole. Most of these commenters supported the proposal. Century requested that openings greater than 1/4 inch in diameter should be permitted to become smaller if the opening is no smaller than 11/2 inches at the conclusion of testing. The commenter did not provide information on why that value would be more appropriate than the proposed value. Since a child or adult seated next to a rotating infant seat can be injured if a hand were caught in an opening whose diameter were reduced to 11/2 inches, Century's request is denied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On a related matter, the agency wishes to clarify a statement in the NPRM. NHTSA indicated a belief in the NPRM that changes in child seat designs (from exposed tubular steel frames to molded plastic ones) might have obviated the safety need for a prohibition against a change in adjustment position. Two commenters did not agree with that statement. The American Academy of Pediatrics said it was not convinced that the risk of injury to a child's fingers has been removed because of the type of material from which restraints are presently made. Mr. Sebring said a return to tubular steel frames could occur in the future, especially since future designs could be patterned after the ``ISO&hyph;FIX,'' a child restraint system that the European community is developing with standardized features for installation in vehicles. Mr. Sebring believes features of the ISO&hyph;FIX design could necessitate a return to tubular steel frames, if the design were eventually used in this country. (He did not specify the features to which he referred.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To clarify the agency's statement, the agency believed that the type of child restraint design made possible through the use of plastic molded frames might have obviated the need for the requirement in question. However, NHTSA has reconsidered this issue. The agency concludes that a requirement protecting against injury to fingers and hands due to shifting child restraint parts is needed to ensure present and future child seat designs do not have dangerous parts that can trap and injure hands and fingers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Printed Instructions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety suggested that NHTSA require that the printed instructions accompanying a rear-facing restraint designed for children with apnea or other breathing problems include information on how these children should be positioned while being transported in a motor vehicle. That suggestion is beyond the scope of the NPRM and has not been adopted. Advocates also suggested that NHTSA require that the printed instructions include information telling the consumer not to impede the ability of the restraint to change adjustment position. The agency concludes that requiring this information for infant restraints that are designed to change adjustment position is within the scope of the rulemaking. The information relates to the real-world operation of the restraint in a crash. This rulemaking, which permits the manufacture of a new type of infant restraint system, rests on NHTSA's conclusion that the new system can afford adequate crash protection provided that the restraint changes adjustment position in a crash. If the movement of the restraint's seating surface were to be impeded by the consumer in some manner, the primary means of crash protection provided by the restraint would be negated. It is crucial that the consumer not impede the movement of the restraint, and be instructed on the matter. Therefore, such instructions will be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule is effective 30 days after its publication date. The shorter than usual effective date is based on the effect of the amendment to relieve design restrictions and facilitate the manufacture of a new type of infant seat. Because the rule relieves a restriction, there is good cause for making it effective in 30 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

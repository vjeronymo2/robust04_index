			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> 14 SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> BURIED TREASURE  </P> <P> "A hoy there, mate! We've gathered many a treasure from foreign shores. . . ."  Who said that? Relax, it's only the electronically wired pirate dummy stationed  by the front door, the first clue that you've embarked on a voyage into the  unusual. Indeed, the nautical treasures waiting to be discovered in The Sea are  wondrous and plentiful -- much like the wonders of the sea itself.  </P> <P> A circus of giant fiberglass dolphins, sharks and whales hangs from the  ceiling. Skeletons of sea mammals adorn the walls. As you navigate your way  through the aisles, you'll encounter shells most landlubbers never knew  existed, scrimshaw, minerals, fossils, ships in bottles and naval relics. If  it's related to the seven seas, you'll find it here -- somewhere. MARK EHRMAN  The Sea, 305 N. Harbor Blvd., San Pedro; (213) 831-1694.  </P></p>

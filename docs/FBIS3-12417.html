Speaking to  the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish  Organizations, he said the massacre at the mosque in Hebron  would be remembered as the Black Friday of the Jewish people.  Rabin was asked if he would accept the PLO's demand for an  international force in the territories to protect the  Palestinians:    [Begin Rabin recording] In the DOP [Declaration of  Principles], it is written international presence but not  international forces presence, and we offer that in the context  of the Gaza-Jericho First, we will not oppose representatives or  international presence of certain individuals in Gaza and  Jericho -- not a force, not armed people. This is part of the  DOP. Whatever we sign, we'll stick to it. All the other  demands I believe that you mentioned -- dismantling of  settlements, no; disarm of all arms from settlers, no. [end  recording]</p>

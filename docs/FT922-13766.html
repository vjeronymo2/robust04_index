			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Bonds: Italians snap up World Bank's Ecu200m offering TWO NEW issues received positive response from investors in the international bond market yesterday, although syndicate officials were unwilling to predict an end to the current uncertain tone of the market. The World Bank launched a Ecu200m 10-year floating-rate note issue, lead-managed by UBS Phillips and Drew. The paper pays  5/8 per cent less than the three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), but was re-offered to investors at 99.85. At this level the discounted margin was 0.57 per cent under Libor. The paper appealed to investors anxious to buy a floating-rate asset at a time of growing uncertainty over the future direction of interest rates. However, most of the bonds were snapped up by Italian investors, who pay no withholding tax on bonds issued by the World Bank and other supranational bodies of which Italy is a member. The syndicate of banks selling the issue was half composed of Italian banks, with Credito Italiano joint lead manager. Italian syndicate officials said uncertainty following parliamentary elections in Italy this week, and persistent speculation about a revaluation of the lira within the European exchange rate mechanism, added to the attraction of a floating-rate investment denominated in a foreign currency. Buying by Italian investors created a shortage of paper in the market. This was only partly relieved by a decision to increase the size of the transactions from Ecu150m to Ecu200m. By the close of trading, the lead manager was quoting the bonds at 100.25 bid, well above the re-offer price. Elsewhere, Toyota Credit Canada, a finance arm of the Japanese automotive company, launched a well-received CDollars 125m five-year issue. The deal, lead-managed by Wood Gundy, was slightly smaller than many syndicate officials had expected, suggesting a cautious approach to the market following the poor performance of other Canadian dollar issues this week. For example, Province of British Columbia's Dollars 300m five-year deal, launched on Monday at a yield spread of 54 basis points over Canadian government bonds, was yesterday trading on a yield spread of around 58 basis points. The 9 per cent Toyota bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.50, where the yield is 48 basis points more than Canadian government paper. The borrower carries a triple-A credit rating, higher than British Columbia. Participants in the deal reported good buying from retail and institutional investors hoping that the yield spread would tighten over time. Outstanding four-year bonds from the same borrower were yesterday trading in the secondary market at a yield spread of 25 basis points. Buying was easily enough to support the modest size of yesterday's issue, and the launch yield spread held throughout the day despite a rally in the Canadian bond market.</p>

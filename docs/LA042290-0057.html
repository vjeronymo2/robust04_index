			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIRE PROTECTION  </P> <P> Your recent report of the De Luz annexation by the North County Fire Protection  District ("De Luz Fights Annexation Bid by Fire District," March 31) leads to  the inescapable conclusion that this annexation is favored by Chief Andrew  Vanderlaan, while the rest of the community is being dragged along kicking and  screaming.  </P> <P> This, in fact, is not the case.  </P> <P> While a segment of the area is opposed to the annexation, the dissenters were  unable to muster sufficient protests to prevent the question from going to the  ballot.  </P> <P> The fact is the majority of the De Luz residents are in favor of the  annexation, which will provide full-year fire protection in accordance with  provisions that evolved after two years of negotiations for a reasonable  response time at a reasonable cost.  </P> <P> HERBERT SULSKY  </P> <P> Fallbrook  </P></p>

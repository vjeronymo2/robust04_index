			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VAEZ INJURES KNEE IN OCC VICTORY  </P> <P> Despite losing its leading rusher, Orange Coast College cruised to a 34-7  victory over San Diego Mesa in a Mission Conference football game Saturday at  OCC.  </P> <P> Quarterback Greg Angelovic completed 16 of 23 passes for 179 yards and three  touchdowns to lead the Pirates (4-1 overall and 3-1 in conference play). But  the afternoon started disastrously for running back Mike Vaez and OCC.  </P> <P> Vaez ran 15 yards on OCC's first play, but a helmet hit his right knee as he  was tackled. The play was nullified for illegal motion, and Vaez was finished  for the game and most likely the season. He spent the rest of the first half  with ice on his injured knee, then was taken to a hospital for further  examination.  </P> <P> Vaez came into the game as the second-leading community college rusher in  Orange County with 454 yards.  </P> <P> "It kind of taints the win, " OCC Coach Bill Workman said. "We're talking major  reconstructive surgery at this point. That's the early report anyway."  </P> <P> With Vaez out, fullback Jason McGehee handled most of the running. He had 94  yards and two touchdowns in the first half as OCC opened a 20-0 lead. He  finished with 110 yards in 22 carries and had three catches for 52 yards.  </P> <P> Mark Craig led OCC receivers with seven catches for 101 yards and two  touchdowns. Craig and Angelovic combined on scoring passes of 12 and nine  yards.  </P> <P> OCC outgained San Diego Mesa, 441-227. Mesa is 1-3, 2-3. STEVE KRESAL  </P></p>

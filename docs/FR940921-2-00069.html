The licensee's authority to operate DPR&hyph;45 was terminated by license Amendment No. 56, dated August 4, 1987. The licensee is authorized to possess but not to operate the La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor (LACBWR) in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The facility is located on the licensee's site located 19 miles south of La Crosse, Wisconsin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its Order (Decommissioning Order) of August 7, 1991, the NRC directed DPC to decommission the reactor facility in accordance with its Decommissioning Plan and the Commission's regulations. This action was taken in response to the licensee's application for authorization to decommission the facility, dated December 21, 1987, as revised February 22, 1988, September 9, 1988, September 30, 1988, January 26, 1989, March 28, 1989, June 6, 1989, October 3, 1989, July 25, 1990, May 10, 1991, and July 25, 1991. Neither the August 7, 1991, Decommissioning Order, which authorized the licensee to decommission the reactor facility, nor the approved Decommissioning Plan, contained an approved procedure that would allow the licensee to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Decommissioning Plan; or (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The licensee, in its letters of August 2, and August 5, 1994, requested the NRC to modify the August 7, 1991, Decommissioning Order to allow DPC to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Decommissioning Plan; and (ii) conduct tests and experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, without prior NRC approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee, as other licensees of both operating facilities and facilities in the process of being decommissioned, continues to discover facility improvements which, if implemented, would either reduce facility operating costs, improve facility safety margins, or are necessary for continued operation/maintenance of the facility. Further, a large number of these licensee-initiated facility improvements, if implemented, would neither increase the probability of an accident occurring, increase the consequences of an accident, reduce safety margins, or create a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated. Thus, in these circumstances, for the NRC to require a licensee to first receive NRC approval prior to the implementation of facility improvements that meets the above criteria would cause an unnecessary burden on the licensee. The NRC has included such change procedures in recently-issued plant specific decommissioning orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee has committed, prior to making any changes to its Decommissioning Plan, to apply the safety and environmental review procedure specified below, which is similar to the safety review procedure specified in 10 CFR 50.59. This commitment is consistent with the flexibility under &sect;50.59 afforded to a licensee authorized to operate a facility and other Decommissioning Orders issued by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 50.59(a)(1) allows a holder of a license authorizing operation of a production or a utilization facility to: (i) Make changes in the facility or procedures as described in the Safety Analysis Report; and (ii) conduct tests or experiments not described in the Safety Analysis Report, without NRC approval, provided the proposed action does not consist of a change to the facility technical specifications or an unreviewed safety question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I find that the licensee's commitments as set forth in its letters of August 2, and supplemented by letter dated August 5, 1994, are acceptable and conclude that with these commitments the safety of the plant is reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health, safety, and interest require that the licensee's commitments in its August 2, and August 5, 1994, letters be confirmed by this Order. The licensee has consented to the issuance of this Order.

Notwithstanding the above, a reduction in site staffing levels below the minimum number for any group or area shown on the organization chart (Fig. 6.1) in the LACBWR Decommissioning Plan, or a change in the reporting relationships for the Plant Manager must be submitted to the NRC as specified in 10 CFR 50.4, and receive NRC approval prior to implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A proposed change, test or experiment shall be deemed to involve an unreviewed safety question (i) if the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment necessary for SAFSTOR previously evaluated in either the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) or the Decommissioning Plan may be increased, or (ii) if a possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the FSAR or Decommissioning Plan may be created, or (iii) if the margin of safety as defined in the basis for any TS is reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) The licensee shall maintain records of changes in the facility and of changes in procedures made pursuant to this procedure, to the extent that these changes constitute changes in the facility or procedures as described in either the FSAR or the Decommissioning Plan. The licensee shall also maintain records of tests and experiments performed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section. These records must include a written safety evaluation containing the basis for the determination that the changes, tests or experiments do not involve an unreviewed safety question, or a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The licensee shall annually submit, as specified in 10 CFR 50.4, a report containing a brief description of any changes, tests, and experiments, including a summary of the safety evaluation of each. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The licensee shall maintain records of changes in the facility until the date of termination of the license and shall maintain the records of changes in procedures and records of tests and experiments for a period of three years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the licensee desires (1) a change in the TS, or (2) to make a change in the facility or procedures described in the Decommissioning Plan or conduct tests or experiments not described in the Decommissioning Plan, which involve an unreviewed safety question, a change in the TS, or a significant environmental impact not previously evaluated, the licensee shall submit an application for amendment of its license pursuant to 10 CFR 50.90. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- The State Office for  Atomic Safety (SUJB) is not ruling out a new round of talks on  construction authorization for the Temelin nuclear power plant  in south Bohemia, because it does not expect the necessary  documents on a new security system to arrive in time, MLADA  FRONTA DNES writes today.    Karel Bohm from the SUJB told the paper that unless the  Czech  Energy Utility (CEZ) submitted documents on the effect of  Westinghouse technology on nuclear safety, the SUJB would not  permit the installation of the safety equipment. The  construction project envisages the installation to be realized  in mid-1994.    "CEZ will probably not be capable of submitting the document  in an acceptable form in time," Bohm says.    He said that Russian-type safety equipment should be used  for  the Russian-type reactors in Temelin, and that the  reconsideration of Temelin construction can be initiated only by  the local district administration in Ceske Budejovice if the  Westinghouse equipment application would substantially change  the original project, Bohm says.    Westinghouse has been chosen to replace the Russian  technology in an effort to raise the plant's safety.    Construction at Temelin started in 1986 but later was  suspended. In March 1993 the Czech Government gave its final  approval to the project, which has met with strong criticism  from some officials and environmentalists both at home and in  neighboring Austria, which is strongly anti-nuclear.    The first Temelin reactor is to be operating at full  capacity  by mid-1995 and the second in 1996. The completed plant is  expected to generate 2,000 MW.    Czech Environment Minister Frantisek Benda has also  mentioned  the possibility of reconsidering the Temelin project. On Monday  [11 April] he warned he would not allow the plant to go into  operation unless the planned "nuclear law" was adopted. The law  is to define the responsibilities of the plant's operator and  deal with ways of storing burnt-out fuel.    Benda's criticism of Temelin led Austrian Chancellor Franz  Vranitzky to note yesterday that debate about bringing the plant  into operation was far from over even in the Czech Republic.    Once again he repeated Austria's offer to cooperate with  Prague in the development of alternative power sources.</p>

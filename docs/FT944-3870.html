			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Books: From Elvis to punk - Nostalgia rules as Peter Aspden tunes into the year's pop books As if sensing its own decline, pop music is delving more and more into the past to discover its true worth; and nowhere can this be seen more clearly than in its literature. The pick of these year's pop books fittingly tackle two of the genre's greatest legends: Elvis Presley and The Beatles. Peter Guralnick's Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley (Little, Brown Pounds 17.99) chronicles just a small part of his subject's life - up to his mother's death in 1958 - but how refreshing it is to see an author concentrating on Presley's formative, classic years rather than dwell morbidly on his decline. Guralnick's account is a welcome corrective to those who believe that Elvis was just a good-looking boy who was in the right place at the right time. He was also, notwithstanding his youth, an immensely dedicated and self-confident artist whose perfectionism exasperated colleagues; the rough spontaneity of a classic like 'Hound Dog', for example, required no fewer than 30 studio takes before the singer declared his satisfaction. The book also evokes marvellously the atmosphere of rural America in the 1950s. Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head: The Beatles' Records and the Sixties (Fourth Estate, Pounds 15) also makes the point that success and super-stardom were not achieved with the apparent effortlessness which the group's best songs managed to convey. His track-by-track analysis, unafraid of explaining seemingly trivial points with quite complex musical terminology, will prove irresistible to any fan; equally impressive, however, is the subtle, elegaic essay at the front of the book which is one of the most convincing cultural analyses of recent British musical history which you could ever hope to read. Elsewhere, we have had the usual mix of embarrassingly hagiographic biographies and serious, polytechnic-lecturer theses which attempt to locate the importance of popular music in society-at-large. These latter affairs, on the whole joyless and ponderously-written, are a result of the spectacular growth of subjects such as cultural studies in higher education, which legitimises doctoral dissertations on . . . well, just about anything really. One of the best of these books is George Lipsitz's Dangerous Crossroads: Popular Music, Postmodernism and the Poetics of Place (Verso, Pounds 18.95), a collection of essays which looks at the subject of ethnicity in music. The mix of different cultural soundtracks is one of the most characteristic features of today's music, and most of these pieces are intelligent and well-conceived. Which is more than can be said of most of the biographies on offer. Once more, the goodies are the oldies. Ray Coleman's Clapton: the Authorised Biography (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 15.99), an easy enough read, perfectly reflects the man's current musical output: pleasant and unchallenging. The subject of Jeremy Reed's Waiting for the Man: A Biography of Lou Reed (Picador, Pounds 14.99) could never be accused of that, but he has become increasingly difficult to take seriously, scarcely deserving of the iconic status ascribed by the author (no relation). The most pretentious offering around is Ray Davies's X-Ray: The Unauthorised Autobiography (Viking, Pounds 16), in which a fictitious 'journalist' gets Davies to open up on his life in the 1960s, although there are some nuggets in the over-confused narrative. A more entertaining account of that decade's excesses is provided by Marianne Faithfull and her co-author David Dalton in Faithfull (Michael Joseph, Pounds 15.99), written with good humour and a certain amount of battered dignity. Moving into (slightly) more recent history, Carl Magnus Palm's Abba: The Complete Recording Sessions (Century, Pounds 12.95) is a good example of a pop act, notwithstanding phenomenal sales and even a cult retro following, being unable to withstand detailed critical attention. Palm has done his homework, however, and some of the early pictures are hilarious. A man who seems to keep up with the feelings and desires of each successive generation is Neil Young; The Rolling Stone Files (Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 15.99) is a revealing and poignant collection of articles from the magazine's archives, and a fascinating insight into the changing face of rock journalism over the past 25 years. But then again, time and pop music have a strange relationship. Delving into George Gimarc's Punk Diary 1970-1979: An Eyewitness Record of the Punk Decade (Vintage, Pounds 8.99), I was reminded that there were just four years between the release of the Beatles' final album, Let It Be, and the first Ramones gig. To listen to the two groups' music, you would put them 100 years apart; but things moved fast in those days. If nobody comes up with any bright ideas, expect both a punk and a Beatles revival for 1995, and expect them to be written about in yet more loving detail.</p>

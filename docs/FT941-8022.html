			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Hanging rejected by larger majority MPs rejected a demand for the return of hanging for all murderers aged over 18 by a large majority of 244 (403-159) in a free vote in the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. It was the biggest setback suffered by the pro-hanging lobby since capital punishment was abolished in 1965, and in effect removes the issue from the political agenda at Westminster. An attempt to amend the criminal justice and public order bill to provide for the reintroduction of hanging for all murders of police officers was defeated by a majority of 197 (383-186). The votes followed a blunt warning by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, that miscarriages of justice could result in innocent parties being hanged. In a mainly low-key debate, advocates of the restoration of capital punishment highlighted the growing number of elderly people being murdered in their own homes. They also cited the rise in the number of police officers killed while investigating robberies and other crimes. Mr Howard, who had consistently voted for the return of the death penalty until 1990, described how the overturning of the convictions for terrorist pub-bombings of the so-called 'Birmingham six' had changed his mind. Acknowledging support among the police for the view that criminals were now more ready to use firearms in pursuit of crime, he reaffirmed his acceptance of the need for a strong deterrent for the murder of police officers. Mr Howard stressed: 'Those responsible serve as a minimum 20 years in prison. Many will serve much longer than that.'</p>

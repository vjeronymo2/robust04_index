			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Southern Electric to market gas Southern Electric and Phillips Petroleum Company UK have agreed to enter into a 50/50 joint venture to acquire and market gas. Initially that will be gas released by tender from British Gas. But over time it is expected that the joint ven-ture will market gas from other sources, including fields in which Phillips has an in-terest. Entry into the gas supply market is consistent with Southern Electric's strategy to increase its non-regulated businesses and to become a leading energy utility.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmers in US exact high price for Bush support THE US administration, which has been showering money on US farmers in a bid to win votes in the crucial Mid-western states, is finding that the price of their support may be more than the president can afford. Mr Bush's most dramatic offering to his farm constituents was his announcement earlier this month that subsidies would be made available under the Export Enhancement Programme for an additional 1.1bn bushels of wheat. The announcement, which outraged other wheat-producing countries, came one week after leaders of national wheat organisations met Mr Edward Madigan, the US agriculture secretary, to complain about the EEP programme. Mr Madison Angell, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, said: 'We told the secretary that action was needed to get markets moving in the right direction. Our prices have dropped nearly Dollars 1 a bushel since the beginning of the year, and the government's passive use of the EEP is one of the problems.' The initiative was extended to 28 countries, but wheat lobbyists remained unsatisfied. In its newsletter, US Wheat Associates said it was 'unfortunate' that countries such as Mexico, Indonesia and Colombia had not been included. They said the president was 'bowing' to Canadian and Australian requests to leave these markets 'out of US wheat farmers' reach'. The White House has had other goodies for the farmers. On Monday it announced a Dollars 1.15bn food assistance package to Russia, including Dollars 250m in aid and Dollars 900m in credit guarantees to the end of February. Farm lobbyists had requested Dollars 1bn in credit guarantees. President Bush has also made available Dollars 755m in emergency funding for farm disasters for winter grain producers to cover 1992 harvest losses. That might have been enough before Hurricane Andrew wreaked havoc upon Florida and Louisiana, where damage estimates are at least Dollars 3bn. Meanwhile, some farmers are less than enthusiastic about the North American Free Trade Agreement. The fruit and vegetable growers in Florida failed to receive exemption from the pact.</p>

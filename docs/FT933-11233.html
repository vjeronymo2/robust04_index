			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Benefits of being open: Two of a kind / How secret service chiefs are coping with the post-cold war world Behind the thick spectacles of Mr Arthur Docters van Leeuwen, the head of the Dutch internal security service, there glints professional sharpness, and just a hint of well-educated menace. He describes a 'friendly talk' he held with a well-known KGB defector. 'You might,' he confides, 'like to call it an interrogation.' In the solid brown headquarters of the Binnenlandse Veiligheidsdienst (BVD) in The Hague, Mr Docters explains how his employees need aptitude both for unearthing information, and for turning it to profitable use. These are attributes wholeheartedly embraced by Britain's MI5, on which the BVD was modelled when it was set up in 1949. However, BVD employees are also required to espouse a most un-MI5-like characteristic: attachment to openness. Mr Docters, a portly and philosophical 48-year-old career civil servant, passionately believes his service must be transparent and accountable. 'If you want to sustain the democratic process, you have to be part of it. If you don't properly meet this requirement, you cease to exist. 'I abhor the idea of having an elite which is in the know about the dark side of society, which is entirely separate from ordinary people who know nothing about it.' The BVD maintains secrecy over individual operations - ranging from countering organised crime, terrorism and espionage, to surveillance of foreign nationals. It needs to be both clandestine and accountable. This is a difficult balance but a manageable one, says Mr Docters, who has been BVD chief since 1989. 'We have a lot of room for manoeuvre. Dutch society is very open. We are easy people to deal with. But underneath we are quite security-minded.' Openness can enhance effectiveness. 'The truth is a flimsy thing - you cannot coerce people into giving it. If you pay them, they will tell you only part of it. People must want to tell you. So you must invest in building up this public spirit.' He describes how a manager from a Dutch company came forward with information over the Iraqi super-gun. 'We were the first western intelligence service to produce pictures of how this equipment was engineered.' Benefits can come in other ways, too. 'Our people may go out in the evening and ask an elderly couple if they can use their bedroom for surveillance. If citizens do not know what the security service is doing, then you cannot expect co-operation from the public,' says Mr Docters. The BVD has about 600 employees and an annual budget of Fl 65m (Pounds 23m). It issues an annual report (although not as fact-crammed as that of Germany's BfV security service), and is responsible to a parliamentary control committee. The BVD's priorities have been 'dramatically' changed by the end of the cold war, Mr Docters says. Its range of activities has increased - and, in fields like terrorism, the need for international co-operation has never been greater. 'There is a lot of movement of terrorist groups across Europe - and the Netherlands has good facilities for moving in and out. If there is a place in the world with revolutionary activity, you will find traces of it in Holland.' The BVD maintains links with 40 other security services, especially those of its EC neighbours. Like the BfV's Mr Eckart Werthebach, Mr Docters knows Mrs Stella Rimington, the director-general of MI5, well. 'This (international) co-operation is essential. Only about 5 per cent of our problems come solely from inside the Netherlands - the rest has some international connection.' The BVD maintains its counter-espionage role - geared nowadays to combating Russian desire for intelligence in the economic and technological fields. 'We still don't trust the Russians because they state time and again that they are continuing to gather intelligence.' Another preoccupation is organised crime, for which the BVD was given responsibility three years ago. He backs the bid by Germany's BfV to be granted powers in this area - a move which would give the Netherlands a clear German counterpart for joint action. 'It would be wise for every country to give their security services a mandate on this front. Organised crime can be beaten, but this needs international co-operation.' He admits that, in this field, the BVD is short of information. 'We know something about the cartels involved - South American, Turkish, Mediterranean. We have some facts - involving Italy, for instance. We do not have a good map. But we can acquire one.' Mr Docters outlines one specific reason why intelligence services need to be involved in organised crime. 'There are people who are prepared to talk to the security services, knowing that the case will not come before a judge and their identity will never come out in the open. This sort of procedure has already proved its worth in counter-espionage and anti-terrorism.' The BVD's operations against organised crime demonstrate how it descends into areas outside the juridical environment. 'Our countries (the west) live by the rule of law. But we create organs which are, at least, on the border of the law. The fierce reactions you sometimes have in public life stem from this paradox. People don't like paradoxes.' Mr Docters believes the Netherlands has found a way out of the paradox: his service can operate effectively only because there is a national consensus that it should do just that. This is the third of an occasional series on EC personalities</p>

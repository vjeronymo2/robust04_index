			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Movenpick omits payout despite return to black MOVENPICK, the troubled Swiss hotel and restaurant group, recovered from loss to make a small profit last year but the dividend is to be passed for the second year running. The directors are also proposing share splits and a rights offer of share purchase options that, if exercised, would raise nominal capital by SFr1.9bn (Dollars 1.3bn) or about 4 per cent. Consolidated net income in 1992 was SFr6.5m, compared with a loss of SFr3.6m. Sales were up 10.1 per cent to SFr1.23bn. Cash flow rose to SFr86.9m from SFr70.1m as a result of inventory reductions. Movenpick said it passed its dividend because of the expansion projects it had in hand and the need to establish a healthy degree of self-financing. The once fast-growing group stumbled in the late 1980s under the direction of Mrs Jutta Prager, wife of Mr Ueli Prager, the founder. Mr Prager resumed charge in mid-1991 and then early last year sold his controlling stake to Mr August von Finck, a Munich businessman. The SFr500 bearer shares and SFr100 registered shares will be split 10 for one with a view to improving their stock market liquidity. The final terms of the options rights issues will be revealed in two weeks. Movenpick said yesterday that the options would be priced at about SFr30 per bearer share, SFr3 per participation certificate and SFr6.40 per registered share.</p>

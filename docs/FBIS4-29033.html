			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The government, expecting  that the tension over North Korea's withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will drag on, has  begun monitoring the prices of basic consumer goods such as  rice, ramyon (instant noodles) and jewelry, as well as the stock  market, every day. No hoarding of daily necessities has yet  been observed, but the supply shortages and resulting runaway  inflation expected from a steep escalation in tension would  throw the economy into confusion, officials said Wednesday. To  prepare for an emergency, the government has started checking  fluctuations of consumer prices and the supply and demand of key  consumer goods on a daily basis, they added.    The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is  monitoring the prices of rice and other farm products, the  Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Korea movements in the  financial markets such as interest rates, withdrawals, share  prices and foreign investment, the ministry of trade, industry  and energy the prices of manufactured goods, and the Ministry of  Transportation foreign tourist arrivals.    No unusual price movements for such items as rice and ham  have been detected, the Economic Planning Board said.    The government has started daily price checks in preparation  for unexpected developments after North Korea bolted from the  IAEA, but nothing unusual has been observed so far, a board  official said.    The government's daily checks come as tensions are expected  to rise in the wake of North Korea's abrupt withdrawal, he  added. In case the situation worsens and the economy weakens,  the government will set in motion an emergency system.    Purchases of food, fuel, first-aid drugs, flashlights and  candles for emergencies are increasing and some prices are on  the rise.</p>

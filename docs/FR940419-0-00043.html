Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications Commission, Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 604, a final regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and is presented below. It is available for public viewing as part of the full text of this decision, which may be obtained from the Commission or its copy contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 603 of title 5, United States Code, 5 U.S.C. 603, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252. Written comments on the proposals in the Notice, including the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, were requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Need for and Purpose of Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act. The rules adopted herein will carry out the intent of Congress to establish a uniform regulatory framework for all mobile services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While all the parties recognize that this rulemaking will impose new legal obligations on licensees whose regulatory status has changed from private to commercial as a result of the new legislation and the actions we have taken in this Order, a number of parties propose that licensees should be able to offer both commercial and private radio service on the same system and under a single license. As a result of these comments, we have adopted these proposals. As a result of other comments, we have made modifications to other proposals as appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Significant Alternatives Considered <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have reduced the burdens wherever possible. In an effort to reduce the burdens on small entities, for example, we will not impose any tariff filing obligations. In addition, we emphasize that the three-year transition rules adopted in this Order will allow existing licensees that are subject to reclassification as CMRS providers to continue to be regulated as private until August 10, 1996. This three-year period will ensure an orderly transition for all reclassified private licensees that are small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Synopsis of the Second Report and Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 23, 1993, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice), 58 FR 53169 (October 14, 1993), in this proceeding in which we sought comment on: (1) The definitional issues raised in the Budget Act; (2) which existing mobile services and future mobile services should be classified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' under the statute and which should be classified as ``private mobile radio services''; and (3) which provisions of Title II of the Communications Act should not be applied to CMRS. We received 76 comments and 52 reply comments in response to the Notice in this proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summarizing the actions the Commission has taken in this Order, the following points highlight the decisions made to implement the objectives of Congress in amending section 332 of the Act. First, the Order gives a comprehensive scope to the term ``mobile service,'' including within the definition all public mobile services, private land mobile service, mobile satellite services, and most marine and aviation wireless services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the Order defined the term ``commercial mobile radio service'' in a manner that covers a significant portion of services provided by mobile carriers because of the conclusion that such a definition best serves the congressional purpose of making mobile services widely available at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms in a competitive marketplace. There are three prongs to the CMRS definition: The service must be provided for profit, it must be interconnected to the public switched network, and it must be available to the public or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public. Under the first element of the definition, the Order provides that ``for profit'' includes any mobile service that is provided with the intent of receiving compensation or monetary gain. In the case of services that are not-for-profit, except for a portion of excess capacity that the licensee offers with the intent of receiving compensation, the service will be treated as for-profit to the extent of such excess capacity activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the second element of the CMRS definition, the Order concludes that a mobile service offers interconnected service if it allows subscribers to send or receive messages to or from anywhere on the public switched network (PSN). Both direct and indirect interconnection with the PSN satisfy this criterion, as well as the use of store-and-forward technology. The Order also gives an expansive meaning to the term public switch network, concluding that the network includes the facilities of common carriers that participate in the North American Numbering Plan and having switching capability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

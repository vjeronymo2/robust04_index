			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The fifth round of Japan-U.S. economic talks on  insurance will begin in Washington on 10 January. Japan and the  United States are scheduled to bring a conclusion to this issue  by the time that the Japan-U.S. summit talks are held on 11  February. However, Japan-U.S. talks on this issue are still at  odds. As it has done for other commercial sectors, the United  States has been calling on Japan to establish a "numerical  target" for opening up Japan's insurance market despite the  Japanese Government's rejection of this. In addition, the U.S.  Government has also called on Japan to delay its liberalization  of some areas of Japan's insurance markets. In response, Japan  has reacted strongly against the U.S. Government's call,  stressing that the U.S. Government's call runs counter to the  principle of talks that emphasize the "promotion of market  opening." Therefore, such resistance by Japan has further  increased the uncertainty of the future of the talks.    Since the first talks in Hawaii in September 1993,  Japan-U.S.  negotiations on insurance have been held once a month.  Originally, Japan and the United States were scheduled to reach  certain agreements in the upcoming talks. However, "in the past  negotiations, both the Japanese and the U.S. delegates have just  repeatedly stressed their own positions, and thus no concrete  progress has been made so far in the talks" (according to a  Finance Ministry source). For that reason, it seems that  working-level meetings will be held sometime this month.    A Japanese official involved in the negotiations has said  that it is still questionable why high priority is given to the  negotiations on insurance together with government procurement  and auto and auto parts among the nearly 20 sector-by-sector  negotiations. A prevailing view is that, because it had been  said that a draft bill on revising the law concerning the  insurance sector would be submitted to the Diet as early as  January 1994 by the Insurance Council, the United States tried  to reflect its demands in the bill. However, the U.S. hopes have  not been met so far because the council is falling behind in its  work on drafting the bill.    Underlying the delay in the negotiations on insurance is  Japan's strong opposition to the U.S. calls for allowing foreign  insurance companies to join an organization composed of Japanese  insurance companies and delaying the liberalization of the  Japanese insurance market in the areas where foreign-capital  insurance companies occupy a dominant position.    As one of its requests, the United States has called for  freezing the liberalization of the so-called "third sector" of  the insurance market -- which is coverage for casualty, disease,  and nursing losses.    In the third sector of the insurance market, foreign  insurers, including U.S. insurers, account for a greater market  share. But a report submitted by the Insurance Council in 1992  calls for allowing life insurers access the nonlife insurance  market and nonlife insurers to make inroads into the life  insurance market.    Taking into consideration foreign insurance companies, the  report also calls for liberalizing by stages the third sector of  the insurance market. The United States, however, has called  for freezing for about five years the liberalization of the  third sector.    The United States insists that, "because Japan's insurance  market is closed to foreign firms, basic types of insurance such  as fire insurance and auto insurance should be liberalized  first. In this sense, it is not reasonable to single out the  issue of liberalizing the third sector of the market." However,  Japan intends to not change its stand of opposing the U.S. calls  by saying that the United State's calls to shelve the  liberalization of the third sector while calling for opening  other areas of the market is an "opportunistic attitude."    Of course, work on reviewing Japan's insurance system has  been under way based on the requests of the United States.  Currently, foreign-capital insurers are not allowed to obtain  membership in the Marine and Fire Insurance Association of  Japan, Inc. [MFIA], but the MFIA is working on revising its  articles of association with the aim of permitting them to join  the MFIA. Moreover, the Housing Loan Corporation, in paying  attention to foreign-capital insurers, took measures last fall  to give foreign-capital firms more chances to win fire insurance  contracts.</p>

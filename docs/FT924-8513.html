			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Saab says it will need capital injection soon SWEDEN'S Saab Automobile says it will need a capital injection from its owners, Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, within the next three months. The group says the injection, added to the cost-cutting measures which it announced on Monday and the planned launch of its new model next year, should guarantee its return to profitability. 'These three measures combined will ensure that we do not need to return to our owners for further help,' a spokesman said. He declined to quantify the injection, but indicated that both Saab-Scania and GM had agreed to it. In June 1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr5.5bn (Dollars 924m) into Saab, but the contribution this time is not expected to be so large. On Monday Saab announced 2,000 job losses as part of a wide-ranging cost-cutting programme to save SKr2bn. It also disclosed a loss of SKr1.3bn for the first nine months, and said it was heading for a deficit of at least SKr2bn for the full year, its fourth consecutive year of losses.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGSLEY'S ENGLISH  </P> <P> Merle Rubin's fulmination against Kingsley Amis -- so rabid as to undercut  anything objective she might have had to say -- seems to me less her fault  (after all, she need not like his work; though she has little excuse for being  so grossly misinformed about him and the critical work done on him).  </P> <P> It was clearly an editorial decision to assign this novel to someone who has  never liked the particular writer ("overrated"); who clearly . . . pities those  less adept ("the befuddled middle-of-the-road reviewer"), and who confuses a  review with an ad hominem attack on the novelist and on all those benighted and  misguided souls ("liberals whose literary standards are . . . debased") who  might find him to have talent.  </P> <P> I had dinner one Boxing Day with an ex-wife of Amis (she is a first-rate  novelist in her own right), and she didn't feel it necessary to attack this  man. Why, I wonder, does Rubin?  </P> <P> RONALD C. DIXON  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA  </P></p>

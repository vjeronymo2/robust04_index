Our Correspondent Reports From Tajikistan"]    [Text] Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of  defense, has visited the area where the Collective Peacekeeping  Forces [CPF] and Russian Border Guards serving on the  Tajik-Afghan border are conducting exercises. On arrival in the  exercise area he joined the Uzbek and Tajik defense ministers  and the Republic of Tajikistan leaders attending the exercises  to hear a report by Colonel General Boris Pyankov, commander of  the CPF in Tajikistan, who is charge of the exercises.    The exercise schedule first involved halting an "attacking  enemy grouping" jointly with border guard defenders. A  defensive engagement was conducted in collaboration with the air  force and artillery and tank subunits. Over 1,000 targets,  along with around 60 decoys, were set up on the battlefield for  the air force and artillery. According to plan the attacking  enemy first came under fire from three artillery batteries,  three mortar batteries, and three "Uragan" rocket-launcher  batteries. The ground forces' operations had helicopter support.    Once the "enemy" had been halted, it was subjected to a  20-minute bombardment involving all forces and means of  firepower. In addition, helicopters dropped a reinforced company  by parachute into an area of possible "enemy" breakthrough.  Then came a counterattack with the support of artillery  subunits and ground-attack aviation.    In the course of the exercises their commander, Col. Gen.  Boris Pyankov, commented on the actions of the CPF, who  demonstrated high combat teamwork and coordination, staunchness  in defense, and swiftness in offense.    At the end of the exercises the defense minister emphasized  that the troops' actions merited an overall high assessment. On  the basis of obervers' reports, artillery and mortar subunits  received an excellent rating. The rest were rated "good." It  must be stressed that the exercises involved long-range  aviation, ground-attack aircraft, and fighters, which provided  the area with air cover. Observers report that over 50 percent  of the targets, around 100 of which were mobile, were hit during  the exercises.    The thorough engineering preparation of the exercise area  must be pointed out. Within a short space of time the troops  equipped a defense area and fully prepared the training zone.  Army Gen. Pavel Grachev pointed to the increased proficiency of  the Russian troops and the Uzbek and Tajik troop subunits. He  once again underlined that these exercises were planned and are  in no way connected with a show of strength, a charge that  people are trying to level at the CPF. After the exercises he  thanked all the personnel who took part in the exercises, handed  out orders and medals, and also issued an order awarding early  promotions to a large number of officers. Pavel Grachev then  went to Parkharskiy Rayon, where an epidemic of toxipathic  hepatitis broke out in 1993. He gave doctors there 5,000  disposable syringes and met with local residents, who thanked  Russia's defense minister for his attention and concern.</p>

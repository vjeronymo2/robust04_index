			<p>BFN     [Text] A prominent IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] youth  leader, Mr. Jeff Sibiya, was killed in a shootout between the  defense force and hostel residents at Katlehong early this  morning. Coetzee Zietsman and cameraman Cedric Muller filed  this report:    [Begin recording] [Zietsman] Trouble broke out in Katlehong  early this morning. Two people died in a shootout between the  defense force and residents of the Buyafuti hostel. Soldiers  raided the hostel in search of weapons. They were allegedly  fired upon and returned fire. Jeff Sibiya of the IFP Youth  League died here and according to the SADF [South African  Defense Force] he was caught in the crossfire. Troops urged  upset residents to remain calm, but the message wasn't well  received. The situation remained tense and soldiers kept a  strong presence. Later Mr. Themba Khoza, the Transvaal  organizer of the IFP, arrived on the scene to assess the  situation and to talk to hostel dwellers. Weapons were carried  openly. Mr. Khoza rejected the SADF's version of the incident.    [Khoza] It is not just untrue, but lies.    [Zietsman] Colonel C.P. du Toit, defense force commander in  the area does not agree.    [Du Toit in Afrikaans] My facts are that shots were fired on  troops and we returned fire in a disciplined manner. [end  recording]</p>

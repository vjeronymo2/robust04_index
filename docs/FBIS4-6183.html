			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 19 (AFP) -- The ultra-left Khmer  Rouge [KR] said they had recaptured on Tuesday their former  headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, ousting government  troops which had seized the strategic town only a month earlier.    "We took our base back at 12:45 P.M., captured eight  government tanks in good condition and destroyed seven," the  Khmer Rouge's spokesman in Phnom Penh said, adding that casualty  figures had not yet been confirmed.    The spokesman said 3,000 guerrillas attacked and forced back  some 7,000 government troops.    "I am very excited to hear we can get back our houses," he  said.    Co-Defence Minister Tie Banh admitted that the Khmer Rouge  had recaptured part of Pailin.    "But remember Pailin is a very big place," he said.    "Some of our troops are countering the attack and there is  fighting going on there," he added.    Tie Banh said the government had only six tanks in operation  at Pailin and questioned how the guerrillas could talk about 15  tanks.    Other military officials said the situation in Pailin was  not  yet clear.    "We should wait until tomorrow," one general said.    " The nature of military operations is like that, there is  pushing up and down," he said.    The Cambodian Army seized Pailin on March 19, claiming a  body  blow to the guerrillas' opposition to the government that  emerged from the UN-organised elections in Cambodia last May.    Pailin is a town near the Thai border that has been in the  guerrillas' zone of influence for years. Its ruby mines and  rich forests of teak have provided the Khmer Rouge with a huge  source of income.    Experts agreed that the government's seizure of Pailin was  of  symbolic weight, but questioned whether the Phnom Penh forces  would be able to -- or even should -- hold on to the strategic  site.    The Khmer Rouge's classic tactic in such setbacks is to fall  back into the jungle, harass the government's supply lines and  then suddenly regroup, launching an offensive to recapture lost  terrain.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The date of the national conference -- 25-26 January  -- is approaching, and the political arena is ready to decide on  the participants, two weeks before the date of the conference.  A spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission said that the  conference would not be a conference of parties. The conference  was the axis of the latest party contacts and statements.    The FFS [Socialist Forces Front] has announced that it will  not participate in the national conference scheduled for 25 and  26 January. This stance was contained in a statement issued  today by the National Executive Committee of the FFS.    In its analysis of the general situation and the reasons  behind its nonparticipation, it said that there was a return to  the unilateral system, the one language and the one thought,  without any consideration for the Amazighi [Berber]  peculiarities. The FFS added that it was working for the  restoration of hope for Algerians, as the statement put it.    On the other hand, some parties are holding meetings in the  form of blocs for consultation and coordination before the  convening of the conference. Yesterday, a tripartite meeting  was held between the FLN [National Liberation Front], HAMAS  [Islamic Society Movement], and the Movement for Democracy in  Algeria. The meeting, which was held at FLN headquarters, was  devoted to the preparation of a draft document containing the  measures, methods, and means for making the national dialogue  successful, to be sent to the Higher State Council [HCE] and the  National Dialogue Commission. On this issue, our colleague  Brahim Zewash telephoned FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri,  who answered at the beginning of this short conversation a  question about the tripartite meeting:    [Begin recording] [Mehri] Contacts were made between four  parties -- HAMAS, al-Nahdah, the Movement for Democracy, and the  FLN. It began within the framework of the suggestion that we  submitted to the HCE and the National Dialogue Commission to  hold a tripartite meeting to study some of the measures that  will help to make the national dialogue successful. Naturally,  the suggestion was rejected but the issue remained, as we  thought that it was beneficial that we should continue our  meetings and our consultations as part of the measures that are  apt to help make the national dialogue successful by expanding  it, on the one hand, and by restoring assurances to society, on  the other.    I believe that we have reached a common ground that will be  communicated within the next few days to the HCE and to the  National Dialogue Commission, and will be published.    [Zewash] Can you tell us the broad lines of this common  ground?    [Mehri] I prefer, as we have agreed, that we should wait  until the petition is published.    [Zewash] In other words, is there an attempt by these  parties  to get closer, either because of the FLN [word indistinct] or  because we are noticing that these parties have participated in  the multi-sided meetings?    [Mehri] No, the subject of the meeting is defined and all  the  sides are in agreement that we meet only on this point. Each  party has its own independent ideas with regard to the remaining  issues. We did not attempt to coordinate our stances with regard  to all issues.    [Zewash] In other words, does not the FLN's proposal,  manifested in a meeting of the political parties -- the HCE and  the National Dialogue Commission -- mean that there is a  somewhat exclusion of the social and economic front?    [Mehri] There is no exclusion of any side. The HCE and the  National Dialogue Council have placed us in a group called the  Group of Six Parties -- we move within this group. We are not  the ones who called for the dialogue so that we can exclude  others. The side that called for the dialogue is either the HCE  -- when it conducted the dialogue -- or the National Dialogue  Council. On the contrary, we are for expanding the dialogue.    [Zewash] Abdelhamid, two weeks remain before the convening  of  the national conference, and as you have not participated in the  recent meeting, is that not considered an obstruction of the  national conference?    [Mehri] No, we were not committed to attend the national  conference, irrespective of the circumstances. From the first  day, when the idea of convening a national conference was  suggested, we asked: Will the conference be a phase of the  dialogue or the conclusion of the dialogue? We were told: It  is the conclusion of the dialogue. We said: Therefore, we  should first agree on the content of the conference. If we  agree, we will go to the conference, but if we do not agree on  the content, then we will not attend.    [Zewash] What are the proposals that the FLN can submit in  order to participate in the upcoming national conference?    [Mehri] This is a long issue, because a year and a half ago  we submitted a large number of proposals, and, so far, no  proposal has been taken into consideration.    [Zewash] According to (?close) sources that attended the  tripartite meeting yesterday, there was an attempt to bring  about the participation of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front].    [Mehri] We are confined to work within the group that the  National Dialogue Commission collectively called, and we are  moving within this group in order to avoid any  misinterpretation. But the question of the participation of the  faction that remained in existence following the dissolution of  the FIS is now naturally recognized by all.    [Zewash] The Central Committee of the FLN will be holding an  emergency meeting in the middle of this month, and it appears --  according to press sources -- that there are differences within  the FLN. Is this true?    [Mehri] This is a healthy sign. We do not claim that we are  working in one voice. All our resolutions were adopted  following a discussion of all views, and we will discuss all  views. There is no complexity in this. Even in the darkest of  circumstances we held meetings that were open to journalists,  and in these meetings we held discussions openly, but this deep  and frank discussion among ourselves made the attitude of the  FLN characterized by responsibility and effectiveness.    [Zewash] Will the upcoming meeting of the FLN Central  Committee be open to the national press?    [Mehri] The issue is being discussed, and as yet, no final  decision has been taken.

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Fyodorov says ministers exploiting banknote chaos MR Boris Fyodorov, the Russian finance minister, warned yesterday that conservative government ministers were seeking to exploit the chaos spawned by the central bank's cancellation of old banknotes last month to reverse radical reforms. Reformist ministers, meanwhile, were involved in self-destructive 'intrigues'. 'The government was never really united. The old guard are exploiting the situation and showing their old face,' he said. He cited in particular Mr Oleg Lobov, the first deputy prime minister for the economy, and Mr Alexander Zaveriukha, deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture. The few genuine reformists within the cabinet were 'not co-operating very much. . . they are very trained in intrigues'. Mr Fyodorov said only he and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, were sticking together in defence of policies such as tight spending and a free exchange rate. Although he still wants an end to remaining central bank restrictions on the use of pre-1993 banknotes, Mr Fyodorov admitted that the main casualty of the central bank's crude monetary reform was 'the credibility of the government, the president and the (market) reforms'. Having intervened to eliminate the confiscatory nature of the central bank operation, it was now difficult for President Boris Yeltsin, who had initially 'not understood what he was being involved in,' to cancel it, Mr Fyodorov said. But he expected Mr Yeltsin to stem the tide against reform when he chairs a special government meeting soon. Mr Yeltsin eased the timetable for the exchange of old rouble notes and raised the amount of cash individuals could exchange from the original central bank limits. Mr Fyodorov, who was in the US when the central bank announced a move which he would never have let through, finally intends to resign from his second, much more lucrative job, as Russia's representative at the World Bank in Washington. He has been holding both jobs in parallel since joining the government in December. But he excluded resigning as finance minister. 'This is not a time to give up or give in to any pressures,' he said, adding on the contrary that his tactics now were 'to raise the heat, to make the fight for reform more acute'. He said the worst thing that could happen is that he would be 'ousted' in the fray. Although the chairman of the parliament, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, has called for the punishment of officials 'guilty' of the banknote operation, Mr Fyodorov said parliament was unlikely to dismiss Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, when it meets on Friday. Mr Gerashchenko, who initiated the banknote operation, was yesterday quoted as having admitted that he had not thought about the implications of cancelling small denomination banknotes - which even prevented people from paying for newspapers. Mr Fyodorov said the central bank was not even carrying out its stated aim of weaning other former Soviet republics off the rouble.</p>

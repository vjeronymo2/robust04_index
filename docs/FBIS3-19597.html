			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F> by Daniele Vimercati in Rome; date not given: "Why I Am  Attacking Berlusconi"]    [Text] Rome -- [Vimercati] Bossi, you have now become a  stonyhearted guest at all the election debates. Adversaries  and allies say that you are the pest of the pole of freedoms,  the person that is making a government accord between the  center-right forces impossible. Are you not afraid that these  accusations will make you lose your grassroots' consensus?    [Bossi] I know very well that somebody is trying to  penetrate  into the League, break up the movement, and put me in  difficulty. They know that I am what makes the League stick  together and they want to strike at me in order to strike at the  heart of our federalist project. But they will not succeed and  if they think they can, they do not know the League.    [Vimercati] But is it true that many League members go to  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's conventions?    [Bossi] I do not perform blood tests on the Forza Italia  supporters. I can only say that I spoke at length with all the  League candidates (and outside the headquarters in Via Bellaria  for the first time there were military police with bulletproof  vests in a state of alert, IL GIORNALE editor's note) and they  agree with me on our political line. I have no doubts  concerning the League's grassroots: It was precisely the  activists and the simple supporters who rebelled against the  recycled people of the Berlusconi list of candidates. I  explained the sense of the operation and now I am satisfied  because the opinion polls, the real ones and not the propaganda  ones, say that the League is growing. Also, primarily in the  north, it has already overtaken Forza Italia, which had grown a  great deal thanks to the massive television propaganda. Now the  pole of freedoms is stronger, but thanks to the League.    [Vimercati] Regarding relations with Berlusconi in the  so-called pole of freedoms: After so many election campaign  controversies perhaps the time has come to reason. Do you feel  up to it?    [Bossi] I have been reasoning since the League was born. If  not, we would have never reached this point.    [Vimercati] You are presenting candidates on the same list  as  Berlusconi, yet not a single day goes by without your insulting  him. What sense does this row have?    [Bossi] First, it is not a row, and I am not insulting  anybody. I am telling the truth, I am the only political leader  who always tells the people the truth and nothing but the truth.    [Vimercati] Even when you say that Berlusconi is a P2  [outlawed Masonic lodge] member, the head of the recycled  people, a man of the old regime?    [Bossi] Unfortunately for him this is the truth. His  membership in the Masonic lodge has been reported, his  connection with the old five-party coalition cannot be denied,  not even by his press office. The facts show his role as a  recycled person.    [Vimercati] If this is how things stand, why did you forge  an  alliance with Berlusconi?    [Bossi] Because I know well, and history teaches me that all  the revolutions had to accept the transmigration of a part of  the old system into the new. Forza Italia is the recycled quota  that the League revolution must realistically accept.    [Vimercati] Well then, if you accept it why continue  attacking Forza Italia?    [Bossi] All I have to do is clear things up, with the  movement and all the citizens. I want the political  significance of this electoral accord to be clear. I have not  been saying these things just today and not even since  yesterday. I have always said these things very clearly, even  in Berlusconi's face, and even before the accord.    [Vimercati] Okay, but now that the election battle has begun  you should be firing against the enemy not against the ally. Do  you not think so?    [Bossi] War against Occhetto's statist Left was declared  some  time ago. I have always said that they will make the state go  bankrupt. Therefore, there is no doubt that the votes must go  to the pole of freedoms. This matter has been settled.  However, something else must be explained to the people.  [Vimercati] That is?    [Bossi] That is, there are two forces within the pole of  freedoms. One wants a change, in fact it was the creator of  change. The other represents the quota of recycled people that  are necessary in any revolution. If this second force grows too  much, there is a risk that a stop will be put to change. For  this reason, in the majority vote, the votes must necessarily go  to the pole of freedoms, but in the proportional lower house  vote, Guerriero of the north should be crossed in the gray  voting card. Otherwise, there will be no change and the  five-party coalition will resurrect. This is what I continue to  repeat, even if the newspapers write what they want.    [Vimercati] I seem to understand that you are afraid of  losing your leadership.    [Bossi] This is not the problem. I fear that we will lose  sight of the final objective and the only one that can change  this country and transform it, make it European: federalism.  Without the League there are no federalist prospects for Italy.  This means that the hands of the centralist parties would go  back to reaching out toward the wallets of the north. This is a  fatal risk that I must denounce. Woe to us if the League does  not win, for the north it would be another century of centralist  slavery.    [Vimercati] The problem is another one, however: the  government. The people would like to vote for a potential  majority. Is a League-Forza Italia government possible?    [Bossi] The League will propose its programs, its  liberalistic and federalist ideas. Those who agree, will be in  the government. It is not a matter of majorities. Let this be  clear, I will not form a single group with Berlusconi. He will  go his way and will have to choose whether to stay with us for  federalism, or with the Christian Democrats, or perhaps the  Left. The Left that is currently directing strong attacks at me  and that is trying to make me lose even the battle for the Milan  seat.    [Vimercati] To tell the truth, today the most violent attack  comes from the Right: [National Alliance leader] Fini says that  a political accord with the League is even possible. As long as  Bossi is no longer party secretary.    [Bossi] Right and Left: They are all part of the same band.  I have been repeating this for some time: Right and Left know  that without Bossi, and with the League in pieces, everything  would begin again as it was before. The hands of the nepotistic  south would reach out toward the wallets of the north. The MSI  [Italian Social Movement] people are objectively tied to  paraMafia interests and are nervous because of this: They know  that the north is not stupid and that it will sweep them away,  it will not give them even a vote.</p>

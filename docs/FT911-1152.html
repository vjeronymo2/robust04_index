			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Monte dei Paschi to expand in Italy MONTE dei Paschi di Siena, the big Italian bank, is gearing up its domestic expansion strategy, despite rejecting plans to follow other public-sector financial institutions and list its shares on the stock exchange, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. As part of the current reorganisation of the Italian banking sector, Monte dei Paschi bank has formalised its bid for the Cassa di Risparmio di Prato, a medium-sized regional bank, which will be considered by the Prato Cassa's main shareholder later this month. The bid, which may be made via Monte dei Paschi's Banca Toscana subsidiary, is valued at around L200bn (Dollars 155m) for a stake of almost 73 per cent. The deal would substantially deepen Monte dei Paschi's coverage of its native Tuscany. The bank may also be interested in bidding for Banca Popolare di Sassari, the second biggest bank in Sardinia, with just under 40 branches and total deposits of L1,600bn. The bank, which last year raised group net profits by 11.3 per cent to L419.9bn, reported that deposits at group level rose by 17.1 per cent to L60,324bn last year, while loans increased by 23 per cent to L41,852bn. Net earnings at parent bank level rose by 10 per cent to L251.5bn. The group's three quoted banking subsidiaries, Credito Commerciale, Credito Lombardo and Banca Toscana, will be paying dividends of L180, L160 and L220 respectively.</p>

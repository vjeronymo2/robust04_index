			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marshal of Aviation Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov: </F> "From Reasonable Sufficiency to Sufficient Reasonableness"]    [Text] Today there is an excessive amount of talk about  selling weapons: Should we do it or not, is it profitable or  not, is it moral or not. The common characteristic of this talk  is that it is futile, and sometimes harmful.    This is a matter of a state monopoly, and it should be in  the  hands of people vested with certain powers and, naturally,  possessing high professional and civil qualities. This is  essentially why broad discussion of the problem of arms exports  is futile.    Another issue connected with the excessive boom in  information about this topic is directly harmful, since as a  result our rivals, clients, and ill-wishers get the opportunity  to take advantage of this information. I am no advocate of  covering up the disgraceful phenomena that take place here  (dubious deals, the misappropriation of proceeds,  unscrupulousness on the part of the participants, and so forth).  What I am talking about is excessive loquacity, and not about  the negligence of certain individuals, but about the essence of  our state interests. Because while we are throwing up our hands  in horror, sighing, and lamenting we may lose the market once  and for all without ever having learned to trade.    And it is the sacred truth that we have never traded in  arms,  because we always supplied them on the basis of secret and  non-secret talks between contracting parties' top people, often  according to the principle: "Do you respect me, do you support  my socialism?" And if you do respect me and support it, you can  have a consignment of tanks or aircraft on a credit of around 30  or 40 years (until the final victory of communism on the planet).    We garnered so much respect that nowadays many countries and  regimes that respect us owe us several tens of billions of  dollars which they are very unlikely to repay either today or in  the future.    It is now very difficult to name the annual sums that our  state used to make in those days out of arms sales and it is  even more difficult to determine where the money went.  Especially as for a number of reasons this question interested  few people then, and of those who were on top of it, "some are  no longer with us, and others are far away."    But the most important point was that this money was not  spent on the reproduction of our industry, but frittered away in  our struggle for a bright future on a world scale.    Since the latter half of the eighties there have been a  number of trends and phenomena in world arms exports which  Russia must take into account if it is to avoid serious losses.    The main trend of the "new era" is that the world arms  market  has begun to shrink both in real terms and in current prices.  This stems from a number of political, economic, and strategic  factors. The Cold War has ended (at present more in notional  terms than in reality) and there has been progress in the sphere  of cuts in conventional arms. The conversion of defense  enterprises is under way (and not only in our country).  Economic difficulties in the Third World countries -- our  traditional partners in arms exports -- have worsened. UN  sanctions have been tightened up, again mostly against our  traditional and most solvent partners. Some importer-states now  have their own military industry.    Simultaneously with this factors tending in the opposite  direction, namely directed toward increasing arms exports, have  emerged and are beginning to operate. New "trouble spots" have  emerged on the map of the world. The world community and its  numerous agencies have proved unable to settle conflicts by  political means. The structure of demand in the world arms  market has changed, and the market is now more geared to  purchasing modern and state-of-the-art models of military  hardware. Countries which in the recent past were regarded as  arms importers are attempting (with some success) to break into  the arms market.    Analysis of these two trends shows that, despite a  reduction in the volumes of arms exports on the world market,  the market will not vanish. Competition will sharpen, and the  market will acquire a clear craving for state-of-the-art arms  systems and technologies.    These trends have affected Russia from two directions, but  their tendency is the same -- willy-nilly to squeeze Russia out  of the international market. The first is based on "purely  Russian" factors which we encounter daily and hourly: the  general mismanagement and laxity which parasitizes on  shortcomings in the economic reform and the controllability of  the state. Its essence is that overly large numbers of  "experts" and "specialists" in the delicate matter of arms sales  have appeared in Russia since the early nineties. On the most  plausible pretexts (social protection, saving producers, and so  forth) they are setting up state and "quasi-state" funds,  organizations, and other parasitical structures (on the  principle that every cockroach considers itself a homeowner).    They have got their eyes on this "tasty morsel," are  competing with each other to the detriment of our state, and are  locked in covert and overt struggle against each other, with the  result that clients are confused, the market is lost, and our  country's prestige in the eyes of potential and actual partners  declines. They view us as an unstable country, with all ensuing  consequences.    The answer to the eternal question "Who benefits by this?"  is  clear -- our competitors benefit, as do all these newfound  parasitical structures and particular (but numerous) individuals  who do not care about the country's interests. They want  profits, offices, imported cars, foreign travel, and more  profits.    The aforementioned "purely Russian" features are certainly  harmful, dangerous, and criminal. They must be stopped (rooted  out) "by revolutionary means" -- I will not shrink from that  expression. But there is another aspect which is just as  dangerous -- dangerous in that in a few years we may find  ourselves in a position where we not only have nothing to sell,  we have nothing to defend ourselves with either should the need  arise.    I will be revealing no secret if I say that our  military-industrial complex is in extremely profound crisis  today. The roots of that crisis go back to the late eighties,  but it has emerged most clearly since 1991-1992.    The liberalization of prices emphatically changed the  conditions of enterprises' economic activity, the main essence  of which was the decline in demand for many types of output.  Galloping inflation, the continuous rise in prices, and the  ineffectiveness of the credit system led to insolvency on the  part of the state and, of course, of enterprises.    This was followed by a sharp decrease in the volume of  production of both consumer goods (especially metal-intensive  goods) and military output (equally metal-intensive), which  resulted in a sharp decrease in metal consumption by our  industry.    I will cite just one example, that of aluminum. Aluminum  production in Russia declined by only 8 percent from 1990  through 1993, while consumption declined by 50 percent, but  exports from Russia more than tripled. The regions received  sales quotas. But, lacking trade experience, they began to seek  middlemen, often dubious ones; the latter in turn began to find  insolvent and unscrupulous partners (see the analogy with arms  sales?). The market was flooded with aluminum.    As a result aluminum prices on the international market have  almost halved ($1,950 per tonne in 1989, $1,000 per tonne in  1994).    Thus less and less metal is being produced and consumed in  our country, exports are increasing, and prices are falling.  (This applies not only to aluminum but also to other raw  material commodities.)    It is easy to see that unless this process too is stopped,  we  will be forced to close our production capacities and to switch  to exporting metals, energy sources, and other raw material  resources. Who benefits by this? Not Russia, of course.    By way of illustration I will tell you the value of certain  goods in the international market. Reducing them to weight  terms, 1 kg of a modern fighter is worth $3,000, 1 kg of a  civilian aircraft is worth $1,000, 1 kg of electronics is worth  $100, and 1 kg of metal shovels is worth $1 (the same as 1 kg of  aluminum).    It is easy to see that it is very profitable to sell modern  fighters, like other military and civilian products. They  embody the highest scientific potential, the most complex  technologies, huge labor resources, and the best trained  specialists. It is not only stupid but criminal to destroy and  lose all this.    On the other hand it is also unreasonable and unprofitable  to support the military-industrial complex in its old form.  Especially as the leaders of the military-industrial complex  themselves not only are aware of but also understand the  necessity of reform. Their only "shortcoming" is boundless  faith in the strength of the state and its structures, where,  though there has been talk of reasonable sufficiency in defense  building and of the need for conversion, downsizing, and  privatization, they have never answered the questions that are  most important to producers: What to cut and by how much, which  defense enterprises should be privatized, what to convert and  how much, what arms does our Army need, what science and  production infrastructure should be left for the future, how  many production capacities should be modernized to produce  promising weapons, and how many should be kept in reserve for a  special period?    You will agree that these are the tasks primarily of state  organs, not of the "Red directors," who are having an  increasingly hard time between the hammer and the anvil, namely,  between silent state structures and uneasy labor collectives.    The main shortcoming of state structures today is that there  is no integrated concept for the reform of the  military-industrial complex in the light of the country's real  defense needs both today and in the future. The ministries and  departments studying these problems (the Defense Ministry, the  State Committee for the Defense Industry, the Ministry of  Finance, the Ministry of Economics) are unable to resolve them  alone. Gathered together, they defend departmental interests.  There is no organ such as the Council of Ministers  Military-Industrial Commission (which existed under the USSR).  But there is a military-industrial complex that is flying off  the rails, there are the remnants of our arms and strategically  important raw materials flying abroad.    Thus it is easy to see that where we should be engaging in  reform, survival, and rescue there are no reformers and  rescuers, but where there is something to sell there are swarms  of them, and, along with the economic damage, this is leading us  to moral degeneration: People are being torn away from  productive labor, gradually turning into storekeepers to whom  the state's interests mean nothing. And this is just as much of  a danger as losing the military-industrial complex.    What am I proposing should be done? First, in view of the  creation of "Rosvooruzheniye," the state company for the export  and import of arms and military equipment, all other  organizations, structures, and funds must be debarred from the  arms trade.    Second, we must urgently adopt a legislative and legal basis  regarding the arms trade, placing this process within the  mainstream of state interests and under the state's control in  such a way as to ensure that both amateurs and "professionals"  at making easy money cannot pass through the legislative  barriers and enter it.    Third, we must elaborate a concept for the reform of the  military-industrial complex which could be made up of a number  of harmonized, coordinated, and interconnected state programs:  an armaments program clearly defining our Army's real needs  both today and for the future; a program of military-technical  cooperation with foreign countries (especially with the CIS  states) taking into account Russia's long-term interests and the  potential and features of our traditional and potential  partners; a program for the recycling and destruction of arms,  military equipment, hardware, and ammunition that our Army does  not need and that are unsuitable for the national economy and  unacceptable for sale on the external arms market, tasking  reserve production capacities with this, thereby also retaining  the requisite number of them for a special period; a program for  the conversion and reduction of science and production  capacities or for tasking them with producing consumer goods on  the basis of technologies as close as possible to military  output.    Fourth, on the basis of these state programs we must carry  out a kind of inventory of all the science-and-production  capacities of the military-industrial complex in strict  accordance with the concept for its reform and in order to reach  a decision and leave the necessary capacities, convert duplicate  ones, allow surplus ones to be privatized, cut unnecessary ones,  and provide work for reserve ones.    Fifth, we must impose strict order in the sale of  strategically important raw materials. I am convinced that if  we carried out a total inspection of all deals regarding these  materials since 1992 and returned all the financial proceeds to  our country, the budget deficit would decrease substantially and  the authority of state structures would increase.    There are a few special areas. Reducing the number of  different models and versions of military hardware and arms. No  country in the world can stand diversity here (around 100 models  and versions of combat aircraft in the air force alone). Add to  that the plethora of types of ammunition, fuels and lubricants,  and spares. And you get a really mind-boggling picture.    There is a need for the strictest standardization. The time  has also come to preclude the duplication that is all too rife  in scientific development work too. There is a need for  measures to shorten the time between projects on paper and their  actual implementation, maybe even via the sale of these projects  or developed prototypes to long-term and reliable partners. The  proceeds could be used to develop and introduce new arms systems  for our own use....    The successful solution of these most important state  problems, in my view, involves a switch from reasonable  sufficiency to the principles of sufficient reasonableness, and  not only in defense building but also in other spheres.    The aforementioned directions are largely organizational and  do not require much material investment. They will take time,  the desire, responsibility, and resolve. And they will bring  savings and profitability.    But, of course, before that and during the transitional  period the profound reform of the military-industrial complex  and its upkeep will require considerable funds. The state lacks  these. Therefore there is no point in waiting for something to  turn up.    There is a great deal of talk at the moment about creating  financial and industrial groups in the defense complex. This  has its supporters and its opponents. I don't want to be the  repository of ultimate truth, but I must say that, despite a  number of shortcomings with respect to authorization to set them  up, these are a kind of lifebelt for the military-industrial  complex. And the potential shortcomings can be balanced and  eliminated via organization and monitoring on the part of, once  again, state structures and their organs without leaving  everything to the hapless producers and all kinds of financial  entities -- especially those with a dubious reputation -- that  are dying to get their hands on them.    We need a plan, we need conditions, there must be a  mechanism  based primarily on state interests. For instance, we need a  strict tender imposing certain requirements on banks wishing to  be founders of financial and industrial groups.    On the other hand, we also need state aid to these financial  and industrial groups: to some in the form of subsidies, to  others in the form of exemption from certain types of taxes, at  least initially. But at any rate the process must be regulated  and controlled by the state. Because if the state leaves this  to the mercy of fate, there are grounds for believing that these  financial and industrial groups will abandon the state. And  this too is not in Russia's interests.</p>

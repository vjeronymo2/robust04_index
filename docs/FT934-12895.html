			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Bosnians launch new offensive BOSNIAN government forces, in the absence of a political settlement, yesterday sought to enlarge their territory, launching an offensive on the Croat-held town of Vares, central Bosnia. UN officials said the mainly Moslem army was trying to link up with soldiers trapped in the Croat enclave, mostly spared in the 19-month war. 'The Bosnian army opened up a route to relieve its people within the pocket. Having done that, the Bosnian army is pressing ahead with an assault along the northwest-to-south-west flank of the Croat forces,' said Colonel Bill Aikman, spokesman for the UN Protection Force. Sarajevo radio said the offensive followed the complete destruction by Bosnian Croatian forces of Stupni Do, a Moslem village on the outskirts of Vares. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) 'burned houses and killed civilians,' said the radio. 'The village of Stupni Do is still burning. There will soon be an offensive to liberate this part of Bosnia.' Vares, under the control of the HVO, lies on a key road from Sarajevo to Tuzla, one of the biggest government strongholds, in the northeast. Bosnian government forces, under President Alija Izetbegovic, are trying to re-open the route to Tuzla, blocked since the collapse last May of their alliance against the Serbs with the HVO. Mr Fikret Abdic, a local leader from the dense Moslem heartland in the northwest, last week signed 'peace agreements' with Serb and Croat nationalists. Mr Izetbegovic now fears that other enclaves, cut off from the Bosnian capital, may broker separate deals with Serb and Croat adversaries in an attempt to end their isolation before the onset of the second winter of war. Mr Abdic's peace pacts appeared to prompt a 500-metre advance at the weekend by Serb troops. Sarajevo radio said it was joint assault by the 'Serbian aggressor' and forces loyal to Mr Abdic aimed at weakening Bosnian government control over the Moslem pocket.</p>

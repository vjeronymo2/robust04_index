			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- The programme of privatisation  of state and municipal enterprises in Russia after July 1, 1994  was submitted for approval to a conference of regional heads  held in the building of the Russian Government on Monday.    The conference was addressed by chairman of the Russian  committee for state property, Anatoliy Chubays, who said that  unlike the first stage of voucher privatisation, during the  second stage priority will be given to quality standards.    The evaluation of property to be privatised after July 1,  will be made in prices which were in effect as of January 1,  1994. The market value of a privatised object will differ from  the starting price by several dozen per cent, rather than by  several dozen times, Chubays said.    The programme of post-voucher privatisation will enable  local  authorities to increase the starting cost of property by 70-200  per cent, depending on conditions of each particular region,  Chubays said. Privileges granted to work collectives in the  course of privatisation have underwent substantial changes in  the new programme. Workers and managers of enterprises who will  prefer the first variant will be given only 25 per cent of  privileged shares (while under the programme in effect today,  workers and managers, including the directors' corps, received  40 per cent of the athorised stock).    A second variant, which is the most popular among privatised  enterprises, envisages that only 10 per cent of shares will  given to them on privileged terms (against 51 per cent in effect  today.)    Nevertheless, privatised enterprises will be allowed to  appropriate 51 percent of all revenues from privatisation,  Chubays said, adding that this measure will help former  state-run enterprises overcome the structural crisis as soon as  possible.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Print employers warn over hung parliament PRINT EMPLOYERS warned yesterday of the dangers to business confidence of a hung parliament as it emerged that more than a third of them expect to cut jobs in the next three months. The British Printing Industries Federation said that, with an election out of the way business confidence would revive, but it added that that assumed that the outcome was not a hung parliament. Its comments reflect concern among the business community that an election with no clear winner would lead to uncertainty among customers and a longer recession. The federation said its quarterly survey of companies with sales of Pounds 1.2bn had produced mixed results. Members reported that the first quarter of this year, which they had assumed would be tough, was far worse than expected. Some 94 per cent of companies were working below capacity. Eight out of 10 had reduced employment, whereas only four out of 10 had expected to do so. Employment prospects remain bleak, with 36 per cent planning further job losses in the next quarter. Smaller companies often shed staff by non-replacement but job shedding at larger companies is more likely to involve redundancies. The federation added that encouragement could be taken from the fact that two thirds of companies believed the next three months would see an improvement in the industry's fortunes. Not since April 1987 has such a large proportion looked forward to better times. Even so, the federation said most members believed it would be the autumn before a real, as opposed to a seasonal, upturn was evident. Hopes for stable prices have faded. Almost three in five companies have cut prices recently, compared with the forecast one in 10. Some 20 per cent plan further reductions.</p>

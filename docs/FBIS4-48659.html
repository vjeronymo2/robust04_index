			<p>BFN     [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP) -- A UN envoy called off a  trip to Kigali on Monday [23 May] despite a shaky truce in  Rwanda's embattled capital, saying neither rebels nor government  forces could guarantee his security.    The envoy, Iqbal Riza, was to have travelled to Kigali by  road Monday to continue discussions to pave the way for the  return of UN peacekeepers to stem ethnic slaughter in Rwanda.  But after talks in the morning with leaders of the rebel Rwanda  Patriotic Front (RPF) at their headquarters in Mulindi, northern  Rwanda, Riza cancelled the trip and returned to Uganda by  helicopter, a UN spokesman said.    "We did not obtain explicit guarantees from the two parties  about his safety," spokesman Abdul Kabia said by telephone from  Kigali, where fighting tailed off despite sporadic gunfire.    Kabia said both sides had agreed to a two-day truce to allow  Riza to hold talks with rebel leaders and Rwanda's interim  government on plans to deploy 5,500 UN troops to stem a  six-week-old bloodbath in which up to half-a-million people have  been killed.    The rebels, however, said they had not agreed to a full  truce, but had agreed to hold fire wherever possible to allow  Riza to travel safely.    But Riza was still concerned about negotiating a dangerous  crossing just outside Kigali, Kabia said.    "The truce is largely holding," Kabia said. "There are  occasional exchanges of fire, but there's a lot less fighting  than usual and so we consider that the truce is being respected."</p>

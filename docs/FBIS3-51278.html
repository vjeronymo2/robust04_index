			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The economic outlook for Colombian industry is  improving. Business reports are favorable in terms of production  activity, volume of orders, and inventory.    This is the picture drawn by the October opinion poll of  employers conducted by the Education and Development Foundation  (FEDESARROLLO).    In the survey of 360 enterprises in all areas of national  production, emphasis was placed on the performance of exporters.    Despite the increase in the volume of goods shipped abroad,  33 percent of the firms reported that profits had dipped.    This phenomenon is related to the revaluation of the rate of  exchange because while exporting larger volumes of goods,  business owners receive less for their sales.    Other negative factors for the export sector include the  high  cost of labor and domestic transport. The lack of an adequate  infrastructure in terms of roads, ports, and airports hurts the  ability of Colombian produdcts to penetrate foreign markets.  <H5>  Cheap Credit </H5>   However, there are also positive factors that have helped  exports. The increase in the volume of foreign sales is the  result of the lowering of trade barriers by purchaser countries.  One example is trade with Venezuela, a country which, thanks to  the free trade agreement, has become the main buyer of our  products after the United States.    Another factor that has benefited not only exporters but all  business owners is more favorable terms for obtaining credit  from the financial system due to the lower interest rates  charged.    In fact, interest on loans has held steady at an average 35  percent annually, down from the 48-percent annual rate charged  two years ago. Access to cheap credit gives businessmen a  breather because they can now develop production at a lower  financial cost.  <H5>  Industry </H5>   Some 41 percent of the industrialists surveyed said the  current economic situation is good, while 46 percent said it is  acceptable, and 13 said it is poor.    For 33 percent of those interviewed, economic prospects for  the next six months are favorable, while 59 percent think they  will remain the same.    Only 9 percent said prospects will get worse. One of the  reasons for the optimism of businessmen is apparently related to  the fact that the government and monetary officials achieved  their economic goals. They are sticking to the goal of a  22-percent increase in the cost of living and economic growth  exceeding 4 percent.    Some 23 percent of those polled said the volume of orders  had  increased, while 55 percent reported that it had remained the  same.    By sector, the economic situation was good for food,  beverages, the print and publishing industry, earthenware, tile,  chemical substances, rubber products, and electrical equipment  and material. Cement and construction materials have shot up  because of a boom in the sector.    The tobacco industry is depressed and all those polled said  their current economic situation is negative. Textiles is  another sector that continues to experience problems.    For the commercial sector, the economic situation in October  was favorable, but less favorable than for industry. Some 32  percent of those polled said it was positive, while for 58  percent it was stable.    Nevertheless, prospects for the next six months look better  for the commercial sector, which has been aided by the economic  liberalization process and integration agreements.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF BLOCK ON GANGS AND DRUGS  </P> <P> I agree wholeheartedly with your commendation of Sheriff Sherman Block  (editorial, "Even Without Drugs, There'd Be Gangs," Sept. 21) for his bold  insight into the cause of gang violence. Block correctly asserted that a  fundamental connection exists between the deviance of gang violence and one's  self-worth.  </P> <P> As violence becomes an increasingly common phenomena, we must concern ourselves  with ways of mitigating the attraction for self-enhancing experiences that  gangs offer those who have previously only experienced lowered self-worth. Our  inattention to this matter, as a society, manifests itself in an increase in  violence and drug-related crimes. Violence and drug use are results, not  causes.  </P> <P> Block's perspicacious recognition of that reality should serve as guidance for  leaders who fear to tread on what they must perceive to be the thin ice of  political sophistication and candor. This perception is misguided as evidenced,  at least, in the political arena, in incredibly low voter turnout. We deserve  more! Thank you, Sheriff Block, for elevating the discussion!  </P> <P> MALKA L. TASOFF, Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Crown Estate payment rises by 8.4% THE CROWN ESTATE, the property owned by the sovereign, who surrenders its profits to parliament in exchange for the civil list, yesterday announced that its payment to the exchequer had risen by 8.4 per cent to Pounds 75.9m for the year to end of March. The estate, the UK's largest landowner, generated a revenue surplus of Pounds 74.3m, up 3.6 per cent. Its value had fallen by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 1.66bn by the year-end. Lord Mansfield, the estate's first commissioner, said the estate had 'weathered the recession very well'. The estate said its strength reflected 'the wide-ranging nature and quality' of its portfolio, and 'the effect of good financial management and a prudent investment strategy'. Lord Mansfield said the Leasehold Enfranchisement Bill going through parliament would have 'a considerable effect' on the estate. Although the estate is immune from the bill's provisions, it has agreed to enfranchise leaseholders except in places such as Windsor, Regent's Park and Kensington, where there are historic associations, special security considerations or close connections with royal palaces and parks. In these cases, tenants will be allowed to extend their leases to 150 years.</p>

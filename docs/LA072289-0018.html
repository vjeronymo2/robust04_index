			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 3 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING AFTER SOCCER GAME  </P> <P> Three men who had just finished playing soccer at a Pacoima schoolyard were  apparently mistaken for gang members and wounded in a drive-by shooting, Los  Angeles police said Friday.  </P> <P> The shootings occurred at 9 p.m. Thursday at the corner of Pierce Street and  Glenoaks Boulevard, police said. No arrests were made.  </P> <P> The victims were identified as Carlos Lopez, 27, who was hit in the face;  Guillermo Martinez, 21, who was struck in the chest; and Benigno Gonzalez, 25,  who was struck in the legs. All three are from the Pacoima area, police said.  </P> <P> Lopez and Martinez were taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills,  where Lopez was in critical condition and Martinez was in serious but stable  condition, hospital officials said. Gonzalez was taken to Olive View Medical  Center and was in stable condition.  </P> <P> Detective Jay St. John said police found no indication the victims were  affiliated with gangs. He said they regularly played soccer at Charles Maclay  Junior High School in the evening.  </P> <P> "Most of them carry daytime jobs and gather there afterward to play," St. John  said. "I don't know of many gangsters who spend their nights playing soccer."  </P> <P> Police said the three men had finished playing on the school grounds and walked  across Pierce Street to use a phone at a service station. While one man used  the phone and the other two stood nearby, a red car carrying two or three men  drove slowly by.  </P> <P> "Some sort of gang challenge was spoken by the suspects in the car," St. John  said. "Then they fired shots. We don't know how many."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- Sudanese Deputy Foreign  Minister Yusuf 'Umar Baradah arrived here Monday on a three-day  official stay and was welcomed by his Iranian counterpart  Mohammad Hashemi at the airport.    Talking to reporters upon his arrival, Barideh described  Tehran-Khartoum ties as "excellent" and said his government was  for further expansion of the "cordial bilateral relations" in  various fields.    Baradah, who carries a written message from Sudanese Foreign  Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih for his Iranian counterpart  'Ali Akbar Velayati, said Iran and Sudan are the target of  adverse propaganda for their efforts to implement Islamic laws.    He said his government was proud of Iranian and Sudanese  officials' adoption of an independent political and economic  path which has led to growing ties between the two countries.    Hashemi referred to the age-old cultural, historical and  religious commonalities between Iran and Sudan and underscored  expansion of bilateral relations.</p>

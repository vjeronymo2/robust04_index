			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Qilandar Momind: "Tribals to Merge into Nation's </F> Mainstream"]    [Text] Federal Home Minister Maj. Gen. (Retd.) Nasirullah  Babar said after a press conference in Islamabad, in formal  talks with reporters, that the federal government has decided to  establish voting right for adults in tribal areas.    During the last general election and afterwards, the  organization and almost all the national political parties  related to tribal areas demanded voting rights in the tribal  areas. The parties involved in the present government have also  included plans for voting in the tribal areas in their election  manifestos. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, during her visit to  the Kurram Agency, announced loudly that elections would soon be  held with voting rights for adults in tribal areas. Major  General Nasirullah Babar, federal home minister, may be talking  informally; however, Madam Benazir Bhutto's declaration is a  very welcome step. It will be remembered in the political  history of this nation. As a result of the implementation of  this plan, hundreds of thousands of tribal people who have been  deprived of their right to vote will get this right. Major  General Nasirullah Babar wants amendments to several laws in  order to attain this goal. Therefore, it will take some time to  implement this plan. Once this decision has been made, however,  we can expect that, Allah willing, all tribal adults will be  able to cast votes in the next general election. The federal  home minister also revealed that in light of this decision, the  government has told the election commission to prepare new  election lists for the tribal area during the next census. The  people in the tribal areas will vote according to this list in  the next election. Similarly, it is the duty of the tribal  leaders and the people there to encourage the tribals to join  the national campaign, and to start a campaign for this in order  to prepare them to make the election lists. The federal home  minister also revealed during his talks that the FATA [Federally  Administered Territories] members support voting rights. The  main reason for the tribal people not having any right to vote  was that the Parliament members from tribal areas were not in  support of this kind of election. Now, with the grace of God,  the situation has changed, and the Parliament members from  tribal areas, perhaps for the first time, support the right to  vote for tribal people. It is expected that the people in the  tribal areas will have the rights for which the educated people  in the tribal areas have fought for a long time. As a result,  the areas included in FATA will become part of Pakistan's  political structure. All the laws of the country used in the  other states will be imposed in the FATA region also. Along with  FATA, the PATA [Politically Administered Territories] region  will also be included in the political structure. Thus, the  political boundaries of the tribal areas will merge with the  boundaries of our nation and fulfill the dreams of Khushal Khan  Khatak and Ilama Iqbal.</p>

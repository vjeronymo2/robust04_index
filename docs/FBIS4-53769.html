			<p>BFN     [Text] The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  has adopted a resolution calling for the creation of the  next-generation cellular telephone system that makes it possible  to use cellular telephones anywhere in the world. On 16 May,  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Ministry [MOPT]  decided to press the United States into putting the resolution  into effect. The United States has adopted a policy ignoring  the resolution, which has prompted the MOPT to make that  decision. The MOPT plans to formally notify the U.S. side of  its decision at the trilateral conference on cellular  telecommunications research slated to be held in Tokyo beginning  24 May. The conference will be attended by Japan, the United  States, and European nations. The European Union (EU) is  expected to cooperate with the MOPT in pressing the United  States to put the resolution into force.    While present car and cellular telephones use ground  stations  to transmit radio waves, the next-generation mobile telephone  system has the feature of using satellites to transmit radio  waves. The next-generation cellular telephone system, if  adopted worldwide, will standardize the current diverse radio  waves used by cellular telephones. Internationally standardized  radio waves would make it possible to use cellular telephones  either in Japan or in other nations.    The resolution adopted by the ITU in 1992 also calls for  standardizing radio waves. The ITU has urged its member nations  to use a total of 230 mHz including 1885-2025 mHz and 2100-2200  mHz as their exclusive radio waves for the next-generation  cellular telephone system. President Clinton, however, has  decided to shift part of the exclusive radio waves to the  current cellular telephone system, incurring a backlash from  Japan and European nations.</p>

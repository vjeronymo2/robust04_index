			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, April 30 (XINHUA)--Anhui Province, which took  the lead in the national rural reform, will adopt a package of  policies to consolidate and develop agriculture.    According to Governor Fu Xishou, one of them is to improve  the contract responsibility system for land utilization. "This  is the key to stabilizing rural policies," he said.    The provincial government has decided that after the 15-year  contracts for land utilization expire this year, farmers may  renew their contracts for 30 years more.    During the contract period farmers are entitled to lease or  mortgage the land or become share-holders.    The period of contracting for barren mountains, land and  water surface may extend up to 70 years.    Anhui is one of China's major agricultural provinces.  Although some five million rural laborers left the fields for  urban areas to seek employment last year, the province still  reaped a grain harvest of 25.96 million tons, an increase of  10.8 percent over the previous year and becoming the only  province in southern China to record a grain increase.    The past decade has seen this East China province not only  become self-sufficient in grain but also sell more than two  billion kg of grain a year to other parts of the country.    "The establishment of a grain reserve system and a grain  risk  foundation is another measure," the governor noted.    The provincial government plans to reserve 600 million kg of  grain to ensure timely grain purchase from farmers and arouse  their enthusiasm for farm production.    In addition, Anhui will increase its input into agriculture.    While continuously boosting its grain output, the provincial  government is determined to pay attention to quality and  efficiency in line with market needs.    It will concentrate on the production of quality rice,  cotton, oil-bearing crops, tea, livestock and poultry, silk,  fruit, vegetables, aquatic products, traditional Chinese herbal  medicines and edible fungus this year.    According to the governor, the government will select 10  counties, 20 production bases and 50 administrative villages to  try out an overall agricultural development project.    Meanwhile, the government is determined to reform the census  registration system to gradually transfer 10 million surplus  rural laborers to urban areas.    At present, the governor noted, Anhui is growing grain on  six  million ha of land, and is expected to produce 25 billion kg of  grain this year, about the same as last year. Its summer crops  are growing well.    The governor disclosed that the province still has three  million people, accounting for five percent of the provincial  population, living below the poverty line.    The provincial government has vowed to exert more efforts to  help these people to rise above the poverty line within three to  five years and live comfortable lives within eight years.    To reduce farmers' financial burdens, the provincial  government has already revoked 87 charges.</p>

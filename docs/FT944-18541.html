			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: London In spite of the recent volatility in the European and US financial markets, gilts maintained a relatively firm tone last week, shrugging off many of the broader swings in the UK equities and futures markets. Many analysts expect this trend to continue this week. 'It's likely to be a week of consolidation,' says Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe. She points out that in the last week a stronger trend in the German bund market coupled with a successful gilt auction has supported the market slightly. 'The supply side story has been unwinding and that is helping it a bit,' she adds. Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg says: 'The recent switching into gilts from equities hints at good underlying demand.' In the absence of the release of any important domestic data this week, one factor that could potentially affect the markets is any aftermath from the Japanese-US trade talks. Some dealers fear that the compromise hammered out in the talks could yet unravel, triggering a fresh bout of international bond market instability. However on the domestic side, the M0 money supply data today, and output figures later this week, are not expected to have a strong market impact.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Accused endure a long wait for justice: Andrew Jack on events in the BCCI trial In the relative comfort of the Police Officers' Club in Abu Dhabi, ten former executives of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International are awaiting the judgment of the court. Periodically since last October they have been driven to the other side of the city to the court of the first instance for hearings, the latest of which is scheduled for this Saturday. Within a few weeks, they could face a drive elsewhere in Abu Dhabi - to the more spartan Al Wathba prison. They are among the former officials of BCCI who are alleged to have been most closely involved in the frauds perpetrated within the bank over the past decade. Their captivity began in autumn 1990, in the months following the period when Abu Dhabi says it was informed of fraud in April by Mr Swaleh Naqvi, BCCI's chief executive. Drawing on initial work which attempted to quantify the fraud, the authorities arrested some 20 individuals including Mr Naqvi. Since April, most of them have been moved to the state as Abu Dhabi asserted its control of BCCI and shifted its headquarters from London. Several were released by the courts within months for lack of evidence, followed by more last year after an initial report to the public prosecutor. That left 14 to face charges in last July. One of these, Mr Arjmand Naqvi, has died. Among the remainder still facing charges, is Mr Aga Hasan Abedi, founder of the bank, who is living in Pakistan and unlikely to stand trial. Another is Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar, former head of the bank's treasury division, who last September pleaded guilty to 16 charges of false accounting involving more than Dollars 745m (Pounds 505m) of depositors' money and is now in prison in the UK. The others held locally, who face charges of forgery, breach of trust, setting up fictitious accounts and falsifying loans, are: Hasan Mahmoud Kazmi; Fakhir Hussain; Abdul Hafeez; Zafar Iqbal Choudry; Mohammed Azmatullah; Imtiaz Ahmed; Ameer Ul Haq Siddiki; Iqbal Ahmed Ridwi (out on bail); Bashir Ahmad Tahir and Naseem Hassan Sheikh. Last month Abu Dhabi, as majority shareholder and creditor to BCCI, sued the detainees for Dollars 9bn, in an action concurrent with the criminal case. The Abu Dhabi proceedings have been gripped by a recent sense of urgency. The periods between court appearances have been shortened, and it appears that future hearings may take place every few days. One reason may be the agreement reached between the Abu Dhabi government and the US authorities last month. It includes a provision to hand over Mr Naqvi by May 8. Although government officials insist the judicial process is independent, they are also confident this deadline will be met. Others are less convinced of this independence. It appears that Mr Naqvi's US lawyer is to be funded by the Abu Dhabi BCCI working group acting in its capacity as shareholder and creditor to the collapsed bank. The same group is believed also to be ultimately funding the costs of the public prosecutor, who has hired Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, to prepare its case. Observers hoping for detailed revelations at the trial highlighting who was responsible for the BCCI frauds will be disappointed. After an initial blaze of publicity and open hearings, all proceedings from the beginning of January are being held in camera. The defendants' lawyers are expected shortly to present their clients' defences. However, much of the work conducted by the judge who will make the decision on the detainees' guilt is being conducted in his chambers using information gathered in reports already submitted by the public prosecutor. One problem is that the carefully concealed nature of the fraud, compounded with the Middle Eastern tradition which does not put all transactions to paper, means that much of the evidence is based on inference. This is partly backed up by interviews given by the defendants - generally without their lawyers being present. The defence lawyers have had a hard time, arguing for access to additional documents, and - unsuccessfully - for bail or trial in another jurisdiction for their clients. They say their clients have already served much of their sentence, since the maximum penalty under each charge is three years and this has already been reached because under local law 21 days counts as a month's imprisonment. Others question how far the outcome will be fair and independently determined, given the enormous complexity of the case, the relative inexperience of the judge, and the traditional hierarchical way in which Abu Dhabi society operates.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSICAL PRAISE  </P> <P> Barbara Malone's article ("It's the Finest Choir Music You've Never Heard,"  Oct. 15) gave me shivers and goose pimples as I reminisced about similar  experiences in Britain's great cathedrals. Visitors can also hear fine music at  lunchtime in many such venues, especially during summer when visiting choirs  from other countries give recitals.  </P> <P> Last summer, the San Louis Obispo Vocal Arts Ensemble was one such choir  singing in St. Giles (Edinburgh), Ripon, Norwich, Lincoln, Ely and Durham  cathedrals. You never know -- your own hometown group may turn up on your  itinerary by surprise.  </P> <P> ROGER OSBALDESTON  </P> <P> Los Osos  </P></p>

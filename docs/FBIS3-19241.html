Mr. Narasimha Rao declared that  India will continue with its economic reform programs while  ensuring that the government does not lose touch with the  realities and exigencies of development for the vast number of  underprivileged. Mr. Rao was replying to the toast proposed by  the British prime minister, Mr. John Major, who hosted a lunch  in Mr. Rao's honor at 10 Downing Street in London. He said a  democratic and secular India pursuing economic liberalization is  keen on tapping the vast potential in Indo-British relationship.  He observed that during the last two years, Indo-British ties  had made remarkable progress. The progress has been visible  since Mr. Major visited New Delhi in January last year.    The Indo-British Partnership Initiative, IBPI, was today  extended by another year. The IBPI was set up in January 1993  for a period of one year to increase awareness of trade and  investment opportunities between the two countries. The  recommendations of the two co-chairmen of IBPI were presented to  Mr. Narasimha Rao and Mr. John Major today. The report  recommends for greater emphasis on the involvement of small- and  medium-size companies. It has identified different sectors for  business opportunities. These sectors include agro food  processing, manufacturing technology, telecommunications and  (?telemetry), infrastructure and environment, oil and gas, and  industrial components. The report among other things identified  major issues for the governments. Some of these are reduction  in tariff, import duty, single window clearance system,  flexibility in labor laws, and comprehensive infrastructure  development.    Our correspondent Alok Deshwal reports from London that New  Delhi is the largest recipient of British overseas assistance  for 1993-94. The United Kingdom has pledged 239 million pounds  to India during this period.    Later, in his meeting with the secretary of state for  defense, Mr. Rifkind, the prime minister discussed various ways  and means of increasing defense cooperation between the two  countries. Earlier, in the morning, Mr. Narasimha Rao had a  breakfast meeting with the lord mayor of London. The prime  minister called upon the British investors to show quick  decisions about making investments in India.    Britain has announced a 10 million pounds assistance for the  World Bank-aided rehabilitation project in the Maharashtra  earthquake-hit areas. During her half-an-hour meeting with the  prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in London this morning, the  minister for overseas development assistance, Baroness (Linda  Chalker), said this will be in addition to 3 million pounds aid  Britain has already given.    Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, was formally  received by the British prime minister, Mr. John Major; and the  foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, at the Foreign Office in  London this morning. He also inspected a special guard of honor.</p>

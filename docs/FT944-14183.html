			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Pressure increases to stem tide of 'dirty money' There is growing pressure across the western world to clamp down on flows of 'dirty money', which some estimates put in France alone at about FFr14bn (Pounds 1.7bn) a year and around the world at up to FFr1,000bn. Mr Pierre Fond, deputy head of the French Tracfin agency which tracks clandestine financial movements, says his organisation has referred 55 cases involving more than FFr1bn in suspected money-laundering operations to the courts over the past two years. It still now receiving about 60 tip-offs each month from financial institutions of flows of dirty money. The figures from Tracfin, which has began full-scale operations in the past two years as a result of French money laundering laws passed in 1990, only records the most suspicious transactions. Mr Fond says that is one reason why the monthly reports coming into the agency are still substantially less than those for its counterparts in countries such as Britain. Tracfin's 25 agents work with about 4,000 'correspondents', one in each of the financial institutions such as banks who monitor confidentially flows of money which might be linked to criminal activities. Mr Fond said one of the most difficult networks to monitor was bureaux de change, because many were very small with only a few staff and often less effective at keeping Tracfin informed. He said money laundering prosecutions were often frustrated because it was necessary to prove the original crime - often committed in another country - as well as all the subsequent flows of money following from it. Also current legislation allowed the agency to act only against laundering activities from drug money and not other illegal activities such as fraud or public sector corruption.</p>

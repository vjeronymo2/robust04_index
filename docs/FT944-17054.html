			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Ciller sees drop in inflation Turkish inflation should fall to 20 per cent by the end of the year, thanks to austerity measures taken in April, when inflation topped 100 per cent and the exchange rate collapsed, according to Mrs Tansu Ciller, prime minister. Commenting on the first six months of her emergency economic programme, she said foreign debt had shrunk by a tenth to Dollars 60bn, central bank reserves had doubled to Dollars 6.7bn and the current account had swung to a Dollars 1.1bn surplus between January and July from a Dollars 6.4bn deficit in 1993. Sharply curtailed public spending brought the budget deficit in the first seven months down to Dollars 586m, almost half the expected amount.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, June 17 (MAP) -- King Hassan II asked the  Moroccan parliament to elaborate `a national charter' on  education defining the basic criteria of the Moroccan  educational system to enable the Moroccan people be up to the  present and future challenges.    In a letter to the parliament Thursday [16 June] that was  read by adviser to the sovereign Ahmed Bensouda, King Hassan II  underlined the key role played by education in economic, social  and cultural development. He noted that despite the progress  made, further efforts must be exerted to take up the challenges  thrown at the sector. `Various shortcomings at all stages and at  all levels are still characterizing our educational system', the  sovereign said adding these shortcomings are the major reason  behind the unemployment of scores of university degree holders.  This situation, he explained, is due to the unbalance between  the supply and demand in various socio-economic sectors on the  one hand and to a deficient orientation and insufficient  information of students on the other.    `Our educational system must be conceived in the frame of a  comprehensive, coherent and future-oriented policy that must be  very flexible and receptive to would-be adjustments', the  sovereign pointed out calling for elaborating a policy able to  meet both the current and future needs related to the economic,  social and cultural changes Morocco is going through.    The education problem is complicated and must be addressed  by  all. It is a collective responsibility committing the state,  parents, teachers and economic operators, King Hassan II said  urging the parliament to devote a large part of the current  parliamentary term to debates on the education problem and to  try to draw the bases of a national policy in this vital field.  `A general consultation must be engaged, without any exclusive  nor exclusion, and far from any demagogic or partisan  consideration', King Hassan II stated.    The sovereign said further he is confident that the mps will  give evidence of patriotism, imagination, audacity and realism  in elaborating this policy which must, the sovereign underlined,  `preserve our identity and authenticity, define... the frame to  train the Moroccan so that he be useful and efficient, at home  and abroad, for himself and for the whole society'.    Our education must assert and consolidate the Moroccan  personality and must be inspired from and based on the precepts  of Islam, a religion of overture and tolerance, King Hassan II  said adding `in this troubled period, it is imperative to  educate and to train the Moroccan on the basis of the respect of  his faith and to instil in him the spirit of Islam which accepts  the other and rejects any domination will'.    Our education must also be targeted to take up the challenge  of the 21st century, i.e. mastering the growingly complicated  technological and industrial evolutions as it must enable the  Moroccan to actively and efficiently participate in the economic  and cultural development of the society. It is high time we  drew lessons from our various policies to adjust our needs and  ambitions to the available means...we must take into account the  increasing budget burdens that might in the short run force the  public finance to make choices detrimental to economic  development and social dignity, the sovereign said before  concluding `the Moroccan people is expecting you to present a  frame of a national dimension, putting an end to the era of  hesitation and fulfilling its legitimate ambitions'.</p>

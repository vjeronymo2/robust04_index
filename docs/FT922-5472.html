			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Cookery Courses: The proof of the Norman pudding . . . - All over Europe, FT writers have been slaving over hot stoves to pick some of THE situation must be quite idyllic in season: a Second Empire manor house built in honey coloured sandstone, surrounded by its own park and lying just 2km from the Channel at Port-en-Bessin. If you point your nose in the other direction, within five minutes you can be in the centre of Bayeux with its cathedral and tapestry. Off-season the weather can be as treacherous as that in Britain: walking down to the coast on the day of our arrival I was all but blown out to sea by a freak gust of wind. La Cheneviere is a 15-bedroom country house hotel which opened just four years ago. Already it has received a number of very positive reviews, especially for the quality of its kitchen. The rooms are extremely comfortable and golf courses and stables abound for hearty guests. For the more sedentary the hotel is well situated for excursions to local beauty spots. The cookery weekends at La Cheneviere are organised by Arblaster and Clarke, a Hampshire company which specialises in wine tours. The four-day trip to Normandy includes 1 1/2 days spent visiting Calvados producers with plenty of opportunites to sample local ciders. On the last day of the cookery course we were also treated to a calvados tasting put on by Yan, La Cheneviere's maitre d'hotel. This proved one of the most popular extra-curricular events on the course. The chef at La Cheneviere is Francois Laurent, a tall, shy man in his late 20s whose self-confidence tends to desert him as soon as he leaves his kitchen. Within his domain, however, he is an able teacher and communicator, with a good command of English. Laurent and his team showed admirable patience when it came to dealing with a posse of cack-handed interlopers clogging up the usual flow of a fast-moving kitchen. There were eight people in the group. Apart from one professional couple, the rest were retired. Lynette Arblaster, who accompanied the group and acted as interpreter, thought the relative seniority of the participants quite usual given the length of the trip: younger people tend to find it difficult to take four days off. The two cookery sessions took place on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. We were split into three groups and each of the three prepared a course. When an important technique needed to be understood, Laurent halted the class and brought us all together to demonstrate the principle; when this was over we returned to our separate corners of the kitchen. The high points in these demonstrations were: the puff pastry (with Laurent whacking the butter into shape with his rolling pin); different stocks and courts bouillons; the uses of pork caul; creme patissiere and sabayons; filleting fish; how to use unripe or overripe cheese in tarts or ramekins and, of course, all sorts of creamy, buttery, appley Norman specialities suitably splashed with calvados. What struck me as quaint at the time was the readiness of our group to prepare things which they would have eaten only with the greatest reluctance. The greatest interest was elicited by the preparation of puddings, cakes and biscuits, and I can imagine that some of these have already been served up to friends of the participants in Wales, Hampshire and Surrey. Although there was considerable interest in trying the products of our labours, on the two occasions we ate in the hotel dining room, we were offered a menu devised and prepared by Laurent. We never learned what happened to our own chef d'oeuvres. I suspect they must have been consumed by the staff. With just two cookery sessions the workload was comparatively light. Saturday lunch we ate in a ferme auberge a few miles down the road before visiting the pontoon harbour at Arromanches - and spending the rest of the afternoon in Bayeux. Bayeux was also our destination on Sunday, where we were due to lunch at the Lion d'Or, the only local restaurant with a Michelin star. Before lunch there was the chance to visit the tapestry and look at scenes of feasting Normans who, like us, were fortifying themselves prior to setting sail for England.

By 18:00 only 12 per cent of  registered electors had turned up at polling stations.    "The elections have been simply foiled and 200 million  roubles thrown away," said Sergey Larionov, head of the managing  department of the city mayor's office and member of the Regional  Electoral Commission. He blamed poor results of elections not  on a low turnout, but rather on those who scheduled the  elections and who turned out to be totally devoid of an ability  to forecast the situation.    St. Petersburg - A little over 20 per cent of registered  electors had turned up at polling stations of the Leningrad  region. However, some constituencies and rural regions in  particular, reported a good turnout which in some regions  reached 28-30 per cent.    The St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has ordered  elections to the St. Petersburg city assembly to be extended  until 22:00 p.m. Monday. The mayor issued this instruction at  the request of representatives of electoral commissions  concerned about a poor turnout in the polls, which might render  the results of elections in St. Petersburg null and void.    Orel - A turnout of 36.3 per cent had been reported by 17:30  p.m. in the Orel region, exceeding the minimum 25 per level  necessary to consider the polls to be valid.    Vologda - Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission of  the Vologda region, Sergey Pervushin, told ITAR-TASS that by  18:00 p.m. Sunday the minimum 25 per cent barrier had been  overcome in all rural districts and two constituencies of the  regional centre.    In the city of Cherepovets, only 17 per cent of registered  electors took part in the polls and it is unlikely that the  necessary 25 per cent turnout will be reached by the end of the  polls, Pervushin said.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Kleinwort trades Two large share trades, early in the trading session, alerted the market to the fact that a substantial stake in Kleinwort Benson, one of the City's leading merchant banks and a big force in the UK securities market, had changed hands. The Seaq ticker revealed two major deals in the shares. The first, a block of 7.8m traded for cash at 500p and the second a block of 7, at 498p. It was later confirmed that American International Group (AIG), a leading US insurance group, had sold its 6.6 per cent stake in Kleinwort Benson, acquired in 1988. The deal was said to have been carried out by SG Warburg Securities. AIG's sale of its Kleinwort stake came the day after Kleinwort shares climbed to their highest level since the October 1987 crash. The share price edged up by one penny to 508p yesterday with trading volume of 15m shares.</p>

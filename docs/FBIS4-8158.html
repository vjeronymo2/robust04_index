			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The government's policy statement has been  debated at the two-day session of the parliamentary committee  for the national economy and the budget. Deputy Prime Minister  Brigita Schmoegnerova took part in today's session. After the  session, our correspondent Bibiana Gunisova asked the  committee's deputy chairman, Jozef Kosnar, to assess the session:    [Begin recording] [Kosnar] As ensues from our committee's  portfolio, the main points on the agenda were the points of  departure for, and the risks of economic development. These  include risks related to the period covering not only this  government's term of office but especially the risks of the  budget economy up until the end of 1994.    We also considered ways of eliminating these risks and  creating a possibly more favorable point of departure for the  development of both the budget economy and the macroeconomic  indexes in the following period--that is, in 1995.    [Gunisova] From your point of view, are these risks  appropriate?    [Kosnar] These risks are greater than the previous  government  was willing to admit when approving the 1994 state budget.  [passage omitted]    [Gunisova] In your opinion and according to the committee  for  the national economy and the budget, are the proposals for  tackling economic problems presented in the government's policy  statement acceptable and realistic?    [Kosnar] This is a peculiar situation. The debate was very  simple. No serious objections were raised against the measures,  the philosophy or the outlines of concrete solutions, or the  more detailed explanation presented by the ministers and the  deputy prime minister.    However, when it came to the vote, a certain party  discipline  prevailed, and so the result of the vote was that the resolution  did not receive the simple majority needed for it to be adopted  by the committee, due to the fact that the deputies for the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia opposed this goverment policy  statement.

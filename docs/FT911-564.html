			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / SIB wins judgment in investment case THE Securities and In-vestments Board has obtained a Pounds 3.6m judgment against a man it alleged was the 'moving spirit' behind a scheme which resulted in UK investors losing Pounds 3m. The money had been put into Hamilton House Associates, a Birkenhead-based investment business. The High Court granted SIB an indefinite extension of an order freezing the assets of Mr Neil Bradshaw, who was said to have fled to the US. Mr Craig Orr, for SIB, told Mr Justice Mummery the new order was needed to help SIB enforce the Pounds 3.6m judgment, which included interest on the lost funds. He said none of the money, which had been transferred to the US, had been repaid, 'and it is unlikely that any of it will'. Mr Orr said small investors in the UK had given money to Hamilton House Associates to be invested on their behalf. The company transferred the money to Consolidated Sterling Deposits of California. Mr Bradshaw was president of CSD and Hughes Flint, its Californian parent. Mr Orr said Mr Bradshaw was not formally a director of CSD's UK agent, West Coast Securities (UK). But that company acted on Mr Bradshaw's instructions. West Coast had marketed the investments in the UK, using material alleged to have been misleading and in breach of the Financial Services Act. The Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (Fimbra) ordered Hamilton House Associates to stop trading in February last year. About 300 investors had invested in what were marketed as fully secured and guaranteed bonds. In April last year it emerged that investors could not redeem their investments before 1994 and would not receive any interest payments. In February, SIB obtained injunctions freezing assets of Mr Bradshaw; Hamilton House; Mr Terence Payne and Mr James Holden, directors of Hamilton House; West Coast Securities (UK); and Mr Michael Dunning, a West Coast director.</p>

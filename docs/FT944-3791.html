			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Cuba threat Congressman Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat and a promoter of the Cuban Democracy Act which tightened the US embargo against Cuba in 1992, is promising legislation in Congress next year to attack businesses in other countries which work with Cuba. He said he would introduce a bill requiring the US government to deny visas to directors of companies which work with 'stolen US property' in Cuba. This would target particularly UK, Spanish and Mexican businesses that have bought expropriated assets in Cuban industries, such as cement and oil.</p>

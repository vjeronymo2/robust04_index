			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> 5. How does the new definition affect less-than-full-time students?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The definition does not affect part-time students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A student who completes fewer than the required minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of clock or credit hours during the 30-week  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period should be considered less-than-full-time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The length of the academic year is irrelevant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the enrollment status of students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Enrollment status is determined by the length of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (in terms of credit or clock hours) that a student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takes to complete a ``program.'' [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 --> II. Eligible Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> A. Effective July 1, 1993, section 481(b) and (c) of the HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require a proprietary institution of higher education or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postsecondary vocational institution to provide an eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program of training that prepares students for gainful employment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a recognized occupation. Section 481(e) of the HEA requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an eligible program to consist of at least 600 clock hours,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 semester hours, or 24 quarter hours offered during a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 15 weeks, if the program admits students who have not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed the equivalent of an associate degree. An eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program must consist of at least 300 clock hours, eight semester  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours, or 12 quarter hours offered during a minimum of ten weeks,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the program is an undergraduate program requiring the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent of an associate degree for admission or if the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a graduate or professional program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary is required to develop regulations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the quality of educational programs of less than 600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clock hours. Those regulations must, at a minimum, require those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> educational programs to have verified completion and placement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates of at least 70 percent. An educational program of more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 300 clock hours and less than 600 clock hours that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's regulations qualifies for eligibility under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Family Education Loan programs even if the educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is not an undergraduate program requiring the equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an associate degree for admission, and even if the educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is not a graduate or professional program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issues that the community was asked to address and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community's views:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What is the equivalent of an associates degree?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should be a degree which meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree requirements of any State for an associate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any educational program that meets State licensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements and that equals at least the length of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical associate degree program. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any educational program leading to a vocational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective if the program is at least 1,800 clock hours,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (60 or 48) semester hours, or (90 or 64) quarter hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (The variation in credit hours depends on whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiators decide to use the number of credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to earn an associate degree or the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits required for completion of at least two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic years.) [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an educational program that is at least two academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years in length. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An associates degree should represent the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an educational program leading to licensure in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupation, if a community college offers an associate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree program for that occupation.

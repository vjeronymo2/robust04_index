			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Meeting of the Bizerte Governorage </F> Regional Council: Solutions to Several Social Problems"]    [Text] The Bizerte governorate regional council held its  first meeting of 1994 last Saturday; the meeting was chaired by  Mr. Mohamed Soudani, governor of Bizerte, and attended by the  general secretary of the RCD [Democratic Constitutional Rally]  coordination committee, and delegates and officials from  regional technical and administrative departments.    At the meeting, the council amended the 1993 budget. The  council also reviewed the progress of various 1993 economic and  social programs and current year's programs, to which an  estimated budget of 100.9 million dinars[D] was allocated  (compared with D172 million in 1992 and 1993).    The council also declared itself pleased with the major  initiatives taken on a regional and national scale in order to  boost the spirit of solidarity during Ramadan, which resulted in  D170,000 worth of aid for the underprivileged (this amount will  be distributed to 6,863 needy families). Add to this the  effective support offered by the seven solidarity restaurants  opened in Bizerte, Menzel Bourguiba, Zarzouna, and Tinja to help  820 disadvantaged individuals.    The governorate has also received a large quantity of  clothing, for distribution to these 820 citizens.    Similarly, the governor informed the council that a solution  had been found to several other social problems, like those  involving workers at the Ichkeul quarries, closed because of  damage to the environment, or the dockers of the Bizerte  commercial harbor.    On the other hand, the council took note with pleasure of  the  17-percent drop in additional job applications, which totaled  3,394 in 1993 compared with 3,983 the year before; this was due  to a decrease in the number of school dropouts and an increase  in the number of young people applying for training in the  area's various vocational schools.    Apart from that, a study of the economy disclosed that  planned 1994 regional investments amounted to D100.9 million, of  which 60 percent will be allocated to productive sectors such as  agriculture, fisheries, and the industry, 28 percent to basic  community facilities, and 6.4 percent to cleaning up and  pollution control.    Speaking of the tourism sector, the governor stated that  construction of at least two hotels will start in 1994, the  owners having completed all required procedures, whereas, two  other tourism developers are about to complete their  applications.</p>

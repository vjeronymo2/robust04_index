			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Security Council Deputy Secretary Vladimir </F> Rubanov: "Militia and Special Forces Increase by 52,000 Men.  Security Council Deputy Secretary Vladimir Rubanov Comments on  the President's Edict `On Urgent Measures for the Implementation  of the Russian Federation Federal Program To Reinforce the Fight  Against Crime for 1994-1995'"]    [Text] The edict ratifies the Federal Program for the Fight  Against Crime and determines measures to implement it, and this  is possibly the most important thing in the document. In  itself, the edict, which was adopted at the level of the highest  Russian executive power, determines the status of the federal  program.    Furthermore, it is important that the edict solves a  financial problem. At the same time, specific instructions are  being given to the government and responsibility for  implementation is placed upon ministries and departments. And  it must not be forgotten that this is an instruction from the  president.    It is also important that the Security Council -- one of the  initiators and elaborators of the program -- is the structure  which is effecting the implementation of the program. Despite  the fact that the implementation of the program is calculated to  take two years, specific measures to fight crime by means of  what are known as organizational actions are already being  outlined now. Furthermore, the program is a federal one and  settles problems at federal level. But this does not mean that  the organs of local authority should sit and wait for the  results of its implementation.    The president's edict provides a possibility of adopting  regional programs for the fight against crime, taking into  consideration criminal factors which occur in a particular  region. Every component of the Federation has the possibility to  reinforce measures aimed at the fight against crime at their own  level and using their own resources. And the program shows how  this can be done.    Apart from the set of legislative acts adopted at State Duma  level, the edict stipulates the adoption of measures at  government level too. That is, questions of child neglect and  crimes committed by minors can already be settled at the level  of existing legislation.    The edict makes it possible to maneuver the manpower and  resources at the disposal of the executive organs of power, and  settle a number of problems concerning the improvement of the  material-technical conditions of the activity of the law  enforcement organs and other structures involved in the fight  against crime.    Apart from that, these measures may be adopted in a  practical  and efficient way before legislative initiatives appear. And in  this case, it is a question of involving citizens, the public,  in the fight against crime -- in the formation of subunits which  used to be called the people's patrol. The Foreign Ministry has  been called upon to deal with the problems of the uncontrolled  migration of the population, which has become more complex in  recent years. The Foreign Ministry is to reinforce monitoring of  these processes.    The edict changes the situation which prevails in  judicial-expert institutions, which are currently in a terrible  state and are equal to academic scientific institutes in terms  of payment. At the same time they work hand in hand with  specialists from the "power" structures, which are in a  different situation. All this could not fail to affect the  cadres of these institutions: Specialists have moved to other  structures of law enforcement organs or left altogether. The  loss of specialists of that class could not fail to have an  effect on the work of the law enforcement organs. This question  has been resolved by the edict.    A number of measures still require legalization by  legislation. Thus, forgery is currently rife. This has  basically occurred because of the emergence of color  photocopiers. The edict envisages the strict monitoring of this  type of duplicating machinery.    Ministries and departments were instructed to prepare a  number of legislative acts to be published in this federal  program. In particular, instructions were also given on the  questions on which the organs of internal affairs themselves  deemed it necessary to make amendments to existing legislation.  They have drawn up their proposals, which have been reflected  in the edict. The president's edict also makes it possible for  appeals to be made to the legislative power in a legally correct  form to legalize the rights which the organs of internal affairs  need in order to intensify the fight against crime.    The fact that the subunits and special troops involved in  the  fight against crime have increased by 52,000 men should be noted  as an important thing in the edict. As we know, the Army is  only used to repel an enemy, but we also know that a lot of  situations have arisen in the past few years and are still  arising when military support and special troops are needed.    The edict also envisages measures to strengthen security at  ports, stations, and airports. Special subunits are now being  created which will accompany trains, both on suburban and  interurban routes; this has been brought about by the increasing  danger on railroads. The customs services have not been  forgotten either. Within the framework of the conversion  program, installations, military camps, and resources (which do  not require a burden on the budget) which are being freed up by  military units are being transferred to the structures involved  in the fight against crime. These are just some of the  important aspects which it will be possible to settle thanks to  the issuing of this edict.</p>

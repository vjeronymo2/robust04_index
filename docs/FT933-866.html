			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / People: TUC picks Feikart for Brussels The Trades Union Congress has made an imaginative choice in the first head of its Brussels office. David Feikart, 47, is not well known outside the mining industry in Britain, but is an experienced lobbyist in Europe - and speaks good French. Feikart has spent most of the past 10 years working in the research department, and latterly as head of research, at the National Union of Mineworkers. After a first degree in his native New Zealand, he came to Britain to study Ergonomics at Birmingham University. Later at Bradford University he did some work on mechanisation in the coal industry and predicted the job losses of the following decade - figures that were ridiculed at the time. In 1983 he moved to the NUM in Sheffield, just before the year-long miners' strike. Although committed to the miners' cause, he eventually found the paranoid atmosphere at NUM hq unbearable and left, earlier this year, to become an energy consultant. The Brussels office is due to open on December 1 by which time he and his family will have decided whether to move house or whether he will be a long-distance commuter.</p>

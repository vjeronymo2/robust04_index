			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Pena from Tuxtla Gutierrez; from the </F> "Upon Awakening" newscast]    [Text] Forty of the 100 individuals who were held against  their will by rebel groups in Guadalupe Tepeyac, Las Margaritas  Municipality, arrived early this morning. These individuals  arrived yesterday [as heard] from that area, after they were  released; in addition, 60 others who were held hostage at the  Social Security Hospital in that area were also released. They  all said they were held against their will. Relatives of the  doctors and nurses who could not leave the town since 30  December were also accompanying them.    Apparently, that area is still under rebel control. It is  expected that the situation here will be normalized very soon,  within a few hours or days, as the rebels will withdraw to the  highlands in Chiapas.</p>

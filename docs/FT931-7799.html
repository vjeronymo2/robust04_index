			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Kim chooses ex-general as premier MR HWANG IN-SUNG, a former general, cabinet minister and corporate executive, was appointed South Korean prime minister by the country's president-elect yesterday. The choice of Mr Hwang indicates the sort of balancing act Mr Kim Young-sam, who will be inaugurated as president this week, is performing in his political appointments. While Mr Kim has named political and economic reformers as his presidential advisers, he is expected to appoint mainly conservative politicians from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party to fill cabinet positions. Mr Hwang is a senior DLP official responsible for policy, with emphasis on the economy. He favours stimulative measures to revive the ailing economy and has criticised present tight monetary policy. He opposes the opening of the country's rice market to foreign competition. Mr Hwang's views on the economy conflict with some of those held by Mr Kim's reform-minded economic advisers. That could indicate a possible struggle between the Blue House, the executive mansion, and the cabinet. The selection of Mr Hwang was somewhat surprising since Mr Kim, the country's first civilian leader in 32 years, had been expected to appoint someone without a military background to stress the new government's democratic character. But Mr Kim has to appease the majority faction of the DLP affiliated with Mr Roh Tae-woo, the current president and a former general. Mr Kim comes from a minority group within the party. Mr Hwang spent most of his military career in financial administration before serving in the cabinets of Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh during the 1980s. His appointment will promote harmony within the DLP, and is meant to reduce regional rivalry in the country. Mr Hwang is a native of Cholla region, the most underdeveloped area in South Korea and the stronghold of the opposition Democratic Party. Mr Hwang was a former provincial governor in Cholla and is one of only two ruling party MPs from that area, which normally gives 90 per cent of its vote to the Democratic Party. He became the first president of Asiana Airlines, South Korea's second biggest air carrier, in 1988 before returning to parliament.</p>

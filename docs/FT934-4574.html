			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Spanish telephone group in partnership Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, said yesterday it planned to enter into 'intensive co-operation' with Unisource, the joint venture linking the telecom companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The move is widely regarded as a first step towards Telefonica's taking an equity stake in Unisource, which is aimed at providing one-stop telecommunications services to the world's multinationals. PTT Telecom, the Dutch shareholder in Unisource, said: 'We don't rule out the possibility that Telefonica will become a shareholder at a later stage.' Unisource is fighting to establish itself in the field of 'outsourcing' in direct competition with ventures by AT&amp;T, British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. Telefonica will not be able to enter into deals with Unisource's competitors.</p>

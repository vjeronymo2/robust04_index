			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Ryabov: "Immediate, but Not Medical </F> Attention: What Russian Drug Addicts Receive Instead of Medical  Care"]    [Text]    The militia is arousing alarm publishing its reports about  the number of drug addicts and crimes connected with drug  dealing. Already it appears that the influx of harmful  substances into Russia cannot be restrained. However, Russian  laws are oriented toward making the same mistakes that have  already been made in Western countries, harshly punishing drug  users. The state shows little mercy for those who suffer from  drug addiction.    ...Four years ago he sat on the dirty stones of the Arbat,  burying his face between his knees. People emerged from the drug  store, huddling themselves up from the piercing autumn wind, not  even trying to help him to his feet.    He was in complete despair. The last of his money had been  spent on "grass." His bills were already past due a month  before, and his friends had turned their backs on him. The  watchful pharmacy staff absolutely refused to issue him the drug  he needed without a prescription. He was on the needle, a heroin  addict. All he had left was to die.  <H5>  Near "Natasha" </H5>   ...The stereotype of drug dealers and users has been  somewhat  shaken. Usually the images of these type people are just the  opposite, but... In a self-assured gait a young man in a long  coat approached three importune teenagers in torn dirty jeans.    It was eight o'clock in the evening, a Sunday. They stood  two  meters from me in a stairway leading to an underground passage  on Pushkin Square near the "Natasha" store. After a few seconds  of negotiation, the most enlivened "grungy-looking" youth made  up his mind:    -- I know him, in fact. Everything is O.K., we can take a  walk, and he nudged his companions in the back.    They were not the only ones, however, who had turned into  the  archway near the theater ticket booth. A middle-aged man, who up  until then had been standing unnoticed near a telephone booth,  lit a cigarette and set out after the four.    Two of them walked ahead, apparently talking about some good  high. They were soon overtaken by the buyer and dealer "on  duty," who were slipping on the worn icy slope. I did not follow  them down, but I could clearly see them standing at the bottom  of the decline. The ritual of selling several match boxes of  hash, as hashish is sometimes called, was not of interest. What  interested me was this new character. I had heard about  informants in plain clothes hired by the militia to trail people.    The dealers and their client went down to the end of the  street and disappeared into an entry way. Near drug trafficking  "points" there are always apartments where the drugs for sale  are kept. The client, of course, does not go in, but waits for  the goods nearby. In order not to let the buyer out of their  sight, dealers do not work alone.    Most likely, the "spy" had grown tired after a long day's  work. Having gone halfway, he turned around and went back to  where he had come. Was his workday over? Having returned to his  original position, he met up with two policemen on patrol, who  had been distracted in the passageway, shooing away some old  women peddling all sorts of junk.    -- I just got through calling. The chief let me off. Can I  go  home? Tomorrow I will be back at 10 a.m. sharp, he told the  policemen.    Dreary from the cold, the civil servants gave their  "colleague" a disdainful glance and let him go. He was not the  only one of his kind at their service. While walking along the  passage they stopped several times, first to have a little word  with two big men with shaven heads, then with a heavily made-up  prostitute. The young lady told the civil guardians about the  movements of some "chick in a fur coat." Several minutes later,  as though friends, they both sat on an iron box near the  escalator and, while dangling their boots, shelled seeds...  <H5>  A Racket in Uniform </H5>   The militia is fighting against the social order. The police  sergeant stops anyone that seems suspicious to him, of which  there are many on Pushkin Square. Ilya lives close by. His outer  appearance unfortunately arouses an inexplicable tension in  policemen. It seems to them that the reason he frequently stands  at the metro entrance is not that he lives close by, but  something else.    -- Every other day they stop me. What am I guilty of, having  a suspicious appearance?    During curfew hours, imposed not long after the events in  October, the militia organizes round-ups at all the suspicious  places where non-conformists gather. An entire detachment of  OMON officers [Special Purpose Militia Detachment], arriving on  a bus late in the evening searched the apartments where the  followers of Petlyura live, the designer and charismatic leader  of the youth underground. They found nothing. How did they know  that drugs were there? It is incomprehensible.    The militia is doing its duty. Our legislation makes no  distinction between those dealing drugs and those using them.  Anyone found with drugs during a search can end up in jail. In  any quantity. So the militia searches. The more people they stop  the greater chance of guessing right...    Not all who are caught go to the police station, however.  The  Law frequently resorts to being an official racket; if there is  no money, identification information is taken down and threats  are made to "take them in" if no money appears.    Chances of finding the needed drug dealer or user on the  street are great for the militia. According to infrequent polls,  the number of occasional drug users in the CIS at the beginning  of last year neared 8 million. A year before that there were  approximately 1.5 million. These figures were arrived at after  estimating the volume of drugs in circulation within the borders  of the former USSR.  <H5>  Life -- No High </H5>   It is well known that the majority of narcotic substances  come into Russia from Central Asia and Afghanistan. The  Tajik-Afghanistan borders represent the same line of fire for  Russian security services as the U.S.-Mexican border does for  Americans.    However, aside from organic drugs in Russia, there are a  large number of synthetic substances. When borders were still  tight, amateur chemists filled the drug void with their  inexpensive goods. Today their experience is not going to waste.    There are quite a lot of underground laboratories in St.  Petersburg. They are closely tied to the market in Moscow. One  of the most productive laboratories of LSD in the northern  capital had to shut down, (according to rumors, "limos with six  doors rolled up to the person in charge, and out slid enlivened  youths who announced that instead of homemade acid, they were  going to bring in real American acid, nicknamed "California  Sunshine [Kaliforniyskoye solnyshko])," whereupon a deficit of  this particular drug formed in Moscow.    At fashionable, although not altogether young parties,  almost  everyone has access to dealers of all types of drugs. LSD and  "grass" are especially popular in this environment, however.  Heroin, which is considered a crude drug, is used by the most  unfortunate. Cocaine is the preferred drug of both the mafia,  and people wishing to give the pretense of being part of the  establishment, as well as those who just "get lucky."    The militia's fight against drug dealing in Russia boils  down  to catching any violator with drugs in his or her possession, in  any amount. It matters not what kind. They are all considered  criminals, even the drug addict, that is, a person who  physically cannot live without doing drugs. The militia is least  interested in the medical aspects of the problem.    A young man, free of prejudice and with a mind of his own,  told me:    -- Drugs will always be around. They are a harmful  temptation, which a certain segment of the population will never  be able to give up. The fight against drugs is fruitless as long  as there are these kinds of people. And they will be around,  because life will never be like a drug high.    ...The crisis for the young man in front of the drug store  fortunately passed. He recovered. He did not resort to crime. It  was medical care that saved him, however, not the punitive sword  of the law, with which he clashed during his fall into the abyss.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Home Affairs Minister Hajime  Ishii said Friday [3 June] he has given up the chairmanship of a  group of Japanese legislators promoting friendship with North  Korea "to avoid misunderstanding" amid calls for Tokyo to take a  tougher line against Pyongyang over its suspected nuclear arms  development.    "I have not harbored any intentions of viewing South Korea  as  an enemy or siding with North Korea," Ishii, who had served as  chairman of the Dietmen's League for Promotion of Japan-Korea  Friendship, told a news conference.    Ishii, concurrently serving as chairman of the National  Public Safety Commission, has been under pressure from the No. 1  opposition Liberal Democratic Party to quit the chairmanship in  view of his status as a cabinet minister and head of the  commission in charge of gathering intelligence on North Korean  agents. "I have to avoid misunderstanding as chairman of the  National Public Safety Commission amid the North Korean  (nuclear) issue and domestic issues," he said.    The LOS ANGELES TIMES and some Japanese media have claimed  that the presence of Ishii and other alleged supporters of North  Korea in the ruling coalition would deter it from regulating the  flow of money to the isolated communist nation from  pro-Pyongyang Korean residents of Japan.</p>

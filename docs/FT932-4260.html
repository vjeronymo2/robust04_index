			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / MPs urge probe of VSEL dealing ALLEGATIONS of insider trading in the shares of VSEL, the armaments and submarine consortium, before it received the government's Pounds 160m helicopter carrier contract were made yesterday by two Labour MPs. Mr Nick Brown, MP for Newcastle East and Mr Stephen Byers, MP for Wallsend, have written to the Stock Exchange demanding an investigation into share dealings in the Cumbria-based company, and to the National Audit Office which has already launched an inquiry into the bidding war over the contract. The inquiry by the NAO, the government's spending watchdog, will have to decide, among other issues, how the consortium of VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan merchant shipyard in Glasgow was able to undercut Swan Hunter, the last shipbuilder in north east England, by Pounds 50m. Swans went into receivership last month after failing to win the contract. The MPs said yesterday that the sharp increase in the price of VSEL shares between October, 1992 and last month, when the order was announced, 'strongly suggested some form of insider dealing,' and had 'all the hallmarks of a stock market scandal'. The letter to Mr Michael Feltham, head of the Stock Exchange surveillance department, says that the 'extraordinary move' in VSEL shares during the period suggested that 'someone may have had inside knowledge of the government's real intention and, having had access to market sensitive information, used it to purchase shares in VSEL prior to the public announcement of the helicopter carrier order.' They believe the government made the important decisions on the contract last October and constructed the rest of the tender process in such a way that Swan Hunter could not win. Only a limited number of insiders would have had access to the information. The Stock Exchange said yesterday it never commented on any inquiry into dealings.</p>

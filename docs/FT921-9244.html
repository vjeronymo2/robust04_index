			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Reuters profits increase 6.3% in spite of fall in new orders REUTERS Holdings, the financial information and news company, reported a 6.3 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 340.3m, in spite of continuing weak conditions in its traditional markets. The number of employees fell by 475 to 10,335 and the group incurred rationalisation costs of Pounds 23.5m in Europe and North America. It also warned that further cuts might be necessary this year. Mr Peter Job, managing director, said Reuters had experienced a big fall in new orders at the end of 1990, and had reacted by improving efficiency. He added: 'In the near term, market recovery is not in sight and we expect revenue growth to slow further in 1992, particularly since, in response to our customers' needs, we have generally avoided increasing prices.' Turnover rose 7.1 per cent to Pounds 1.47bn in the year to December 31, while earnings per share increased 10.5 per cent to 54.7p (49.5p). Strong cash flow increased net cash from Pounds 217.1m to Pounds 502.9m and interest income rose from Pounds 30.4m to Pounds 49.6m. Because of its strong balance sheet, Reuters increased the final dividend to 12.3p (10.6p), raising the total by 13.3 per cent to 17p. The dividend cover falls from 3.29 to 3.21. Reuters said the long-delayed second phase of Dealing 2000, its automated trading system which enables foreign exchange traders to complete transactions on-screen, had been successfully tested by 30 banks in London and New York. The group plans a formal launch within weeks. Reuters had also satisfactorily tested Globex, which will provide screen-based trading of futures and options. Globex is being created jointly by Reuters with the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and is to be launched later this year. Mr Job said Reuters had been under great pressure to provide more information about the group, and for the first time had broken down operating profits by geographical area, excluding the rationalisation provisions and central costs of Pounds 113.8m. It said Europe contributed Pounds 305m, compared with Pounds 312m in 1990; Asia Pacific Pounds 124m, up from Pounds 110m; America a loss of Pounds 5m, compared with a loss of Pounds 8m. Visnews, its television agency, made Pounds 1m (Pounds 4m). Reuters shortened the depreciation period for its subscriber terminals from five to four years, at a cost of Pounds 29m. Lex, Page 20</p>

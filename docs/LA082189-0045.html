			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> DESPITE NEW LAWS, U.S. STILL A LURE IN MEXICO  </P> <P> Although most Mexicans believe new U.S. immigration laws have made it more  difficult to find work in the United States, more than 4.7 million Mexican  citizens believe they are very likely to move north in the next year, according  to a Los Angeles Times poll.  </P> <P> It is impossible to know how many will actually emigrate, but according to the  poll, 1.3 million would go to California and 800,000 of those would choose to  look for work in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Jorge Bustamante, a Mexican immigration expert and president of Tijuana's  Colegio de la Frontera Norte, said the numbers reflect "wishful thinking"  rather than reality.  </P> <P> "You're talking about attitudes, not real behavior. That may be how many people  would go if you assume that it is easy, but not when you know that what it  takes to get to the United States is increasingly expensive and difficult," he  said. "A lot of those who say they are going may not make it."  </P> <P> Bustamante estimates that there are now 1.75 million Mexicans living illegally  in the United States, about the same number as last year, before new U.S.  immigration reform laws went into effect. But U.S. officials disagree, saying  illegal immigration appears to have declined.  </P> <P> A majority of Mexicans believe that the landmark agreement between their  government and foreign banks to reduce the foreign debt burden will improve the  country's stagnant economy, the poll found, but they are skeptical that they  will feel the effects personally.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, they say, the country has become so impoverished that half of all  Mexican children may suffer from hunger. Asked if their friends' and neighbors'  children have enough to eat, 53% of the respondents said "no" and, among the  poor, 69% said the children are sometimes hungry.  </P> <P> More than 1,800 Mexicans were interviewed on a wide range of political and  economic issues from Aug. 5-13. Times poll director I. A. Lewis said the  nationwide survey has a margin of error of three percentage points in either  direction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Joblessness, Debt Cited  </P> <P> Unemployment and the foreign debt are the top problems facing the country, most  of those questioned said. But while President Carlos Salinas de Gortari blames  debt and low international oil prices for the nation's economic ills, most  Mexicans blame the crisis on governmental corruption and on the policies of the  previous administration of President Miguel de la Madrid.  </P> <P> Salinas was budget and planning secretary in that administration, and during  the campaign last year, voters apparently held him responsible for six years of  economic stagnation and a 50% drop in real wages. Salinas won with 50.4% of the  official vote count in the presidential election, the lowest winning margin for  a candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in the six decades that it  has ruled.  </P> <P> But Mexicans have ceased to identify Salinas with the last administration, the  poll found. Now, three-fourths of those interviewed said they generally approve  of his handling of the economy, although they do not agree with all of his  policies.  </P> <P> For example, more than half said that Salinas should continue to encourage  foreign investment in Mexico, an idea that once was a political taboo in the  highly nationalistic country; but two-thirds of all Mexicans object to the  government's sale of state-owned companies. Surprisingly, that number was  higher among the wealthy classes who normally tend to support free enterprise.  </P> <P> Sixty-two percent of the wealthy said they are better off today than they were  six years ago, whereas 37% of the lower class said they are getting poorer.  </P> <P> Expectations about the economy also vary dramatically between rich and poor.  Seventy-three percent of the wealthy expect their financial situation to  improve by the end of Salinas' term in 1994, whereas only 31% of the poor  believe that they will be better off.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Economic Escape Valve  </P> <P> The United States remains an economic escape valve. Almost 6% of those  responding to the poll said they were "very likely" to take up residence in the  United States within the next year. In a country of about 85 million people,  that is the equivalent of more than 4.7 million would-be emigrants. Another 16%  said they were "fairly" likely to move north within the next year.  </P> <P> Asked where they would go if they had to leave Mexico, 31% of those interviewed  pointed north, and the same percentage insisted that they would not abandon  Mexico under any circumstances.  </P> <P> Almost a third of those interviewed said they had already visited the United  States, and 42% said they have relatives living there. But only 7% said they or  someone in their household receives financial support from relatives in the  United States.  </P> <P> New U.S. laws that imposed sanctions on the employers of illegal aliens have  discouraged illegal immigration, 62% of those interviewed said. Sixty percent  said they believed that it is now harder to find work in the United States.  </P> <P> Although 22% of those interviewed said they may take up residence in the United  States within the next year, U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg, a  supervisor for the San Diego sector, was encouraged by the perception that it  is more difficult to find work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An 'Economic Push'  </P> <P> "Even though the laws change on this side of the border, there is still an  economic push in those countries (such as Mexico), but it's a beginning. If  only one in five want to come, that's a good deterrent," he said.  </P> <P> Gregg said that detentions in the San Diego sector, the busiest area along the  border, have dropped from a high of 629,656 in fiscal year 1986 to 431,592 last  year. He said that 309,000 have been detained this fiscal year, which ends in  September.  </P> <P> Gregg noted that part of the drop may be due to the legalization of about 3  million immigrants who now may go back and forth across the border legally.  </P> <P> But Bustamante charges that the Immigration and Naturalization Service tinkered  with its figures by stepping up patrols before the immigration legislation was  passed by Congress and reducing enforcement since the law went into effect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Significant Difference'  </P> <P> "They manipulate the number of hours they dedicate to apprehensions. There is  no significant difference between the numbers (of illegal immigrants) last year  and this year," Bustamante said.  </P> <P> In the poll, 23% of those who said they were in some degree likely to move to  the United States picked California as their destination, and 14% specifically  chose Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Those polled said they like the culture (18%), democratic tradition (17%) and  equality (12%) in the United States, but above all, they said they like the  "economic opportunity" (41%). Sixteen percent said they liked the fact that it  is a rich country.  </P> <P> Asked what they dislike about the United States, many responded that the  country is "domineering" (24%), "patronizing" (22%) and that there is  "discrimination" (38%). But 42% said what they disliked was the extent of the  drug problem in their neighbor to the north.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Nation's Woes: The View From Mexico  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Times Poll on Mexican politics was based on face-to-face interviews with  1,835 Mexican adults. It was conducted Aug.5-13 in 42 randomly selected towns  and cities throughout Mexico. It has a margin of error of 3 percentage points  in either direction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Around Here, Do Children Get Enough to Eat or Are They Hungry?  </P> <P> Enough: 34  </P> <P> Hungry: 53  </P> <P> Don't know: 13  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Important Problem  </P> <P> Unemployment: 45  </P> <P> Foreign debt: 38  </P> <P> Corruption: 23  </P> <P> Pollution: 21  </P> <P> Inflation: 19  </P> <P> Crime: 10  </P> <P> Population growth: 9  </P> <P> Family breakdown: 2  </P> <P> Public health: 2  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where Would You Prefer to Live in U.S.?  </P> <P> Los Angeles: 14  </P> <P> Rest of California: 9  </P> <P> Other border state: 9  </P> <P> Chicago: 4  </P> <P> New York: 4  </P> <P> Washington D.C.: 2  </P> <P> Someplace else: 12  </P> <P> Nowhere in U.S.: 33  </P> <P> Don't know: 13  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans To Live in U.S. Next Year  </P> <P> Very likely: 6  </P> <P> Fairly likely: 16  </P> <P> Fairly unlikely: 17  </P> <P> Very unlikely: 17  </P> <P> No plans at all: 42  </P> <P> Don't know: 2  </P> <P> Source: The Times Poll  </P></p>

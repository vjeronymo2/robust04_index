			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Girls overtake boys in academic performance Girls last year overtook boys in virtually every measure of school academic performance, figures released by the Department for Education show. For the first time, a greater proportion of women entered higher education than men, while girls' performance in GCSE exams was sharply superior to boys'. In 1992, 45 per cent of girls passed five GCSEs at grade C or above (equivalent to a pass in the old O-level), while 38 per cent of boys reached the same standard. More girls attempted A-levels (31 per cent against 26 per cent of boys), and 16 per cent passed at least three, compared with 14 per cent of boys. Provisional figures showed that roughly twice as many women as men gained vocational qualifications. On leaving university, total female graduate unemployment last year was 10.6 per cent, compared with 15.1 per cent for men. The Equal Opportunities Commission hailed the results as showing that women's aspirations and expectations of themselves were at last the equal of men's. It said education had been one of the most significant barriers to full equality of opportunity. Only 20 years ago, lack of educational qualifications had been one of the toughest hurdles for women to surmount when looking for jobs, according to the commission. The education department's figures show that women have had to seek work without enough high-level qualifications: men between the ages of 40 and 59 are more than twice as likely than women to hold a university degree, and more than three times as likely to have A-levels. The commission suggested that childcare facilities would have to improve if women were to be able to take full advantage of educational improvements in the jobs market. It also voiced concern that, at university level, male dominance of traditionally 'masculine' science subjects continues. Almost a quarter of men took engineering and technology degrees, compared with less than 5 per cent of women, and men also provided more undergraduates in mathematics, computing and physical sciences. Mr Tim Boswell, the further and higher education minister, welcomed the figures but claimed that sciences were still seen 'too much as no-go areas'. In university degrees, men can claim to provide slightly more examples of excellence, with 8.7 per cent gaining firsts, compared with 5.7 per cent of women. But men also receive more third-class and pass degrees. Women rule the brainwaves, Page 6</p>

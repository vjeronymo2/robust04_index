The  situation is such that our coast is undefended, and the absence  of the F-16 in our space shows that we cannot defend our land  and sea. Mr. Pressler declared Pakistan a hostile nation three  years ago. Perhaps he does not know the difference between  gunpowder and atomic bombs. The American policy shows that they  want to make Pakistan a sacrificial lamb or goat and throw it in  front of the bloodthirsty wolves.    If we review relations between the United States and  Pakistan, it is clear that the United States has not been  faithful even to its good friends. There is an old adage used by  the soldiers in the West: If you are faithful to your friend,  then you are unfaithful to God. The Americans follow this adage  perfectly. In the Gulf War, it started Operation Desert Storm to  help its friends. It then demanded billions of dollars to meet  its war expenses. First it emphasized the need for nuclear power  in Pakistan, and when Pakistan reached its goal of producing  nuclear power, it then began to make noise and asked it to stop.    When India exploded a nuclear bomb in May 1974, it was  commended, even though India had fought wars with both China and  Pakistan. America is extremely powerful, but because of its  biased nature, its foreign policy has been very ineffective. It  is falling in the eyes of the free world. The United States had  no desire for Pakistan to reduce its defense budget. The  Americans praised their agents for this goal, and then had them  raise the slogan that Pakistan must reduce its defense expenses.  Why should we reduce defense expenses? No logical reason was  given for this.    Pakistan has had an open stand, that militarily weak  Pakistan  had always been a "delicious morsel" for India to devour. India  had always suppressed the weak, be it in the Kashmir issue, Goa,  Nepal, Bhutan, Hyderabad (Deccan), Junagarh, Manavdar, Mangrol,  Naxalbari, the Nagas, Mizo tribals, or former East Pakistan.  India always forced itself into any place where it saw weakness.  The Americans always supported India in Asia and have ignored  India's belligerence, war craze, and expansionist designs.    The balance of military power is essential for a stable,  peaceful environment, especially in Asian and African nations;  however, the United States of America has also tried to  establish India's supremacy in Asia. A good air, land, and sea  army is important for any country. If Pakistan wants to  strengthen and stabilize its defense forces, that is its natural  and legal right.    The United States, because of its erroneous policy, or to  gain specific goals, wants to impose restrictions on its  "weapons." If it does not change this attitude, there is the  strong possibility that Pakistan will get its military needs  from Western nations and China.    The United States believes that Pakistan cannot function  without its technology. The Americans are wrong. They are not  fully aware of the skills of the Pakistani people. The question  arises: Since the United States is a trading nation, is it  backing away from its agreement in order to put pressure on  Pakistan to close its nuclear plant? Can the nuclear plant be  closed?    The way the United States wants to disarm Pakistan in the  name of peace in Asia is causing negative results. Just because  of U.S. stubbornness, the whole nation agrees on the point that  Pakistan should make a nuclear bomb, and should talk to other  countries in order to meet its needs.    The Americans should think about it all since they have  themselves made thousands of nuclear bombs and stored them in  safe places, they have spent billions of dollars and established  two "secure places" underground, where nuclear radiation cannot  reach. The Pakistani army is not a police force; it also has to  protect and defend the nation. It also is endangered by India's  expansionist designs. Of course, the armed forces keep the  Pakistani government informed about its needs. The Pakistani  army cannot expect internal and external pressures.    The present Pakistani government, led by Madam Benazir  Bhutto, who represents a strong and flawless political heritage,  is expected to keep in mind the needs of military Pakistan.  Madam Benazir Bhutto surely considers Pakistan more important  than her own life, and she is aware of the needs of our armed  forces. If the Americans do not review their attitude, they will  soon lose their good friends. It is also possible that Benazir  Bhutto will make changes in her new social contract and will  order military training for all men and women under the age 45.  Perhaps the Americans want a peaceful nation to become a  belligerent one; however, the Pakistani people want to benefit  from peaceful but modern technology. The United States should  participate in the effort to make Pakistan a peaceful area, one  that is strong in defense. Every U. S. president has said during  the last half century that a strong, stable America is important  for world peace. Will not a strong Pakistan assure peace in Asia?</p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Better margins boost Rosebys and current period starts well ROSEBYS, the retailer of household textiles, curtains and accessories, lifted pre-tax profit from Pounds 606,000 to Pounds 681,000 in the six months to June 26. Historically the majority of profits come in the second half, according to Mr Roy Waudby, chairman. He added that so far in the current period 'we have experienced a most welcome increase in like for like sales.' In the first half turnover reached Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 20.9m). Operating profit jumped to Pounds 737,000 (Pounds 560,000) reflecting improved margins and strict cost controls. Margins further improved, Mr Waudby said, as a result of continuing the overseas buying policy. Consequently both stocks and net borrowings were higher than normal at the period end, amounting to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 8.9m) and Pounds 4m (Pounds 1.8m) respectively. During the period the number of branches in England and Wales were increased to 148. Since then three more had been opened and it was expected that at least 10 others would be operative in the second half, of which seven would be sited in Scotland. Earnings per share improved to 2.3p (1.9p). The interim dividend goes up to 1.4p (0.9p). The company was floated in March 1992.</p>

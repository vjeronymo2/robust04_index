			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, Feb 15 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation is increasingly critical of apparently  inadequate United Nations plans to monitor Serb artillery around  Sarajevo, sources at NATO headquarters said here Tuesday [15  February].    They said plans by UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) to have  monitors check on Serb artillery stored in Serb barracks did not  amount to proper control.    One source, speaking on condition that he not be identified,  said: "That's not a proper control. We need to be serious about  this. The control has to be strong enough to stop the weapons  being used." [passage omitted]    In Zagreb, UNPROFOR spokesman Matthew Nerzig denied reports  of differences "between the goals pursued by NATO and the UN."  He maintained Tuesday that the UN wanted "effective control" of  the weapons and not mere monitoring.    But Nerzig would not give details of the UN plans, and  conceded that UNPROFOR officials were giving a "broad  interpretation" to the concept of control.    The UNPROFOR spokesman said the NATO ultimatum issued last  week called specifically for "the withdrawal or regrouping and  placing the heavy weapons under UNPROFOR control. Under  UNPROFOR control means just that: this is not a monitoring of  heavy weapons, this is the effective control of those heavy  weapons," he said.    Nerzig quoted a recent statement by the British commander of  UNPROFOR in Bosnia, General Sir Michael Rose, who said there  were many ways of effectively controlling the Serb weapons.  "Those are the ways that are being looked into and being  discussed with the (Serb and Moslem belligerents)," he said.    Nerzig added: "I wouldn't spell out exactly which procedure  or process we are going to use in the variety of cases. We are  working on setting an effective control."</p>

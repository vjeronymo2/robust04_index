			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature; by diplomatic </F> correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia believes that the time has come for the world  community leading members of which are going to attend the  ministerial meeting in Geneva on May 13 to start an energetic  political discussion with the conflicting Bosnian sides.  Otherwise they might never agree. The statement was made in a  Wednesday interview with Interfax by a special envoy of the  Russian president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin.    He added that during the contacts of the last six months the  differences between the sides deepened rather than shrank. "If  this continues, there will be no settlement at all. Therefore  purposeful and energetic influence on the conflicting sides is  necessary," the diplomat said.    He stressed that Moscow expects the Geneva meeting of  foreign  ministers of Russia, the USA, Britain (permanent members of the  UN Security Council), as well as Greece, Germany and Belgium  (representing the EU) to work out a common strategy for a  Bosnian settlement.    According to Churkin, Russia and its Western partners have  not yet agreed on their approaches to a settlement. It is the  purpose of the ministerial meeting to agree to the maximum on  the approaches and a concrete program of action. So far there  are only different ideas concerning the way the sides should be  influenced, Churkin said.    On the possibility of using armed force to pressure the  conflicting Bosnian sides Churkin said there has never been such  an argument. Any use of force, and this has happened already,  is prompted by extraordinary circumstances which in their turn  stem from humanitarian reasons, the existence of safe havens and  the protection of the UN force in ex-Yugoslavia. Security  Council resolutions for ex-Yugoslavia did not provide for the  transition to a diplomacy of force. It is out of the question  to try to use force to make one of the sides do something for a  political settlement.    Churkin said that by pressure on the conflicting sides he  means the use of solely political means.    In his opinion the Geneva meeting can reach agreement and  work out a coordinated plan. "Common grounds will be found. The  question is how far-reaching these common positions are going to  be. Only the ministerial meeting can show that," Churkin said.    The diplomat said that Russia's starting point is quite  resolute, but he could not promise that the Russian side would  manage to persuade all participants to share its views. He  foresaw certain difficulties, but hoped that the common approach  would be as close as possible to the initial Russian stand.    In Churkin's opinion one cannot say that the current  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina favors a political settlement.  The situation is quite the opposite. It is not favorable for a  political settlement because both the Bosnian Serbs and the  Muslims are drawn too much by centrifugal forces aimed in the  opposite direction, in the direction of further military  confrontation, in particular in the area of Brchko. They  believe that a political settlement is impossible in principle.  This does not promote the peace process, of course.    The diplomat did not rule out the possibility that the  Geneva  meeting might drag out and end on Saturday morning, not on  Friday as it is planned now.</p>

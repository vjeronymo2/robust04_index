			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Rain Ren in Beijing and Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] China has started drawing up nominations for the  position of Hong Kong's first chief executive under the  post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government.  Sources revealed yesterday the State Council's Hong Kong and  Macao Affairs Office asked China's de facto embassy in Hong  Kong--the Xinhua News Agency--to start preparing a list of  possible candidates late last year.    Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) members have suggested  the candidate could be a man or woman, should be an experienced  civil servant, and not have a strong political background. The  chief executive will be Hong Kong's most powerful person after  1997, replacing Britain's colonial Governor as the territory's  top official.    It is also believed members of China's advisory body on  transitional matters, the PWC, proposed to put the issue to its  government and administration sub-group at a meeting last  Thursday [6 January]. But members disagreed on the issue and  postponed discussions until a later date.    Sources said nominations for the chief executive would be  based on three principles; the candidate needed to have the  approval of the mainland's Central Peoples Government, he or she  must have high prestige amongst civil servants, and must be  acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. Nominees will also have  to satisfy some basic criteria, outlined in the Basic Law.    The Basic Law says the chief executive must be a Chinese  citizen of not less than 40 who is a permanent resident of Hong  Kong. He or she must have no right of abode in any foreign  country and have lived in Hong Kong for a continuous period of  not less than 20 years. The Basic Law says the chief executive  will be selected by "elections or local consultations". The  chief executive must serve a five-year term and cannot serve for  more than two consecutive terms.    PWC member and former executive councillor Rita Fan said the  chief executive must be "someone who is strong, outstanding,  able and a very good communicator". In a recent interview with  The Standard, Fan said the first chief executive after the  transfer of sovereignty would have one of the most difficult  jobs in Hong Kong's history. Fan, who resigned from the  Executive Council shortly after Governor Chris Patten arrived in  the territory, is herself tipped to be one of the candidates.  But Fan said she would never take on the job. "Personally I am  not interested and I don't have the ability to do it," she said.    PWC member Raymond Wu said the chief executive should be an  existing civil servant, have a non-political background, and  have an "unconfrontational" relationship with China. He also  said the PWC was not the appropriate place to talk about  candidates for the chief executive, although the PWC would have  a say in the formation of the selection committee which appoints  the chief executive.    With 1997 still three-and-a-half years away there has been  little speculation on possible candidates for the top job. A  number of senior civil servants in the Patten administration  known to be sympathetic towards China are also likely to be on  the list of candidates. Names that could be floated from the  PWC itself include Fan, chairman of the pro-China Democratic  Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Tsang Yok-sing, member  of the PWC's government and administration sub-group, and  Chinese University professor Lau Siu-kai. Former secretary for  home affairs Peter Tsao could also be in the running.    Chinese officials such as Hong Kong and Macao Office Affairs  director Lu Ping are out of the race because they do not fit the  Basic Law criteria of being permanent residents of Hong Kong.</p>

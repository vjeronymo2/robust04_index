			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salete Sodreira from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The Federal Supreme Court, STF, upheld the Bahia  State law allowing the local legislative assembly to indirectly  elect former Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' successor.    The former governor resigned his position to run in the 3  October general elections. The Bahia legislative assembly had  approved a law allowing the election of a successor to finish  the gubernatorial mandate. A group of parties resorted to the  STF, stating that the law was unconstitutional because  gubernatorial elections must be handled by Congress. They also  alleged that voting for the successor could not be open as  established in Bahia State law. By a seven-four vote, the STF  justices ruled the state law was based on the Constitution and  that Gov. Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' successor must be elected in  30 days. Vice Governor Paulo Souto also resigned his position to  run in the October elections.</p>

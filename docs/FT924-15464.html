			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Swedish credit rating in balance SWEDEN was yesterday placed on the review list for future possible downgrading by Moody's, the New York international credit agency. At present the country has a foreign currency debt rating of AA1, the second highest possible. The announcement came as Sweden's Central Bank cut its overnight lending rate to the country's commercial banks from 24 per cent to 20 per cent, in a further step designed to calm the markets in the aftermath of the week's all-party crisis package to reduce Sweden's industrial costs. Short-term market interest rates also fell yesterday. The Central Bank also revealed in its latest weekly report of capital movements that SKr15.1bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of capital flowed out of Sweden during the last six days of September. This provided the sombre background for the second package of austerity measures in a fortnight to be agreed between the government and the main Social Democratic opposition. Moody's said that there were several factors behind its decision to place Sweden on its review list. It pointed to the likely slowdown in the country's economic stabilisation and reform programme because of the increased weakness in the European economy, its sluggish growth, which was likely to strain the financial position of various economic sectors and of the government, and Sweden's relatively large external debt, which might 'prove a heavier burden in the context of more volatile exchange markets'. The credit agency acknowledged that the recent all-party economic agreement would strengthen the credibility of the country's anti-inflation policy, but it added that a strong krona policy could prove to be a costly one. Moody's review of Sweden would therefore 'focus on the policy's sustainability'. It added that 'a de facto krona appreciation vis-a-vis Sweden's major trading partners would have a negative effect on growth in the near future.'</p>

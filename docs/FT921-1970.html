			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / International Company News: Moulinex climbs 11% to FFr149m MOULINEX, one of Europe's leading makers of small household equipment, yesterday reported an 11.2 per cent rise in net profits for 1991, writes William Dawkins in Paris. Reported profits rose to FFr149m (Dollars 26m) from FFr134m on sales up to FFr8.35bn from FFr5.96bn, including the first contribution from Krups, the German producer of coffee machines and blenders which Moulinex bought in January last year. As expected, the financing costs of the Krups takeover meant the German acquisition diluted Moulinex's earnings in its first year, though the French group said Krups was profitable before interest charges. Stripping out Krups, net earnings rose by 14.9 per cent to FFr154m while sales increased 12 per cent to FFr6.68bn.</p>

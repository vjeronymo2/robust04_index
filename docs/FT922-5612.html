			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Renewed deficit in motor trade THE MOTOR industry trade balance fell back into deficit in the first quarter, bringing an abrupt halt to the improvement achieved in the deep 2 1/2 -year recession in UK new vehicle sales. In the last three months of last year the motor industry achieved its first quarterly trade surplus since the early 1980s, with a surplus of Pounds 121m. According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry accumulated a trade deficit of Pounds 532m in the first quarter of this year, compared with a deficit of Pounds 341m in the same period a year ago. The sudden deterioration in the sector's trade balance is a further sign that the prolonged UK recession might be ending, as imports have again started to rise faster than exports. The performance of the motor industry is a large factor in the development of the overall UK trade balance, and as domestic demand for new vehicles rises, the deficit is expected to grow. The motor industry trade balance has been in deficit every year since 1982, but last year's deficit, at Pounds 1bn, was the lowest for nine years and showed a sharp fall from Pounds 4.6bn in 1990 and a peak deficit of Pounds 6.6bn in 1989, when UK new vehicle sales were also at a record level. The rapid improvement in the past two years was driven both by the recession, which sharply depressed imports of new cars and commercial vehicles, and by the industry's strong car export perfor-mance. According to the SMMT, the value of imported automotive products rose 12 per cent year-on-year to Pounds 3.3bn in the first quarter, while export earnings rose only 6 per cent to Pounds 2.8bn. The SMMT said the increase in the value of imported products marked the reversal of the downward trend that had become established in mid 1990. The value of car imports rose 13 per cent in the first quarter to Pounds 1.6bn, while the value of car exports rose only 3 per cent to Pounds 987m.  -----------------------------------------          UK MOTOR TRADE (Pounds M)              - first quarter  -----------------------------------------                Exports  -----------------------------------------                        1992      1991  ----------------------------------------- Cars                    987       962 Comm. vehicles          266       214 Parts and accessories 1,244     1,129 Others*                 277       325  -----------------------------------------                Imports  ----------------------------------------- Cars                  1,563     1,382 Comm. vehicles          189       172 Parts and             1,417     1,281 accessories Others*                 136      119  ----------------------------------------- Trade balance  ----------------------------------------- Cars                   -576     -420 Comm. vehicles           77       42 Parts and accessories  -173     -152 Others*                 141      206 Total balance -532 -341  ----------------------------------------- *Others includes agricultural tractors, dumpers, trailers, caravans, industrial works trucks and freight containers.  ----------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and Customs and Excise  -----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Approval sought for HK airport funding THE future of Hong Kong's new airport will move back onto the agenda today when the Hong Kong government approaches the local legislature for approval of a big works contract, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The government is expected to present financial plans to an ad hoc committee of the Legislative Council (LegCo) for the funding of a contract to build the site for the colony's Chek Lap Kok airport, north of Lantau island. The HKDollars 9bn (Pounds 760m) contract was let provisionally in the summer to a multinational consortium, which later agreed to extend the validity of its bid to the end of this month. The government is hopeful that LegCo will approve the funding when the finance committee debates the issue tomorrow week. If the funding is not approved soon then it is unlikely the 'airport platform' - as it is known - could be completed in time to allow the airport proper to open before mid-1997, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. The government told China of its plans to press ahead with the building of the platform last Friday. It was warned, however, of pursuing a 'go it alone' policy and told that Beijing's consent to franchises to operate airport services would be held up if it did so. Hong Kong government officials have denied that they will build the airport without China's approval. They say the Anglo-Chinese memorandum of understanding relates to works and business franchises which straddle 1997. Share prices fell sharply for the second day in succession yesterday as international investors sold amid continuing concerns about the rift between the UK and China over democracy in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index closed 240.19 lower at 5,848.33, nearly 4 per cent down on Tuesday.</p>

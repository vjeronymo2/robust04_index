			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CAR WRECKERS ASK COUNCIL TO OK MOVE  </P> <P> Consultants for the Pick Your Part auto-wrecking yard appealed to the City  Council on Tuesday night after failing to win Planning Commission approval to  move the operation from Stanton to the site of a former landfill in Anaheim.  </P> <P> A spokesman for a group of about 100 residents who oppose the relocation, which  they said would put the industrial-style operation too near their homes, said  they expected the appeal.  </P> <P> Phil Steyerman, accompanied by other members of the Stop Pick Your Part  Committee, said they will again don their yellow T-shirts and show their  opposition when the council holds a hearing on the appeal. No hearing date has  been set.  </P> <P> The 20-acre lot is at 2925 W. Lincoln Ave. Most of the homeowners who oppose  the proposal live in a housing tract north of the site.  </P> <P> Consultants for the company, which must move from its current location by March  1, had compiled detailed plans for what they called a state-of-the-art  auto-recycling center, hoping to assure residents that the operation would not  be a typical junkyard.

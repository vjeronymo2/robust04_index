			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> PARSONS FINDS A HOME AS CATCHER FOR LA QUINTA  </P> <P> Jason Parsons of La Quinta High School can hit. There seems to be no question  about that.  </P> <P> Parsons, The Times' athlete of the week, is batting .434 with nine home runs  and 32 runs batted in. Last week he had three home runs and seven RBIs.  </P> <P> So Parsons can hit. What no one was really sure of was what position he could  play.  </P> <P> "Scouts and college recruiters think he may be the best hitter in the county,"  La Quinta Coach Dave Demarest said. "They just weren't sure where they could  put him."  </P> <P> But this season, Parsons believes he has found a home, which is located behind  home.  </P> <P> "I played catcher in the Area Code games last summer, and the coaches up there  thought it was my best position," Parsons said. "They told Coach Demarest."  </P> <P> Demarest was happy to hear it, considering the fact that both his catchers  graduated last June.  </P> <P> "We were glad to finally find a spot for Jason," Demarest said. "He could play  first base, but we had an all-league player (Bob Heyl) returning at that  position. I feel that catcher is Jason's future. He'll be a good one."  </P> <P> Parsons, who played outfield as a junior, enjoys his new job. He has the arm  strength to play the position and he's learning the do's and don'ts as he goes.  </P> <P> "I'm still just getting the basics down," Parsons said. "The footwork is the  toughest. But I really like it. You can control the game. And I don't exactly  have the speed to play the outfield."  </P> <P> And playing catcher also has helped Parsons' hitting.  </P> <P> "You can get an idea on each umpire's strike zone, so the next time you hit you  can be more selective," Parsons said. "You can also learn a hitter's weakness."  </P> <P> Parsons knows about weaknesses. He admits that his is being a perfectionist.  </P> <P> "I feel I should get a hit every time up," Parsons said. "I know it's not  possible, but that's what I strive for."  </P> <P> Parsons hasn't been perfect, but a .434 batting average isn't that far off.  </P> <P> "That's a hard .434; there aren't any bloopers in that," Demarest said. "Once  he learns that failure is part of the game and stops trying to be perfect, then  he's going to be really dangerous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Brett Grebe of Westminster was five for eight with three RBIs last week. He  also was 2-0 as a pitcher with 15 strikeouts in 10 innings.  </P> <P> Matt Folsom of San Clemente had five RBIs, including a three-run homer, in a  13-6 victory over El Toro Wednesday.  </P> <P> Buster Nietzke of Capistrano Valley was six for seven, with three runs scored,  three RBIs, a home run, two doubles and two steals in two games last week.  </P> <P> Pete Montera of Kennedy set a school record with 13 strikeouts in a 3-2 victory  over Santiago Wednesday. Montera also hit a solo home run in the seventh to win  the game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jason Parsons  </P> <P> La Quinta High School  </P> <P> Position: Catcher  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 6-2, 195, Senior  </P> <P> Last Week: Parsons had four hits, three of which were home runs, and seven  RBIs.  </P> <P> Season: Parsons is hitting .434 with nine home runs and 32 RBIs.  </P></p>

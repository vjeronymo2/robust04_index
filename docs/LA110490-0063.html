			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG TEN ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BUCKEYES WIN BIG, TAKE ON IOWA NEXT  </P> <P> Ohio State tuned up for next Saturday's Big Ten showdown against No. 13 Iowa by  routing Northwestern, 48-7, Saturday at Columbus, Ohio.  </P> <P> "I told our squad to enjoy this victory tonight," Ohio State Coach John Cooper  said, "because starting tomorrow afternoon everything will be about Iowa. We  probably won't even look at this film tomorrow. . . . Maybe we ought to start  working on (Iowa) tonight, as good as they are."  </P> <P> The Buckeyes will play the Hawkeyes at Iowa City.  </P> <P> Ohio State was never threatened against the Wildcats, scoring on its first six  possessions. Raymont Harris scored two touchdowns and Kent Graham came on to  throw a pair of touchdown passes as the Wildcats were assured of their 19th  consecutive losing season.  </P> <P> "The best thing about the ballgame was that we won handily, we played a lot of  players and didn't have any serious injuries," said Cooper.  </P> <P> Greg Frey sustained bruised ribs during a third-quarter sack, but Cooper said  he expected his senior quarterback to be available for Iowa.  </P> <P> Ohio State improved to 5-2-1 overall and 3-1-1 in the Big Ten by winning its  third game in a row. Northwestern is 2-6 and 1-4.  </P> <P> Robert Smith rushed for 128 yards in 23 attempts for the Buckeyes, who built a  27-7 lead at the half.  </P> <P> No. 20 Michigan 38, Purdue 13 -- Allen Jefferson scored three touchdowns on  short runs, but it was the Wolverines' special teams that did the most damage  in this Big Ten game at West Lafayette, Ind.  </P> <P> Dwayne Ware scored once on a blocked punt and recovered a fumbled kickoff to  set up another score for the Wolverines (5-3, 3-2).  </P> <P> "We've always said and every coach will tell you, you can't overemphasize the  importance of special teams," said Michigan Coach Gary Moeller.  </P> <P> Purdue's Fred Akers, whose team dropped to 1-7 and 0-5, said: "Mistakes in the  kicking game in the first half usually are disastrous. Those really were."  </P> <P> Ware went 17 yards after Dave Ritter's block and recovered a fumble of the  ensuing kickoff that set up a 16-yard touchdown pass play from Elvis Grbac to  Desmond Howard.  </P> <P> Jefferson, who carried the ball only six times for 24 yards, scored on runs of  two and three yards and one yard.  </P> <P> The Wolverines, who intercepted two Eric Hunter passes in the first half, led  31-6 at halftime.  </P> <P> Michigan State 45, Indiana 20 -- Hyland Hickson ran for 170 yards and scored  three second-half touchdowns as the Spartans overcame a shaky first half and  beat the Hoosiers in a Big Ten game at East Lansing, Mich.  </P> <P> Tico Duckett ran for 150 yards and a touchdown for Michigan State (4-3-1, 3-2),  and quarterback Dan Enos added two short touchdown runs.  </P> <P> Indiana (4-3-1, 1-3-1) took advantage of Michigan State turnovers to lead,  20-17, at halftime. But it was Indiana's turn to blunder in the third quarter.  Ernie Thompson fumbled at the Hoosier 46 and the Spartans were in the end zone  seven plays later, with Hickson scoring from 13 yards out.  </P> <P> Hickson then capped a 64-yard drive with an eight-yard run to put Michigan  State ahead 31-20.  </P> <P> A fumble by Indiana's Vaughn Dunbar was recovered by linebacker Dixon Edwards  at the Indiana 39, and Michigan State scored four plays later on a 15-yard run  by Duckett to lead 38-20.  </P> <P> Indiana's last serious comeback bid ended when, after driving 53 yards to the  Michigan State 27, Thompson was thrown for a two-yard loss on fourth and one.  </P> <P> Minnesota 21, Wisconsin 3 -- Tailback Mark Smith scored two touchdowns and  Chuck Rios added a third and the Gophers held the Badgers to 36 yards rushing  at Madison, Wis.  </P> <P> The victory keeps Minnesota's Big Ten championship hopes alive. The Gophers are  5-3 and 4-1.  </P> <P> Smith, a freshman, rushed for 73 yards in 20 carries and scored on a four-yard  run in the first quarter and on a 16-yard shuffle pass from Scott Schaffner in  the fourth.  </P> <P> Wisconsin is 1-7, 0-5.  </P> <P> This was the 100th meeting between these two schools. Minnesota leads the  series, 55-37-8.  </P></p>

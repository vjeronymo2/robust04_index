			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Brown Shipley recommends 30p cash offer BROWN SHIPLEY Holdings, the investment and broking business, yesterday reluctantly recommended a cash offer of 30p per share from Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise, its 29.8 per cent shareholder. 'Taking into account the on-going interests of the business and the clientele, I support the solution this offer brings,' said Mr William Dacombe, the chairman and chief executive appointed 16 months ago to turn round the troubled group. The bid values the group at Pounds 4.8m, against net assets of Pounds 8.1m. Mr Giorgio Rossi, a director and 14 per cent shareholder, resigned from the board before the bid announcement. Mr Rossi had taken his stake in 1986 when the share price ranged between 400p and 645p. Last night the shares closed 4p down at 31p. The sale of the final Brown Shipley businesses has, in effect, been forced by potential claims of Pounds 2.4m from the Luxembourg bank. These claims arise from possible liabilities relating to the leasing business sold by Brown Shipley's banking arm last year. Kredietbank, when it purchased the banking business last summer, was given indemnities on the potential liabilit-ies. The only alternative to a bid from Kredietbank would be to fight the claims. If unsuccessful, the group's net assets would be reduced to less than the called up share capital. Brown Shipley, which has been struggling since suffering heavy losses in the small companies market three years ago, has progressively sold several businesses over the last two years. Mr Dacombe had hoped to rebuild the group on its core investment and stockbroking operations, which manage some Pounds 2.4bn in discretionary funds.</p>

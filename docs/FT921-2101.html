			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Americans urged to leave Libya THE US and France yesterday urged their nationals to leave Libya before air links are cut by the expected imposition of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, Reuter reports from Washington. A resolution proposed by the US, France and Britain would impose mandatory sanctions, including an air embargo, a halt to arms sales and a reduction in diplomatic representation if Libya does not turn over agents suspected of involvement in two aircraft bombings in which 471 people died. Libya is alleged to have played a central role in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1989 crash of a French UTA plan over Niger in central Africa. Yesterday Libyan leader Muammer Gadaffi sent world leaders a cable from Tripoli repeating that Libya was happy to co-operate with the Lockerbie investigation, but condemning as aggressive the draft UN resolution calling for sanctions. The resolution 'threatens international peace and is related to the occurrence of aggression,' he said. The US State Department made it clear yesterday that American nationals should depart as soon as possible. 'Once airline links are broken, it will be obviously more difficult to leave the country,' Ms Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said. An estimated 1,000 Americans are in Libya. The French Foreign ministry said 470 French people were in Libya at the beginning of this year but several dozen had already left. Libyan Prime Minister Abu Zaid Omar Dourda said in Cairo he had called for an emergency meeting of Arab League foreign ministers, apparently to discuss the sanctions threat. At the United Nations Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general said he believed diplomacy could still solve the looming crisis over Libya. He said he had met Tripoli's UN ambassador more than 10 times over the past few weeks in hopes of averting a showdown. Talks were continuing with non-aligned members of the council, several of whom want to avert sanctions. 'We are trying for a kind of compromise' within the framework of Security Council demands, he said.</p>

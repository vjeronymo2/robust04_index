			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Top-level shake-up at Tetra Laval Tetra Laval, the leading Swedish packaging group, yesterday announced a shake-up of senior management following the sudden departure of Mr Uno Kjellberg as chief executive of the group's biggest division, Tetra Pak. Tetra Laval said Mr Kjellberg was quitting due to differences with the group board over strategies at Tetra Pak, which makes systems for liquid food processing, packaging and distribution. The privately-owned group gave no further details on the decision. 'We cannot go into details without revealing information about our future strategies to our competitors,' the company said. It said Mr Gunnar Brock, head of Alfa Laval, which makes packaging machinery, would succeed Mr Kjellberg at Tetra Pak. Mr Lars Hallden, Tetra Laval group chief executive, would head Alfa Laval until a new chief executive was appointed. The shake-up was the first sign of differences at the top level since Tetra Laval was created when Tetra Pak, owned by the Rausing family, acquired Alfa Laval for Dollars 2.5bn in 1991 in Sweden's biggest-ever takeover deal.</p>

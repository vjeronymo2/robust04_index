He said: Jiangxi has  been developing fairly rapidly in recent years. In particular,  it has attached importance to educational work. The key to  economic development and invigoration lies in training qualified  personnel. The Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee and government  have firmly grasped education. This will definitely play a very  positive role in Jiangxi's future development.    The full meeting of the Jiangxi delegation, held this  morning, was presided over by provincial CPC Secretary Mao  Zhiyong. Huang Zhiquan, Huang Maoheng, Hua Tong, Lu Derong,  (Liu Yizhong), (Li Lide), Huang Dingyuan, and others spoke. In  light of Jiangxi's practical reality, they aired their views  freely on issues such as educational reform, financial and tax  system reform, foreign trade structural reform, the purchase and  marketing of grain, special funds for grain storage, the  development of light vehicles, and strengthening infrastructure  projects.    Vice Premier Li Lanqing fully affirmed those good opinions  and suggestions made by the people's deputies. He said: It is  necessary to take effective measures to solve the problem of pay  and conditions, and housing for teachers. Input for education  must be increased, and the teachers' law must be enforced well.  He pointed out: The fundamental solution for education lies in  reform. It is necessary to adjust well the macrostructure of  education. First of all, major efforts must be concentrated on  basic education. This is a matter of vital importance which  concerns the quality of our nationals as a whole. Furthermore,  it is necessary to develop vocational education. The majority  of Chinese youths rely on vocational education to train  themselves into useful persons. Reform in higher education must  place its emphasis on improving quality.    Financial Minister Liu Zhongli and Minister of Forestry Xu  Youfang were also present at today's discussion of the Jiangxi  delegation.</p>

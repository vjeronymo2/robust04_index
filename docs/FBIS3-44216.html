			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>   [Excerpts] The ANC's [African National Congress] behavior  following the invitation to the organization's president, Mr.  Nelson Mandela, to visit Namibia during SWAPO [South-West  African People's Organization] solidarity week, was insulting to  say the least. President Sam Nujoma and SWAPO were insulted in  the worst possible manner, and none of the thousands of  explanations by SWAPO's public relations division is acceptable.  Only a fanatical minority party support group still concern  themselves with excuses from SWAPO headquarters. Namibians are  not sorry that Mr. Mandela has dropped his plans to visit  Namibian communities during a fund-raising attempt for the ANC's  election campaign with SWAPO President Sam Nujoma and SWAPO  Secretary General Moses Garoeb. Mr. Mandela unknowingly did  Namibians a favor by canceling the visit.    First, his presence would only have secured an audience for  Mr. Garoeb in Oranjemund, and, second, under the current  economic and social conditions, Namibians can ill afford to make  funds available to a party such as the ANC, which already has  millions at its disposal. Namibians believe that Mr. Mandela is  aware of the fact that inhabitants of this country need the  money more than the ANC does, and for this reason he decided not  to visit the country.    The motive for the cancellation could also be that Mr.  Mandela has heard of SWAPO's three failed national fund-raising  efforts and wanted to spare himself and SWAPO the disgrace.  SWAPO's car competition in its newspaper, NAMIBIA TODAY, was  canceled because of a lack of interest, while the newspaper  eventually closed its doors for the same reason. For a while  last year, it was propped up artificially with state funds and  NEW ERA machinery. [passage omitted]    Yesterday the ANC informed a South African news agency that  Mr. Mandela's visit had been canceled, but a SWAPO spokesman  Alfeus Naruseb reported that the visit would go ahead. It seems  that SWAPO wanted to send a signal to Mr. Mandela that he should  not cancel his visit before he has Mr. Naruseb's permission to  do so. Mr. Nujoma explained yesterday that he was informed  about the cancellation of the visit. According to him, Mr.  Mandela telephoned him yesterday morning. But if Mr. Nujoma  followed NBC [Namibian Broadcasting Corporation] news, he would  have known that the South African news agency and the NBC knew a  day before him that the visit had been canceled. This is a rude  response from ANC ranks and an unequaled display of  thanklessness. This insult comes after the organization  received an amount of 1 million rand from the Namibian  Government in the midst of the drought. It is an insult, to say  the least. If SWAPO does not see it this way, then the party is  more unobservant than expected.</p>

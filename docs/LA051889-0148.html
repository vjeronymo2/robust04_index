			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVOLT IN GUATEMALA, WHILE EASILY QUELLED, POINTS TO WIDER GRIEVANCES  </P> <P> A failed coup attempt by senior military officers last week appears to have  been triggered by a new outbreak of guerrilla warfare and the emergence of  civilian President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo's controversial protege as a leading  candidate to succeed him.  </P> <P> But while the revolt was thwarted without a shot by loyalist commanders and  denounced by nearly every civilian group, the grievances voiced by the plotters  are shared beyond their small circle and spell a lingering threat to  Guatemala's incipient democracy, according to political sources and foreign  diplomats.  </P> <P> Since a similar coup attempt a year ago, these people say, Cerezo has yielded  much of his power to the military hierarchy that saved him. The latest revolt,  in their view, has strengthened those commanders committed to civilian rule  while increasing the president's dependence on them.  </P> <P> The army high command moved swiftly this week to stifle internal dissent,  indicting 24 active and retired officers in a military court on rebellion and  sedition charges for the May 9 uprising. But the crackdown may carry a price  for Cerezo, Guatemalans close to the president believe.  </P> <P> "These coup attempts are like heart attacks," said Juan Jose Rodil, a reformer  dismissed from Cerezo's Cabinet after last year's coup attempt. "They kill part  of the system and affect the health of the whole body. To survive, the patient  has to accept certain restrictions."  </P> <P> Guatemala, rent by Central America's most enduring conflict between the  extremes of left and right, has never sustained a modern democratic government.  Human rights groups estimate that up to 100,000 people died in political  violence under a string of military dictators in the 1970s and early 1980s.  </P> <P> After decimating a force of several thousand leftist guerrillas, the armed  forces switched to a strategy of isolating the insurgency through rural  development and civilian rule. Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, began a five-year  term in January, 1986, after winning 68% of the popular vote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Expectations  </P> <P> But Guatemalans' high expectations of him have not been fulfilled. Despite  modest economic growth and greater margins of civic freedom, the 46-year-old  president is viewed today as unable to close a widening gap between rich and  poor or to stop official corruption and lingering human rights abuse.  </P> <P> Against this backdrop of popular disillusion, some military officers contend  that the new counterinsurgency strategy is failing and would be further  undermined by the election of Alfonso Cabrera, Cerezo's hand-picked  presidential candidate, whom they view as a symbol of corruption.  </P> <P> A manifesto drafted for the May 9 revolt charged that public funds were being  diverted into a campaign "to install a party dictatorship for the benefit of a  political clique of unscrupulous Christian Democrats" and into front  organizations of a resurgent guerrilla army.  </P> <P> It accused Gen. Hector A. Gramajo, the defense minister and most powerful  military figure, of "support and complicity" in this process.  </P> <P> Troops loyal to Gramajo and the president used tanks to corner soldiers  involved in the four-hour rebellion before the proclamation could be broadcast  or published.  </P> <P> The uprising was undertaken before dawn with 300 soldiers from the air base at  Guatemala City's airport and one of three army barracks in the capital. Wearing  sky-blue kerchiefs to identify themselves, they seized the telephone company,  police headquarters and the national radio network as well as Gramajo's wife  and three children.  </P> <P> But the rebels miscalculated. Apparently unaware of technology that averted a  total shutdown of the telephone system, they failed to prevent the high command  from enlisting other units against them. By 9 a.m. it was over.  </P> <P> Cerezo identified the chief plotter as Col. Cesar Ramon Quinteros, an  Israeli-trained officer who lost to Gramajo in maneuvering for the army's top  post and was shifted from a troop command to head the largely symbolic Central  American Defense Council.  </P> <P> Among the others indicted were three other colonels on the council, commanders  of the two rebel units, a former police chief and four officers who were  cashiered for the May 11, 1988, coup attempt but later freed under an amnesty.  Three of those charged have eluded arrest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Relaxed, Confident  </P> <P> In an interview, Cerezo said the military leadership was "much more annoyed" by  this year's revolt, which he described as better organized, and ready to  prosecute to the limit. He appeared relaxed and confident of finishing his  term.  </P> <P> "The reaction of the people and the political parties and, in general, the  attitude of the army allow me to think that we have taken a step toward the  consolidation of democracy," he said.  </P> <P> Independent analysts are not so certain. Cerezo was able to dispel much of the  tension lingering after last year's revolt, they say, with such policy changes  as breaking off peace talks with the guerrillas, re-equipping the army, making  economic concessions to business executives and canceling moves to upgrade ties  with Communist nations. The new spasm of discontent seems directed more at the  army leadership.  </P> <P> "It's more dangerous for Cerezo now," a Western diplomat said. "He doesn't have  as much to play with except (getting rid of) Gramajo, the man he needs most."  </P> <P> One catalyst for the revolt, according to lawyers for the plotters, was an  April 25 guerrilla ambush that killed the second in command of the  Huehuetenango army base in western Guatemala. The victim's brother-in-law, an  air force colonel, took part in the coup attempt.  </P> <P> The ambush followed stepped-up guerrilla attacks on army road crews in the  mountainous interior, the loss of an air force plane that was apparently shot  down and the bombing of a police station in the capital.  </P> <P> Days before last week's coup attempt, one of the cashiered plotters of the 1988  revolt was quoted in Guatemala City newspapers as saying that "tension in the  army is even higher now" because the commanders will not fight back  aggressively.  </P> <P> Col. Luis Arturo Isaacs, the army spokesman, denied that the guerrillas, whose  armed strength he estimated at 800, are a renewed threat. But he acknowledged  that the army's strategy of focusing on their civilian support base instead of  direct pursuit "is hard for many officers to comprehend."  </P> <P> "Gen. Gramajo is 20 years ahead of the institution on how to make the army work  in a democratic framework," a military specialist said.  </P> <P> Coup rumors began sweeping through a tense capital last month as Cerezo was  buffeted by unusually strong criticism from Guatemala's Roman Catholic bishops  and lashed out bitterly against rightist-controlled newspapers.  </P> <P> The final trigger for the coup attempt appears to have been the dismissal two  weeks ago of Navy Capt. Romeo Guevara Reyes as national police chief and his  replacement by a civilian Christian Democrat.  </P> <P> Guevara took part in the uprising. His spokesman, Carlos Chen, said Guevara had  been pushed aside to give the ruling party a freer hand to put off-duty police  officers to work in Cabrera's campaign for the party presidential primary on  June 18.  </P> <P> Some analysts see the coup attempt as less a threat to Cerezo, who is now  viewed as a lame duck, than to his longtime friend and protege. As secretary  general of the party, Cabrera helped Cerezo win the nomination in 1985, then  served as foreign minister.  </P> <P> The president supports Cabrera's candidacy, overlooking his friend's bouts of  public drunkenness and mysterious wealth. Newspapers have suggested that  Cabrera is involved in narcotics trafficking -- talk that Cerezo calls  unfounded and ideologically motivated.  </P></p>

The Arab affairs editor in the Jamahiriyah News Agency  commented on this saying:    "Such actions constitute blatant interference in Syria's  internal affairs".    The editor questioned whether the United States would accept  that anyone could demand of the American President Bill Clinton  to release American prisoners in American jails.    The editor said that this condescending manner with which  America views the rest of the world has plunged the world into  crisis. They do not allow anyone else to treat them as they  treat others in the belief that they are unique and others are  not allowed to do what the United States allows itself to do.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria April 13 SAPA -- A halt on sales of state  land was on Wednesday [13 April] called for by the Transitional  Executive Council's [TEC] sub-council on regional/local  government and traditional authorities. In a statement, the  sub-council said it had decided to ask the government to stop  the sale of state land without first consulting the sub-council.    On the sale of state land in kwaNdebele, the sub-council  decided that no land be disposed of unless in exceptional  circumstances and specially not through the process being  planned by the homeland government; that sales, when necessary,  be transparent and based on consensus; that the process of  township development proceed on the basis that no decision be  taken on entitlement of occupation or ownership; and that the  process of establishing the identities of people living on the  land in kwaNdebele proceed on the basis that it not involve  decisions on who will be entitled to occupation or ownership.</p>

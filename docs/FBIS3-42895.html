			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Zasurskiy: "Russia Is Famished for Ideology </F> of Reforms, While Ideologues Gaydar and Yavlinskiy Wait for the  Government Exhausted by This Famine To Fall"]    [Text] The government's failure over practically the entire  second half of 1993 to come up with a concept of economic reform  reflecting at least somewhat the reality of life in Russia has  opened a niche in economic programming for nongovernment  experts. The need for ideology after the last symbolic reformers  departed from Viktor Chernomyrdin's government has grown so much  that two contenders rose simultaneously to fill the void: one--a  collective one--in the form of Academicians Abalkin, Shatalin,  and Petrakov; the other in the shape of Sergey Glazyev, former  minister of foreign economic relations and currently chairman of  the Committee on the Economy in the State Duma.    Several assessments came out lately; half of them were  devoted to bashing Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin's work; others  reiterated Sergey Glazyev's program; and a few attempted a  comparative analysis of these programs. As we learned the day  before yesterday from the speech of Minister of the Economy  Aleksandr Shokhin, there is also a third contender--Saburov. His  program was delivered to the government through restricted  channels, however, and at this point its content has not become  a subject of public discussion.    In considering the joint report of the Institute of  Economics  of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Reform Foundation, it  makes sense to separate two principally different notions. The  first is the "academicians' program": a notion constructed by  way of simply renaming the report and the most superficial and  subjective analysis of it by people who are believers in  Gaydar's ideology. This notion is simply a projection that only  remotely resembles the original source.    The second notion is the actual report, namely: a list of  anticrisis measures in different areas of economic policy, void  of any particular ideological uniformity for the reason that  each part was written by specialists in that particular area,  while the three-headed author-academician either from haste or  for some other reason has not gone the entire length of  structuring this report into an ideological whole.    All those points for which the academicians are being  "trampled" (such as freezing prices in raw material sectors with  possible budget subsidies for them and establishing a fixed  exchange rate for the ruble) do not represent a mandatory  attribute of the economic policy but are subject to discussion,  say the report's authors.    But what is in the report that is inarguable? That is the  whole point: The report is not built on positive premises. It is  based on rejection of the Adam Smith-esque approach to reforming  Russia. The report's authors absolutely clearly learned the  lesson of rampant liberalism in Russia, especially so in the  area of reforms' humanism--or rather lack thereof. Therefore  many critics of Abalkin-Petrakov-Shatalin rightfully pointed out  that the authors make the cornerstone of their program not the  formation of an economy that would give people the opportunity  to engage in raising their own level of well-being, but rather a  direct elevation of their well-being--an ideology which, for all  its humanism, is absolutely unacceptable for a transition  period. And the main shortcoming: The report never succeeded in  identifying the priorities of the proposed economic policy as a  whole.    On the other hand, the report also has unquestionable merits  with respect to stating and formulating the problems. These  achievements are especially noticeable in the parts dealing with  demographics and social problems. Overall, the role of this  worthless program but decent report is positive: It has  enlivened the academic and quasi-academic debate, thereby  contributing to the creation of a favorable incubative climate  for forming a truly sound economic ideology.    The program will be used by the Cabinet of Ministers as an  encyclopedia of variations of sectoral approaches; by  lobbyists--as a quotation book; and by radical reformers--as a  punching bag.    Sergey Glazyev came no closer to ideology than the  academicians. But he is much more concrete and tangible. The  point is that his formulation of the main tasks takes place not  in the field of narrowly delimited special sections but at the  highest level of the expanse of economic policy. His program  combines methods of monetary regulation of inflation and  "nonmonetarist" measures.    Glazyev's entire work is written as a word for word  translation--a list of concrete measures that are necessary to  implement because of the strengthened role of state regulation.  Much is already being done by the government--for instance, the  policy of encouraging the creation of financial-industrial  groups.    On the whole, however, Sergey Glazyev's predilection for  concentrating his attention on concrete things only emphasizes  the fact that what we have here is not a program of economic  reform based on medium-term measures but a set of quick fixes,  that is, precisely the normal kind of economic program that does  not give the author the right to be considered an ideologue.    Among the more interesting points in S. Glazyev's program, I  would like to name a very (maybe even excessively) clear outline  of the architecture of a tax system and interesting proposals on  introducing a flexible system of bank reserves, which would  increase for short-term and decrease for long-term credit. It is  quite possible that the government would indeed implement these  measures, although it would be ridiculous to expect it to carry  them out to a full extent.    This, however, practically exhausts the entire list of  publicly known programs for saving the Russian economy. It is  interesting that such a recognized maestro of the period of  Russian liberalism as Gaydar and his antagonist Yavlinskiy have  not seriously joined the debate. On the contrary, as soon as the  niche of economic programming began to be filled by  academicians, a former minister, and the ex-contender for the  role of ideologue Saburov, Gaydar began to assume with greater  zeal than ever before the stance of a politician (Yavlinskiy  already became a politician long ago).    Neither Gaydar nor Yavlinskiy pin any hopes on the  government  in the sense of following a particular ideology; both say rather  unenthusiastically that they will support all constructive  initiatives of the cabinet and oppose the government's positions  they do not agree with. As to the former attempts of these  leaders to head the Cabinet of Ministers, in this case they may  be interpreted in two ways: as an awareness of their  responsibility for Russia, or as tactical moves. These  intelligent and experienced people by all their demeanor send  the message that the issue of forming a new, or bringing to a  new level the old, ideology of reform has ceased to be a matter  of principal importance (whether it is in the current political  situation or with the current political elite is another  question).    Today, forming an economic policy from the contradictory  ideas floating in the air with respect to restoration of  industry and continuing cutbacks in state expenditures belongs  more in the realm of public relations than the actual ability of  the government to implement this policy. Gaydar and Yavlinskiy  understand this, seeing the current uncertainty as a sort of  transitional stage within the framework of the transition period.</p>

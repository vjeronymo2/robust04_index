			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Five linked changes planned to credits - Dividend Tax This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. FIVE LINKED changes were proposed on tax applying to dividends; to reduce the value of the tax credit on dividends paid by UK companies from 25 per cent to 20 per cent for dividends paid after 5 April 1993; to reduce correspondingly the present income tax charge on dividends from the basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent; to reduce correspondingly the rate at which a UK company has to account for advance corporation tax (ACT) when it pays a dividend from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, but with a transitional rate for 1993-94 only of 22.5 per cent; to reduce the rate of corporation tax paid by authorised unit trusts in line with these changes; to introduce transitional payments to charities with dividend income from UK companies. The chancellor's intention is: to provide an overall cash flow benefit of nearly Pounds 2bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95 to all UK companies paying dividends; to reduce the amount of new surplus ACT arising in 1993-94 and subsequent years by some Pounds 300 million a year; to raise revenue of about Pounds 1bn a year from 1995-96 onwards. Tax credits accompany dividends paid by UK companies can be set against a UK resident shareholder's liability to tax on the dividend. A shareholder who is exempt from tax on dividends (such as a pension fund or a charity), who is not liable to income tax because any income is covered by allowances, or whose income falls within the lower rate band of income tax, can claim payment of all or part of the credit. The value of the tax credit is currently 25 per cent of the dividend plus the tax credit. This exactly matches liability at the basic rate of income tax of 25 per cent on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit. From 1993-94, the value of the tax credit falls to 20 per cent of the dividend plus the tax credit. The credit on a dividend of Pounds 75, for example, thus becomes Pounds 18.75 (20 per cent of Pounds 75 plus Pounds 18.75). This will exactly match the new income tax charge at the lower rate on the sum of the dividend and the tax credit. Shareholders who are exempt from tax on dividends, or not liable to tax, will be paid the tax credit on dividends paid after 5 April 1993 at the lower rate of 20 per cent. This will also apply to tax credits paid to holders of Personal Equity Plans. Individual shareholders whose income falls within the lower rate band of income tax charged at 20 per cent can, at present, claim payment of that part of the credit which exceeds their liability. After 5 April 1993, they will not be entitled to any tax credit payment as the tax credit will no loner exceed the liability. For shareholders who are currently liable at the basic rate of income tax of 25 per cent, the present tax credit matches the liability on dividends and there is no further tax to pay. After 5 April 1993, the tax credit will continue to match the liability exactly, but at 20 per cent. Individual shareholders who are liable at the higher rate of income tax of 40 per cent currently pay extra tax on dividends at the difference between the higher rate and the value of the credit.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN SENTENCED IN DEATH OF BYSTANDER  </P> <P> A 38-year-old North Hollywood man who fatally shot a bystander while trying to  kill his ex-girlfriend was sentenced Wednesday to 26 years to life in prison.  </P> <P> Fernando Osorio was convicted in October of second-degree murder and attempted  murder for killing Ralph Guillen, 34, with shots intended for Yolanda Gallegos,  who had spurned him several months earlier.  </P> <P> On Feb. 19, 1988, Osorio went to the bar where Gallegos worked and fired a  .38-caliber automatic pistol at her, but hit Guillen instead.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Jerold M. Schultz argued that Osorio should be convicted  of manslaughter, not murder, because he did not mean to kill Guillen.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Guadalupe Y. Gonzalez read a plea from Guillen's widow and  four young children, who said they still require psychiatric counseling and  asked that Osorio receive the maximum sentence of 26 years to life.  </P> <P> Gonzalez also pleaded for the maximum sentence, saying Guillen was born on  Christmas Day and dressed up as Santa Claus each year to distribute gifts to  his family, who now celebrate the holiday at his graveside.  </P></p>

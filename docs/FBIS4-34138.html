			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Undoubtedly, clothes do not make the man. This can  be confirmed by those who, yesterday, applauded when they saw  the Cuban president arrive at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit  with a smile on his face and looking slim. It would take less  than an hour to thwart all the conjectures concerning the  clothes worn by the leader of the Cuban Revolution. For the  first time, he abandoned his olive green uniform to wear a  typical Cuban guayabera.    His firm and courageous words, as on previous occasions when  he stood at a national or international podium, dashed the  assumptions of those who believed the change in attire indicated  the Cuban position was crumbling. His direct, profound, accurate  speech concentrated on denouncing the evils that afflict our  America and those responsible for so much sorrow and poverty. He  is the same Fidel -- profoundly Latin American, defender of the  poor and disenfranchised, a courageous fighter against causes,  or anything that obstructs Latin American development.    If there is any other possible interprepation for the  clothes  he wore at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, it would be only  that the guayabera is an article of Cuban clothing; it is in  great taste; it was created near the Yayabo River; and its wear  has become mandatory among Latin Americans. Therefore, it is  another symbol, another part of our roots on which we stand in  this hour.</p>

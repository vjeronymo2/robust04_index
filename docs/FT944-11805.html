			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Public support unitary councils Bournemouth, Brighton and Plymouth all seem certain to become unitary councils following yesterday's publication of public-opinion research by the Local Government Commission. The commission is, however, set to abandon more radical plans for restructuring Devon, Essex and East and West Sussex because the polls do not show any great public support for the move. The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, is expected to make final recommendations to the government on these counties by the end of the month. The government has signalled that it will honour the results of the polls. In Devon the commission's preference is to make Plymouth a unitary authority  -combining the powers of county and district councils. However, 52 per cent of respondents favoured retaining the two-tier system for the rest of the county. There was 33 per cent support for the commission's second preference of creating six unitary bodies. Most support for this option came from Torbay (57 per cent) and Exeter (52 per cent) where the district councils have campaigned strenuously for unitary status. In Dorset a unitary solution seems likely, with 34 per cent favouring three unitaries - the commission's preference - and 33 per cent preferring four. In Essex the commission's preference for unitaries in Southend and Thurrock while leaving the rest of the county untouched, was most popular, being backed by 53 per cent of respondents. But it is most likely that there will be no change at all since support for the status quo was strongest in the two districts recommended for change - 35 per cent in Southend and 67 per cent in Thurrock. Support for maintaining the status quo in East Sussex outside Brighton and Hove was 34 per cent, with 23 per cent backing no change at all. There was also 15 per cent support for creating four unitaries. In West Sussex the status quo had strong support, with 49 per cent wanting no change and 30 per cent backing the commission's proposal to create a unitary combining Hove with Adur and Worthing. This option had minimal support in these areas, however.</p>

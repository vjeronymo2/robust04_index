			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts (Christmas Entertainment): Come to the Ball - Holiday ballet, music and opera BALLET, alone among the arts, moves into the major key at Christmas. This month sees the centenary of The Nutcracker. Too bad the UK does not have a great staging of this (potentially) marvellous ballet. Those who need a fix of Tchaikovsky's classic score this Christmas may attend English National Ballet's month of Nutcrackers at the Festival Hall (December 21-January 16) or Birmingham Royal Ballet's three-week season at the Birmingham Hippodrome (until December 19). Better than either, however, is Matthew Bourne's impish and refreshing version for Adventures in Motion Pictures, staged (as in 1892) in a double-bill with Tchaikovsky's Yolanta and presented by Opera North at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. (18-22 December and 20-30 January). Frederick Ashton's ballet Tales of Beatrix Potter, newly adapted for the stage from the 1971 film, is Covent Garden's main Christmas offering this year, in a double bill with his classic 1964 Shakespearian one-acter, The Dream. Despite frosty reviews, it is currently delighting not only children but numerous adults. Only a few Pounds 50 seats remain, but seats upstairs are the best place to catch the most enchantingly choreographed tale of all  -the Two Naughty Mice. The three-act Cinderella is yet another Ashton ballet (1948) that works as seasonal fun and brilliant choreography. The current staging, though flawed, is basically commendable and often enthralling (December 23-Febrary 3). Something in Ashton's spirit had an instinct for Christmas. London City Ballet, during its four-week season at Sadler's Wells, is presenting his 1937 Victorian-skaters-in-winter masterpiece, Les Patineurs - one of the most perfect ballets ever made - in a triple bill (December 14-16, 21-23). Balanchine's brilliant 1960 Donizetti Variations, scarcely known in Europe, is also to be seen on the December 14-16 bill. Other performances are of Ben Stevenson's Romeo and Juliet. The Messiah crops up all over the place at this time of year. For example: St Mary's, Bryanston Square (Dec 12, Geoffrey Hanson conducting the London Ripieno Singers); Royal Festival Hall (December 14-15, Franz Welser-Most conducting the LPO, Felicity Lott and others); Barbican (December 14, Jane Glover conducting the RPO and Huddersfield Choral Society); Westminster Central Hall (December 15, organised by soprano Eiddwen Harrhy in aid of the homeless); St John's, Smith Square (December 16 and 17, by candlelight, John Lubbock conducting the St John's Orchestra and London Philharmonic Choir); and many more. The performances at St John's, Smith Square, performances are part of a season of Yuletide choral music there (December 13-23). Repertory includes Mediaeval, Renaissance, Bohemian and Polish; also Britten's St Nicholas (December 15). A highlight should be The Sixteen's performance, over two nights, of Bach's Christmas Oratorio (Parts 1-3, Tuesday 22; Parts 4-6, December 23). The most obviously Christmas opera this year is Hansel and Gretel, although one may pause before bringing the kids along to David Pountney's masterful and provocative staging. Few critics have kind words for Ken Russell's version of Princess Ida (also Coliseum, until January 21); as with last year's seasonal staging of Fledermaus, you go to it for the sake of either argument or mindless frivolity. In contrast, running from December 16 until January 23, is Pountney's new staging of Janacek's The Adventures of Mr Broucek. Hopes are high for Covent Garden's new production of Handel's Alcina (December 22-29, January 15-22), particularly on vocal grounds; the cast includes Yvonne Kenny, Ann Murray, Kathleen Kuhlmann and Anthony Rolfe Johnson.</p>

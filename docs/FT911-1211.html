			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Poll puts interest in job above earnings EMPLOYEES are more concerned about whether their jobs are interesting and secure than they are about pay and benefits, according to a Mori poll commissioned by the GMB general union. The poll findings are intended to influence debate about priorities at a special conference due to be held today on the future of the Trades Union Congress. The GMB said the survey gave a clear warning that only 1 in 20 people counted working for an organisation with a strong trade union as important in a job. The two factors, out of a total of 21, that were considered most important in a job, were: whether the work was interesting and enjoyable (62 per cent); and whether it was secure (59 per cent). A feeling of having accomplished something worthwhile (46 per cent) was rated third, and basic pay (38 per cent) ranked fourth. Among women employees, basic pay ranked seventh. Fringe benefits were valued highly by only 6 per cent. Having a chance to learn skills and develop abilities was important to 33 per cent of those polled but was negotiated in only 20 per cent of workplaces, said the union. Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said trade unions in the 1980s had been pushed back into a corner and had accepted that they could talk to employers only on a limited range of issues. 'Our poll shows that to survive in the 1990s we have got to widen our approach to bargaining,' he said.</p>

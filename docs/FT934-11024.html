			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Deutsche Bank prepares to open wide the doors on its past: The secretive institution plans 'no-holds-barred' history TOWERING above Frankfurt's financial district are the twin skyscrapers of Deutsche Bank's headquarters. The buildings are made of of steel and glass: blue reflective glass which is eye-catching but not designed to let anyone look inside. This lack of transparency has long been a characteristic of the bank, Germany's most powerful financial institution with profits as big as those of its three main competitors combined. Deutsche Bank has been at the heart of German capitalism since shortly after it was founded in 1870, and has always been highly secretive in its dealings with the outside world. A portion of the veil, however, is set to be lifted. To celebrate the bank's 125th anniversary in two years' time, Deutsche has commissioned a 'no-holds barred' history of the bank from five leading economic historians, each concentrating on a particular period. The bulk of the material has already been completed and was presented to international scholars in Frankfurt last month. The history itself will be published in German and English in 1995. The historians, at work on the project since 1988, have more recently been able to draw on the bank's archives for the years 1870-1945. These only became available after German reunification in 1990; before then they were held in the east German city of Potsdam. With a budget of DM1m (Pounds 400m), the project was initiated by Mr Alfred Herrhausen, the former chief executive of the bank killed by terrorists in 1989. It has the active support of his successor, Mr Hilmar Kopper, who makes a point of finding time amid his frantic schedule to attend the meetings of the committee co-ordinating the project. According to Prof Manfred Pohl, the bank's in-house historian, the aim is to take the writing of corporate history to new levels of academic excellence. All too often, he says, corporate histories diminish their intellectual authority by their desire to present an unremittingly positive view of the company in question. For the Deutsche Bank, as for other German financial and industrial institutions, there is one area of obvious potential embarrassment when scrutinising the past - collaboration with the Nazi regime in the 1930s and assistance with the war effort in 1939-1945. Last time the Deutsche Bank published a history, to celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1970, the issue was not confronted. Barely a mention was made of a report by the finance division of the Office of Military Government, United States Finance Division (OMGUS) which described how the bank, in common with other large financial institutions, financed the war effort, facilitated its industrial customers' use of slave labour, expanded its branch network into the territories occupied by the Wehrmacht, and participated in the Arianisation of German business. This time, there will be no fudge: the bank is intending to stare this unpleasant aspect of the past directly in the face. It demonstrated this commitment last month when it held a seminar on the bank's role in financing Universum Film, Germany's film monopoly in the 1920s and 1930s which developed into a central organ of Goebbels' propaganda machine during the Third Reich. The company was founded in 1917 at the initiative of Mr Emil Georg von Strauss, a director of the bank, and Deutsche owned a stake in the organisation during the twenties when it made a made a number of early film classics such as Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis'. The bank sold out in 1927. Moreover, says Prof Pohl, the commitment to objectivity has been underscored by the decision to appoint Prof Harold James, an Englishmen now at Princeton University, to cover the most sensitive period of all: 1933-45. Prof James is the official historian of the International Monetary Fund and writes on German affairs. The OMGUS team reported that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's second biggest bank then and now, had too great a concentration of economic power. They recommended that the banks should be wound up and their senior executives tried as war criminals and barred from taking up positions of responsibility in post-war Germany. The winding-up did not happen. Broken down into regional organisations by the allies, the banks were reformed in 1957 and soon developed for themselves a central role in post-war capitalism. Nor did bank personnel find themselves excluded from office, as witnessed by the career of the legendary Mr Hermann Josef Abs, Deutsche's first chief executive after the war. He joined the board of the Deutsche Bank in 1938 and although he was never a member of the Nazi party, and provided personal help to Jewish businessmen and their families during the war years, he was roundly criticised by the OMGUS investigators. Mr Abs is today 92 and still able to prosecute his causes with a flavour of the old doggedness - nowadays in the art world rather than in the boardroom. After brief internment after the war, he went on to be one of the chief architects of Germany's economic revival. The Abs theme is likely to be of special interest to readers of the official history. But the narrative from the more distant past should also provide insight into the mysteries of present-day German capitalism. For example, the chapters covering 1870-1914 and 1914-33 will deal with the bank's role in sponsoring companies such as Siemens, AEG, Daimler-Benz and Mannesmann in their early years. Its links with these companies are still close.</p>

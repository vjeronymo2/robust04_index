			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun--The newspaper OBSERVADOR  ECONOMICO, which is published in Montevideo, reported on Tuesday  that the Uruguay firm "Imaribo" has purchased Ka-32 all-weather  helicopters, which are being manufactured in the town of  Zhukovskiy in Moscow Oblast, for ice reconnaissance and for the  transportation of cargo. Under a contract with the firm, a group  of Russian engineers in Uruguay is fitting these helicopters  with weapons; they are a civilian version of the mass-produced  combat helicopters. Afterwards, they will be resold to other  countries. The first helicopter has already been purchased by  Peru's Armed Forces.    The Ka-32 helicopters are being delivered from Russia by sea  to Uruguay's free economic zone, to the town of Florida, 90 km  north of the Uruguayan capital. Each helicopter costs no less  than 2.5 million dollars. The newspaper notes that these  helicopters are one of the most promising models in Russia,  which are noted for their high degree of maneuverability.  During the war in Afghanistan, these helicopters, fitted with  weapons, proved their combat effectiveness. In addition to  this, they have a spacious cargo compartment and equipment for  the transportation of suspended cargo. The Ka-32 helicopters can  be used to assemble equipment, lay power lines, and also to  carry out operations to rescue people and equipment during  natural disasters.    The Uruguayan newspaper notes that the intention in Peru is  to use the helicopter to fight the drug mafia. Contracts for  the sale of the military version of the Ka-32 helicopters have  already been concluded with a number of other Latin American  countries.</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PICKETS AT CARL'S JR.  </P> <P> After reading the news accounts of National Organization for Women supporters  picketing the Carl's Jr. Restaurant in Irvine (Oct.29) Sande Soloman's  statement " . . . and we're here to protest Carl Karcher" kept ringing in my  ears.  </P> <P> If Ms. Soloman and the NOW supporters are telling us not to buy Mr. Karcher's  hamburgers, are they going to urge all of their families and friends to boycott  any hospital, shelter, community service or charity funded by the Karcher  family? Or is it all right to sock it to Mr. Karcher's business but continue to  take from his ever-extended hand?  </P> <P> VERONICA BAUM  </P> <P> Corona del Mar  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: EC plea to stave off US airlines EUROPEAN Community airlines and telecommunications groups must be given time to grow stronger before the European market can be opened to full outside competition, according to the EC's competition commissioner. In a speech due to be delivered in Washington last night, Mr Karel Van Miert warned that although the EC was pledged to liberalisation in both sectors, it would not improve competition to give US companies immediate access to the European market. Instead, he said, EC airlines and telecoms companies should be allowed to 'grow strong' within a liberalised internal EC market. In the text of his speech - released in Brussels ahead of last night's address at the European Institute Club - Mr Van Miert pointed out that US airline companies 'grew strong on the back of the world's largest and still protected market'. EC air transport and telecoms companies deserved an equal chance to become competitive. As the EC's transport commissioner until January this year, Mr Van Miert helped persuade EC member states to accept a package of measures liberalising the Community's air transport market. Under the terms of the 'open skies' programme, which came into force on January 1, airlines are allowed to set fares at any level, and EC carriers can compete on routes previously dominated by national airlines. The text of last night's speech underlined his continued concern about discrimination in the US air transport market. He said the US would have to treat EC airlines in the same way as it treated its own before US carriers would be granted access to Community markets. Mr Van Miert said he also wanted to end the 'popular misconception (in the US) that a large part of industry in Europe is either publicly owned or publicly controlled' and that it benefits from unfair state support.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey's swap shop Abbey National's behaviour bears the hallmarks of a one-product company with surplus capital and a desperate desire to diversify. After its embarrassing mistakes in estate agency and French commercial lending, it is now teaming up with Baring Brothers to offer swap business to corporations. That certainly marks a departure from its retail traditions and the fear must be that, like other attempts at diversification, it will end in tears. The only consolation is that Abbey's treasury business has a good track record and now accounts for over 20 per cent of profits. Abbey does have some swaps market experience from its active Eurobond borrowing programme. Yet it is stretching things to claim much synergy between mortgages and the swap market. The latter makes more sense for Barings, which has quietly scooped up the twin advantage of access to Abbey's capital and its credit rating. Abbey prefers to present the venture as little more than an interesting sideline. Having tested the water, though, the natural inclination will be to go in deeper. It would not take long before top group management, which has no experience of the sharp end of the derivatives market, is out of its depth. The fate of TSB's attempt to diversify into big ticket commercial lending may prove instructive. Still nursing its wounds, TSB now again sees its future in retail business. It paid a heavy price for trying to behave like Citibank. Abbey would risk a similar fate if it tried to emulate Bankers Trust.</p>

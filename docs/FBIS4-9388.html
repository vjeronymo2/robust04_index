			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (AFP) -- An aid convoy which had  been blocked by Serb forces arrived Tuesday in the Moslem  enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, a spokeswoman for the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said.    Spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said the Danish convoy of 10  trucks, carrying 90 tonnes of supplies, arrived in Gorazde  Tuesday morning.    The convoy, which left Belgrade Monday morning, crossed into  Bosnia Monday afternoon, but was stopped at a Serb checkpoint at  Dobrun, some 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Gorazde, and sent  back into Serbia, where it remained overnight.    On Tuesday Bosnian Serb authorities in Pale authorised the  convoy to continue into Bosnia, Sachs said.    Two other aid convoys, both Russian, were on their way to  Moslem enclaves in Bosnia, Sachs said. One was carrying 110  tonnes of aid to Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia and the other, of  14 trucks carrying 61 tonnes of supplies, was heading for  Gorazde.    A UN convoy carrying some 250 peacekeeping troops arrived in  Gorazde at 2:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) Monday, having taken 11 hours to  make the 70-kilometre (40- mile) journey from Sarajevo.    It was blocked for two hours in the Sarajevo suburb of  Lukavica by Serbs who objected to what they said were  discrepancies in the convoy's papers.</p>

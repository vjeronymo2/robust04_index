			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / SGS-Thomson share issue to raise Dollars 480m SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday announced plans to raise up to Dollars 480m (Pounds 292m) through the issue of shares on the New York and Paris stock markets. The operation is a significant step in the development of the semiconductor group, which was formed in 1987 through the merger of state-owned groups Thomson Semiconductor of France and Italy's SGS Microelectronics. Analysts in Paris said the issue of shares, which will represent about 20 per cent of the company's enlarged capital, would reinforce its balance sheet and could mark a step towards privatisation. The decision to raise capital on the stock market follows a strong improvement at the company, which is Europe's second largest semiconductor manufacturer. Last month it reported net profits of Dollars 166.1m for the six months to the end of July - more than for the whole of the previous financial year. Sales for the current financial year are expected to rise by about 20 per cent, compared with the Dollars 2bn recorded in 1993. Profits have been boosted by the upswing in the international semiconductor market and by reduced financial charges following two capital increases of Dollars 250m last year. The company's principal products include semiconductors for telecoms, computers and control systems. Under the terms of the issue, 21m shares will be offered. Just over 13.6m will be offered to investors in the US and Canada, with the balance being offered in other countries. In addition to listings on the New York and Paris stock exchanges, the shares are expected to be quoted on Seaq International. SGS-Thomson is also considering a quotation on Telematico, the Italian screen-based dealing market. The shares are to be priced at between Dollars 21 and Dollars 23. Morgan Stanley will be global co-ordinator and lead manager of the issue, with Banque Indosuez and Lehman Brothers as co-global co-ordinators.</p>

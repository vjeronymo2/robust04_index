Birkavs considers it is  time to launch economic ties between Latvia and Chile. The  sides are unanimous it is of special importance to enhance trade  between the two countries. Nowadays, the volume of goods  imported from Latvia by Chile comprises only 4,000 lats. The  ambassador sees good possibilities to more extensive bilateral  trade in the fact that Latvia has a large trade fleet, while  Chile produces relatively cheap goods. Birkavs, in turn,  proposed that work be started on providing the economic ties of  both countries with a legal basis, reviewing agreements on  investment protection and on avoiding double taxation. Latvia  would be the first country to have an agreement with this South  American country on avoiding double taxation. Birkavs and Parra  view the exchange with high-ranking delegations as the important  contribution to the cooperation between Latvia and Chile.    Birkavs also proposed the information exchange on the reform  process, stressing that Latvia wishes to know the way success in  economic reforms was achieved in Chile.    Parra, in his turn, called the experts in forestry and sea  economy of Latvia to join launching the projects dealing with  the research carried out in these branches in Chile.</p>

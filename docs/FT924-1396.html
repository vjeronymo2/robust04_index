			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs may back extension for coal POSTPONING the deregulation of the electricity market is likely to be the centrepiece of the proposals of the Commons select committee on trade and industry to boost the coal industry. MPs believe this would provide a necessary three to four year 'bridge' for British Coal to raise productivity to a level where it would compete on world markets. MPs finished two months' of hearings this week and aim to have their report ready by mid-January, ahead of a white paper by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Postponing deregulation would extend present arrangements which give British Coal protected access to 70 per cent of the domestic power generation market. Under the current timetable, its protected access will be reduced to 50 per cent of the market in 1994. The all-party committee, chaired by Mr Richard Caborn, Labour MP for Sheffield Central, is also warming to the idea of an energy commission to set policy and provide long-term stability. Members are concerned that the government does not have adequate powers to manage the energy market, and that it is leaving the regulators in command. Other measures the committee is considering include: Making the cross-channel link with the French electricity grid revert to its intended role as a balance to cover peaks and troughs, rather than as a source of imports. Stopping the switch to orimulsion, derived from coal waste, as a power station fuel. Diverting part of the nuclear levy into the coal industry, but as a subsidy for cleaner coal technology rather than a price support. This would get round EC limits on energy price subsidies. Requiring British Coal to squeeze the last coal out of doomed pits. This could be done cheaply as part of a 'rape and pillage' exercise, and the coal offered on the export market at world prices. These measures could boost coal demand by over 30m tonnes a year, though between 20-25m tonnes is more likely. MPs seem unlikely to support other widely canvassed options such as cutting back the nuclear power industry to make more room for coal. This would involve heavy decommissioning costs. But in return for being spared the axe, nuclear power could be made to give up a portion of its levy income. Making an outright subsidy for coal is unlikely to be suggested because of the state of public finances. It also looks as if the committee will leave gas alone because of the lack of clear evidence that it is stealing market share from coal.</p>

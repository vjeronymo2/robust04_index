Geydar Aliyev said he  is ready to consider the status of the Republic of  Nagorno-Karabakh if only the Karabakh troops leave for their  territory.    Thus, the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh is officially  recognized a conflict side, though Azerbaijan was always  avoiding doing it. But, according to Mamikonyan, the Aliyev's  declaration gives no mechanism of conflict regulation.    Mr. Mamikonyan also confirmed Karabakh for numerous times  declared he has a claim on the lands of Azeris and is ready to  set them free as soon as the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh  security is solved.</p>

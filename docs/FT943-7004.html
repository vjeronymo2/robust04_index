			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Seoul curbs overseas bond issues South Korea's finance ministry will ban companies from issuing convertible bonds and other securities in foreign capital markets in the fourth quarter of this year. The ministry said the decision was meant to prevent inflationary pressure caused by an inflow of foreign capital, with the government worried that inflation will exceed this year's target of 6 per cent. It added that its ceiling of Dollars 1.25bn on overseas bond issues for 1994 had already been reached. South Korean companies have been eager to tap foreign capital markets to finance an expansion in industrial facilities being taken in response to an export boom. At least 21 companies have applied to the Korea Securities Dealers' Association to issue overseas bonds during the fourth quarter. They were hoping to take advantage of improved financial conditions resulting from a possible solution to the North Korean nuclear dispute. The ministry had initially proposed to exempt Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) from the ban on bond issues. But it decided to impose the restrictions after protests from other companies. Posco planned to issue Dollars 200m in American Depositary Receipts this year as a step to seeking a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the first for a South Korean company.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Investors clear way for Finnish pulp mill Finland's Metsa-Rauma yesterday gave the go-ahead for the construction of a FM3bn (Dollars 524m) pulp mill at Rauma in the west of the country. It will be one of the biggest investments in the country's pulp and paper sector. The plant, which will have a capacity to produce 500,000 tonnes a year of chlorine-free softwood pulp, is expected to start production in the spring of 1996. United Paper Mills (UPM) and Metsa-Serla, two of Finland's leading pulp and paper groups, are the biggest shareholders in Metsa-Rauma, with stakes of 45.6 per cent and 27.8 per cent respectively. A further 20.6 per cent stake will be held by Metsaliitto, a wood procurement co-operative. Metsa-Rauma's owners will finance one-third of the project. The balance will funded through a loan, for which the Finnish Guarantee Board has provided a FM1.2bn guarantee. The lead manager is Postipankki, the Finnish state-owned bank. Optimism about the pulp market has risen rapidly since the start of the year, with softwood pulp prices surging from Dollars 380 a tonne last November to Dollars 560. Some commentators believe the price could reach Dollars 650 a tonne by the year-end. Mr Juhani Ahava, Metsa-Rauma chairman, said the mill's main owners would take about half the plant's output. UPM will use most of its share at its Rauma paper mill, while Metsa-Serla will supply its Kirkniemi magazine paper plant. Much of the remaining production is expected to be sold in Europe as a reinforcing agent in recycled paper production. The mill is also being built because Metsaliitto wants to have an outlet for its members' wood in the Rauma region, where two pulp mills have been closed.</p>

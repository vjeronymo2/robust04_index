			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> THE GEYSERS REGION LOSING ITS STEAM  </P> <P> The world's largest complex of natural geothermal electrical plants, clustered  in Northern California's The Geysers region, is running out of steam must  faster than expected, according to energy experts. The area's more than 30  plants were originally expected to produce enough electricity for 500,000  households and account for 38% of the world's geothermal capacity. But steam  pressure in the area has dropped below 200 pounds per square inch, less than  half what it was when development began three decades ago. State Energy  Commission Chairman Charles Imbrecht said the potential financial loss could  reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  </P></p>

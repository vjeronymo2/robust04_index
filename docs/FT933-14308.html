			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Whitehall calls for training improvements HUMAN resources and training are the chief obstacles to industrial competitiveness, a government study has found. Whitehall officials told MPs yesterday that the main difference between the UK and its competitors lies at the craft and technician level, while management quality is also variable. The report says that productivity in manufacturing still lags behind Japan, France and Germany by 25 per cent. However, the gap has closed from between 40 per cent and 45 per cent at the end of the 1970s. Mr Robert Dobbie, head of the recently formed competitiveness division at the Department of Trade and Industry, told the Commons trade and industry committee that the gap was largely due to the use of human resources rather than lack of investment. The UK's lower spending on research and development was a source of concern, he said. However, innovation depended not only on research, but on the successful exploitation of new ideas. The report on UK manufacturing competitiveness, submitted by the DTI to the committee, is a summary of a study submitted to ministers earlier this year. Press reports at the time alleged that the study had been suppressed because it was too damning about UK industry. This was denied yesterday by officials who said the new version contained the same data and omitted only confidential advice to ministers. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the report showed that although British industry had caught up significantly in the past 15 years, there were still gaps. 'In the training of technicians and craftsmen, the results are perhaps worse than we expected,' he said. 'In other areas they were better.' Mr Dobbie told MPs that British management was also variable in quality. The best were of world class, but there was a long tail of poorer performers. He denied MPs' suggestions that UK manufacturers were at a disadvantage on fiscal grounds: 'The fiscal regime in the UK is relatively favourable towards industry.' He also denied that UK companies were handicapped by shareholder pressure for large dividend payments. 'The evidence is that in general, UK companies do not get into difficulties by paying too large dividends,' he said.</p>

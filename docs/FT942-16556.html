			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptionals behind Laird rise - 'Very difficult' German market proves main setback Exchange rate movements and settlement of a lawsuit helped Laird Group, the manufacturer of car components and industrial products, raise profits for 1993. The group, which makes more than 80 per cent of its profits overseas, lifted its pre-tax line from Pounds 36.2m to Pounds 38.2m. The latest figure included a Pounds 2.5m exchange gain and a Pounds 2.8m credit from the settlement of a lawsuit over intellectual property rights. Last year's outcome included operating losses of Pounds 700,000 and a Pounds 2.6m disposal loss from discontinued operations. Mr John Gardiner's role as chairman and chief executive is being split from October with Mr Ian Arnott, group managing director, taking the latter position. Mr Arnott said the company had put in a solid performance in spite of the worst recession in the European automotive industry since the second world war. More than 60 per cent of the group's business is derived from the automotive industry. Last year French car production was down 15 per cent, while Spanish and German production was down 20 per cent. Mr Arnott described the German market, where the group suffered its main setback, as 'very, very difficult'. Profits from France were ahead following cost savings and better supplies to new models, and in Spain were up from a low base. Total group turnover rose from Pounds 600.7m to Pounds 624.4m, although Pounds 50m of the latest figure reflected exchange rate movements. Non-automotive activities, which are being expanded in order to reduce exposure to the automotive industry, improved profits by 50 per cent and raised their share of total profits from 22 per cent to 38 per cent. The industrial products division, which includes automotive components other than seals in Germany and parts for doors and windows, lifted operating profits from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 16.2m. In the UK this division's non-automotive profits rose from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 8.4m. The services industries division, which includes US printing and plastics distribution and the Scottish computer components operation, lifted profits from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 10.1m. At the year-end net debt and gearing was virtually unchanged at Pounds 22.7m and 10.5 per cent respectively. Earnings per share under FRS 3 were up from 18.7p to 21.2p, helped by a fall in the tax charge from Pounds 15.5m to Pounds 13.3m. A final dividend of 6.5p is proposed, taking the total to 10.7p (10.5p). COMMENT Strip out the currency factor and the lawsuit credit and Laird's operating profits are Pounds 39.5m, down from Pounds 46.3m for 1992. This illustrates the extent of the European recession for automotives, particularly in Germany, on which the group is still heavily dependent. However, the non-automotive side, which has a high US and UK content, is making progress. The balance sheet remains strong, and new plants are being brought on stream this year in the UK, the US, Spain and the Czech Republic. Pencilled-in profits of Pounds 40m for this year put the shares, up 18p at 388p yesterday, on a prospective multiple of more than 17, which looks fully valued. However, it is worth remembering that despite extremely tough markets the dividend is being raised, and the cover has been increased from 1.9 to 2 times.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Pericles diffused - Martin Hoyle on the National's new production The huge disc that dominates the Olivier stage in Pericles at the National is planked like a galleon's deck and blistered with what might be lunar craters or froth bubbles; a reminder from Mark Thompson's designs that the moon and the sea propel the action in this rambling odyssey. Or it could be a giant beer-mat. Phyllida Lloyd's production draws on styles and cultures from South American jungle to ice-bound Inuit, Arab to African to oriental. There is music. There is dance, not as much as advance publicity led us to fear but still interminable. From the home country there is a dash of pantomime and a hint, in the brothel scenes, of Carry On (one day Barbara Windsor must play the Bawd). And the net result is to make a sprawl more sprawling still. Ms Lloyd's production of Britten's Gloriana, much praised at its Opera North base raised doubts at Covent Garden: it failed to paper over cracks in disjointed narrative or iron out unevenly distributed dramatic action. It substituted business for an overall view; and made a long work longer. The same might be said of this Shakespeare production, particularly damaging in a piece that needs to be focused, cohesive and concentrated. Here it is merely diffused. Part of the trouble is the character of Pericles himself, at first glance tailor-made for the Green Party candidate that Douglas Hodge is in real life. The prince is a jolly good sort, suffers, and is reunited with his dispersed family; all without achieving any noticeable human character. Some themes may herald the last great works but much is hack stuff, possibly already extant when Shaklespeare took it up. Mr Hodge does well in a psychologically non-existent role that requires him to be a boy scout for most of the evening before briefly turning into King Lear. His early, slightly gormless, decency finds a natural resolution in the almost wimpering exhaustion from happy gratitude to the goddess Diana - the production at least ends movingly. But mainly it limits itself to throwing visual gimmicks at the piece and hoping for the best. The chorus-figure Gower (pointedly not ancient in his famous opening words, 'From ashes ancient (pause) Gower is come') emerges from the same grand piano in which Thaisa's presumed corpse is consigned to the sea. Why? Sexual cross-over in the casting seems to have no rationale behind it - unlike the famous 1973 Round House production which boasted a Bawd, G-stringed, fish-netted and high-heeled, in the wickedly cherubic shape of Harold Innocent. Tom Yang comes off best as the murderous foster-mother, an imposing presence flouncing, swirling and fluting, a cross between M Butterfly and Cruella de Vil. Poor Selina Cadell, on the other hand, looks and patently feels absurd as a bespectacled elder statesman. Visually there are treats but it is all too picturesque. Fairy-tales need the anchor of normality as a point of reference; when everything is grotesque you cease to care; the lost chord in Pericles' perceived music of the spheres is the sound of a great 'So what?' The first real stroke of theatre, when Thaisa is resuscitated not gracefully but screaming, reliving the pains of childbirth, occurs after an hour and a half. In a not entirely audible cast, Kathryn Hunter brings her gnomic individuality to roles as varied as the nasally cockney Bawd and the incestuous king (a monstrous Ralph Steadman-like figure, tiny crowned head atop fifteen feet of red robe, scarecrow stilt-arms waving). Susan Lynch's Ulster-accented Marina is a tough, sparkish waif who replaces the part's usual pathos with Paisleyite pugnacity. Of the French-accented dancer chosen to speak the goddess's important words, the less said the better. The overall impression is of watching an ambitious production of The Magic Flute without Mozart's music. And what an experience that would be.</p>

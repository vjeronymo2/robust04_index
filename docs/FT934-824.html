			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (2): Budget targets may not be met - Impact of the Gulf war on the economy Saudi Arabia is well versed in handling the peaks and troughs of oil export earnings. The 1980s saw annual variations of up to Dollars 100bn as the kingdom was affected by sudden changes in supply and demand, and fully used its role as the swing producer within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to smooth out fluctuations for the greater long-term benefit of the producer nations. However, the financial impact of the Gulf war, particularly on the level of Saudi Arabia's reserves, has put an end to that role. The kingdom is now like any other member of Opec in that it will need to maximise its oil export revenues for the foreseeable future if it is to prevent its budget and current account deficits from running out of control. The government can fairly point to the fact that it has already enjoyed a measure of success with deficit-reduction policies during the five-year period before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and threw its programme badly off course. During the second half of the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its overall budget deficit by more than half, from over 20 per cent of gross national product to less than 10 per cent. During the same period the current account deficit on the balance of payments was reduced by 5 per cent of GDP to 11 per cent. But President Saddam Hussein put an end to those creditable achievements. The average budget deficit for the years 1990 and 1991 came to about 17 per cent of GDP and the current account deficit climbed back to about 14 per cent. It has been the government's stated intention to get back on track as swiftly as possible. Its 1992 budget was supposed to see a sharp drop in spending with total expenditure set at just over Dollars 44bn, compared with an annualised rate of Dollars 61bn over the two previous war-affected years. This should have seen the deficit decline to a forecast 3.3 per cent of GNP. In the event, the government failed to reduce spending by its target of 28 per cent and provisional figures suggest that at about Dollars 55bn, it was some Dollars 11bn over budget. As a percentage of GNP, the deficit was nearly three times larger than the target. Although officials decline to discuss budget details, it seems clear that capital expenditure was substantially larger than forecast and there was also slippage in the announced programme of reducing subsidies, particularly those related to the agricultural sector. The government has promised to try harder in the current financial year and there is evidence that it is having greater success, particularly in reducing the subsidies paid to wheat producers. The main cuts were designed to fall on project expenditure, especially that related to security. However, there is little additional evidence, real or anecdotal, to indicate that firm government action has been taken. The spending target of Dollars 48.5bn appears unrealistic and the final figure could well turn out to be within the Dollars 53-55bn range. At the same time, government revenues appear certain to fall below the forecast Dollars 45bn as a result of weakening oil prices. This would suggest another budget deficit this year of more than Dollars 10bn. With little or no growth forecast in the overall economy, the aimed-for reduction in the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP will not be achieved. This failure has to be seen in the context of the concerns expressed privately six months ago by a visiting team from the International Monetary Fund. The mission warned then that even if the Saudi government met its 1993 budget targets, total debt would rise from 56 per cent of GDP to some 60 per cent. Unless further stringent measures were taken in the succeeding years the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 80 per cent by 1997. These forecasts were also made on the assumption of a modest annual increase in the level of oil revenues. But, the Fund added, if the government failed to meet its 1993 targets, which now seems certain, the medium-term deficits would be even larger and debt servicing would place an increasingly heavy burden on budgetary resources. Although the authorities remain confident that the banking sector's high liquidity level will continue to finance the budget deficit through the traditional means of government development bonds, there are fears among the private sector that in the medium term its access to funds could be squeezed. Such a prospect should be an additional cause of alarm for a government which for nearly a decade has insisted that the private sector must take a growing responsibility for providing economic growth. One probably inevitable consequence of all these pressures is that the government will have to turn to taxation, in some form, as a way of boosting its revenues. Ministers have been adamant during the past two years that social conditions have not permitted either a significant cut in subsidies or any form of additional charges. On the contrary, subsidies on some utilities were actually increased in order to offset the modest increase in inflation stemming from the Gulf war. But the nettle will eventually have to be grasped, and there are some indications that the government is already looking at modest initiatives, such as a tax on international and domestic airline tickets. There is also considerable scope on the expenditure side, where military and infrastructure projects appear to be ripe targets for cuts or delays. The Gulf war experience demonstrated that the kingdom's ability to resist external threats resulted as much on the facilities it was able to provide for foreign armies as it did on Saudi Arabia's own armed forces. Those facilities proved their value, and military experts argue that the kingdom requires more time to absorb the equipment it now has, rather than embarking on a programme of new acquisitions. In other words, it could well do without do without some of the Dollars 30bn of weaponry it has contracted to buy since the invasion of Kuwait. Such cuts or delays would also help to ease the balance of payments problems which have mirrored those of the budget. The current account deficit last year at Dollars 19.4bn was substantially above forecast and casts serious doubt on the outcome for 1993 which, it had been hoped, would not rise much above Dollars 11bn, or around 9.3 per cent of GDP. Even on that basis, the IMF had projected a worsening current account deficit over the next four years, reaching some Dollars 19bn in 1997, assuming also strong capital inflows. Weakening oil prices and a lower than expected level of foreign investment in Saudi Arabia would obviously make the picture considerably gloomier. The problem is exacerbated by the loss of the reserve cushion caused by the Gulf war. Net official foreign assets were estimated at Dollars 72bn at the end of last year, equivalent to about 29 months of imports. But this tells only part of the story. Over 30 per cent of the assets managed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency is held as statutory cover for the currency. Another 30 per cent is held against letters of credit and liabilities to the commercial banks, while some Dollars 20bn or more represents loans to Iraq and other countries which are most unlikely ever to be repaid. In the middle of this year, liquid funds actually available to Sama were put at a little over Dollars 7bn, and were unlikely to show much, if any, improvement in the short to medium term. Further external borrowing is, of course, an option, but there is no evidence that Saudi Arabia has tapped international markets beyond the Dollars 4.5bn it raised at the time of the Gulf war. Some bankers suggested recently that the fact the government has not borrowed this year indicates that the authorities are proving more successful than had been supposed in controlling the current account deficit. This may also have served to dampen recurrent speculative pressures against the riyal. Some Saudis continue to argue privately for a modest devaluation against the dollar, but there is no evidence that the government sees any benefit to the economy from such action. On the contrary, it almost certainly fears the damage that a devaluation would have on local confidence and the consequent impact on capital inflows from abroad.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT BY KIND OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN PRODUCERS'                     VALUES AT CURRENT PRICES (SRM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1981       1982      1983       1984       1985  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A - Industries and other producers except producers of government     services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture, forestry   and fishing       6,740      8,725     9,611     11,620     13,789  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Crude petroleum   and natural    gas            323,328    192,874   143,172    120,305     88,286  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other mining &amp;

DPR&hyph;32, DPR&hyph;37, NPF&hyph;4, and NPF&hyph;7 issued to Virginia Electric and Power Company, (the licensee), for operation of the Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2, located in Surry County, Virginia, and North Anna Power Station Units 1 and 2, located in Louisa County, Virginia. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application dated May 27, 1994, for exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.'' The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system for site access control such that picture badges and access control cards for certain non-employees can be taken offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) specifies that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area *&blank;*&blank;*''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, employee and contractor identification badges, coupled with their associated access control cards, are issued and retrieved on the occasion of each entry to and exit from the protected areas of the Surry and North Anna sites. Station security personnel are required to maintain control of the badges while the individuals are offsite. This practice has been in effect at the Surry and North Anna Power Stations since each operating license was issued. Security personnel retain each identification badge, as well as the associated access control card, when not in use by the authorized individual, within appropriately designed storage receptacles inside a bullet-resistant enclosure. An individual who meets the access authorization requirements is issued an individual picture identification card and an individual access control card which allows entry into preauthorized areas of the station. While entering the plant in the present configuration, an authorized individual is ``screened'' by the required detection equipment and by the issuing security officer. Having received the badge, the individual proceeds to the access portal, inserts the access control card into the card readers, enters a personal identification number (PIN), and passes through the turnstile which unlocks if the preset criteria are met. Once inside the station, the individual's PIN is not required in order to further utilize the access authorization card. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This present procedure is labor intensive since security personnel are required to verify badge issuance, ensure badge retrieval, and maintain the badges in orderly storage until the next entry into the protected area. The regulations permit employees to remove their badges from the site, but an exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has completed its evaluation of the licensee's application. Under the proposed system, all individuals authorized to gain unescorted access will have the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) recorded with their badge number. Since the hand geometry is unique to each individual and its application in the entry screening function would preclude unauthorized use of a badge, the requested exemption would allow employees and contractors to keep their badges at the time of exiting the protected area. The process of verifying badge issuance, ensuring badge retrieval, and maintaining badges could be eliminated while the balance of the access procedure would remain intact. Firearm, explosive, and metal detection equipment and provisions for conducting searches will remain as well. The security officer responsible for the last access control function (controlling admission to the protected area) will also remain isolated within a bullet-resistant structure in order to assure his or her ability to respond or to summon assistance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

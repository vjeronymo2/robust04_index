			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to the Chamber </F> of Deputies in Rome -- live]    [Excerpts] Dear deputies, my late arrival was due to a  delay in concluding the morning session of the confidence  debate, because many deputies did not respect the time limits  allocated to them. [passage omitted]    Please allow me to start by offering my best wishes and my  thanks at the efforts put into discussing my speech, which  according to practice I read to the Chamber immediately after  having read it to the Senate. Once the custom was to repeat  without omissions the speech of the prime minister, but this  practice has been, I think wisely, abolished. The repetition of  an identical speech came to be considered a mere formality, or  if you will, a rite rather than a homage to the rules of  institutional communication. On the other hand, as my colleague  Giorgio Napolitano [former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies]  reminded us, ours is a system of perfect bicameralism, where one  assembly repeats, or almost repeats, that which the other does.  [passage omitted]    As every one knows, the elections took place on 27 and 28  March of this very year, and the republic will from this  evening, if of course I obtain your confidence, have a  government that is completely in control of its duties. [passage  omitted]    For the hundreth time, I will tell you how things stand: I  founded, nurtured, and administered until a few months ago a  large number of companies. I acted in accordance with the  constitutional laws that guarantee free enterprise. However,  today I am no longer a businessman, I no longer carry out any  administrative duties in my companies, I do not take part in the  decisions concerning the running of these companies, I do not  hold any posts in these companies, I am the managing director of  nothing, I do not attend any meetings, nor do I attend any  shareholder assemblies. This is my ethical behavior with regard  to the assets that I own. Furthermore, I am supervised by my  conscience -- which no one in good faith can doubt -- I am  supervised by the president of the republic, by the anti-trust  authorities, by the media ombudsman, by the Council of Ministers  -- which is a collective body -- by the parliament, and most  especially by the opposition parties, by judiciary, by the free  press, by the electors, and by public opinion. If all this is  not enough, if we want to look into the future and exercise  without control the normal functions of surveillance to which  all public men are subject then this is bad. [passage omitted]    Let us return to serious matters, former speaker Napolitano  touched upon points with which I frankly agree. [passage  omitted]    It is true that a first-past-the-post system must have a  series of checks and balances. The American system of  democracy, which is a presidential and first-past-the-post  system par excellence, is indeed based on a cast-iron system of  checks and balances, of autonomous powers, which are controlled  by great authorities. However, in Italy we are only at the  beginning of this process. For the past few months, we have had  a first-past-the-post system with a strong proportional  counterweight. [passage omitted]    I am sensitive to the question of counterweights and  guarantees, of rules and the rigorous adherence to those rules.  [passage omitted]    I will not repeat here the considerations on my government's  policy or on the various points of this policy, as I already did  this in the Senate. I am convinced that even the best policy  cannot exist and thrive without the existence of instruments to  put this policy into practice. [passage omitted]    I am certain that I have formed a capable team full of  competent and enthusiastic people. [passage omitted]    Mr. Fausto Bertinotti [leader of the Communist Refoundation  Party], what do you mean when you say that the crisis in the  Italian economy is a structural one? I think that you mean that  the crisis is a serious one, that it has nothing to do with the  current situation, that it cannot be solved without  intervention, that the sectors involved are productive,  agricultural, industrial, financial, and commercial, that  briefly what is at stake are the destiny and the aims of our  economy. If structural means this, then my honorable colleague,  be so kind as to realize that there is no difference of opinion  between us as far as our country's economy is concerned. We  disagree on the means of overcoming these difficulties. Our  disagreement is a simple one and is one that everybody can  understand without oversimplifying the nature of the problem.  [passage omitted]    I am referring to a point in your speech in which you blame  all of the world's suffering on capitalism. Allow me to say  that you are forgetting a fact that is now universally  recognized in our time. [passage omitted]    Most of the suffering in our time should be laid at the door  of Communism and the Socialist reality and to the misery that  they caused, rather than at the door of captalism.    Everyone knows how I feel about this, and my views were put  to the electorate. I do not expect this to be accepted, but I  only ask that it should be put to the test, because, as I said,  they are not dogmatic thoughts. [passage omitted]    The government must intervene in two ways, by supporting the  economy by freeing it from too many rules that stifle it, and,  at the same time, by supervising the adherence to those rules  without which there would be no free market: support and  supervision. This does not mean managing the economy. [passage  omitted]    The free market is a strategy of development that must be  treated cautiously, but it is a strategy to whose principles  this government has decided to adhere with wisdom and restraint.  [[passage omitted]    Dear deputies, I would like to thank Achille Occhetto for  his  speech. I am sure that he made the right choice when he said  that the Left would not follow a blind and factious opposition  line. [passage omitted]    Achille Occhetto was one of the first to recognize after the  general election vote the right of the winning coalition to  govern. Then, for some reason, he changed his mind, and the  secretary of the largest party on the Left called this  government a humiliating one for Italy. Furthermore, he used a  tone that was completely out of character in an attempt to take  away the government's legitimacy. [passage omitted]    I do not believe that this is simply a right-wing  government.  This morning, the honorable Taradash [Radical Party] and the  honorable Bonnino, with her moving silence, asked me how I  regarded the role of the reformers in my government. [passage  omitted]    I intend to keep the helm firmly in the center. The  coalition that feeds the government with ideas and proposals --  as we saw during the course of the debate in the chambers -- has  a common moderate and democratic denominator. The coalition  encompasses the liberal left wing of the reformers to the  Catholics then through to the center politics of Forza Italia  and to a grassroots movement such as the Northern League, and  finally encompassing the institutional right of Gianfranco Fini.  However, one can coin the definitions that one prefers.  [passage omitted]    A pretext for bitterness is the presence in the government  of  the National Alliance. This is an electoral slate and political  organization that has signed a pact with the electors and with  other movements to govern Italy; it emerged from the polls  triumphant. This is a political organization that, as the  Honorable Fini solemnly confirmed this morning, has consigned  its links with fascism to history. This is a political movement  that, as Francesco Cossiga reminded us in the Senate, in the  past, when it was not called National Alliance and when it was  very different from what it is today, used its determining votes  to elect people to the highest offices in the state. These  actions were received with thanks. [passage omitted]    If you want to criticize us, then let me be the target of  your criticism, because I am a liberal democrat antifascist or  perhaps you can criticize my policies; however, do not look for  any pretexts to criticize the National Alliance. [passage  omitted]    I would like to thank the groups that make up the Freedom  Alliance and that have decided to give their vote of confidence  to the government. [passage omitted]    We have a shared vision of a united and federal Italy in a  united and federal Europe. [passage omitted]    I listened carefully to the things said by the Honorable  Gianfranco Fini during the course of this parliamentary  confidence debate. I do not know if one can say that  antifascism is the opposite of fascism. However, it is certain  that the Honorable Fini confirmed this morning the rigor of his  intention that many, including his adversaries, recognize. I am  certain that he says what he means and what he believes in when  he affirms his belief in the principles of democracy and liberty  and when he affirms his opposition to the political  totalitarianism that has marked the history of this century.  Italian democracy has always shown, my dear colleagues, a great  capacity to attract its ideological adversaries, and this has  been recognized instinctively by true liberals: liberty  liberates.    Madame speaker and honorable colleagues, if we obtain your  confidence, then from tomorrow the work of the government will  begin in earnest. You know that we have been summoned here by  millions of Italians who have a great desire for change. You  know the principles that we believe in and the values that  inspire us. We believe in all forms of liberty -- the liberty  of thought, the liberty of expression, of association, the  liberty to practice one's religion -- every religion, those  faiths that encourage man to improve himself. We believe in the  individual, we believe that we each have the right to fulfill  ourselves, to build our future with our own hands and to aspire  to well-being. We believe in the family, which is the center of  our affections and the fundamental nucleus of our society. We  believe in enterprise, which is the organization and institution  that creates work, well-being, and wealth. [passage omitted]    We believe in tolerance, and for us it is natural to  practice  this. We believe in respect, in respect for everyone -- even  our enemies and above all for those who are the weakest.  [passage omitted]    We are ready for everything. Today we are ready to govern  and tomorrow to be in opposition. We are a new force managing  the state, and for this precise political motive, we ask to be  judged by facts. [passage omitted]    It is obvious that it will not be easy to put the country  back onto the right road, it will not be easy to relaunch the  economy and to safeguard jobs and above all to create new jobs.  It will not be easy to manage public money with attention and  with the capacity to make savings by reining in public  expenditure to relieve fiscal pressure. [passage omitted]    We know that our task will not be easy, but we will try to  succeed.    Dear colleagues, I thank you and ask that you give the  government your confidence.</p>

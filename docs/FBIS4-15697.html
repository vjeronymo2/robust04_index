			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kuzmenkin, VECHERNYY NOVOSIBIRSK </F> political observer: "City Something..."]    [Text]The city electoral commission started to work  right away, and several days after the elections to the  Novosibirsk City Deputy Assembly we have an opportunity to learn  about the results of the voting in each of the 25 electoral  districts. The dry figures lead to interesting  speculation--there will be more about them a little later;  first, the main thing.    The main thing is that Novosibirsk residents elected only 10  of the 25 deputies to the city Assembly. These 10 of the  people's elect will soon receive temporary certificates, but it  is still too early to say anything definite about the organ we  elected, or even simply to state whether it exists or not! The  fact is that there simply are no regulatory documents--they  apparently forgot to write them. So SOMETHING exists in  Novosibirsk, but we can say nothing about the details. For now  the mayor has added some clarity: Viktor Tolokonskiy stated that  the deputies must begin their work and that he personally will  do everything necessary to make sure that this happens as  quickly as possible.  <H5>  1. ONLY ONE OUT OF FOUR VOTED... </H5>   Of the 1,065,304 registered voters, 267,977 were not too  lazy  to come to the electoral precincts. This is only 25.2 percent of  the overall number of voters. And if that were not bad enough,  some of our compatriots preferred either to destroy their  ballots or take them for souvenirs, as a result of which the  electoral commissions, to their regret, found in the ballot  boxes (the word is somehow fitting) an even smaller  percentage--22.8 percent. But the rayons voted in different  ways. For example, residents of Zayeltsovskiy Rayon contrived  to elect all three of their deputies and the residents of  Pervomayskiy and Tsentralnyy Rayons elected their one each.  That was the maximum, and then came: Kalininskiy--two out of  three, Dzerzhinskiy--one out of two, Sovetskiy--the same,  Oktyabrskiy--one out of three. Three rayons were left out of  the game: Residents of Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon were unable to  elect their one deputy; Kirovskiy residents elected none of  their three deputies; and voters of Leninskiy Rayon failed to  elect even one out of five....  <H5>  2. DEPUTIES </H5>   Be that as it may, we did manage to elect 10 deputies. We  have published the lists so there is no point in repeating them;  let us note only the most interesting details. In the first  place, 11 deputies from the former city soviet were vying for  mandates at the same time: the largest number--three--in  Kalininskiy Rayon, and not a single one in Pervomayskiy,  Tsentralnyy, or Zheleznodorozhnyy. Only one of them was  ultimately successful: Vasiliy Krivoshchekov was elected in  Kalininskiy Rayon.    Second, only three of the deputies were nominated by voter  associations. That same Krivoshchekov was nominated by the Club  of Deputies and Voters, Georgiy Chulinin--Russia's Choice, and  Aleksandr Mankov--Working Novosibirsk.    Third, the city's mayor confirmed his authority and a good  deal of popularity: Viktor Tolokonskiy in competition with three  opponents was able to win 51.7 percent of the votes.    Let us note also that Nadezhda Boltenko in Zayeltsovskiy  Rayon was able to pass up two former city soviet deputies at  once: She won more votes than both of the aforementioned  deputies together. Aleksandr Mankov also won over two former  deputies, but in Kalininskiy Rayon. And in general the voters  preferred to see in the city Assembly people who are removed  from the political battles: Many of them work in production.  <H5>  3. GEOGRAPHY </H5>   Political geography is an extremely curious thing. Take, for  example, Dzerzhinskiy Rayon: In three districts communists  solidly gathered 22-32 percent, holding second places. In  Zheleznodorozhnyy Rayon the one with the largest number of votes  was the representative from the Yavlinskiy bloc, Gennadiy Popov,  and in Zayeltsovskiy preference was given to independent  candidates. Quite diverse people won in Kalininskiy while the  administration chief, Vladimir Afanasyev, won easily in  Kirovskiy, garnering more than 40 percent of the votes. In  Sovetskiy, on the contrary, administrators met with complete  defeat and the chief of the administration and his deputy lost.  Oktyabrskiy Rayon made an interesting decision; here the  general director of the Novosibirsk directorate of  Mosbiznesbank, Anatoliy Zvyagin, became a deputy, and in another  district the leader was Vasiliy Vereteno, who was nominated by  the Siberian branch of the International Association of  Enterprise Leaders.  <H5>  4. SYMPATHIES </H5>   An interesting picture emerges here too. True, it is  necessary to do one thing: We will count those who gathered the  most votes in their district but still did not become deputies  because of a confluence of circumstances (voter apathy, poor  positioning of the stars, etc.) but simply the winners. This  simplifies things considerably: Ultimately the discussion can be  only about  sympathies.    Well, let us publish, as they say, the whole list. The  anti-Yeltsin opposition had a serious stake in the elections to  the city Assembly. Although, true, they still could not reach  agreement among themselves. As a result the communists would  put up one person, Working Novosibirsk--two, and Homeland--one.  The oblast organization of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation ran seven candidates--one took first, three took  second, and three failed. Working Novosibirsk received two  firsts, two seconds, and again three failed. Homeland's  indicators are not as good: one first, one second, and five  "zilch." Representatives of the National Salvation Front and  the Novosibirsk people's assembly lost solidly.... The Liberal  Democratic Party, which intended to install three of its members  as deputies, suffered a painful defeat--all of its candidates  did badly, and the leader, Kirill Volobuyev, in his own  electoral district received half as many votes as his only  opponent.    Now let us look at the other side. Democrats received five  first places: two for Club of Deputies and Voters, and one each  for Russia's Choice, Yavlintsy, and Forum. Only the candidate  from Democratic Russia won no laurels. Russia's Choice gained a  first and a second place. The ones that looked weakest were the  candidates from the Forum voter club: one first place and two  failures. Note that the SOTSPROF trade union failed: a second  place and two "zilch" and the same fate befell the only  candidate from Unity. And for the Club of Deputies and Voters  the indicators are these: two first places and an equal number  of failures.    As for the administrators, here not everything is so simple.  The mayor won quite confidently, the head of the administration  was also on top, but the head of the administration of Sovetskiy  Rayon lost by a mile to his only opponent. As for their  deputies, one out of the four took second place.    In general there are stable sympathies for the center and  the  people who were able to convince the voters that they were the  "movers and shakers." If all the deputies had been elected, the  two administrators would have been joined by 12 independent  (from whom?) deputies, six representatives of democratic blocs,  and four from the opposition.    Now a little about the details. In face-to-face  confrontations between supporters of the current reforms and  representatives of the opposition the former won six times and  the later won four times. Seven times the opposition kept itself  from winning. The Communist Party, Working Novosibirsk, and  Homeland frequently battled against one another, apparently  remaining true to the old ideological principle: "And who the  hell are you?" Another interesting detail: Young leaders of the  LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and RCWP [Russian  Communist Workers Party] (nonetheless already the top people in  their parties) ran in two districts--the chairman of the  Novosibirsk branch of the former, Kirill Bolobuyev, and the  secretary of the oblast committee of the latter, Sergey  Krupenko. Both suffered serious defeats and both lost to women:  a teacher and a physician. Women, incidentally, came in first  in seven out of 25 cases.  <H5>  5. CONTINUATION FOLLOWS </H5>   There will apparently be nothing to report on the  Novosibirsk  Assembly itself in the near future, but we will definitely try  to tell you about the deputies and their work.</p>

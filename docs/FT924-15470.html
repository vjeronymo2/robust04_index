			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Setback as interest rate hopes fade THE LONDON stock market yesterday paid dearly for the interest rate optimism which had sustained it earlier in the week. Gains in share prices were sharply reversed as sterling crumbled after hopes of rate cuts in Germany and in the US were dashed. The two-week equity trading account ended on a sour note with the FT-SE Index showing a fall of more than 22 points on the day. The deepening setback in the pound now casts serious questions over whether another early cut in UK base rates is possible, according to Mr Ian Harnett, strategist at Strauss Turnbull. The stock market had been hoping for a further one point reduction in base rates, perhaps ahead of next week's annual conference of the Conservative party, when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, must defend his stated intention to pass the Maastricht legislation during this parliamentary session. Political worries depressed equities at first but share prices rose quickly behind a firm opening in stock index futures. The Footsie was quickly ahead by 12.7 points before it began to fade as it awaited confirmation that the Bundesbank was leaving interest rates unchanged. But the slide in equities gathered pace significantly after better employment data than expected in the US appeared to eliminate the chances of a further easing in Federal Reserve credit policy at present. With sterling nearly eight pfennigs down against the DM and the Dow Industrial Average 31 off at the London close, the Footsie did well to rally for a final reading of 2,549.7, a net loss on the day of 22.6. Seaq volume fell to 599.8m shares from Thursday's 823m, which was worth Pounds 1.4bn in retail business, maintaining the improved customer business levels seen since sterling left the ERM network. The stock market has fallen by around 2 per cent this week as sterling's weakness and calls for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, have unsettled expectations that UK base rates could be cut to 8 per cent by Christmas. However, over the two-week account, the fall in the Footsie has been only about 0.7 per cent. Government bonds gave back early gains and closed lower as sterling fell. Losses among the long dates were no more than  1/16 with the shorts showing similar losses. Index-linked also gave back gains. After receding from the levels which followed sterling's withdrawal from the ERM, retail volume has begun to rise again.</p>

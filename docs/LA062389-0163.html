			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW SURGES 49.7 ON GOVERNMENT REPORT;  </P> <P> EVIDENCE OF SLOWER ECONOMY TRIGGERS TRADERS' OPTIMISM  </P> <P> The stock market rallied sharply to new post-crash highs today in buying  encouraged by fresh evidence of a slowing economy.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 49.70 to 2,531.87, surpassing  the previous closing high since the 1987 crash: 2,517.83 on June 2.  </P> <P> The gain, the largest for the average in six weeks, left it with a net increase  of 45.49 points for the week.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock  Exchange, with 1,065 up, 430 down and 474 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 198.72 million shares, against 176.51 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index added 2.81 to 182.86.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department report this morning that new factory orders for durable  goods fell 4.2% in May was a pleasant surprise on Wall Street, where traders  had been expecting the figures to be unchanged or slightly higher.  </P> <P> Analysts saw the decline as a sign that the economy might be slowing more  dramatically than previously forecast.  </P> <P> That stirred some stepped-up talk of a possible business slump. Brokers said,  however, that it also raised expectations of falling interest rates and reduced  inflation.  </P> <P> In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds soared about $15  for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yield to the 8.18%-8.23% range.  Since early spring those bond interest rates have fallen more than a percentage  point.  </P> <P> Optimists in the financial world argue that as evidence of a weakening economy  mounts, the Federal Reserve will relax its credit policy to cushion the effect.  </P> <P> "The economic data once again reinforced the perception that this economy is  going to grow a lot slower before it grows faster," said Ward McCarthy,  economist with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues were up between 3/16 point and 1/4 point, intermediate maturities gained  between 1/4 point and 7/16 point and 20-year issues advanced 1/2 point by  midday, according to the Telerate Inc. financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer,  was up 3.98 to 1,171.02.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrials also advanced. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80  corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.39 to 322.80.  </P></p>

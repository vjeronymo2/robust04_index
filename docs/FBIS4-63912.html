			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vsevolod Orlov report: "The Economy Should Be Economical. </F> Taxpayer! Here Is a Package for You. It Is Hard To Resist  Reporting on the Package of Edicts Recently Signed by the  Russian President"]    [Text] They presuppose the following:    1. The abolition of quotas and licenses for export shipments  by all enterprises, as well as concessions on export duties in  addition to those laid down by Russian legislation (naturally  this does not apply to interstate agreements concluded  previously).    2. The government's submission to the Federal Assembly of  draft laws reducing the number of taxes, lowering the rates of  basic taxes -- profits and value-added tax -- by 10-20 percent,  and prescribing preferential taxation for enterprises involving  foreign capital employed exclusively in the production sphere.  What is more, there are to be changes in the taxation of  individuals.    3. The creation of "state-funded" enterprises, in other  words enterprises whose leaders have limited rights but bear  full personal responsibility for the activity of the enterprises  in their charge. In this connection there will no longer be  federal enterprises in full state ownership, while those already  created will either be eliminated or turned into "state-funded  houses." Production units which are ineffectually managed and  not liable to privatization will provide an additional base for  the creation of "state-funded enterprises."    4. The establishment of chronological reporting  [kalendarnaya otchetnost] on payments from enterprises' current  payment accounts and the creation of a federal bills of exchange  chamber.    5. The introduction of strict responsibility for tax  evaders: The first violation incurs a heavy fine, the second  results in the elimination of the enterprise.    The adopted edicts may quite easily be regarded as a step  toward administrative control of the economy. But has anyone  said that Russia does not need those kind of steps? Triumphant  privatization reports do of course provide inspiration for fresh  achievements. However, state enterprises also produce output  and, incidentally, workers at these enterprises have the worst  social protection of all, creating a heightened danger of  strikes in the state sector. State-funded enterprises may elicit  bad associations with Stalinist methods of managing industry.  But there must nevertheless be a clear distinction between  concerns and corporations that have, as a result of  privatization, legalized the position of monopolized feudal  estates and state enterprises. The latter should come under  tight state control. That is the reality of a mixed economy.    The president's edicts on the whole give rise to the sense  of  attempting to cut the Gordian knot of Russian economic  management with albeit several blows. Whether good, bad, or  mediocre, clear and comprehensible rules of play have to be  established some day. The tax situation is abnormal -- so here  is legislation which precludes supplementary interpretation and  here are punitive measures to be applied against those who do  not give a damn about it. I must particularly point out that  tough measures are being taken against taxpayers at the same  time as guarantees of an improvement in the tax climate  (although it is of course better for there to be an improvement  first and then tough measures). There is a problem involved in  granting export concessions, quotas, and licenses with unclear  regulations that permit heaps of violations -- all three should  be abolished (I think that certain countries that live off  reexporting Russian resources are becoming somewhat jumpy).  There is an interesting aspect to the problem of payment  defaults: A debtor's ruble account is empty but his  hard-currency account is full. There may be a solution: In  that situation the hard currency should be immediately converted  and the debts paid....    I would very much like to write the words "and so on," but  that is regrettably where the adopted measures stop.</p>

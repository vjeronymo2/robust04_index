			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Manuel Antonio has just told Radio  Mozambique that there will be no general strike within the  Mozambican Police force. He was reacting to a letter sent to  him by members of the police force. In a letter published by  the weekly SAVANA newspaper, police agents said they would be  going on general strike as of 1 May and presented demands such  as salary increases and promotions.    Interior Minister Manuel Antonio said the letter had been  written by an opportunistic group, including some officers, that  have infiltrated the police force. [passage indistinct]</p>

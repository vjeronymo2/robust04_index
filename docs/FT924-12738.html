			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Little to celebrate at LME's annual shindig - Sagging prices and soaring stocks are casting a shadow over the exchange THOUSANDS OF metals producers, consumers and traders are this week paying their annual homage to the most international market in the world: the London Metal Exchange. But there is a hollow ring to the celebrations. Gloom caused by a recent and sudden collapse in metals prices keeps intruding. At least half of worldwide contracts for the six metals traded on the exchange are related directly to LME prices. And for much of this year prices were doing quite well. By the end of September, the LME-traded metals were showing price gains since the begining of 1992 ranging from 14 per cent for tin to a more modest 5.5 per cent for lead. But evidence that these prices were giving false signals was clear to see: recession persisted in North America and parts of Europe; growth was slowing rapidly in Germany and Japan, which, with the US, provide the biggest markets for metals. LME stock levels were rising as prices were going up, an unnatural phenomenon, as any schoolboy economist will tell you. 'We had prices that simply could not be justified by fundamental conditions,' Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economic adviser at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, points out. 'People who thought those prices were justified were living in a fool's paradise.' He suggests that a new and volatile source of demand for LME metals was at work. Some heavyweight financial institutions had begun to invest in commodities for the first time in ten to 15 years to diversify their portfolios. 'Given the size of the metals markets, only a small shift in fund investment pushes prices up substantially,' Mr Crowson points out. Compared with other financial markets, the LME is relatively small, he says. The total value of all its metal stocks was only about Dollars 2.2bn at the start of 1992 and Dollars 3.4bn in late August. 'The cost of buying up total existing stocks of some individual metals would be relatively low, although only a portion is needed to influence the market.' Investment interest from the funds has helped drive LME turnover - which is much greater than the value of its stocks - to record levels this year. Mr Crowson, who is an LME director, suggests: 'This is fine as long as the institutions pay more than lip service to portfolio asset management - but not if they become mesmerised by patterns of prices on charts'. Some traders admit that, while the funds were making the running, they had to concentrate on trying to guess what they might do next. Traders took their attention away from the real world of falling demand and rising metal supply surpluses. Now the funds seem for the time being to have quit, bringing the market down to earth with a nasty bump. Ms Lesley Campbell, a trader at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, explains: 'There have been occasions in the past year when big players in the LME's copper, aluminium and zinc markets provided price support - more than the fundamentals have justified. Too many blind eyes were turned away from the fundamentals for too long.' Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, a subsidiary of the Westpac banking group, says: 'The commodity funds have been financing the record LME stockpiles. now they are liquidating their positions. 'The market has completed a complete U-turn since August, he says. 'Suddenly the market realised that economic recovery was not happening, it would be longer delayed and more muted than expected. A short, sharp fall in growth was expected in Japan, now it looks as if it will be a protracted fall.' No wonder the OECD says that domestic product growth in its member countries this year is now expected to be a maximum of 1.5 per cent when at the begining of this year it was predicting growth of 2.3 per cent. As the accompanying figures from the UK-based World Bureau of Metal Statistics show, most of the LME metals were building supply surpluses during the first half of this year. However, the copper market was more or less in balance and tin stocks were falling, thanks to the efforts of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, which has been limiting output so as to cut the excessive stocks that have been depressing prices since the 1986 collapse of their price support scheme. The 43,000-tonne reduction in aluminium stocks resulted from capacity reductions during the first half, but that trend has since been reversed as new smelters have come on stream and mothballed units have reopened. Aluminium and nickel have been hit hard not only by slowing industrial activity but also by the upsurge in exports from the former Soviet Union. Mr Lloyd Davies, general manager of the WBMS, points out that commercial nickel stocks have more or less doubled since the end of 1990 and 'this obviously is the result of Russian shipments to the west.' Deliveries of nickel from the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) to the west in the first half of this year might have been as much as 50,000 tonnes, roughly in line with exports in the same months last year. 'Indeed, there might even have been a growth in deliveries,' he says. Recorded deliveries of aluminium from the CIS to the west were running at an annualised rate of 650,000 tonnes compared with 500,000 in 1991, Mr Davies points out. It would take a big fall in exports in the second half to produce a significant drop in CIS aluminium deliveries this year. Analysts say it is now clear that there will be no short-term industrial growth to produce a demand-led recovery in metal prices. So there have been widespread and vociferous calls for production cuts. 'There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Without meaningful production cuts prices will deteriorate further,' says Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at the SG Warburg Securities financial services group. Ord Minnett's Mr Moore suggests: 'The onus is back squarely on the producers. The choice is simple - cut back refined metal production or spend another year in purgatory'. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggests copper is the 'most over-priced' metal at the moment. Supply interruptions, which usually play an important role in the copper market, 'have been conspicuous by their absence. The Chinese, who helped the copper price by buying heavily earlier this year, now might be selling. Stocks have been building since August in a way that suggests this is no ordinary summer slow-down. This is a market moving into surplus'. On the other hand, Mr MacMillan suggests aluminium and nickel have less far to fall than other LME metals because their prices have been so low for so long. Zinc prices, buoyed up by a technical, options-related squeeze for much of this year, have come back with a bump. 'The squeeze has ended and the fundamentals have taken over,' he says. Tin demand is weak but lead might get some support from labour contracts about to be negotiated - 'lead is the metal I'm least bearish about. But, in all, the metal markets do not present a pretty picture.' RTZ's Mr Crowson hopes the various international political uncertainties that are affecting sentiment will gradually be lifted in the coming months but, even so, the outlook is not bright. Although he looks forward to improving world economic activity in 1993, this will be 'largely in the second half. In important areas such as construction, automobile production and many capital goods sectors, however, activity will remain below the peaks of the late 1980s, even as we go into 1994'.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    WESTERN WORLD SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION                            (THOUSAND TONNES)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  1992       1991                    1992       1991                Jan-June   Jan-June                Jan-June   Jan-June  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                           Nickel  Supply        7,639       7,880     Supply          337        372  Consumption   7,682       7,547     Consumption     312        367  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Copper                              Tin  Supply        4,645       4,438     Supply           76         84  Consumption   4,597       4,490     Consumption      91         91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lead                                Zinc  Supply        2,175       2,245     Supply        2,734     2,690  Consumption   2,171       2,205     Consumption   2,709     2,661  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bureau of Metal Statistics.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said  yesterday Thailand should consider sector-by-sector whether to  withdraw or retain rights reserved especially for Americans to  engage in services and professions normally reserved for Thais.    His comment confirms the gathering momentum at the highest  levels of government to review the 1966 Thai-US Amity Treaty  which exempts Americans from a number of activities normally  restricted under the Alien Business Law.    The move would be part of Thailand's preparation to  undertake  commitments under the new General Agreement on Trade in Services  (GATS) due to take effect early next year.    GATS outlaws discrimination between trading partners in  service industries. The European Union, Japan, Australia and  other industrial countries have been urging Thailand to provide  them with the same rights Americans enjoy under the Thai-US  treaty.    Thai officials are only now starting to consider which  services should be opened to other nationals and which should  continue to be reserved for Thais.    Under GATS, the restricted service sectors would also have  to  be closed to Americans, but Washington is lobbying to keep them  open.    Dr Suphachai said the treaty has been in effect for a long  time. Considering current conditions, it may be obsolete.  Therefore, the country should review whether it will continue  to grant privileges to each sector of the service industry.    Paramount to considerations is whether any decision would  affect national security or contravene Thai traditions.    The Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry suggested that the treaty  not be amended; however, Dr Suphachai said more debate among  other government agencies, particularly the Commerce Ministry,  should be entertained.    Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon said earlier that  Thailand should amend the treaty to comply with the GATS rules.    Dr Suphachai said the country had approved the amendment of  the Announcement of the National Executive Council No. 281,  commonly known as the Alien Business Law, which refers to freer  foreign investment in the same line with "national treatment"  (that is, treating others as if they were Thai nationals. He  maintained such rights are already granted to U.S. citizens.    The government is planning to liberalize foreign investment,  particularly in the automobile industry, said Dr Suphachai.    Asked whether a law passed by the parliament should  supersede  a treaty, Dr Suphachai said that normally a treaty should  supersede any law. However, specific laws may present conflicts  which should be carefully reviewed.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Firms could be barred under PIA regime A number of firms in the financial services industry could be prevented from doing business by the proposed new watchdog body intended to improve protection for private investors. The Personal Investment Authority, which yesterday published details of how it intended to work, gave a clear warning that firms approved by present regulators would not be guaranteed acceptance under the new regime. Mr Joe Palmer, the authority's chairman, said: 'Though we'll be relying on data from existing regulators, the standards and decision-making are the PIA's' Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, emphasised that the onus would be on firms to show why they should be admitted to the regulator, rather than on the regulator to admit them. Up to 6,000 individuals and firms, from small independent financial advisers to large banks, building societies and life companies, could be eligible to apply for membership. The authority expects to be in operation by mid-July this year, but still faces resistance from some sections of the financial services industry, including several leading life insurance companies. The PIA's hand in overcoming industry opposition was strengthened yesterday by a statement from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, that it was 'minded to recognise' the PIA as the new watchdog for private investors, and that it intended to end its recognition of present retail regulators. This means that members of Lautro, the self-regulatory organisation for the life insurance industry, and Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, with misgivings about the PIA will not be able to remain under their present regulators indefinitely. Instead, firms will have to choose between being regulated by the PIA or directly by the SIB, which has hinted it might 'sub-contract' this task to the PIA. There was a cautious reaction from the financial industry to the authority's prospectus but it was largely welcomed by existing regulators. Lautro highlighted the improvements in procedures for dealing with complaints against members and the 'risk-based' approach to regulation. The Consumers' Association called the PIA the 'last chance for self-regulation' and urged the new body to 'ratchet up the threshold of minimum competence'. The PIA has faced some criticism for deciding that people working in the financial services industry should make up only 10 of the 21 board members. Mr Palmer insisted the plans still amounted to self-regulation. Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, urged potential PIA members to 'consider the prospectus positively'.

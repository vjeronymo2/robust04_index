			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with National Bank of Tatarstan Chairman Yevgeniy </F> Bogachev by RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN correspondent Ye. Taran; place  and date not given: "Yevgeniy Bogachev: `Emergency Measures Are  Needed'"]    [Text] [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, at the recent  conference held by the president, in the press, and at the  latest session of the republic Supreme Soviet the issue of  nonpayments has been raised many times. It is assumed that this  problem will receive priority attention in the anticrisis  program currently being drafted by the government. It is obvious  that the nonpayments crisis is a Russia-wide phenomenon. Still,  can this problem be resolved at least partially at republic  level? How can the National Bank of Tatarstan help?    [Bogachev] At the National Bank's initiative, the republic  government adopted a decree and prepared on its basis a statute  on mutual clearing between producers, processors of agricultural  products, and trade organizations. You understand that the  nonpayments problem cannot be solved in one strike, overnight;  therefore, on an experimental basis we intend to untangle this  knot first in the sectors that supply the population with  foodstuffs--bread, milk, meat, confectionery items, etc.--and  trade. For these enterprises and organizations we introduced the  so-called file No. 2. We established a payments schedule for  them. First they settle accounts with the budget (pay taxes into  it), then the pension fund, and then with producers and  processors of agricultural products.    [Taran] That is, the file means that if the enterprise  received money into its account in the bank, it is...    [Bogachev] ...transferred to pay taxes to the budget, to the  pension fund, and then--to pay for agricultural products  delivered to them. If there is not much money, not much will be  paid. But it will get paid instead of the money just sitting  there!    How were things before this decree? For instance, a rayon  food trade administration receives money from stores, pays taxes  to the budget, pays into dozens of various funds, pays out  wages, and disposes of the rest of the money at its discretion.  If it wishes, it uses it to buy imported candy or sausage, or,  if it wishes, it will pay the Zarya factory or the meat  combine... Now if a trade administration or food processing  enterprise attempts to violate the procedures set by the decree,  the banks will not allow it to do so. They will withdraw money  from the account and send it where it is supposed to go.  Otherwise we will not be able to get the money to the  countryside--it will constantly be diverted along interim stages  of the chain.    [Taran] If the chain links kolkhozes and sovkhozes with the  trade sector and, in the final analysis, with the republic  population, and is located inside Tatarstan, then you can  probably attempt to untangle the knots using both the command  methods envisaged in the decree and economic levers. What about  enterprises whose suppliers and consumers are in Russia and  other CIS countries? Or how do you settle financial relations  between the AO [joint-stock company] Tatneft and  Nizhnekamskneftekhim?    [Bogachev] Speaking of Nizhnekamskneftekhim, it is actually  owed a lot of money by many CIS enterprises, while inside the  republic it owes money to many suppliers. Some chains, wherever  possible, we cut short by a bill of exchange or so-called barter  applied to debt. For instance, the Nizhegorodskiy oil refinery  pays the AO Tatneft for oil with gasoline; this gasoline goes to  the Tatneftprodukty association, and we count it as payment by  the oil producers' to the budget. By the way, the National Bank  already has set up a commission that will look more closely at  these chains of nonpayments and, if possible, shortcut them,  apply mutual clearing, even extending to Russian enterprises and  CIS countries.    I can even give you an example of how we untangled such a  chain. A Chisinau tractor plant owed money to the  Nizhnekamskneftekhim association for products shipped. We came  to an agreement that Moldova would deliver spare parts for  tractors to Tatselkhoztekhnika, and we would count this as  Nizhnekamsk producer payments into the budget.    Most often, however, credits are needed in order to  accomplish mutual clearing. We will be allocating resources to  the extent possible, especially if insignificant amounts are  needed, in order to complete mutual clearing.    Not everyone agrees to such mutual clearing, however. For  instance, the Novomoskovsk plant, which produces gasoline, owes  a substantial amount of money to Tatneft, but is in no hurry to  pay with fuel, and in this situation offers gasoline at a price  hiked up by 15-20 percent if we want it faster. See what is  happening in the economy! We can demand sanctions, file a claim  with the arbitration court, of course. But how much time this  will take!... Meanwhile, Muscovites advise us: Do not ship the  oil. But you cannot just stop the wells.    [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, I understand that enterprises  must, of course, settle accounts with the budget and  agricultural producers. But there also is another line item on  which calm and stability in the republic depend. I mean paying  wages--and paying them on time. At many enterprises people have  not been paid for three to four months. I do not know whether  there is any truth to the rumor that 50 percent of the money  received will be reserved specifically for paying wages.    [Bogachev] I cannot either confirm or deny this information.  At the recent meeting held by the president I submitted a  proposal for the anticrisis program: to let enterprises keep at  minimum 5 percent of the money received for their immediate  needs.    [Taran] Is this an emergency reserve?    [Bogachev] Yes, and no one--not the budget, not the funds,  not the banks--can touch this money. It happens sometimes that  an enterprise cannot send people on vacation, provide financial  assistance, and so on.    This proposal was supported, and in one document there is  even the figure of 30 percent. But if this passes, it will hit  the budget hard.    [Taran] But you have to pay people, too. They have to live  on  something...    [Bogachev] Yes, there are enterprises in the republic where  wages have not yet been paid for February, and in some kolkhozes  and sovkhozes--for January. But overall as of 1 May the back pay  owed amounted to 160 billion rubles [R]. This is one month's  worth of back pay. In certain sectors, however--agriculture, the  defense industry, light industry, the budget sphere--the arrears  are substantial. Measures are being taken, however, to pay off  these arrears at least through April. It looks as if we will be  issuing credits in order to get out of this situation.    [Taran] Yevgeniy Borisovich, will we find credit resources?    [Bogachev] I will give you these figures. As of 1 January  our  credit resources amounted to R600 billion; as of 1 May--already  R900 billion. I know the interest rate is very high, and it is  hard for enterprises to carry the debt, but what can we do? Just  recently our bank charged 210 percent interest, then 205  percent, then 200 percent. At the latest auction we acquired  centralized resources at 190 percent. Of course, commercial  banks charge a higher interest rate.    We have to keep in mind, however, that we issue credit to  agriculture on average at 20 percent, and to some farms--at 10  percent. For instance, the bread products association received  most of its credit at 10 percent. But even this money is  difficult to get back. The enterprise ships flour and cereal,  but the money does not come back, it gets stuck somewhere.  Consumers do not pay.    [Taran] How do you explain the lowering of the Central  Bank's  interest rate?    [Bogachev] I want to remind you of the statements of Central  Bank of Russia Chairman Gerashchenko that by the end of this  year the interest rate will be 100 percent. But in my opinion  even this is too much. If interest rates were no higher than  20-30 percent, prices would go down, too.    The lowering of interest rates is a result of the decline in  the inflation rate. In my opinion, there is no particular reason  to rejoice. We have achieved it at the cost of reducing consumer  demand--people do not have any money, they are not paid wages.  This is the way to entirely ruin industry, which will stop  producing any output.    [Taran] We were talking mostly about noncash clearing. But  there also are quite a few problems with cash, are there not?    [Bogachev] The National Bank has now put into circulation  about R600 billion in cash. Republic banks have only R21  billion. Where is the rest of the money? I do not think it is in  the hands of the population, because people are not being paid  wages. It is possible that it is circulating hand-to-hand,  bypassing the budget and other taxes. This is my first guess.  The second is that the money is at enterprises. I do not know of  a single instance of any manager being penalized for using cash  in lieu of noncash transactions. When the money goes through the  bank, taxes are withheld, along with other deductions. Quite  often, however, enterprises get cash through their own trade  network and immediately use it to purchase goods, pay wages, etc.    I am against repressive measures. The National Bank of  Tatarstan is proposing other ways. We need to make it possible  to buy in the market shares of profitable, prestigious  enterprises and banks, without restrictions, for money. Right  now, however, many banks are privately-held joint-stock  companies. But if enterprises have the money (the R600 billion  is sitting around somewhere unused, after all!), why not buy  shares if good dividends are paid on them? We need to speed up  the creation of a securities market. Then this money will  surface.    The situation today is such that we simply do not have time  to spend months developing programs and laws, and then more  months adopting and amending them. We need to give our president  the powers to resolve some matters through decrees. We need  urgent measures to save our economy, first and foremost  industry. This is where the budget revenue is formed. To a  certain degree I am beginning to support those politicians and  economists who maintain that the road to the market should go  through dictatorship. Chaos is not going to get us anywhere.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Lunch with the FT: A writer whose talent bloomed - Michael Thompson-Noel meets Lisa St Aubin de Teran She is small and exotic. Occasionally, her eyes survey a detail - the light on the river, a waiter's passing smile - with an artist's calculation. You wonder what she is seeing. Is she absorbing data, or just enjoying lunch? This is Lisa St Aubin de Teran, whose novels and short stories have been translated into a dozen languages, although her poetry has been translated only into Italian and Norwegian. I ponder that awhile, wondering what a master of literary impressionism like her - sensitive, evocative, beautifully controlled - sounds like in Norwegian. The task is beyond me, so I produce my cigarettes. She studies me approvingly, and takes out her own pack. 'I am so relieved you smoke,' she says. 'I was sort of wondering. In Italy' - where she lives - 'there is no problem with smoking, but in other parts of the world this whole anti-smoking thing is almost beyond control. I find it so counter-productive, all this hectoring.' A waiter, watching her keenly, replaces her ashtray even before she lights up. 'Why this restaurant?' I ask. (For Lunch with the FT, guests can choose any restaurant they wish.) We are in Cantina del Ponte at Butlers Wharf, on the bank of the Thames immediately to the east of London Bridge. As part of Sir Terence Conran's South Bank gastrodome, it occupies what many would rate the finest restaurant site in London. The food is good: more Pacific rim, claims The Good Food Guide, than ethnic Italian, as though anyone minds. Lisa St Aubin de Teran had started with a glass of champagne, then switched to orange juice, and was eating voraciously - salmon, steak, pudding. 'I just like it,' she said, answering my question. 'I know this restaurant, though I have only been here at night. I like the view. It's a little like being in Sydney. I like the river and I like the City, but then I am extremely fond of London. My favourite city for being in is probably Rome. For eating in: Paris.' She was born in Kensington, London, in 1953 and moved, shortly afterwards, to Wimbledon. She was first married at 16. For seven years, she managed a sugar plantation in the Venezuelan Andes. She is very widely travelled, especially on trains, and has lived here, there and everywhere. She started writing poetry when she was 12, short stories six years later. Her first novel, Keepers of the House, won the 1983 Somerset Maugham Award and her second novel, The Slow Train to Milan, the 1984 John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize. Now, she lives in a valley in Umbria. In her latest book, A Valley in Italy, she describes her struggle, since 1988, to rehabilitate the Villa Orsola in which she and her family live: a Herculean task. The villa was a ruin: no electricity, no water, no windows, no doors and a serious gap in the roof. 'You must be tough,' I said to her. 'Extremely tough. What possessed you to take the villa on? How could you write anything with all that noise and mess?' 'I suppose I am tough,' she replied. 'Buying the villa was partly an act of real foolishness. I didn't see how derelict it was. People said it would cost millions to restore. I could see that it wouldn't cost millions, but I didn't realise how much it would cost - money I didn't have, the energy of organising people. The effort that went into its restoration was probably sufficient to run a small country, and it is by no means finished. Two sides of the villa are all right, the third unfinished and the fourth - the back - still spectacularly derelict. 'Fortunately, I click on and off as a writer. I spend a lot of time working things out in my head, so that the time spent actually writing is hardly more than auto-dictation. This gives me lots of spare time, for music and opera, say. I love the way opera is much more part of everyday life in Italy than elsewhere. A performance of Don Giovanni in Italy is a bit like a football match. If they don't like the soprano, they crank up their football rattles. 'In view of the money and energy that the palazzo consumed, I've felt a lot less self-indulgent since starting my lily project.' This lily project could make her famous in her part of Italy, if she isn't already. (She speaks Italian fluently, and now understands Umbrian dialect.) In her part of Umbria, poverty used to be endemic; it still casts a shadow. Until 1945, the local men had to emigrate or work a six-day week as labourers, charcoal burners or wood-cutters in the endless forests. The land, says Lisa, excelled in no single crop, producing only inferior versions of what neighbouring Tuscany grew. Then tobacco caught on, providing, from 1953 onwards, a boom which by 1980 had provided every family in her village, San Orsola, with its own house, a piece of land and at least one car. 'In the high days, tobacco yielded a profit of Pounds 25,000 per hectare, far more than maize, for example - Pounds 400 per hectare if the villagers were lucky.' But tobacco-growing, which is pollutive, entails crippling drudgery, and the EU subsidies were being slashed. A new crop was needed. To her intense surprise, Lisa discovered that lilies grew easily in her Umbrian garden. Perhaps they were the answer. She imported 500 bulbs from the Netherlands which also, generously, offered technical assistance and advice. The bulbs did as well as on a Dutch lily farm. Three years ago, she imported another 8,000 bulbs, raising her stock to about 24,000. 'But I went to Brazil, to make a TV film of a rail journey. On my return, I found that a herd of pigs had broken in and caused dreadful damage, though I have probably still got 6,000 lilies flowering this summer.' 'Wild pigs?' 'The offspring of domestic sows and wild boars - the very worst. They are a terror because they can get into anything. Real kamikazes - they will thrust their young on to electrified fences, then storm in behind them.' Despite that set-back, and the tangle of red tape that surrounds any endeavour in Italy, Lisa is hopeful that lilies will bloom commercially in her valley. 'People originally thought my scheme truly ridiculous. Now they are keen.' Some farmers are ready to try growing them, with her support, and the rewards could be significant. Rome and its flower markets are two hours away, Florence and Siena closer. 'You only need a small amount of land to grow lilies. No family would be able to farm more than  1/2 -1 hectare of lilies and tulips, which also do extremely well. The villagers could make more from my flowers than from tobacco.'</p>

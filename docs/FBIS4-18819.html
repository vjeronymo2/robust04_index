			<p>BFN     [Text] The first planes have taken off this morning. The  operation to evacuate 1,500 Belgian nationals from Rwanda was  authorized by the government. The first Hercules C-130s took  off this morning. For now, they mostly seem to be carrying  equipment. We're joined from Melsbroek by Thierry Belfroi. Have  more planes been taking off?    [Melroi] Yes, four planes have taken off since 0715. Convoys  have been arriving at the military airport here in Meulebroek  throughout the night -- military equipment and jeeps. There  have not yet been any troops. The latest news we have received  from the Tielen barracks from where the paracommandos are  expected to arrive at about 0930 this morning is that their  departure from the barracks has been delayed by at least one or  two hours. Journalists are being kept away from the barracks,  and it is very difficult to get any information. There are  stilll four C-130s on the apron ready to take off with  equipment, and two Boeing 727s, which are waiting to take off  with the troops which are expected. We're also expecting troops  from Flawinne in the course of the afternoon.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] In 1993, our province's economic construction  and various social undertakings gained further development.  Looking back and ahead, how, facing the new circumstances and  new tasks, shall we accomplish the province's economic targets  for 1994 in a better way? With this question in mind, our staff  reporter Guan Qizhi interviewed acting Governor Zhang Wule on  New Year's eve.    Acting Governor Zhang Wule gave a systematic explanation of  the economic approach and measures mapped out for 1994 in this  province. Today, we bring you the first of the three parts of  the recorded interview.    [Begin recording] [Guan] Governor Zhang, the year 1993 has  now passed. What is your comment on our province's economic  work in the past year?    [Zhang Wule] In 1993, the economic operation in our province  has been basically normal. It has maintained a steady and  healthy development momentum. If measured by the major economic  growth indexes, the provincial GNP was 39.42 billion yuan, the  growth rate being 10 percent; the second major index, the  provincial income, was 28.44 billion yuan, the growth rate being  10.5 percent; and the prescribed target for total industrial and  agricultural output value was fulfilled. In particular, our  economic efficiency has been improved to some extent this past  year: The production-marketing rate of industry reached 94  percent; the speed of funds circulation also accelerated; and  the growth of sales income and deliverable profits and taxes  obtained was faster than that of output value. In agriculture,  the whole province attached great importance to grain output,  which registered 14.8 billion jin this year. The past year has  also witnessed the fastest growth of township and town  enterprises in recent years, as their total output value reached  16.8 billion yuan, the growth rate being over 50 percent. The  net income of peasants was 550 yuan per capita. The actual  financial revenue of the province, after all the above-mentioned  data are factored in, is estimated at 4.58 billion yuan, the  original target being 4.32 billion yuan. This represents a 14.6  percent increase over last year. Using these major indexes, one  should say that our economy has maintained a sustained and  healthy development momentum.    But, in my opinion, we should recognize that there are  problems in our economic development. Where are the major  problems? I think I can sum them up with one point, that is,  comparing our province's current level of economic development  with the macroenvironment of the whole country, we can see that  our main problem is the slowness in economic development, which  calls for efforts to change through deepening the reform by  various means.    [Guan] Governor Zhang, the year 1994 will be the first year  for our province to achieve our next five-year objectives. It  will also be a year when the largest number of reform measures  will be promulgated. One can call it a year for solving key  problems in the reform. Faced with this situation, what  measures will our province adopt to boost its economy?    [Zhang] You are quite right to call next year a year for  solving key problems in the reform. On a nationwide scale, the  depth and breadth of the reform policies and measures to be  promulgated next year will be unprecedented since 15 years ago  when the reform and opening up began. Therefore, I feel we  should pay attention to the following points when carrying out  economic work in the coming year. First, we should  conscientiously analyze the situation facing our province in  terms of economic development. Second, we should find out the  impact of the reform measures to be promulgated by the state on  our province and work out matching policies and measures that we  should adopt. Third, in light of such overall circumstances, we  should establish and improve the basic strategies of our  economic development. [passage omitted]</p>

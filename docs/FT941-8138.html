			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software in US link-up - Venture gives distribution access to 45,000 prospective customers Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based accounting software company which joined the main market last year, has secured distribution in North America for its principal product through an innovative revenue sharing venture. The deal has been signed with Global Software, a US accounting software house based in Raleigh, North Carolina. The venture gives QSP access to 45,000 prospective customers - the UK market for large scale accounting software is only about 3,000 customers. At no cost it gives QSP a 5 per cent equity stake in Global with the option to purchase a further 5 per cent at a later date. QSP and Global will share both software licence fee and maintenance revenues from QSP's new client-server accounting software, Universal Olas. Analysts were enthusiastic about the deal, arguing that it provided QSP with a low cost and low risk method of entry to the US market. Sales in the North American market are critical for any software company with global ambitions but UK companies have a poor record of success in the US. QSP's share price was unchanged yesterday at 407p. Mr Alan Mordain, QSP chairman, said the company had been seeking a suitable US partner for two years and had been encouraged by the similarity of approach between the two companies. The Global management, which recently bought the company from Hathaway Corporation, had powerful incentives to make the relationship work, he said. QSP has been successful in the UK with a mainframe accounting package, but is pinning its future hopes on Universal Olas, developed for client-server systems at a cost of some Pounds 12m. Client-server systems are increasingly taking over from mainframe computers in large companies and could represent half of all installed systems by 1998. Global, with revenues of Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) in 1993 and over 1,000 customers in the US, including Federal Express and the American Hospital Association, is a competitor to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software and Computer Associates of the US, and SAP of Germany in mainframe software, but has no client-server software. Mr Thomas Roberg, Global's vice president, said that without the QSP deal the company would have had to develop its own client-server product. QSP now has 10 customers for Universal Olas and has completed all the principal modules.</p>

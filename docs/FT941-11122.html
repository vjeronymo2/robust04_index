			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Motoring: In the third estate Vauxhall's Astra and Ford's Escort have had it all theirown way in Britain's lower-medium estate car market. Last year, the Astra took 53.2 per cent of sales and the Escort 37.5 per cent. The only other estate to score more than 1,000 sales was - would you believe? - the Lada Riva. Things are about to change, though. Citroen's ZX estate will go on sale in the UK onMarch 1, while the Volkswagen Golf and Rover 400 estates are not far behind. There will be three ZX estates. Two are Avantage models with a 1.4-litre, 75-horsepower petrol engine or a 1.9-litre, 71hp diesel. The other is an Aura model witha 92hp, 1.9-litre turbo-diesel. All have identical five-door bodies 8in (20 cm) longer than the ZX hatchbacks, which have themselves become Britain's best-selling Citroens, with more than 75,000 registrations since their launch 30 months ago. Built-in roof-rack side rails, remote-control central locking and power-operated slide/tilt sun roof and front windows are standard. Keen prices are expected to range from less than Pounds 11,000 for the petrol Avantage to under Pounds 12,750 for the turbo-diesel with power steering. Uniquely, the 1.9-litre diesel (but not the turbo-diesel) will be available with automatic transmission instead ofmanual gears at no extra cost. The petrol-engined Avantage and turbo-diesel Aura estates I sampled rode a shade more firmly than their hatchback counterparts because the rear suspension has been up-rated to cope with payloads of more than 1,100lb. (500 kg). But they were just as comfortable, and a small amount of passive rear-wheel steering made them feel as nimble as ever when cornering or lane-changing. It is easy to hump things aboard a ZX estate because thetailgate opens to below bumper-top level and the wheel arches intrude very little into the flat-floored load space. A Citroen accessory dog guard does not get in the way of the load space cover and can be folded down when not needed. Last year, nearly half the British buyers of lower-medium estates chose diesel, which was twice the total for hatchbacks and saloons of similar size and price. Introduction of the ZX estates must lift the figure far higher because, good though the petrol version is, the diesels are the ones to go for. The 111 mph (178 kph) Aura turbo-diesel is the fastest, has the best acceleration and, at a constant 56 mph (90 kph), is the most frugal (64.2 mpg/4.4 1itres per 100 km); you can have your cake and eat it.</p>

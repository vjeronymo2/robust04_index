			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Argentine forces quell riot city Argentine government security forces yesterday retook control of the north-western city of Santiago del Estero, where rioters on Thursday burned down public buildings, ransacked the homes of local politicians and looted shops, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. In the worst rioting Argentina has seen since hyperinflation gripped the country in 1989, about 5,000 public employees took to the streets in protest at unpaid wages and plans to eliminate government jobs. Officials said six people were killed, 120 treated in hospital and 170 arrested. President Carlos Menem returned yesterday to Buenos Aires, cutting short a visit to the Vatican. Congress voted to dissolve the provincial government and authorised the federal government to appoint an administrator to run the province for five months. The government sent the province Dollars 60m to pay wages. Like nearly all Argentina's 23 provinces, Santiago del Estero's public sector is the largest employer and relies heavily on federal transfers for its spending. NEWS IN BRIEF</p>

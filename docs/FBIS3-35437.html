			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Tehran, 2 Dey [23 Dec] (KEYHAN-E HAVA'I News  Service) -- Following the resignation of Seyyed Mohammad  Asghari, supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute, His Holiness  Ayatollah Khamene'i, leader of the revolution, issued an order  appointing Hoseyn Shari'atmadari as his representative and  supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute.    The text of the order appointing the new supervisor of the  KEYHAN Institute is as follows:    In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate    Mr. Hoseyn Shari'atmadari, may your successes continue:    In view of the resignation of Seyyed Mohammad Asghari and  with appreciation for his continuous and concerned effort as a  worthy cultural leader, I appoint you, an esteemed public figure  with high merit and an unusual record of revolutionary and  cultural service from an exalted family of martyrs, as my  representative and supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute.    KEYHAN is a great institution and has vast capacities. It is  necessary to make the best use of this asset for the growth and  advancement of the thought, culture, and awareness of the dear  nation of Iran.    The press in Islamic and revolutionary Iran has a great  responsibility on its shoulders to guide thought, explain the  truth, and defend against the assaults of foreigners.  Indifference towards the intellectual needs of the nation of  Iran and indifference to their Islamic and revolutionary  aspirations, which is evident in some of the nation's current  press, is an evil that will not be forgiven in the judgment of  our people now or in the future, and ultimately before the court  of God in the hereafter. Rebellion and opposition to these  aspirations unfortunately also exists in a number of  publications, which abuse the freedoms to which the Islamic  Republic of Iran adheres, and this will not be forgotten.    KEYHAN is a publication that, praise God, has advanced on  the  path of growth and interests and has not been contaminated. Even  so, this institution is expected to make its positive role as  prominent and profound as possible, and to advance all its  affiliated publications to the highest level possible.    In this great mission, you must ask for guidance, success  and  help from God and you must make use of the aid of worthy  colleagues, consultants, and committed and skilled executive  officers. You must earn the confidence of the people by doing  good work, speaking the truth, exercising literary courage,  employing the powerful Persian language in conveying  information, and doing all these things while maintaining the  direction of the Islam of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the  principles of the Islamic revolution. You must make the results  of your efforts available to as many minds as possible in this  talented, outstanding and great nation.    May God help you and your respected colleagues and may you  receive the special grace of His Holiness, may Almighty God  preserve him.    1 Dey 1372 [22 December 1993], equivalent to 8 Rajab 1314    Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i  <H5>  Biography of Hoseyn Shari'atmadari </H5>   Hoseyn Shari'atmadari was born in 1326 [21 March 1947-20  March 1948] in Damavand and graduated in microbiology from the  Tehran University Medical College.    While a student he worked to spread Islamic culture and to  promote the views and theories of His Holiness the Imam (peace  be upon him) along with great martyrs such as Ayatollah Sa'idi,  Professor Motahari, Dr. Bahonar and other dear ones. He was very  active in the Islamic struggles against the oppressive monarchy.  For this reason, he was arrested by the SAVAK in the year 1354  [21 March 1975-20 March 1976] and was severely tortured in the  oppressive monarchy's prisons.    With the triumph of the Islamic revolution, he was released  from prison along with other political prisoners by the Muslim  people of our country.    After the triumph of the Islamic revolution, Shari'atmadari  joined Islamic groups in establishing the Islamic government.    During the sacred defense he was active at the fronts and  was  even severely wounded once.    The new supervisor of the KEYHAN Institute has various  writings. In recent years he has cooperated closely with the  nation's press and cultural centers such as the newspaper KEYHAN  and the weekly publication KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, by writing numerous  political and cultural articles.</p>

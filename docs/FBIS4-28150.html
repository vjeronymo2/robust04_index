			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The fifth congress of  the Korean Children's Union [KCU] opened with a large attendance  at the 6,000-seat theatre of the February 8 House of Culture  here today on the occasion of the 48th anniversary of the  formation of KCU by the great leader President Kim Il-song.    The meeting is discussing tasks for firmly preparing the  Children's Union members as true young guards of the Workers'  Party of Korea [WPK].    A portrait of President Kim Il-song is placed on the  platform  of the congress hall.    Participating in the congress as delegates are members of  the  Children's Union who have distinguished themselves in study and  organizational life.    A delegation of the union of Korean children in Japan is  also  present at the congress.    Attending the congress today were Pak Song-chol, Politburo  member of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea  and vice-president, Kye Ung-tae, Politburo member and secretary  of the C.C. [Central Committee], WPK, and other senior party and  government cadres and officials concerned.    At the congress, letters and red neckerchiefs carrying the  loyal determination of the three million KCU members to the  great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il were conveyed to the platform by delegates from all  provinces (municipalities).    A letter of congratulations sent by President Kim Il-song to  the participants in the congress was read out by Kye Ung-tae  there.    Items on the agenda "1. On tasks facing the Korean  Children's Union in firmly preparing the KCU members as true  young guards of the Workers' Party of Korea" and "2. On the  amendment to the rules of the Korean Children's Union" were  endorsed at the congress.    A report on the first agenda item was delivered by Choe  Yong-hae, chairman of the Central Committee of the League of  Socialist Working Youth of Korea.    The reporter said the letter of congratulations sent by the  great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song to the participants in  the congress is a bright torch more brightly illumining the road  ahead of the Children's Union members advancing toward a hopeful  future under the leadership of the party and a great programme  of the chuche-inspired children's movement.    He reviewed the proud path of struggle covered by the Korean  children's movement.    He said:    Generalissimo Kim Il-song who set out on the road of  revolution in his early years formed the Saenal Juvenile Union,  the first communistic children's revolutionary organization in  Korea, thus giving glorious origin to the Korean children's  movement.    The great leader closely rallied a great many children under  the flag of the anti-Japanese children's corps and brought them  up into child revolutionaries during the glorious period of the  anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, and in the post-liberation  days formed the Korean Children's Union and set forth for the  KCU the militant slogan "Let Us Always Study and Prepare  Ourselves for a New Democratic Korea!" In the postwar period, he  changed the slogan into "Let Us Always Prepare Ourselves To Be  the Reserve Force for the Building of Communism!" to meet the  new requirements of socialist construction.    Now, the Korean communist children's movement and the work  of  the KCU are further developing unremittingly under the correct  guidance of respected General Kim Chong-il.    General Kim Chong-il expounded the idea of continuously  carrying on the vigorous movement for learning from the glorious  childhood and youth of the great leader as the keypoint of the  work of the KCU. He has seen to it that all the work of the KCU  is aimed at rearing all its members to be reliable heirs to the  revolutionary cause of chuche, unfailingly loyal to the leader.    It is the greatest achievement in the work of the KCU that  it  has closely united its members in the same thought and purpose  around Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il by  rearing them to be true sons and daughters of the party who have  a good knowledge of their leader and always follow him from  their early years.    Dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said:    "The organizations of the Korean children's union must set  it  as their most important task to rear all its members to be sons  and daughters unfailingly loyal to the leader and unite them  closely around the party."    The KCU organizations have vigorously carried on the  movement  for learning from the glorious childhood and youth of  Generalissimo Kim Il-song and General Kim Chong-il among the  union members and organized in various forms and ways education  in the principles of the chuche idea and the revolutionary  traditions, class education and education in socialist  patriotism and communist morality.    The hearts of the members of the KCU are now filled with  pure  loyalty to trust and follow only Generalissimo Kim Il-song and  General Kim Chong-il like sunflowers.    Strenuous efforts have been made to prepare the members of  the KCU to be future builders of socialism with ample knowledge,  high morality and strong body, with the result that there have  appeared throughout the country more than 1,800 model classes  that won "the July 15 honor prize," more than 2,400 winners of  "the 'our classroom' literary prize," talented little artistes  and promising sportsmen.    Through brisk socio-political activities and do-good-things  movement, the members of the KCU have created over 1,127,000  hectares of "the Children's Union forest in recent years."    Today the KCU has grown to be a powerful organization of  children the 3 million members of which move as one, united  closely around respected General Kim Chong-il, and fulfil the  tasks set forth by the party in time with strong spirit of  organization and discipline.</p>

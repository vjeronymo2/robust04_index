			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANN ARBOR WARMS UP AFTER BIG CHILL  </P> <P> When film director Lawrence Kasdan chose the title "The Big Chill" for his 1983  movie about the reunion of old pals from the 1960s, he must have been thinking  about the frigid winters he spent here, as a student on the University of  Michigan campus.  </P> <P> Fortunately, the Big Chill does not last forever . . . except on the silver  screen.  </P> <P> Once the summer weather arrives, Ann Arbor emerges from its winter doldrums and  blossoms into a warm, wonderful, walkable city with lively outdoor cafes,  pleasant tree-shaded parks and a pseudo-Ivy League atmosphere.  </P> <P> Although it is only 45 miles west of Detroit along I-94, Ann Arbor prides  itself on maintaining a totally separate identity.  </P> <P> The 165-year-old city is an intellectual never-never land, where the pizza  delivery drivers have Ph.D.s and even the residential street corners, notably  Nixon-Bluett, have political overtones.  </P> <P> But politics, along with everything else, took a back seat last week as the  city and campus community celebrated en masse Michigan's first-ever NCAA  basketball championship, an 80-79 overtime victory over Seton Hall Monday night  in Seattle.  </P> <P> True, the action on central campus slows down considerably once the  university's nearly 36,000 students pack up their PCs, LPs and CDs and head for  home.  </P> <P> But year-round residents (called "townies") view the break from the Go Blue!  hoopla of the students (called "gownies") as a welcome change.  </P> <P> For visitors, the pause provides a perfect opportunity to enjoy Ann Arbor at  its very best, the one time in the whole year when it is possible to find a  vacant parking lot.  </P> <P> Anyone who is visiting Ann Arbor for the first time should plan to spend at  least a morning, if not an entire day, strolling around central campus. Maps  are available at the information desk in the Michigan Union at the corner of  State and South University, and at bookstores.  </P> <P> However, it's easy to find your way around if you keep in mind that the core of  central campus is a block-square area called the Diagonal (or Diag, for short),  which is bounded by State, North University, East University and South  University. Everything else more or less revolves around it.  </P> <P> In the halcyon days of student protests, the Diag was often the stage for  Vietnam protests and Black Action Movement rallies. But nowadays during summer  break, students are more likely to be hurling Frisbees than diatribes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Colorful Figures  </P> <P> If you time it right you may even catch Dr. Diag, one of the many colorful  figures on campus, delivering an impromptu soliloquy on some obscure subject  from his stone bench podium.  </P> <P> In keeping with its reputation as the "Harvard of the Midwest," the university  has several interesting museums that are open to visitors.  </P> <P> The Alexander G. Ruthven Exhibit Museums complex is guaranteed to be a hit with  kids, who will enjoy seeing the 15-foot allosaurus (dinosaur) skeleton on the  second floor and the twinkling constellation show in the planetarium.  </P> <P> The Kelsey Museum is best remembered for its display of Egyptian mummies, and  the Museum of Art is notable for its compact but fairly eclectic collection of  paintings and sculpture.  </P> <P> Several landmarks may be of interest to visitors. A bronze plaque on the  Michigan Union denotes the historic moment in 1960 when then-President John F.  Kennedy stood on the front steps and announced the formation of the Peace  Corps.  </P> <P> The intersection of South and East University is also noteworthy. It is known  as McDivitt-White corner, honoring two American astronauts, James A. McDivitt  and Edward White, who were Michigan graduates.  </P> <P> Be sure to walk through the Engine Arch of the old Engineering College building  on the northwest corner of the intersection. In bygone days when the university  enforced a 10 p.m. curfew, it was said to be the goal of every co-ed to kiss  her sweetheart under the Engine Arch at the stroke of midnight . . . without  getting caught sneaking back into her dorm.  </P> <P> If your feet get hot you can always stop for a pizza and beer, served out of a  Kerr jar, at Dominick's, a popular outdoor cafe across the street from the Law  Quadrangle.  </P> <P> The Law Quad, built between 1923 and 1933, lends an Ivy League atmosphere to  the campus, with its Gothic spires and leaded-glass windows. Its shaded inner  courtyard is straight out of "Love Story."  </P> <P> Drake's Sandwich Shop, with its familiar red-and-white-striped awning, is  another throwback to the 1920s. Inside you'll find an old-fashioned soda  fountain that serves Boston coolers, along with rows and rows of glass candy  jars.  </P> <P> Ironically, Ann Arbor's newest and fastest-growing attraction, Domino's Farms,  has no connection with the university.  </P> <P> The $250-million complex, northeast of the city on a 300-acre site off Plymouth  Road, serves as the world headquarters for Domino's Pizza Inc., and as a  showcase for millionaire owner Thomas S. Monaghan's treasured collections.  </P> <P> Monaghan, an avid admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright, has selected Wright's early  Prairie style architecture for his corporate buildings, and has established a  Frank Lloyd Wright Museum to house the world's largest collection of Wright's  works, valued at more than $30 million.  </P> <P> Also in the exhibition building is the Domino's Pizza Classic Car Museum, where  visitors can stroll among 100 of the classiest antique cars assembled under one  roof. The prize in the collection is the Bugatti Royale, which is only one of  six made and was the personal car of Ettore Bugatti. Monaghan shelled out $8.1  million for it -- the highest price ever paid for an automobile.  </P> <P> Throughout the summer Domino's hosts a series of arts and crafts festivals,  kite-flying competitions and other family-oriented events.  </P> <P> Nothing can compare, however, with the Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, which has  been a traditional rite of summer for several decades.  </P> <P> What started in 1960 as a few artists displaying their wares between roped-off  parking meters on South University, has grown into a four-day extravaganza that  literally engulfs the entire city. This year the fair will be held July 19-22.  </P> <P> It is really three art fairs wrapped up in one; the unending expanse of  hand-thrown pots, abstract oil paintings, blown-glass vases and woven wall  hangings extends from central campus all the way downtown to Main Street.  </P> <P> The Ann Arbor Summer Festival, scheduled for June 24 to July 16 this year,  features performances by theater groups, musicians and vocalists.  </P> <P> The best thing about Ann Arbor, however, is that when you get tired of it you  can simply pack up a picnic and head for a nearby lake or river. Gallup Park  offers paddle boat, canoe and bike rentals for an enjoyable afternoon on the  Huron River. The city sponsors a Huron River Day (July 9), with lots of family  activities.  </P> <P> The Arboretum (known as "the Arb"), which grows more than 50 species of plants,  is a favorite place for hiking and communing with nature.  </P> <P> When the sun sets, Ann Arbor once again becomes the center of action. During  the summer months, restaurants such as the Full Moon Cafe, Gratzi and the Real  Seafood Company serve food and spirits at outdoor tables on Main Street, a la  Rome's Via Veneto.  </P> <P> On a sunny day you may even see the legendary Shakey Jake, Ann Arbor's prince  of street people, passing by decked out in his Panama hat, white suit and  two-toned shoes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bygone Era  </P> <P> One of Ann Arbor's most famous restaurants is the Gandy Dancer, which occupies  the city's historic old railroad station. Lanterns, photos of old steam engines  and an antique wrought-iron sign recreate the nostalgia of a bygone era when  trains were king of the road.  </P> <P> If you want something funky in food, stop in at the Fleetwood Diner, which is  housed in an old trailer, or the Del Rio, which has a long oak bar and  stained-window accents.  </P> <P> For a few more lire you can enjoy an Italian dinner at the Bella Ciao, a cozy  trattoria, or a French meal at Escoffier, which has a more formal Parisian air.  </P> <P> After dinner you'll find cool jazz at the Bird of Paradise Jazz Club, down-home  country and bluegrass music at the Ark, classical strains at the Kerrytown  Concert House, vintage movies at the Michigan Theater and live comedy at the  Mainstreet Comedy Showcase.  </P> <P> Watering holes such as the Old Town Bar have also been an integral part of the  city since 1872, when it was duly noted that Ann Arbor had eight hotels, five  druggists, five billiards halls . . . and 49 saloons.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Where to stay:  </P> <P> Ann Arbor Inn, 100 South 4th Ave., Ann Arbor, Mich. 48104, (313) 769-9500.

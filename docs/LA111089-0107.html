			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> In a series of drawings, Bryan Hunt reworks images of cliffs framing the sea  into tall, angular abstractions that resemble his bronze sculpture. Loosely  sketched with graphite and oil stick, zapped with sparse watercolor washes,  these landscape fragments are like passing thoughts shared with a stranger.  </P> <P> Sometimes the precipices that frame each sheet bulge and indent in  complementary ways, as if yielding to pressure from each other across the  divide of space. Variations in the substantiality of the cliffs provide fresh  points for the eye to fix on.  </P> <P> In a group of super-size (60x45-inch) drawings, the cliffs assume Baroque  proportions -- knobbily exaggerated, Dr. Seuss drawing shapes. What comes  through in the end is the sheer fecundity and flexibility Hunt displays while  noodling around within the parameters of a sharply defined theme. (BlumHelman,  916 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, to Nov. 25) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

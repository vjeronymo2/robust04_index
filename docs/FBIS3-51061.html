Such expectations were expressed on the first day of the  year  by President Fidel Castro, who estimated that the sector must  continue to increase crude oil production and that initial  exploration, currently carried out in association with foreign  companies, must begin to show results.    For the first time in 30 years, Cuban oil workers produced  more than a million tons of a oil in a 12-month period.  Specialists describe the oil as dense, viscous, and with high  light hydrocarbon content, which makes it more flammable and  thus harder to control.    The 1.1 million tons of oil expected to have been produced  by  the end of the year would represent savings of $45 million to  the national economy and have helped generate 30 percent of the  electricity used in the country.    In addition, hydrocarbon by-products were used to make  cement  and basic oils, the latter basically used to produce lubricants.    Cuba's record high oil production was the 938,000 tons  reached in 1986. Successive productions were 894,600 (87),  716,800 (88), 718,400 (89), 670,800 (90), 521,800 (91), and  882,100 (92).    According to sources at Cubapetroleo, the drop between 1987  and 1991 was basically due to the depletion of the Boca de  Jaruco deposit, approximately 45 km east of Havana.    This last deposit and the one in Varadero (140 km east of  Havana) were the most important in the archipelago; 20  additional deposits have been discovered there in the last 30  years.    During this period -- according to GRANMA -- 65,000 km of  seismic lines [lineas sismicas] were completed; 1.5 million  meters of deep shafts were perforated; magnetic, radioactive,  and geological surveys [levantamientos] were conducted; and the  use of aerial and satellite photography was regularized to study  the natural oil and gas [gasopetroliferas] possibilities.    Oil prospecting gained strength by the end of last year,  when  11 plots on land and superficial waters in the Cuban insular  platform were offered for international bidding in Canada and  London.    This made possible -- according to TRABAJADORES -- the  securing of a large number of contracts with foreign firms,  including the UK's Premier company (to explore 2,990 square km)  and France's Geopetrol (1,600 km).    Jean Louis Remondin, board member of the French enterprise,  told the local press that he was confident that there were  important reserves of the so-called black gold in Cuba.    The geographic location and the geological and geophysical  characteristics of the territory contradict those who doubt the  existence of more oil in the island, the specialist added.    In addition to the exploration contracts, Geopetrol has  similar agreements to recover and improve the Cuban deposits,  especially those in the Yumuri Valley, Puerto Escondido, and  Martin Mesa, all in the western part of the country.</p>

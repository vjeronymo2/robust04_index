			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Minolta settles with Honeywell for Dollars 127.5m MINOLTA, the Japanese camera manufacturer, yesterday agreed to pay Honeywell, the US controls group, Dollars 127.5m to settle a long-running patents dispute - a move which could have serious repercussions for other Japanese camera companies. The settlement follows a Dollars 96m award to Honeywell last month by a jury in a New Jersey federal court, which ruled that Minolta had infringed a Honeywell patent on camera auto-focusing technology, although not wilfully. Honeywell said at the time that the award would allow it to put pressure on 15 other Japanese camera companies with which it is in dispute over auto-focus technology. Minolta had been widely expected to appeal against the jury's ruling, delaying a final settlement for a year or more. However, it said yesterday it would pay Dollars 127.5m to settle the lawsuit, including Honeywell's claims for interest, and for a fully paid-up world licence to manufacture and sell its products under all the relevant Honeywell patents. Mr Sam Kusumoto, chairman of the group's US subsidiary, said: 'Reaching a decision to settle was not an easy one. However, we believe that eliminating the cost and distraction of prolonged litigation is in the best interests of our 2,900 US employees, as well as tens of thousands of Minolta dealers who have supported us in this dispute.' Japanese camera-makers were surprised at the speed of the agreement, which sets an unwelcome precedent for them and for some electronics companies who fear their video camera equipment could be a target for complaint from Honeywell. Several Japanese makers, including Canon and Asahi Optical, say they have been gathering technical information in expectation of negotiations with the US company, while Nikon, another leading maker, has argued that it had developed its own technology and would not be affected. It is unclear how many of the 15 makers targeted by Honeywell will agree to settle out of court, but the makers have feared that the US company could take action to limit their sales of related equipment. The decision has come at a difficult time for Japanese camera companies, which are expected to report sharply lower earnings for this period.</p>

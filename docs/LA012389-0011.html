			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW MILLENNIUM  </P> <P> Dan Molitor (letter, Jan. 13) is exactly right in saying that the next  millennium begins with 2001 not 2000 but common practice is to include the last  year of the preceding decade, or century or millennium in the nominal '30s,  '80s, 20th Century, Third Millennium. It's like trying to fight against "the  reason is because" or split infinitives or ending sentences with a preposition.  </P> <P> Poor George Bush has seen so many banks go belly up in the Reagan years, he  can't get his hands on an up-to-date calendar. Pearl Harbor, I remember it  well. It was September.  </P> <P> We know Ronald Reagan's political calendar was 19th Century, carry a big stick  and clobber little Grenada or bomb women and children living in tents.  </P> <P> MARK NICHOLS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

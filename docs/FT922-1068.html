			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Warning on Lasmo US share offering GOLDMAN SACHS, the US investment bank handling the flotation of Ultramar Corporation, the North American oil refining business owned by Lasmo of the UK, said last night the price range at which the shares were likely to be sold had been cut to Dollars 15-Dollars 17. However, both Goldman and Ultramar, which confirmed the reduction in price from its Tarrytown, New York State, headquarters, said they still expected the offering to take place 'one day this week'. In its original filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, dated May 1, Ultramar Corporation suggested a maximum offering price of Dollars 21 a share. It said it was planning to sell 33m shares, excluding up to 4.95m shares which might also be sold if over-allotment options granted to underwriters were exercised. At the Dollars 21-a-share offering price, the equity offering would have generated just under Dollars 700m for the British oil and gas company, with a concurrent offering of debt securities raising a further Dollars 400m. At the latest Dollars 15-Dollars 17 price, the sum raised from the share flotation would range between Dollars 495m and Dollars 561m. Goldman Sachs added yesterday that, aside from the reduced sale price range for the shares, all other aspects of the offer remained unchanged. Earlier in the day in London, nervousness about the fate of the International Public Offer sent Lasmo shares tumbling, making the stock the worst performer in the FT-SE 100 index. The price fell 15p to 172p - the lowest level since December 1987 - on heavy trading volume. In the wake of the aborted GPA flotation, dealers were worried that the offering might be pulled altogether, or that the price could be cut. However, dealers seemed to expect the reduced price range would still be around Dollars 17-Dollars 19. Lasmo's disposal of the North American downstream assets, earmarked since it took over Ultramar last year, has been shrouded in uncertainty for some months. Analysts have suggested that Lasmo originally hoped a single buyer for the business would emerge, and only opted for a flotation when a suitable purchaser failed to materialise.

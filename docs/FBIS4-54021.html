			<p>CSO     [Text] City banks plan to increase fiscal year 1994 lending  in overseas areas by about 3 percent over the last fiscal year.  The reason is that in addition to the expected expansion in the  U.S. economy, the demand for capital is expanding in Asia based  on a high-growth economy. Aside from a substantially higher  growth rate for overseas loans compared to domestic loans, it is  anticipated that the balance of overseas loans on a  yen-denominated basis will increase for the first time in three  years.    At Fuji Bank and Sakura Bank, fiscal year 1994 lending in  the  United States will increase about 3 percent over the last fiscal  year, and will increase about 10 percent in Asia. According to  Managing Director Hisao Kobayashi of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,  "Overseas lending will increase beginning in the January-March  quarter." Sumitomo Bank and Asahi Bank also have similar plans  primarily for the Asian region.    Trends of the above nature had become conspicuous after  October 1993. According to a Bank of Japan [BOJ] survey, the  balance of loans issued by overseas branches at the end of  January 1994 stood at 49.0423 trillion yen, an increase of about  1.5 trillion yen in four months. The BOJ has arrived at the  opinion that "overseas lending will most likely increase in the  future with the second half of 1993 representing the turning  point."    One reason city banks' overseas lending is on the rise is  that domestic lending has stopped growing. Some signs of  improvement have been seen in the domestic economy, but it is  expected that demand for capital will remain sluggish and growth  in domestic loans is expected to range about 1-2 percent over  the last fiscal year.    City banks' equity ratios as of the end of March had reached  9 percent, which is above the minimum specified by the Bank for  International Settlements. This improvement has enabled a  substantial increase in yen-denominated overseas assets,  providing a favorable impact on city banks' capabilities to  expand loans in overseas areas.    Growth in Asia is the greatest on a regional basis. There is  a boom in the location of Japanese businesses centered in China  and ASEAN nation are experiencing strong demand for capital to  handle the construction of infrastructure. City banks intend to  maintain a growth rate of around 10 percent for loans in the  region.    Even lending activity in the United States, which had  dropped  steadily since 1990, has stopped falling in response to an  economic recovery. Demand for new loans is expanding in a broad  spectrum of businesses ranging primarily from manufacturing to  small and medium businesses. Fuji Bank reveals it has "expanded  loans to U.S. firms at the rate of 10 to 15 percent above the  levels in the last fiscal year."</p>

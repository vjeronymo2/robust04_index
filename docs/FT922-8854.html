			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Lloyd's to consider changing rules LLOYD'S, the insurance market, is likely to call a referendum at its annual meeting in June about introducing retrospective cover for losses incurred by Names as far back as 1988, Andrew Jack writes. The meeting is also likely consider mutualisation under which all Names would contribute to the liability of those who have made the most severe losses. Lloyd's is pressing for the introduction of corporate, as opposed to individual, membership of the market as recommended in the Rowlands task force on its future. The task force also recommended a limit of 100 per cent losses on premiums to Names as opposed to the traditional unlimited liability. Lloyd's received a legal opinion two months ago that admission of corporate membership would not require a change in legislation governing the market. It is awaiting a second opinion requested by the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI said last night it had received the first opinion sought by Lloyd's. 'The DTI has asked for more information, which it will need before it can take a view on how its regulatory responsibilities to the insurance companies would be affected under the 1982 Insurance Companies Act,' an official said.</p>

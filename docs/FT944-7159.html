			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices at auctions this week were generally firm, and wool was in sufficiently good demand for clearances to the trade to be good. There was no clear rise in the market, however, and without this incentive business is very quiet. The usual pattern is of better business in November, but this month has been quiet throughout Europe. Order books were filled quite far ahead two or three months ago, also unusually timed, so there is no special anxiety about activity at present.</p>

Conference organizers invited  the delegates to commit themselves in a patriotic spirit to  untangle the crisis. Jean Luckenson reports:    [Begin recording, in Creole] We have patiently set out today  to seek a solution to the crisis the country is experiencing. It  is perhaps one of the gravest crises ever experienced in our  national history. We must find a solution, an effective remedy  to this cancer gnawing at our society at the end of this  century, because the times are grave. We need peace in a Haitian  society that is examining its future. Today, our concern is an  urgent solution so that coming generations do not judge us.  These statements were made by Fritz Bissereth, CARENA national  coordinator, in his speech opening the national conference at  about 1100 on 6 February. [passage omitted]    Bissereth went on to say we must set aside our divergences  or  political opinions, regardless of sector, so we can find an  urgent solution within the next 48 hours. After the opening  speech, the audience stood up to observe one minute of  meditation. A delegation then placed a spray of flowers before  the altar of the homeland.    The high point in this rally today was the statements of the  delegates and the various resolutions they introduced. Of the  100 [invited], 65 guests representing political parties or  socioprofessional organizations were present. Divergent opinions  were presented in the delegates' statements. Some opted for the  application of Article 148 of the country's fundamental law;  others demanded [the application of] Article 149. National  Coalition spokesman Carl Denis asked for a clean sweep, as a  true solution, or a triumvirate or five-member consultive  council. For his part, the representative of the National Rally  Party [PARAN] has withdrawn because, in his opinion, there is no  presidium managing this national conference. According to the  PARAN representative, Frantz Gerard Verret, the CARENA members  are acting as sole sovereigns whereas, in principle, the  National Assembly should be making decisions. [passage omitted]    The panel was made up of the Reverend Aurel Chery; Gabriel  Miracles, representative of the Autonomous Organization of  Haitian Workers for the union sector; Max Beauvoir,  representative of National BODE [BODE Nasyonal, voodoo  organization, expansion unknown]; Manfred Antoine,  representative of the people's sector and the National Front for  Change and Democracy; Dr. Rony Durant, representative of the  Higher Institute of Political and Juridical Sciences; and  Colonel Wilson Eustache, representative of the Army. We should  tell you that the representatives of the resigning government  were not present, nor was the diplomatic corps. The rally took  place in a very calm atmosphere. The room was very crowded. We  saw a big national flag and slogans advocating peace and  reconciliation. On the whole, this was the situation at the  Holiday Inn. Jean Luckenson for Signal FM. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / End to rabies law likely to be urged An end to rabies quarantine laws for pets is expected to be suggested in a report by the Commons agriculture select committee of MPs when it is released next week. The report also looks at the effectiveness of health checks on farm animals imported into Britain as a result of the European single market. It will be published on Wednesday and is likely to recommend replacing quarantine laws with a vaccination scheme.</p>

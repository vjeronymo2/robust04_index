			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Escape from the black hole / A look at the options facing unemployed UK executives The consultants and counsellors who advise the growing reserve army of unemployed executives in the UK often compare losing a top job to divorce or the death of a close relative. The unemployed executive may be more comfortably off than the average worker, but unemployment can be a greater psychological blow. 'If you have really invested yourself in your career, and neglected your family in the process, unemployment can be felt as a terrible rejection, the opening up of a black hole,' says Mr Bill Robbins, a counsellor with the DBM consultancy. Until recently, this sort of language might have been dismissed as the hyperbole of a fast-growing, and profitable, industry. But the mental health of depressed executives can now make front-page news, as it did last week when Mr David Elton, the oil executive who lost his job when Ultramar was taken over by Lasmo, killed his wife and then himself. Middle and senior managers in the UK have traditionally enjoyed greater security of tenure than blue- and white-collar workers. They have also been more secure than their US counterparts who have long been used to a more vigorous hire-and-fire tradition. 'The ordinary British worker could always blame someone else if he lost his job; an executive felt he could only blame himself,' says Mr Robbins. Those days are gone now that executive unemployment - as defined by the Department of Employment's list of professional and managerial occupations - rises to the 350,000 mark, and advertisements for general managers routinely attract 500 replies. Thanks to corporate restructuring many of the lost jobs will never return; a recent survey by Reed Personnel Services found that managers will be in least demand as the recession ends. As executive unemployment has become more routine so the stigma has diminished. Recruiting agency Jamieson Scott illustrates the point by reference to a client living in an exclusive cul-de-sac in Surrey. When he lost his job two years ago, he initially hid the fact from his golf-partner neighbours. He is now much happier as all but one of the seven breadwinners in the cul-de-sac are also unemployed. Some senior executives do well out of redundancy. Mr Ian Bell of outplacement agency Sanders &amp; Sidney says the average executive has a severance package equivalent to 11 months' pay but gets a new job within five months, half at a higher salary. Other London-based outplacement agencies, which run courses and provide assistance to get executives back into the job market, quote similar figures. Many specialists in executive unemployment are sceptical of such optimistic figures, however. And in any case, only about 20 per cent of unemployed executives enjoy the service of an outplacement agency. Those who do are usually doubly privileged, as it tends to be the larger, enlightened employers which provide outplacement as part of a redundancy package. Those same employers often provide pay-offs of Pounds 70,000 to Pounds 100,000 for departing executives or bring forward a pension of two-thirds of final salary for executives in their mid-50s. The worst-off are those who work for companies that go bankrupt. They eventually receive the UK minimum for redundancy which, even for those with long service, totals no more than about Pounds 2,500. If the executives are not self-employed and have been in work for more than two years, they can also claim Pounds 43 a week in unemployment benefit, which is not means-tested, and income support, including the payment of some mortgage interest, which is means-tested. For people who have been used to earning Pounds 40,000 a year or more, this crash in their standard of living combined with the undermining of self-esteem can be devastating. The transition was illustrated last week by businessman Mr Stephen Ensor and his family, who spent the night in a council hostel for the homeless after being evicted from their Pounds 350,000 home. Most unemployed executives fall between the extremes of a handsome pay-off and penury. Money is tight but a small severance payment plus savings or a spouse's earnings keep things steady for a few months at least. Mr Nigel D'Auvergne, who runs the Executive Self-Help Group in St Albans, says the average pay-off among his 50 members, mainly middle-managers, has been Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 30,000. One of Mr D'Auvergne's first steps on losing his job was to visit the local Citizens Advice Bureau: 'A lot of executives feel a bit squeamish about that but they should find out what they are entitled to.' To many executives dismissal comes out of the blue. 'The personnel directors always say 'he knew it was coming', but the executives usually say it was a complete shock and often feel very bitter, especially if they have been with the same company for 20 years,' says Mrs Donna Fidler of DBM. How do executives behave once the initial shock has passed? A small minority lose their identity when they lose their jobs and teeter close to, or fall into, the 'black hole'. But most, according to Mr D'Auvergne, feel a mixture of elation and anxiety. Mrs Jennifer Bowden of HS Solutions says the key is to stay calm and find the right 'mind-set': be neither complacent nor over-anxious; remember you remain the same person with the same skills the day after you lose your job. According to Mr Roger Shipton of KPMG Career Consultancy Services, most executives are not particularly entrepreneurial or dynamic, especially if they have been in one company most of their lives; even people in marketing may have forgotten the basics of how to sell themselves. For that reason, the experts encourage unemployed executives to take advantage of any help available in applying for a job. The Department of Employment's 105 executive job clubs are criticised by some job consultants but a third of the 12,000 executives who passed through their doors last year found jobs. Executive self-help groups, such as that in St Albans, provide better support for the depressed and usually try to include executives' spouses. Training and Enterprise Councils are also taking a closer look at executives and some have set up programmes which employ qualified executives as consultants to small businesses. Discipline and careful planning are essential, but the experts warn against the scatter-gun method of firing off 500 curriculum vitae. Mr John Baker, a former salesman unceremoniously let go by Shell Gas last May, also warns to expect virtually no replies from written inquiries or even job applications. Networking: Ian Bell of Sanders &amp; Sidney says that responding to advertisements, being placed by a headhunter and cold-calling together account for only about 25 per cent of jobs for unemployed executives. The other 75 per cent of jobs come from networking - which means using past business contacts. Mr Bell says you can expand your network by asking for two more names every time you leave a meeting with a contact. Self-employment/consultancy: Mr Chris Humphries, chief executive of Hertfordshire TEC, says that self-employment is the first thought for most executives, but only a few see it through. Consultancy is a more realistic option, as many companies will offer to hire back redundant executives as consultants. It helps to have a specialist executive skill like Mr John Pickering, a 55-year-old former BT executive who is an expert in wayleaves - obtaining permission to lay cables - and is in demand from telecoms companies. Mr Tim Hugh-Garland who runs First Partnership, specialising in setting people up as consultants, says about a quarter of his clients succeed. But consultancy is increasingly competitive and requires a subtle mixture of personal and technical skills. Mr Jim Potts, 51, who lost his job when chemical company Laport was sold to Solvay, tried consultancy but, like others, found it too lonely. He is now chief executive of Greater Nottingham TEC and setting up a self-help group for unemployed executives. Flexibility: Many executive jobs will never return. Mr Shipton of KPMG and others stress that executives must be ready to retrain for another industry if their skills are too specific, or consider a 'portfolio' of part-time, perhaps consultancy-related, posts. But how ready should executives be to take cuts in pay and/or status? Few will go as far as Mr James Guest, 39, a former Pounds 60,000-a-year City stockbroker who now drives a London bus for Pounds 15,000 a year - exactly the sum he received when he landed his first job as a metal broker in the City in 1981. He bought a company dealing in property for restaurants and hotels in 1987 but after two good years had to sell out in 1989. 'Driving a bus can be quite physically demanding but it is fun going through the City and seeing my old mates,' says Mr Guest, an Australian. He plans to get back into business as soon as possible, but adds that, for those who need to work, what he is doing is better than nothing. A degree of downward flexibility on pay can only help, though headhunters such as Mr David Juster of Selector Europe warn that aiming too low could backfire, as employers do not like taking on people they believe over-qualified. One idea for executives with capital or particularly generous pay-offs is to take a stake in a small business looking for an outside investor. But something that is generally frowned upon by the consultants is trying to turn a hobby into a business. Mr John Sutton, who lost his job when National Power closed its laboratory at Leatherhead, tried to turn his interest in carpentry into a small garden-furniture business. Holmwood Garden Seats did not take off, however, and with six of his eight children from two marriages still needing varying degrees of support he has successfully switched to consultancy, winning a Pounds 25,000 contract. 'I've been lucky but many people coming out of former nationalised industries have no idea where to begin,' he says. Others who can find it especially tough are people in their mid-to late-50s and those coming out of the armed forces. Most unemployed executives have valuable skills and in a few years, with the projected decline in the population, will be badly needed by industry. 'The trick is,' says Mr Roger Young of the British Institute of Management, 'to keep their skills from wasting away before they are wanted again.' CHECK-LIST FOR UNEMPLOYED EXECUTIVES 1.  Don't panic, discuss your situation openly with family and friends. There is no stigma attached to executive unemployment, and your chances of returning to the labour market in some form are considerably better than less qualified people. 2.  Prepare a family budget with income and outgoings over the next 12 months.  It will often reassure, and at least clarify. 3.  Make initial contact with the department of employment, the department of social security and the local Training and Enterprise Council to find out what job-hunting support and financial benefits are available 4.  Draw-up your CV, or have it done professionally, dwelling on your key skills and best attributes. 5.  Start networking.  Networking fills more than 70 per cent of all executive posts.  Every time you leave a meeting ask for the name of two people who might be able to help. 6.  Prepare thoroughly for all meetings and interviews.  Monitor and follow-up all contacts. 7.  Do not rule out alternatives to ordinary salaried employment such as consultancy, or, if you have the capital, taking an equity stake in a growing company. 8.  Think about doing things which make you more employable ie learning a foreign language or doing that MA. 9.  Whatever you do, be disciplined, accept that the search for a new career will be a full-time one.</p>

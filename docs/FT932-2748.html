			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / NFC may drop results forecast TRANSPORT and logistics company NFC, an experiment in popular capitalism since its 1982 employee-led buy-out from the government, is considering ending its unique practice of giving 'best view' forecasts of future profits. The practice was developed to keep shareholder employees informed before the company was listed on the stock market. When the company floated in 1989, it won special permission from the stock exchange to keep the 'best view' practice because about 90 per cent of its 33,000 employees were also shareholders, but many were not familiar with owning shares. The practice is under review because of changing rules about communicating information to shareholders. The company is also concerned about possible legal challenges in the US if it failed to meet its best view forecast. NFC yesterday reported pre-tax profits more than doubled to Pounds 86.6m in the 28 weeks to April 17. Most of the increase was due to exceptional profits on a disposal and the results were slightly below expectations. The company is sticking to its earlier 'best view' estimate for this year of Pounds 95m to Pounds 100m, excluding exceptional gains. The review of 'best view' forecasts also reflects NFC's growing international businesses, which are more prone to economic and currency swings. Overseas earnings have grown from almost nothing 10 years ago to 45 per cent. According to analysts, the review also signals NFC's desire to come into line with other large transport groups, especially as institutions now own more than 50 per cent of its shares. Some analysts expect NFC to launch its first rights issue if a suitable acquisition arises. Lex, Page 22; Background, Page 24</p>

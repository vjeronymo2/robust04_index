			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONVICTED SPY FOR ISRAEL FILES FOR DIVORCE;  </P> <P> ESPIONAGE: EX-NAVY MAN JONATHAN POLLARD IS SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE. LAWYER FOR  HIS WIFE SAYS SHE WAS SERVED WITH PAPERS IN HER HOSPITAL BED.  </P> <P> Jonathan Pollard, the former Navy intelligence specialist imprisoned for life  for spying for Israel, has filed for divorce from his wife, who served three  years in prison as an accessory to his crimes, her lawyer said today.  </P> <P> Mark Baker, attorney for Anne Henderson Pollard, 30, said his client was served  with divorce papers in her bed at Mount Sinai Hospital on Wednesday by a man  who posed as a hospital employee to gain entry to her room. Pollard has been a  patient at the hospital for treatment of a chronic gastrointestinal condition,  he said.  </P> <P> "She's in a state of shock," Baker said. "The papers served her cite  irreconcilable differences between her and her husband, whom she hasn't seen  for 3 1/2 years and hasn't talked to on the phone for four months. There's been  almost no contact, so how could there be irreconcilable differences?"  </P> <P> Baker said Pollard had not made up her mind whether to contest the suit and  will concentrate her efforts on going to Israel to get medical treatment. He  described her as destitute and said an insurance company in Israel has offered  to pay her medical costs there.  </P> <P> Jonathan Pollard, 34, is in solitary confinement at the maximum security prison  in Marion, Ill.  </P> <P> He and his wife had been married for only four months and were living in  Washington when he was charged with turning over top-secret documents to the  Israelis in return for money to finance a lavish lifestyle.  </P> <P> His wife was not implicated directly in the spy charges on which her husband  was convicted but tried to help him flee the country and destroy documents. She  pleaded guilty to accessory charges in the hope that it would help her husband  get a more lenient sentence, her lawyer said. She served a three-year prison  term.  </P> <P> Anne Pollard was released March 31 from a halfway house.  </P></p>

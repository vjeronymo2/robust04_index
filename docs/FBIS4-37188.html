			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 16 (AFP) -- OPEC ministers struggled  here Thursday [16 June] to break a political deadlock over the  choice of a successor to outgoing OPEC Secretary General Subroto  of Indonesia.    The front-running candidate for the office is former  Venezuelan oil minister Alirio Parra, said to have the support  of most of the 12 member countries of the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).    But Iran has proposed its current ambassador in Tokyo,  Hoseyn  Kazempur-Ardabili, a veteran OPEC delegate.    Iran's oil minister, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh-Kho'i, made it  clear Wednesday he was maintaining Kazempor's candidacy,  blocking a consensus in favour of Parra, and told reporters  early Thursday he had "not changed" his position.    According to OPEC's statutes, the organization's top  executive officer is appointed by unanimous decision of the OPEC  conference for a period of three years that can be renewed only  once.    Subroto, aged 66, a veteran Indonesian official who served  for 10 years as Indonesia's mining and energy minister until he  was named head of the OPEC secretariat in 1988, will be  completing his second term by the end of June.    Some delegations were said to favour extending his  appointment for six months as an interim solution, to give OPEC  members time to sort out the problem by the time of their  year-end conference scheduled to open here on November 16.    Another provisional solution mooted would provide for the  current OPEC President, Libya's Oil Minister 'Abdallah Salim  al-Badri to "supervise" the operations of the Vienna-based  secretariat in cooperation with OPEC's Iraqi Deputy Secretary  General, Ramzi Salman.    However, Kuwait made it clear at one point Thursday it would  suspend any relations with OPEC if day-to-day operations at OPEC  headquarters were left in the hands of an Iraqi national.    Conference sources meanwhile claimed Aqazadeh had been  rebuffed by key members, including Saudi Arabia, when reportedly  seeking guarantees that an Iranian would be appointed three  years from now if Iran withdrew its present candidate to make  way for Parra.    Under the statutes, the secretary general may be picked "on  a  rotational basis" for a two-year term, if a unanimous decision  cannot be obtained. This happened frequently in the late 1970s  and early 1980s, but then resulted in a stalemate because of the  Iran- Iraq war.    When Marc Nan Nguema of Gabon left office in mid-1983, an  Iranian was next in line, but his appointment was blocked by  Iraq and its Arab neighbours.    As a consequence, then Deputy Secretary General Fadhil al-  Chalabi, who happened to be an Iraqi, was left in charge of the  secretariat until Subroto's appointment in June, 1988.    The choice of a new OPEC chief executive officer was the  final point on the agenda of the ministers' mid-year meeting  which opened here Wednesday.    They cleared their main business late Wednesday by agreeing  to leave OPEC's overall oil production ceiling unchanged to  year-end and to avoid any ministerial meetings before the next  regular conference set for November 16.    The ministers reckon that this will encourage the recent  uptrend in oil prices, since demand is expected to firm up  towards the end of the year as economic recovery gains ground in  industrial nations.    "Doing nothing may sometimes do the trick," a delegate  commented.    Oil futures soared in New York after the ministers' decision  late Wednesday, hitting a 12-month high of 19.86 dollars a  barrel for the American benchmark light crude, WTI. But  analysts here said this was mainly due to factors which had no  bearing on the outcome of the OPEC talks.    In London, North Sea Brent prices at two months broke up  through the 17-dollar mark early Thursday afternoon, as crude  for August delivery briefly reached 17.04 dollars a barrel  before stabilizing at 17.02, compared with 16.94 dollars at the  Wednesday close.</p>

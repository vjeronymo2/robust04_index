"We hail the quick U.S. reaction" to Japan's action program  aimed at boosting foreign access to its construction market, the  top government spokesman told a news conference.    He also expressed hope that the outcome of the Japan-U.S.  construction negotiations will have a favorable effect on the  "much bigger theme" of bilateral framework trade talks.    Following Japan's announcement of the action plan on  Tuesday,  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Wednesday that the  United States will remove the threatened punitive actions  against Japan over the construction market.    The U.S. had charged that the Japanese bidding system, which  allows only a select number of construction firms to tender for  public works contracts, discriminates against U.S. companies.    Washington had set Thursday as the deadline for Tokyo to  make  requested changes in bidding procedures, otherwise sanctions  would be imposed.    Takemura said, however, that Japan drew up the action  program  of its own volition, not because of U.S. pressure.    "I hope this move will have a favorable effect on the  Japan-U.S. framework talks toward the summit in February," he  said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill  Clinton will meet in Washington on February 11 to assess  progress in the bilateral negotiations being held under a trade  framework accord reached last July.    The action program, which takes effect April 1, calls for  the  introduction of an open bidding system on public works projects  of central and local governments and 84 public corporations.    Currently, only designated contractors are allowed to  participate in bidding for most projects.    Under the action plan, the open bidding system will be  introduced for state-sponsored projects worth 4.5 million  special drawing rights (SDRs) or more of the International  Monetary Fund, or about 720 million yen or more. At present,  one SDR is valued at 160 yen.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi said earlier in a  statement that the U.S. appears to have given high marks to  efforts by the Hosokawa administration to resolve the issue.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata also said in a statement that  he is convinced that the settlement of the issue will contribute  to progress in the framework trade talks.</p>

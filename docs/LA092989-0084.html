			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LAUNDRY OF QUAKE-DAMAGED HOSPITAL IN SYLMAR REBORN AS A SHOWPLACE FOR ARTISTS  </P> <P> When the 1971 earthquake shook the Veterans Administration Hospital in Sylmar,  47 people were killed and most of the buildings were damaged beyond repair.  </P> <P> The hospital closed, but the laundry building survived. And in 1977, when the  90-acre site reopened as Veterans Memorial Park, the laundry building was  transformed into a public art gallery. Atop a hill amid eucalyptus and palm  trees, the Century Gallery overlooks the San Fernando Valley, with a view on a  clear day as far as Sepulveda Pass.  </P> <P> "Local people in Sylmar still don't know it's here," said Priscilla Neilsen,  who has worked for two years as the gallery's curator and only paid employee.  </P> <P> Neilsen says the gallery's mission is to aid emerging artists and make art  available to the public free of charge. The gallery, which closes during the  summer, has opened its season with an exhibit of works by local Latino artists.  </P> <P> Neilsen is paid for 12 hours a week by the Los Angeles County Department of  Parks and Recreation, which operates the park. The Century Gallery is the only  gallery in the county's parks and recreation system, and it is kept open mainly  by volunteers.  </P> <P> The county pays for the building's maintenance and the invitations to each  exhibition opening, but not much else. Artists are asked to pay $40 to help  with printing and other costs.  </P> <P> "It's catch as catch can as far as a budget goes, and it gets worse every  year," Neilsen said.  </P> <P> The gallery's 12 volunteers are called the Docent's Council, and most are  members of the Sylmar Women's Club, a philanthropic group that donates about  $600 a year to the gallery. The docents provide the food for the art show  openings.  </P> <P> "They bake their own cookies," Neilsen said. "It is very much a labor of love."  </P> <P> Despite the small budget, Neilsen says, the gallery has professional standards.  "Everything is screened, and we look for high-caliber work. We don't show  back-yard artists.'  </P> <P> The works range from $100 to $3,000, and the gallery takes a 25% commission  from sales.  </P> <P> The gallery runs five exhibits a year, at least one showcasing the works of  local artists. The current show, "Para Nuestro Exhibicion Latino," features  more than 50 works of eight Latino artists from Sylmar and Sun Valley.  </P> <P> "It's giving some new artists exposure that they couldn't get elsewhere because  they don't have the experience," said Andro Avendano, an artist who proposed  the show. Avendano hung the show himself, mixing his work and that of seven  other artists throughout the 5,000-square-foot gallery. The exhibit includes  oil paintings, colored-pencil drawings, bronze sculptures, watercolors and  photographs.  </P> <P> Neilsen says the show is unusual for the gallery. "We've had a lot of  avant-garde, conceptual, Southern California art, but it doesn't necessarily  appeal to the San Fernando Valley. This is more pictorial, more figurative.  There's nothing here that you don't know what it is."  </P> <P> The gallery's next show, which opens Nov. 5, will feature paintings, prints and  photographs of the San Fernando Mission by two local artists.  </P> <P> Mary Dahlsten, president of the Docent's Council, says the volunteers give  tours to elementary school students from the inner city, sometimes as often as  twice a week. "It's usually their first gallery," Dahlsten said. "Whether they  get anything out of the art show or not, it's a beautiful park."  </P> <P> Business people who come to the park occasionally visit the gallery during  lunch breaks, Dahlsten says, but the gallery doesn't get many other visitors.  She says she and other volunteers used to advertise art shows by putting flyers  on neighbors' doorsteps, but they stopped because of the poor response.  </P> <P> "People around here probably go to Los Angeles to see something when it's just  as good here," she said.  </P> <P> Not only is it difficult to attract visitors, Dahlsten says, but it's becoming  increasingly difficult to attract volunteers, which they have tried to find  through women's clubs and running ads. "I'm 72," she said. "And I'm about the  youngest one we've got."  </P> <P> "Para Nuestro Exhibicion Latino" can be viewed at the Century Gallery, 13000  Sayre St., Sylmar, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays.

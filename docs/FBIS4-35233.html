			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 28 May (INA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH has said that  recent changes in the UN Security Council, which has recently  witnessed support by all UN Security Council member states --  with the exception of the United States and Britain -- for the  lifting the blockade, have made Saudi King Fahd lose his balance  and abuse Iraq.    In its editorial today, the paper adds that when he saw Iraq  getting prepared to resume its normal life and the role  compatible with its size, history, and capabilities, Fahd lost  his mind. For he realizes that this will mean an increase in  the state of deterioration in Saudi Arabia, a widening gap  between the treasonous rulers and the masses there, and a  decline in the importance of the subversive Saudi role on Arab  and Islamic fronts.    Referring to the hostile U.S. role, the paper notes that the  United States is losing daily its sources of influence on the  world and regional levels to the forces of freedom and progress.  The paper notes that this has left the Saudi agents deeply  concerned about continued U.S. protection against the wrath of  the peoples that have suffered from their crimes, especially  since they know well that the "American's God is the dollar."    The paper says: Therefore, Iraq's certain and imminent  return to the regional arena will mean that the United States  will reconsider the role of Saudi rulers and will leave them  alone to deal with the realities of the new situation that  emerged during the Mother of Battles.    The paper stresses that as Fahd watches all this, he is  obsessed day and night by the nightmare that Iraq has past the  dangerous stage, that it has destroyed all justifications for  the blockade, and that the world is clearly coming to understand  Iraq's position.    On the same topic, BABIL describes Saudi ruler Fahd as a  glaring example of the pseudo men afflicting the Arab nation.    In an editorial, the paper says that after what he said  against Iraq, this Arabist bastion and upholder of the banner of  Islam, the betrayer of the two holy mosques and Judas Iscariot  can only be described as a dissolute person and a pig.    The paper stresses that the Arab nation's history cannot be  made by dissolute persons and pigs, but faithful leaders with  clean minds and hearts. Those are makers of the future and the  pride of the nation. As for the first category, their lot is  to rot in vice, damnation, and misfortune.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Observer: Paradise lost? Like the Hawaiians' Aloha, Tahiti's Ia Ora is a salutation that can stand for both 'hello' and 'goodbye'. But it can hardly mean 'welcome' as the Pacific islanders say it to the latest newcomer - income tax. Whether the innovation means goodbye to Tahiti's claims to be an earthly paradise is open to question. It would certainly be denied by the government of French Polynesia, whose excuse is that the tax is needed to supply a social welfare system and more decent roads, housing and healthcare. Besides, the government says, the tax won't be levied on incomes below about Pounds 7,900, and even above that the rate will be only 3 per cent. But isn't that a figure we've heard somewhere before? Well, almost - because it was at the rate of 2.9 per cent that income tax was first imposed as a peacetime measure in Britain in 1842. Of course, as prime minister Sir Robert Peel pledged at the time, it was to last at most three years . . .</p>

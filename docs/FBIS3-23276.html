"The settlers of Qiryat Arba', Gush Qatif, Qedumim, Teqoa',  and Ari'el must leave their settlements by March 15," Hamas's  'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam military wing said in a leaflet.    "If they don't, we will not let them rest in their  settlements or feel safe on the roads to their settlements."    It also warned that "the leaders of Israel will pay for  their  crimes sooner or later," and scoffed at the army's ability to  prevent the attacks.    The leaflet, titled "The Settlers Will Pay with Their Blood  for the Massacre," described a five-stage plan of attack.    "With each step we will make the Israeli people and settlers  cry in blood for their dead, and let them know that our blood is  not cheaper than theirs," the leaflet stated. "We have chosen  our targets and our living martyrs have been instructed to carry  out the suicide operations."</p>

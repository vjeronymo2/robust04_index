			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / The Property Market: A dialogue of the deaf - Matthew Oakeshott on the case for reforming commercial leases Some of Britain's biggest retailers met last week to demand changes in the way they rent commercial property from long-term investors - pension funds, insurance and property companies. The retailers dislike the traditional institutional lease, under which tenants contract to pay rent for 25 years with upward-only rent reviews every five years, and keep the property fully repaired and insured. They argue that the English lease structure is inflexible and unfair, rents increase in an arbitrary way, and if they pass on ('assign') leases on property which no longer suits them, they are liable for rent and repairs if subsequent tenants default (the principle of privity of contract). Weary and fearful investors, suffering the worst property crash since the 1930s, say they have heard all this before - there is always a crescendo of tenants' screams in the depths of recession. Certainly there was little sign of retailers wanting to reform the system four years ago when it was working in their favour. Many were eager to take more space, or pocket a fat premium from selling a lease on a shop where the rent bill lagged behind the market because of the traditional review system. Most also wanted arbitrators to settle disputed rent reviews, not independent experts who can take a wider view of current market conditions. Property is a cyclical business - it always has been, it always will be, and with any conceivable legal and institutional framework the balance of advantage between landlord and tenant will still vary over the cycle. Long-term investors need a secure income stream to meet their liabilities. A traditional long institutional lease to a blue-chip tenant produces ideal top quality income. Letting or re-letting empty property is a sideshow compared to the long-term investment performance of the more than 90 per cent of institutions' property assets which are safely let and which generate income. Just because tenants can negotiate soft leases in soft markets such as London offices, they should not expect long-term investors to concede sea-changes in the lease structure; such concessions would devalue the bulk of their portfolios and eliminate property as a competitor to equities and gilts for investment funds. Unless they are offered something in return, long-term investors are as likely to abandon the institutional lease as climbers on the North Face of the Eiger to let go of the rope. They would be failing in their duty to their pensioners and policyholders. At present the operation of the market seems unfair to tenants during their lease but equally unfair to investors when the lease ends. Under the 1954 Landlord and Tenant Act, the tenant has the investor up against a wall, with a one-way option in his favour to renew his lease for up to 14 years at a rent and with lease conditions fixed by a court. And it is tough under current English law to ensure that departing tenants leave property in good repair. The argument between tenants and investors looks like a dialogue of the deaf. But there is a simple solution to the strains in the system. It would help both sides now and keep a better balance over the whole economic cycle, as well as cutting legal costs and delays. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the basic contract for the occupation of commercial property operates in a much fairer way than in England and Wales, both during and at the end of a lease. Many important investors and tenants have operated happily under the Scottish and northern Irish systems for many years. Why not bring England and Wales into line? There are two main differences between commercial property leases in the north and south of the UK: Privity of contract. Tenants in Scotland and Northern Ireland are off the hook once their leases have been assigned but the investor's position is protected because leases can usually be assigned only to a tenant of equal status. If an undoubted name such as Marks and Spencer wants to move out, prudent investors will ensure that the lease is not assigned but the shop is sub-let to, say, Lowndes Queensway, or a Mrs Snooks (who may be a respectable trader but would not be 'of equivalent financial standing, demonstrably capable of fulfilling all the tenant's obligations throughout the period of the lease', as a Scottish institutional lease may put it). But if Mrs Snooks in Scotland or Ulster takes a lease on a small shop, and assigns it to a Mr McHattie, she cannot be pursued for Mr McHattie's rent or repairs years after she has retired, for example (and the present English law can produce horrific cases). The blue chip tenant, by sub-letting rather than assigning, can also keep a firmer grip than in England on his liabilities arising from rent reviews and alterations, and has the right to take back and re-let or reoccupy the property if the sub-tenant defaults on rents or repairs. Lease terms in Scotland mean what they say about repairs and lease length - tenants of office and industrial property in Scotland have no right to renew their lease, and shop tenants' rights are negligible. A 10 or 25-year lease means just that, not a perpetual right to occupy for the tenant. Obviously tenants in England and Wales see no advantage under the present system in signing a long lease since they may enjoy a series of free five-year statutory options to renew in their favour. If the Scottish system applied to England, tenants would have to strike a balance in their lease renewal negotiations between their wish for flexibility and security. Many UK national retailers are still freely taking new leases and renewing leases for 20 or 25 years in Scotland, not just because the market is healthier in Scotland than in London, but also because long leases often make commercial sense for both landlord and tenant under the balanced Scottish system of lease renewals. There is no need, anywhere in the UK, for courts to be involved, with all the expense and delay entailed either in fixing new lease terms or in settling dilapidations claims at the end of leases. In Scotland, if the landlord gets his property back at the end of the lease, he repairs it straightaway and the tenant pays. In England and Wales the process is cumbersome, costly and slow with some big retailers rivalling Houdini in their technique for wriggling out of repair commitments. Property often stands empty for years while cases drag through the courts. A shift to the Scottish system would not need immediate legislation in England and Wales. Investors and tenants should now agree a three-point commercial property charter for new leases (see chart). Such a charter would give something to both sides. It would make investment and occupation simpler and cheaper, and it would protect small traders without undermining institutional investors' long-term security of income. It would also reduce the swings in advantage between landlord and tenant over the economic cycle which are inevitable in the present English system, and end the Catch-22 of landlords and tenants never wanting the system changed at the same time. If this voluntary charter works well in practice, the law should then be changed to abolish both privity of contract and the 1954 Act for all new leases. It would, of course, be wrong to break existing lease contracts by retrospective legislation abolishing privity of contract or a tenant's rights to renew leases.

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills police might have nominated Zsa Zsa. Casual pot smokers would  certainly have voted for L.A. Police Chief Daryl Gates. Some L.A. County  residents would have opted for malathion.  </P> <P> But none of the above made Spy Magazine's prestigious 1990 list of "The 100  Most Annoying, Alarming and Appalling People, Places and Things."  </P> <P> It's not really surprising. You know how snooty Eastern publications tend to  ignore the West. But even Spy had to include Raiders wheeler-dealer Al Davis  and junk-bond crook Mike Milken.  </P> <P> Randy Keser's car doubles as a mobile personal ad.  </P> <P> "Wife Wanted," blares a sign on the back of his VW Rabbit. In smaller print, it  adds, "Or Live-Together Mate." There's also a phone number for the Lovelorn of  the Lanes to jot down.  </P> <P> Keser, a 39-year-old aspiring actor who has been married previously, said, "I  haven't had much luck finding a woman the regular way. I mean, I could pick up  someone in a nightclub. But if I marry her that's where she's gonna be (in a  nightclub) when I'm working at night." Keser, who said he's displayed the sign  "off and on" since January, reports he's heard from "a few women" as well as  several pranksters.  </P> <P> He added: "I also hear from other guys who say they wish they had the courage  to do what I'm doing. They ask if they can have some of my leftover phone  numbers."  </P> <P> The license plate frame on L.A. City Fire Engine No. 43 says: "This is the  E-Ticket Ride."  </P> <P> The freeways are more congested than ever and the price of gasoline is ticking  ever upward. But one oil company wants to help out the motorist, as only an oil  company can. Local Shell outlets are offering "Cruisin' Classics" tapes for  "$1.99 each, with 8-gallon fill-up." The cruisin' hits include "Ventura  Highway" by America. Really puts you in the mood to burn up $1.40 per gallon in  rush-hour traffic, doesn't it?  </P> <P> As an example of the Let-the-Computer-Do-the-Thinking attitude, Lynn Dickhoff  of Topanga cites the postal clerk who informed her that the cost of mailing two  small calendars would be $103.80.  </P> <P> Before the mistake was discovered -- the computer hadn't cleared the previous  customer's $99 money order -- Dickhoff commented that $103.80 seemed a bit  high.  </P> <P> "It's the tax," the clerk said.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  miscelLAny:  </P> <P> The Gorman School District to the northeast of L.A., the smallest in the  county, consists of three teachers and 42 students.  </P></p>

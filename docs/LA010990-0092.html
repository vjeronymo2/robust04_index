The Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization,  which last March filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11  bankruptcy proceedings, has proposed to distribute cash, notes and a new issue  of common stock to satisfy creditor claims. If approved, health-care providers  would become Maxicare's major stockholders.  </P></p>

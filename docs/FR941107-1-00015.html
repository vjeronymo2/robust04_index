			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 94&hyph;NM&hyph;132&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain British Aerospace Model Avro 146&hyph;RJ70A and &hyph;RJ85A series airplanes. The CAA advises that, during an inspection of the cable terminals in the auxiliary power unit (APU) starter circuit, incorrect cable terminals were found installed on these airplanes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation revealed that nickel-plated copper terminals were installed during production instead of aluminum/copper terminals. Nickel-plated copper terminals that contact APU starter cables having an aluminum core result in dissimilar metal corrosion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such corrosion could lead to the loss of power to the APU, and the consequent inability of the pilot to start the APU when necessary in a situation where an airplane's primary or other electrical power sources are lost. If this were to occur, all electrical power on the airplane may be lost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Avro has issued Service Bulletin S.B. 49&hyph;40, Revision 1, dated March 17, 1994, which describes procedures for a detailed visual inspection to identify the cable terminals fitted to cables KA47 and KA48 in the APU starter circuit at terminal block KA9. This service bulletin also describes procedures for removing the cable terminals identified as part number (P/N) S1007&hyph;042 and installing new cable terminals having P/N S1006&hyph;040.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a detailed visual inspection to identify the cable terminals fitted to cables KA47 and KA48 on the APU starter circuit at terminal block KA9, removal of certain cable terminals, and installation of certain new cable terminals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 3 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 1.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $250 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $997.50, or $332.50 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

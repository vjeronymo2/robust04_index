			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Departments to adopt resource accounting All central government departments will be required to comply with radical new 'resource accounting' guidelines within the next four years, under official proposals unveiled yesterday. Departments will have to account for capital expenditure and develop more accurate and relevant management information, a Treasury green paper says. The paper describes the changes as 'probably the most important reform of civil service accounting and budgeting arrangements this century'. It follows a pledge for reform of the present 'archaic' public-sector accounting system in the Budget speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The green paper says that most government departments would implement resource accounting by April 1 1997 and the remainder a year later. The accounts would be laid before parliament for the first time in 1999-2000. At the launch of the document yesterday Mr Clarke said: 'People will find other ways of celebrating the millennium but few will be more important. This is one of those highly significant events.' He said the recommendations would bring public-sector accounting 'up to date' and 'very much more in line' with the best of financial reporting in the private sector. The proposals are in stark contrast to the present system - which Mr Clarke called 'silly' - by which cash is recorded when money is first spent on capital items, with no account subsequently taken of whether an asset is still in use, has been sold or reached the end of its useful life. The green paper says resource accounting encompasses both the adoption of accruals accounting, similar to that used by companies, and the development of a framework for analysing expenditure by departmental objectives. It will lead to longer-term use of resource budgeting for future decision-making, and to the development of a series of output indicators to improve civil service management. The paper stresses the need to link inputs to outputs, with the emphasis on improved management and on what departments produce rather than what they have available to spend. Its recommendations should provide a better basis for treating capital, encourage a more systematic approach to charging for capital items and make comparisons easier across departments and with the private sector. The proposals suggest financial statements for each department would include: An operating cost statement, highlighting resources consumed during the year net of department income from customers. A balance sheet showing assets and liabilities, provisions and an analysis of capital employed. A cashflow statement, analysing capital and current cash outflows and sources of finance. Mr Andrew Likierman, head of the government's accountancy service, said the computer and associated costs of implementing the system would be up to Pounds 3m in each department. Reacting to the green paper, Mr Noel Hepworth, director of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said: 'This is good news and a very important progressive step. It will generate widespread recognition and support overseas.' Better Accounting for the Taxpayer's Money: Resource Accounting and Budgeting in Government. HMSO. Cmnd 2626. Pounds 9.40.</p>

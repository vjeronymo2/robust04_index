Olechowski said that the signed agreements were like "stones  of which a new Europe was being built." He also stressed that  they would contribute to building relations between the nations  that liked each other.    Earlier in the day, the two ministers held a meeting and  chaired the plenary talks by the delegations of the foreign  ministries of Poland and Slovenia. The talks were attended by  Polish deputy minister for foreign economic relations Andrzej  Bryt.    The talks focused on preparing bilateral economic agreements  which were planned to cover protection of investments, avoidance  of double taxation, transport, transfer of social benefits and  re- admission.    Peterle said the agreements should be signed still this  year.  He stressed that the talks and decisions made on Monday were "a  big step" designed to consolidate Polish-Slovenian and  international cooperation in Central Europe on the  Baltic-Adriatic line.    The two sides also discussed the situation in the Balkans.  In the opinion Peterle, the recent developments in Bosnia show  there is a possibility of reaching peace. He expressed hope  that the European Community would help limit or even solve the  conflict.    Peterle, who is holding both the post of foreign minister  and  deputy prime minister, said Slovenia was planning to establish  its embassy in Warsaw. Poland announced at the beginning of  January, 1994, that it decided to open its embassy in Ljubljana.</p>

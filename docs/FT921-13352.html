			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BT partly-paid shares close below 110p Partly-paid shares in British Telecommunications closed yesterday for the first time below the price at which the government sold them to small investors. In last month's Pounds 5.4bn sale, the Treasury sold shares to 2.7m small investors at 110p and to institutional investors at 125p. Yesterday, the shares closed at 109 1/2 p after touching 108 3/4 p at one stage. The government had made it clear that it wanted to avoid the shares going for a large premium, as this could have left it open to accusations that it had sold public assets on the cheap. But ministers may now face the embarrassment of voters finding that their investments have fallen in value. Nonetheless, small shareholders have not actually lost money because they received a 5.7p dividend last week. The share price has been undermined by fears that Oftel, the industry regulator, would control BT's prices more strictly when it starts to review them at the end of this month.</p>

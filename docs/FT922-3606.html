			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems welcome PM's 'wooing' LIBERAL Democrats yesterday interpreted a warmly worded letter from Mr John Major as a sign that he is preparing to woo the party's MPs if necessary to help the government win a Commons majority on the Maastricht treaty. The prime minister told Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, that he did 'appreciate the support you have given', even if Liberal Democrats wanted to go faster on European integration and had reservations about the Maastricht deal he had won.</p>

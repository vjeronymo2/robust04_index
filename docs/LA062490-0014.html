			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GREATEST SOLDIER-STATESMAN SINCE WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> GENERAL OF THE ARMY GEORGE C. MARSHALL, SOLDIER AND STATESMAN BY ED CRAY (W. W.  NORTON: $29.95; 847 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-393-02775-9)  </P> <P> George Catlett Marshall clearly ranks as one of the most extraordinary soldiers  and statesmen this nation has ever produced. As World War II Army chief of  staff he was, in Winston Churchill's words, the great "organizer of victory."  As secretary of state from 1947-1949 he played a major role in the formulation  of basic U.S. Cold War policies, most notably Containment and the European  Recovery Program, which bears his name and led to his receipt of the Nobel  Peace Prize. As secretary of defense during the Korean War, he helped to  re-create U.S. military power while simultaneously reasserting civilian control  over it in the Truman-MacArthur controversy.  </P> <P> Marshall's character was even more impressive than his accomplishments.  Contemporaries were awed not only by his leadership abilities, but also by his  honesty, commitment to principle, self-sacrifice, and sense of honor and duty.  He turned down power, profit, and historical immortality on numerous occasions,  refusing to seek elected office, to accept lucrative offers for his memoirs, or  to request command of the Normandy invasion that was his for the asking. Harry  Truman considered him the "greatest living American." To Churchill, he was "the  noblest Roman of them all."  </P> <P> Not everyone agreed. Like any public figure, Marshall had his failures and  detractors. Pearl Harbor occurred while he was chief of staff, and his 1945-46  mission to prevent civil war in China did not succeed. His policies infuriated  the "China Lobby" and the McCarthyites within the Republican Party, who went so  far as to accuse him of being a "front man for traitors." Yet for most of his  contemporaries, Marshall remained a figure of towering stature, comparable only  to George Washington in the annals of U.S. history.  </P> <P> Over the last few decades, however, Marshall's reputation has faded. Most  college students today cannot identify him at all, save for the fact that he  had "something to do with the Marshall Plan." As Roosevelt feared, people have  remembered the battlefield commanders from World War II rather than the  soldier/statesman who was their mentor and superior.  </P> <P> Ed Cray, journalist, author, and associate professor of journalism at the  University of Southern California, has attempted to rectify this situation with  a one-volume biography of Marshall designed for the general reader. He is not  the first to do so. Three other journalists have previously published popular  biographies of Marshall: William Frye in 1947, Robert Payne in 1951, and  Leonard Mosley in 1982. Cray's effort is far superior to all of these. Unlike  the first two authors, he has the advantage of writing after the publication of  Forrest C. Pogue's magisterial four-volume official biography and the first two  volumes of Marshall papers as edited by Larry I. Bland. Unlike the third  author, he has taken the time (nine years) to immerse himself in this and other  relevant material, and to verify his conclusions with scholars. His numerous  sources include unpublished as well as published documents, key secondary  works, journalistic accounts of the time, oral history transcripts, and his own  oral history interviews. The result is an accurate and judicious, as well as a  highly readable portrait of a true American giant.  </P> <P> Cray's title reflects his emphasis. "General of the Army" was a special,  five-star rank created by Congress to recognize Marshall and a few others for  exceptional service in World War II. Although he held two Cabinet positions  afterwards and is most famous today for the Marshall Plan, the focal point of  his career remains his extraordinary tenure from 1939-1945 as Army chief of  staff. Cray properly devotes two of his four sections and more than half of his  narrative, as well as his introductory chapter and title, to this six-year  period.  </P> <P> Marshall's basic character and ideas were of course formed long before 1939,  and Cray's first section clearly traces his personal and professional  development from birth in 1880 to the chief-of-staff appointment. Those years  were marked by recognition of his exceptional abilities, but lack of  appropriate promotion because of the small size of the Army and the fact that  his genius at staff work prevented him from obtaining troop command. Not until  1936 would he see his first star.  </P> <P> Marshall's exceptional managerial abilities would be critical in creating the  largest Army in U.S. history between 1939 and 1945. Of at least equal  importance in explaining his success during these years, however, was his  capacity to grow intellectually throughout the war, despite his age, and  consistently to assume more and more responsibilities. The most important of  these were political in nature, for war is an instrument of policy and  inseparable from political realities. Consequently Marshall found himself  constantly dealing with congressmen, presidents, naval and allied counterparts,  and leaders of other countries on a host of politico-military issues. So  successful was he in these efforts that by 1945 he had become the President's  most trusted adviser and one of the nation's foremost and respected diplomats  as well as soldiers. His shift after the war from military to  civilian/diplomatic posts, covered by the author in his fourth and final  section, was thus far less dramatic and surprising than one would think.  </P> <P> Cray is especially good in explaining the complex politico-military issues of  the war years while keeping his subject in the foreground. His tightly knit  narrative weaves together the numerous events that concerned Marshall from 1939  through 1945 without losing track of the man himself. This is an impressive  accomplishment for any writer, and especially for one not trained in history.  </P> <P> That lack of training does reveal itself, however, in a few errors and  omissions. Historians no longer describe the 1920s as an era of "deliberate  isolationism," for example. On occasion, the author credits Marshall with  questionable and undocumented beliefs, uses quotes improperly to describe  preceding events, and provides incorrect first names and background  information. Although extensive, the bibliography does not include a few  pivotal works on strategy and diplomacy during World War II and the early Cold  War, or some previously published studies of Marshall. Compared with other  popular biographies of major World War II figures, however, this one is  remarkably accurate and well researched, and highly recommended for the general  reader.  </P> <P> The Marshall Plan might have rebuilt Eastern Europe 40 years ago, had the  Soviet Union not stood in the way.

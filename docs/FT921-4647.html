			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Murdoch holding in News Corp diluted MR Rupert Murdoch's family shareholding in News Corporation has been diluted to 41 per cent from 44.8 per cent as a result of moves to strengthen the group's balance sheet following its financial crisis last year. The dilution, which was expected, was divulged by News Corp in a filing to the Australian Stock Exchange. News Corp is incorporated in Adelaide, although it is run from the US. News Corp said the number of voting shares held by Mr Murdoch and his family companies Cruden Investments and Kayarem had risen to 150m from 120m in September. However, the family's holding was diluted by the issue of 96m new shares as part of News Corp's refinancing since the completion last year of a USDollars 7.6bn debt rescheduling agreement with more than 100 banks. The group issued 42m shares in December, and just under 2m in September and October as part of its dividend re-investment plan for shareholders. The remaining 52m shares were issued on conversion of the company's convertible notes. News Corp announced the latest step in its refinancing on Thursday in New York, where News America Holdings, the group's principal US subsidiary, said it planned to raise about USDollars 300m in zero coupon exchangeable subordinated notes. News Corp has raised about USDollars 1.5bn recently through the issue of notes and shares, asset sales, and the part-flotation of Pacific Magazines and Printing, an Australian subsidiary. The refinancing programme has been generally well received. Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating agency, raised News Corp's long-term debt rating from BB minus to B in December.</p>

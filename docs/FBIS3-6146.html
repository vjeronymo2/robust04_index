			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpts] The Jakarta Stock Exchange is entering the  modern era. Since the end of January, a big change has been  attempted in the exchange's trading system. Indonesian Stock  Clearing and Deposit Inc (KDEI) has been in official operation  helping brokers to expedite day-to-day trading. The KDEI will  handle all the details relating to the completion of  transactions.    In that way, less of a burden will be placed on the brokers.  All they have to do is trade; they no longer have to dun the  buyer for payment. On the other hand, the buyer will not have to  chase after the seller to transfer the stocks. KDEI will take  care of all those matters. Four days after a transaction takes  place, the selling broker can ask KDEI for payment, and all the  buyer has to do is take possession of the stocks.    At first this so-called settlement process will only be  applied to five stocks--Indah Kiat, Barito Pacific, Tjiwi  Chemicals, Pan Brothers and Dharmala. These five stocks have  dominated the market for the past three months. "They account  for 30 percent of all transactions," said Cyril Nurhadi,  managing director of KDEI. Next June KDEI hopes to handle all  transactions on the Jakarta Stock Exchange.    KDEI will use computers to handle these settlements, which  can be very complex. Computers will not only execute the  settlements but will also handle the bidding process. [passage  omitted]    As a pilot project, Hasan Zein Mahmud, managing director of  the Jakarta Stock Exchange (BEJ), has been using a computer to  implement the bidding on 72 stocks which are not traded very  much and which are also known as "sleeper stocks". For this  trial, BEJ employees wrote a simple program themselves," said  Hasan. This is meant to be a way of getting ourselves used to  the computer.    This simple program will be replaced by a sophisticated  program which will merge the BEJ and KDEI computer networks.  Everything, from the trade to the settlement, will be handled by  electronic signals running through thousands of slender cables.  The BEJ has appointed Berca Inc to computerize the system.    Berca Inc, which is owned by the businessman Murdaya Poo,  submitted the winning low bid of $3.45 million. "This is cheap  because it includes all the computer hardware," Hasan explained.  It is said that the next lowest bid was three times higher than  Berca Inc's.    However, this doesn't mean that everything is perfect. As  was  mentioned above, the BEJ wants the computers to be in operation  by June 1994. Transactions, now valued at more than 100 billion  rupiahs per day, cannot only be done by hand.    Problems might arise because the BEJ will not be in its  present building, located at the corner of Merdeka Selatan  Street and where the computers have been installed, for much  longer. It has been reported that the lease on the building will  not be renewed and that the BEJ will have to move into a new  building on Sudirman Street, Jakarta, which is now being readied  for the future site of the exchange. Of course it is not very  efficient to install the computers and all their cables and  networks and then three months later to dismantle them because  the BEJ has to move. It has been estimated that at least 200  million rupiahs will be wasted. [passage omitted]    Another problem is that the computers will be put through a  three-month testing period in the old building. An expert in  capital markets thinks that computers must be tested for at  least one year while transactions are being executed.    "This is necessary in order to test the various scenarios  which might arise on the market. Otherwise, if the system goes  down and the market comes to a halt, the reputation of the  Jakarta Stock Exchange can suffer," he said. Besides that,  "Stock transactions on the primary market must be part of the  computer's agenda," said J. A. Sereh, a broker who used to be  the managing director of Danareksa Inc.

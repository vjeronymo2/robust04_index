			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: FASB rule impacts on bondholders THE Financial Accounting Standards Board, the US accountancy standards group, voted yesterday to approve a rule that will force US financial institutions to carry more of their debt and equity securities at market value. The ruling, which will come into effect next year, will have a particularly big effect on banks and insurance companies, which have large holdings of bonds. The changes will make it harder for them to categorise their debt securities as long-term investments held for the duration of their maturity, and thus valuable at cost. Instead, banks and insurers will have to categorise more of these bonds as 'available for sale', which means they will be marked-to-market, or valued according to their current price in the market. The FASB decision immediately came under fire from banking and insurance groups, which have long argued that current value accounting would introduce unwelcome volatility into their earnings. They have also argued that having to mark-to-market more of their financial assets may force them to change their investment philosophies by switching more of their assets out of long-term securities and into short-term securities. The American Bankers Association, which expressed disappointment yesterday at the FASB vote, called current value accounting 'a bad idea whose time should not have come'. The ABA said the new rule would 'change the way banks conduct their business and the fundamental role they play in the economy'. The FASB was also attacked for changing its rules on the accounting of assets, but not on the accounting of liabilities. In a statement, the Metropolitan Life insurance group said: 'Marking only assets to market without marking the corresponding liabilities to market is not sound accounting and reporting practice. We believe it makes little sense and is not healthy for long-term lenders and borrowers in the capital markets.' A spokeswoman for the FASB said the board voted by 5-2 to approve the rule after one of its seven members, who had previously held out against supporting current value accounting, changed his mind. The rule will be formally issued in June.</p>

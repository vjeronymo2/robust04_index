			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- Continuing to occupy a position of  noninterference in the conflict inside Afghanistan, Russia calls  on all sides involved to display restraint, to reject actions  using force, and to seek political compromises for the sake of  national consolidation. This was stated by Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the information and press department of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today.    He noted that Russia views with deep concern recent events  in  Afghanistan, the flaring up of armed clashes in Kabul and in the  north of the country which have already caused numerous  casualties, including among the civilian population. It is  evident that such a development can only further intensify the  polarization of the forces in Afghan society, make the prospects  for restoring peace in Afghanistan even more remote, and  seriously complicate the situation on the southern frontier of  the CIS and in the region as whole, the Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.    Together with other states and the United Nations, Russia is  prepared to assist the process of achieving an Afghan  settlement. Grigoriy Karasin said getting such a settlement  going and furthering it would correspond to the common interests  of the whole of the international community.</p>

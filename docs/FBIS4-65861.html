			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Geneva, May 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslems and  Croats will press demands for more land at a meeting of the  warring factions Wednesday [25 May] in the French Alps near here  with an international contact group, a Moslem delegate said.    Sources close to the talks said the final delegates from all  three sides had arrived in Geneva Tuesday. [passage omitted]    The Bosnian Serb delegation arrived Tuesday, headed by  Momcilo Krajisnik, the speaker of their self-proclaimed  parliament.    Krajisnik said his side wanted a ceasefire as soon as  possible and did not attach any conditions to a truce or new  peace talks.    But, he insisted, referring to sanctions in effect against  Serbia and NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs, "we think we  must be treated in the same way."    "Serbs are the only ones to be threatened ... to get bombed  and to have sanctions imposed against them," he said, speaking  after a meeting with international mediators Lord Owen and  Thorvald Stoltenberg.    A member of the Moslem delegation who asked not to be named  accused the superpowers Tuesday of trying to "dictate and  impose" a solution on Bosnia-Herzegovina that would not restore  peace.    He rejected a European plan for the ethnic division of  Bosnia- Herzegovina, which the contact group backed at a meeting  in Geneva on May 13 and urged all sides to accept. [passage  omitted]    The Moslem delegate Tuesday said the Moslem and Croat  leaders  -- who agreed this year to form a new Moslem-Croat federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina -- would use their own proposal made in  Vienna earlier this month.    That plan gave the federation a greater chunk of land, 58  percent of Bosnian territory, than the European plan.    The European plan provides 51 percent of the territory for  the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for Bosnian Serbs.    The Moslem delegate said the Moslems and Croats would  present  themselves as a "united" front at Talloires and "undertake  discussions on the basis" of their Vienna plan.    Krajisnik said setting percentages for partitioning land was  "a useless way of doing things. It must not be a precondition  for the continuation of talks." [passage omitted]</p>

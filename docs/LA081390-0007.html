			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON CONGRESSIONAL 'LOG-ROLLING';  </P> <P> 175 VOTES FOR 'BUTCHER OF BAGHDAD';  </P> <P> THE DEBATE ON CUTTING EXPORT CREDITS FOR IRAQ WAS A TEXTBOOK CASE OF CRASS  POLITICS OVERRIDING MORAL PURPOSE.  </P> <P> Although President Bush has acted with swift resolve since Iraq's dramatic  invasion of Kuwait, America's message to Baghdad in the days and months  preceding the attack was far more ambiguous. In fact, just six days before,  Republicans and Democrats alike took the floor of Congress to oppose even the  mildest sanctions against Iraq, which by that time had amassed 30,000 troops on  its border with Kuwait.  </P> <P> Despite Hussein's outrages against human rights and his extraordinary military  buildup, the United States has extended $500 million this year in credit  guarantees for exports of agricultural commodities to Iraq. In 1989, the total  was about $1 billion. Such taxpayer-subsidized loans are not even available to  the Soviet Union, which has bought U.S. grain for years.  </P> <P> It is well known that U.S. farm subsidy programs -- what Texas' Republican Rep.  Dick Armey calls "OPEC for crops" -- are among the most wasteful boondoggles  that Congress has contrived.  </P> <P> When a farm-state Democrat, Rep. Dan Glickman of Kansas, offered an amendment  to this year's farm bill to take Iraq off the gravy train, the State Department  opposed it; a subsidy cutoff, State said, "would not help us achieve U.S. goals  with Iraq."  </P> <P> That the State Department and many in Congress were more interested in  maintaining this most blatant of domestic political payoffs than in ending U.S.  taxpayer support for Iraq was telling evidence of the level of American concern  with events there. The implicit message was surely not lost on the Butcher of  Baghdad as he weighed whether to grab Kuwait.  </P> <P> In all, 91 Democrats and 84 Republicans voted against ending export credit  subsidies to Iraq. And while the Glickman amendment passed, 234-175, the kind  of tough, even Pattonesque rhetoric that is everywhere evident in the halls of  Congress today was strangely absent from the debate on July 27.  </P> <P> "Back before the Cuban Revolution," said Democrat Bill Alexander, "Arkansas was  the single largest exporter of rice to Cuba. Over 30 years since the embargo  was imposed by our country against selling rice to Cuba, it has cost my rice  farmers $11.5 billion in uninflated dollars.  </P> <P> "The embargo on Cuba has been a classic case of shooting ourselves in the  foot," he concluded. "To do so once was folly. To do so a second time, with  respect to Iraq, is near insanity."  </P> <P> Insanity . . . Last week, the word was used to describe Saddam Hussein's state  of mind. But the week before, it was to hell with human rights and national  security -- there's money to be made. Indeed, in the very same floor speech in  which he acknowledged that the Iraqi government was "despicable," Alexander put  it this bluntly: "Here's why we shouldn't restrict agricultural trade with  Iraq: We need the trade."  </P> <P> Perhaps one might excuse a Bill Alexander for such crass opportunism, since he  at least represents a farm district. But the farm lobby could not win 175 votes  for subsidies to Iraq through its numbers alone. According to Bernal Green and  Thomas Carlin, two economists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, only 46  of the 435 congressional districts in America are farm-oriented. Like the labor  unions, farm groups have used political organizing skills to amplify their  power far beyond their numbers.  </P> <P> That is why I found myself desperately lobbying representatives of large  metropolitan areas during the floor vote on ending subsidies to Iraq.  </P> <P> Pressure from a rural constituency couldn't explain why Charles Rangel, the  Democrat who represents Harlem, or Jim Bates, the Republican-turned-Democrat  who represents San Diego's southside, voted to keep Hussein on the dole. A far  better explanation is that most members of Congress, like the farm lobbyists  themselves, are champion log-rollers.  </P> <P> David R. Nagel, a Democrat from Iowa who voted to continue Hussein's subsidies,  recently took the House floor to explain in detail how farm-state legislators  had cut a deal with the maritime lobby: In return for farm support of a  "ship-American" rule, Nagel said, the maritime interests agreed to support the  farm program.  </P> <P> And so it has gone, on and on, until now members of the House from every region  of the country have become so caught up in voting for farm subsidies that even  a madman like Saddam Hussein cannot break them of their habit.  </P> <P> Of course, once American public opinion was enlightened about Hussein, the very  same members of Congress who had pontificated about the evils of "using food as  a weapon" immediately voted to cut off not only subsidies, but all trade with  Iraq.  </P> <P> None, however, was more unabashed in his instant reversal than Democrat Mervyn  Dymally of Los Angeles. Taking the floor only five days after his vote to give  subsidized loans to Hussein, Dymally "urgently requested" the President to  "exert every effort, short of militaristic intervention," in Iraq.  </P> <P> It is a sad fact that the substantial support for taxpayer-guaranteed loans to  Saddam Hussein -- up to the very moment of his rape of Kuwait -- speaks volumes  about the dominance of domestic political expediency over national security  interests in Congress. After all, it is hardly as if the bipartisan votes for  continued agriculture subsidies to Hussein were cast in ignorance of the threat  that he poses to Mideast peace.  </P> <P> Debate on the Glickman amendment only served to highlight that its opponents  were well aware of Hussein's crimes. Missouri Republican Bill Emerson, who rose  to oppose the subsidy cutoff, called Iraq "at this point in time the most  abysmal government in the world." As if domestic murders and foreign aggression  weren't enough, the debate even brought to light that Iraq has consistently  cheated on the commodity loan program.  </P> <P> In a floor speech on the day of the Iraqi invasion, Edward F. Feighan, a  Democrat who represents suburban Cleveland, Ohio, catalogued Hussein's  atrocities to date and his potential for more. Feighan spoke with such ringing  passion, one couldn't have guessed that he'd voted to stock Hussein's larders  just days before.  </P> <P> So, through neglect and naive collaboration, America has found it now must pay  a far higher price to stop Saddam Hussein than merely lost trade opportunities.  </P> <P> Edmund Burke, to whom is attributed the statement that "The only thing  necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing," in fact said  this: "When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one  by one -- an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle." Now Hussein and  his 1 million bad men are combined against us. The failure of good Republicans  and Democrats alike to stand together when there was an opportunity to thwart  him has all but ensured American sacrifices in a contemptible struggle.  </P></p>

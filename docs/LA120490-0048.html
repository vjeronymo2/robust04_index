			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LEWIS IS OUT, PACKARD IS IN IN GOP VOTE  </P> <P> A conservative cadre rallied by Orange County lawmakers won a hotly contested  leadership race within California's GOP congressional delegation Monday by  installing one of its own, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), and other allies in  influential posts.  </P> <P> Led by Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), the California conservatives  ousted Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands) from his only state delegation post hours  after Lewis won reelection as head of the House Republican party caucus.  </P> <P> The vote was reportedly 11 to 8 to replace Lewis with Packard as California's  representative to the Republican Committee on Committees, a powerful body that  assigns GOP lawmakers to congressional panels. All five Orange County  congressmen supported Packard.  </P> <P> "I'm going to work my heart out for them," Packard said of his fellow  Californians. "I don't have any outside agenda. I don't have any ulterior  motives to be on the Committee on Committees." Packard represents southern  Orange County and northern San Diego County.  </P> <P> Lewis had been criticized by some for what they said was a willingness to use  his power over committee assignments to further his aspirations to party  leadership positions.  </P> <P> The vote was said to have stunned Lewis, who campaigned hard for the committee  assignment post up until minutes before the 19 California Republicans began  casting their ballots.  </P> <P> Referring to Lewis and his chief allies, Reps. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego) and  William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), one Orange County lawmaker said: "It just  didn't occur to them that the slaves would rise up. They have always thought of  us as the Three Stooges."  </P> <P> However, in an interview after the vote, Lewis said: "I have other things to  do. . . . I did not make an impassioned plea."  </P> <P> Several lawmakers said that Packard's victory appears to have strengthened the  hand of the Orange County congressional delegation. Not only can Packard be  expected to give special attention to their requests for committee assignments,  the sources said, but their ability to put together a coalition powerful enough  to remove a party leader from his delegation post also will not be forgotten by  their colleagues.  </P> <P> The conservatives who ousted Lewis, who held the committee assignment post for  eight years, argued that he and Thomas for too long had dominated key  leadership jobs within the delegation. In voice votes, the Republican  congressmen also replaced Thomas as their representative to the National  Republican Congressional Committee and as liaison to the state Republican  party.  </P> <P> The votes, Dannemeyer said, represent "a recognition that these jobs with real  responsibility need to be passed around occasionally. . . . It was time for a  change, and that's what we made."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, conservatives led by House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich  (R-Ga.) failed by a vote of 98-64 to remove Lewis as chairman of the party  caucus, formally known as the House Republican Conference. Lewis became a  conservative target after he angered fellow Republicans this fall by endorsing  the White House-backed budget plan that included tax increases.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer and Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Long Beach) opposed Lewis in the party caucus race. However, Packard and  Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) supported him.  </P> <P> Packard and Cox contended that Lewis, despite the budget vote, was more  conservative than his opponent, Rep. Carl D. Pursell (D-Mich.). In addition,  Packard and Cox said it would be foolish to replace a Californian heading the  party caucus with a representative from another state.  </P> <P> After his defeat of Pursell, Lewis lashed out at Gingrich and others in the  House Republican leadership who had sought to bring him down.  </P> <P> "The election . . . was somewhat of a disaster, not for Carl Pursell, but  rather for those within the leadership who have chosen to actively work against  my candidacy," Lewis said. "Their purpose was not to help Carl Pursell but to  dump Jerry Lewis."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(ZI)": "Unemployment in the Czech Republic"] </F>   [Excerpt] The number of unplaced job-seekers registered at  labor offices continued to rise in December last year. On 31  December, 185,216 people were out of work, which is the highest  number of unemployed since March 1992. Compared with the  situation at the end of November, there were 9,500 (5.38  percent) more unemployed, while, compared with the same period  of 1992, there were 50,400 more unemployed.    Some 31,944 people came onto the labor offices' registers in  December, which is 6,900 newly registered job seekers fewer that  at the end of November. Only 22,500 job seekers came off the  labor offices' registers; of these, 15,600 (69.3 percent) were  placed in employment, 2,700 (12.0 percent) were struck off the  register for not observing the conditions for cooperation with  the labor offices, and the remaining 4,200 (18.7 percent) came  off the register for other reasons. The number of labor offices  that, during December, recorded a drop in the number of  registered job seekers has declined. Only six labor offices  (Prague-West, Ceske Budejovice, Usti nad Labem, Jablonec nad  Nisou, Prague, and Beroun) recorded a drop in the number of job  seekers between - 3.8 percent and - 0.1 percent. The  month-to-month increase in unemployment in the other labor  offices hovered between 0.05 percent in the Blansko District and  17.2 percent in Cheb.    The number of people receiving benefits prior to entering  into employment was 93,380 on 31 December 1993, which is 50.4  percent of the overall number of unplaced job seekers.    The level of unemployment, calculated as a percentage of the  number of registered job seekers in the overall available work  force, was 3.52 percent on 31 December, which was the highest  figure recorded in 1993. Compared with the same period last  year, this is 0.95 percentage points more and, compared with  September 1993, it is 0.35 percentage points more. Unemployment  rose in all regions of the republic except Prague (stagnation).  The highest level is still in North Moravia (6.16 percent),  where, of the 10 districts, only Olomouc recorded an  unemployment level under 5.0 percent. Only in Prague and the  Cheb District was the level of unemployment under 1.0 percent in  December (0.34 percent and 0.68 percent respectively). It was  more than 5.0 percent in 22 districts and more than 7.0 percent  in seven districts. The highest level of unemployment was in  the Znojmo District (8.52 percent) and in Bruntal (8.7 percent).    The number of vacancies has continued to decline in contrast  to the rising number of unplaced job seekers. On 31 December  1993, there were 53,938 vacancies on offer at labor offices,  which is 1,100 fewer than in November and 25,500 fewer than  during the same period of 1992. The supply and demand situation  for vacancies is different in individual regions of the Czech  Republic. While in Prague at the end of December there were  almost six vacancies per job seeker; in North Moravia, the  demand for vacancies exceeded supply almost 12 times and in  South Moravia 6.5 times. The average for the Czech Republic as  a whole was 3.4 job seekers per vacancy. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sa'id 'Ayyad in Jericho, QUDS PRESS] </F>   [Text] Jibril al-Rajjub, who has been appointed by PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as the official in charge of preventive  security in the West Bank, has said that if the settlers try to  break the law, we will confront them and deal with them harshly.  He noted that their presence is illegal and described them as a  "time bomb." He said that if they break the law we will not  throw roses or rice at them.    Al-Rajjub, who returned to the occupied territories from  Tunis on 17 May, said that the agreement that the PLO and Israel  signed is "unfair." He said that the Palestinian party is  committed to keeping law and order regarding the settlers and  others. He said: We pledge to all Palestinian political forces  to respect their right to express their stances freely and in a  democratic and civilized way. He noted that every political  force has the right to call for strikes, stage demonstrations,  hold seminars, protest to the authorities, and express their  views as they deem fit. However, he vowed that the Palestinian  authorities will be firm and not allow any political faction to  take the law into its hand and impose a strike by force.    Regarding the pro-Israeli collaborators, al-Rajjub, who  holds  the rank of a colonel in the Palestinian security organ, said  that they constitute a very serious factor. He said that this  problem will be handled on a case-by-case basis and in  accordance with the degree of the crime committed by these  collaborators. However, he stressed that from now on the  Palestinian authorities will not allow any collaborator to think  he is above the law or to carry arms on the streets. He called  on individuals who collaborated with Israel to reconsider their  past so that the new authorities will be able to determine their  future.    Al-Rajjub emphasized that the Palestinian security organ  will  establish close cooperation with the Arab security agencies and  emphasized that there will be no direct or indirect cooperation  with the Israeli security agencies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  Defense William Perry denied today that the Pentagon is planning  to delay closure of some bases until after the 1996 elections.    "We plan to go ahead with a vigorous base closing in 1995.  And we will propose to close as many bases as we can  effectively and efficiently execute," Perry said in a radio  interview.    There were reports in recent days that the Clinton  administration is considering the move so as not to inflict  economic pains to some of the communities and to alienate voters  there in the 1996 elections.    Last year, Congress approved, and President Bill Clinton  signed, recommendations to close 130 military bases and scale  back 45 others around the United States.    According to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment  Commission that made the recommendations, the base closures will  save the U.S. Treasury about four billion dollars from fiscal  1994 to 1999.    After the year 2000, the U.S. is expected to save about 2.3  billion dollars each year as a result of the base closings.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 26 (XINHUA) -- Vladimir Shumeyko,  speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament, today reiterated  that the reshuffled government will stick to the reforms  underway in Russia.    He said the new government will not reverse the reform  process, as feared by some enthusiastic reform advocates,  especially after the departure of former Deputy Prime Ministers  Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fyodorov.    Shumeyko indicated that their departure only represents a  change in economic policies, and that the new government is  shifting its efforts to stimulate production.    Earlier this month, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  announced a shift from the purely monetary methods of managing  the economy as pursued by Gaydar and Fyodorov.    Fyodorov, also former minister of finance, today formally  quit that post following his earlier refusal to remain in the  new cabinet.    Sergey Dobinin, his former first deputy, has since been  appointed acting minister under a decree by President Boris  Yeltsin.    Fyodorov disclosed that he recommended Dobinin for the post  as he thought Dobinin was "the best choice".    Shumeyko ruled out an altered government attitude toward the  West following the departure of Gaydar and Fyodorov, saying  "Russia will maintain its relations with Western partners as  ever."    But at the same time he pointed out that Russia, as a  "sovereign nation, will not allow anyone speaking to it in a  chiding manner."    Shumeyko also told the press that presidential power has  been  consolidated as a result of the December legislative elections  and the government reshuffle.    The speaker of the Federation Council denied speculation of  a  dispute between the president and the prime minister over  economic policies.</p>

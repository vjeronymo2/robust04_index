			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, January 26 (BTA) -- The passage of the  national budget act within the time limit asked by the prime  minister, the new conditions in the political space following  the recent meeting between Zhan Videnov, leader of the  ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), and Filip  Dimitrov, leader of the anti-communist Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS), and the rampant crime topped the agenda of a more  than two-hour-long conversation today between President Zhelyu  Zhelev and the leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan. Mr. Dogan was late for his  appointment after talks at the Council of Ministers. The  government still has room for manoeuvre and may do a lot more,  the DPS leader said after the meeting. The incumbent cabinet  was voted into office on the DPS mandate. February 16 is a  realistic deadline for the passage of the budget, according to  Mr. Dogan.    The bipolar model manifests a perpetuation syndrome which is  dangerous for the country, said the leader of the third largest  parliamentary party. As a democratic alternative, centrism may  offer completely different survival strategies to the country,  he emphasized. Mr. Dogan reiterated to the president his view  that the BSP and the SDS have a lot of shared interests and that  this is all the more obvious after their leaders' meeting.  "Extremes attract each other because they are similar," he  said. The anti-presidential campaign and nationalism as a  powerful trump in the hands of the parliamentary BSP and SDS,  similar views on the pre-election functioning of parliament and  on barring the access of other political forces to a future  parliament constitute a dangerous tendency, according to Mr.  Dogan. "I would like to state in full responsibility that any  calling into question the 4 percent threshold (the proportion of  the vote which, under the effective electoral law, a party  should poll in order to qualify for the distribution of seats in  the legislature) may result in such a mess that we will wonder  whether we are in the Balkans, in Europe or somewhere else in  the world," he warned.    "The new crime situation necessitates more radical  countermeasures because the incident in Belite Brezi (a Sofia  neighbourhood where two Red Beret commandos were shot and killed  by fellow policemen in an unauthorized operation) calls into  question the competence of the Interior Ministry," Mr. Dogan  said, summing up his views on the other item on the agenda of  his talk with the president. In addition to personnel changes  in the ministry, it needs a new strategy to handle the problems,  he said. One of the basic things is to guarantee decent living  and safety to the rank- and-file policemen, the DPS leader  stressed. "A minister who should excel at firmness and a  strategy for resolute action rather than at his own virtues is  another essential condition for the Interior Ministry to do its  job," the DPS leader emphasized. He rejected the SDS draft  resolution on personnel changes in the Interior Ministry,  arguing that an opposition force cannot dictate personnel  changes in the ministry.</p>

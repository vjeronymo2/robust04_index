			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> U.S. JUNIORS GO TO FRANCE FOR SECOND SUMMIT  </P> <P> International team competition is nothing new to golf. There are the Walker  Cup, Ryder Cup and Eisenhower Trophy world team matches for men, the Curtis Cup  and Espirito Santo Trophy world team matches for women.  </P> <P> Now the juniors are going international.  </P> <P> The Southern California vs. France junior matches, which began almost by  accident two years ago at the Alhambra Municipal and Industry Hills courses,  will be held for the second time, next month in France. Twelve Southland  juniors, ages 12 to 17, and two PGA professionals, Jerry Herrera of Azusa  Greens and Dave Smith of the Navy course in Cypress, will leave on June 28 for  Paris, where the youngsters will play on four courses against a team of French  juniors.  </P> <P> The idea came about during the Guadalajara Pro-Am in Mexico in early 1988.  Herrera was in the tournament -- he won it -- and one of his partners was  Alaine Sarfatti, president of Le Club de la Tour, an organization with offices  in Paris and Los Angeles. Sarfatti mentioned that his club was sponsoring a  trip by 12 French juniors to Southern California as a reward for their play,  and asked Herrera if he knew of some available courses.  </P> <P> "I was an assistant at Alhambra Municipal at the time," Herrera explained, "and  we had a Christmas tournament scheduled for our own junior program. I suggested  that he bring the French players and play in it. Then I contacted (pro) Jim  Porter at Industry Hills and got starting times there. With the help of Porter  and Dave Allaire of Lakeside and the Southern California Junior Golf Assn., we  put together a team of our best players and challenged the French kids.  </P> <P> "It took on big-time trappings when Pat Rielly, president of the PGA, put in an  appearance, and the matches were filmed by a TV crew from France.  </P> <P> "The French kids had such a great time that when they got back to Paris, the  French golf federation invited us to come over there this year. I've written  letters to other national federations with the suggestion that they join us in  the future and maybe have an annual event that moves from country to country,  like the world team matches."  </P> <P> The 12 Southern California golfers were selected for their play in the Junior  Golf Assn. Three of them -- Tiger Woods of Cypress, Young Nam of Los Angeles  and Eddy Lee of Corona -- were members of the 1988 team.  </P> <P> Woods, 14, has won four Junior World age-group championships, and shot a 70-69  -- 139 on the Balboa and Encino courses to win his age division in the L.A.  City Junior Championships in April.  </P> <P> Nam, who attends Marshall High, is the City prep champion and winner of the  1988 Asian junior tournament in Manila. Lee, from Corona High School, is the  Southern Section prep champion.  </P> <P> Other boys on the team are Chris Tidland, 17, of Placentia, the Los Angeles  City junior champion; Richard Son, 17, of Fullerton; Scott Richardson, 17, of  Laguna Niguel; Ben Garner, 14, of El Toro, and Ted Oh, 13, of Torrance.  </P> <P> The four girls are Heidi Voorhees, 17, of North Hollywood, runner-up in the  L.A. City junior tournament; Leanne Wong, 15, of Los Angeles, a two-time Junior  World champion who also won the Korean junior title last December; Allison  Wilson, 13, of North Hollywood, and Sandie Song, 12, of Cerritos.  </P> <P> They will play on July 3 at Le Touquet Golf Club, July 4 at Morfontaine Golf  Club and July 5-6 at St.-Nom-La-Breteche Golf Club, site of the Lancome Trophy  matches. They will also watch the final round of the French Open on July 1 at  the Chantilly course.  </P> <P> Herrera, 36, a former Monrovia High, Pasadena City College and UC Santa Barbara  golfer who became head pro at Azusa Greens in February of 1989, has been the  catalyst for the matches. His French counterpart, Fred Beauchemp, once gained  international attention when he crossed the Atlantic Ocean on a sailboard.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine what a trip like this must mean to a teen-ager," Herrera said.  "I was 12 before I knew what golf really was. An uncle took me to Rancho when I  was 12 and I saw Arnold Palmer, and right then I decided I wanted to be a  professional golfer. This opportunity to help establish a union between our  junior golfers and France has been a unique experience for me. It's like a  dream come true -- 20 years later."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Casey Boyns, a caddie at Pebble Beach, will defend his championship in the 79th  annual California Amateur tournament June 25-29 on the Cypress Point, Monterey  Peninsula and Pebble Beach courses. A field of 102 will play 36 holes of stroke  play June 25-26 and then begin match play June 27. The 36-hole final will be  June 29.

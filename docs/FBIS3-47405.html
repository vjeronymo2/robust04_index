The message says that when the allied foreign forces led by  the United States invented a "nuclear suspicion" against the  North and successively raised hysteric nuclear and war clamours  one after another from the beginning of last year on that  pretext in a bid to inflict the holocaust of a nuclear war on  the territory of the homeland, Pomminnyon lifted up voices of  anti-war and peace at home and abroad together with all the  fellow countrymen, defending the banner of national independence.    The new year 1994 is a very meaningful year, one year to go  till the first year of reunification which Pomminnyon declared  before the nation when raising the anchor to set sail, the  message says, and continues:    The new year has come, but reunification will not come by  itself for us, and no outside forces will make a present of  reunification to our nation.    The United States, on the pretext of the invented "nuclear  suspicion" against the North, is creating an atmosphere of  distrust and confrontation within our nation and increasing the  political and military tensions. Taking advantage of it, the  South side's authorities are resorting to all despicable means  and methods like opening the rice market, on which the right of  peasants to existence hinges, to the United States, while  persistently trying to maintain an "international cooperation  system" to harm and stifle the fellow countrymen.    The present-day situation requires that all our fellow  countrymen vigorously advance along the patriotic road of  reunification, more firmly united than before under the banner  of great national unity.    The overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon respectfully  proposes  to the South and North sides to set 1994, the eve year of 1995,  the first year of reunification, as a year of great national  unity for national reunification and jointly conduct the  movement to unite the whole nation as one.    We firmly believe that the call of the overseas side  proposing the new year as a year of great national unity for  national reunification will meet with full support and response  from the Pomminnyon organisations in the South and North.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Fake World Bank securities Financial fraudsters have been trying to sell hundreds of millions of dollars of fake World Bank securities in the US and the UK, writes Robert Peston. The World Bank, the multilateral development bank, yesterday warned investors not to buy prime bank notes or prime bank guarantees which carry its name. Investors are offered astonishingly high rates of interest. A scheme being marketed in the UK offers 156 per cent return for an investment of Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.4m) and 260 per cent for Dollars 100m and higher.</p>

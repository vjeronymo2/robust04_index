			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Brussels gives guidelines on open telecom market TELECOMMUNICATIONS groups in Europe will have to increase the cost of local telephone calls and charge rival companies for access to the telephone network to fund a basic minimum service for customers once the sector is liberalised, the European Commission said yesterday. But the Commission said it would be up to individual member states to decide exactly how to fund a 'universal service' after January 1, 1998, the date set for opening ordinary telephone services to full competition across the European Union. The options - which are already being considered by telecoms companies  - are contained in Commission guidelines, published yesterday, aimed at helping member states prepare for full competition. In June, when EU telecoms ministers agreed on the 1998 deadline for liberalisation, they made clear that the definition of a universal service was essential to calm fears about the effects of competition. At the moment, basic services - such as promising to connect all customers, even those who live in remote areas - are partly funded by profits from international and long distance calls, estimated at up to Ecu16bn (Pounds 12.2bn) a year. But increased competition is expected to cut those profits, and without safeguards some member states and national operators fear that rival companies will simply not carry out loss-making obligations. The Commission has decided to draw a very broad definition of basic services, based on legislation which has already been adopted on the regulatory framework for liberalisation. For example, the Commission says that basic customers rights in the EU should include: having a phone connected; receiving services - such as installation or repairs - within certain time-limits and according to certain standards; clear complaints procedures; and access to new services such as itemised bills. The Commission says that although basic services should still be 'affordable', the cost of such obligations will have to be met by charging local subscribers more for ordinary phone calls and phone connections, and levying fees on new operators wanting to use existing networks.</p>

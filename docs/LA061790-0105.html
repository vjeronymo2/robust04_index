			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONSERVING WATER -- THE CONTRADICTIONS  </P> <P> I find it ludicrous that the city of Anaheim has sent out a glossy little  brochure telling the citizens how they might save a few teaspoons of water.  </P> <P> And today I read that the new public utilities general manager is "big" on  conservation. Edward K. Aghjayan wants Anaheim to be a role model for water  conservation.  </P> <P> How can the city reconcile this noble goal with continued annexation of more  land to the east and the unrestricted housing developments in every part of our  city, thereby increasing water usage? It doesn't make sense. Am I missing  something here?  </P> <P> JUNE BAAL BICKFORD  </P> <P> Anaheim Hills  </P></p>

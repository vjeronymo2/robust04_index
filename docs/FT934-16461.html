			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Johnston cuts loss to Pounds 393,000 REDUCED pre-tax losses of Pounds 393,000 were announced by Johnston Group, the construction and engineering concern, for the half year to June 30. Losses of Pounds 765,000 were reported last time. Turnover increased to Pounds 64.2m (Pounds 58.4m) including Pounds 3.5m from the sale of a development property at Esher, Surrey. Mr Graham Johnston, chairman, said the UK construction side suffered from reduced volumes and severe price competition, resulting in 'significant losses'. In the engineering division, the road sweeper manufacturing companies suffered a small deficit, largely because of losses in the Californian business acquired in April 1992. Mr Johnston said that changes were in hand which would improve the US performance. Cost savings, however, had enabled Johnson Engineering in the UK to improve results and the construction materials division had shown 'a considerable increase in profits.' The result benefited from a fall in interest charges to Pounds 693,000 (Pounds 779,000). Losses per share were reduced to 4.62p (7.52p). The interim dividend is cut to 1p (2.25p).</p>

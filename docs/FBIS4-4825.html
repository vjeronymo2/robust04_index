			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 4 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian  and Swedish companies today signed four memoranda of  understanding (MOU) including one to establish a scholarship  fund.    Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and his  visiting Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt witnessed the signing of  the MOUs.    The first of the MOU, on the establishment of the Swedish-  Malaysian Scholarship Fund, was signed among seven Swedish  companies, namely Armitage Shankf, Bofors Sdn Bhd [Private  Limited], Celsius Tech, Ericsson Perwira Telecom, SKF Bearing  Industries, Skanska International Building AB and Volvo/SMA  (Malaysia).    The fund would establish closer links between Malaysia and  Sweden in the areas of engineering, technology and business  development.    The establishment of the fund is seen as a contribution  towards the implementation of Vision 2020, the Swedish Embassy  said in a statement issued through the Foreign Ministry.    The statement said the fund would undertake to finance and  facilitate graduate and post-graduate studies at Swedish  universities and other educational institutions as well as  on-the-job training in companies for suitably qualified  Malaysian students.    In the longer term, the fund would expect to provide similar  opportunities for Swedish youths in Malaysia, the statement said.    The seven companies have pledged an initial sum of RM  [Malaysian ringgit] 1.8 million for the fund. Dr. Mahathir and  Bildt have agreed to be the patrons of the fund.    The second MOU, to construct the Wisma Scandinavia building  here, was signed by Uniphoenix Corporation Berhad's Mohamed  Saufi Abdullah, Melker Schorling, the managing director of  Skanska, and Wisma Scandinavia Property Sdn Bhd's Hans  Wetterberg.    The third MOU, to develop port Langkasuka in Langkawi, was  signed between Ting Pek Khing, chairman of the conglomerate  Ekran Sdn Bhd, and Schorling, while the fourth, on technical  cooperation in relation to hydro-electric power development in  Malaysia, was signed between Ekran Sdn Bhd and Skanska  International Civil Engineering AB.</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY COUNCIL FIGHTS BACK AT PROPOSED ETHICS REFORMS  </P> <P> Bristling at the implication that they may be corrupt, Los Angeles City Council  members on Wednesday threw out the $1.5-million annual funding for a proposed  ethics commission and began picking away at other provisions of a sweeping  ethics reform proposal.  </P> <P> "Because the mayor said he used bad judgment, we are all tarred with being  crooks," said Council President John Ferraro. "We have to prove our innocence  before we're accepted, and I don't like that. I don't like that at all."  </P> <P> The full council was confronting, for the first time, an ethics reform package  whose seeds were planted a year ago when questions about Mayor Tom Bradley's  financial dealings began to emerge publicly.  </P> <P> Bradley conceded that he used poor judgment in accepting paid positions with  two area banks and appointed an ethics-in-government commission to draft a new  standard of conduct for public officials.  </P> <P> The far-ranging proposals of that commission, combined with the recommendations  of a council committee, call for publicly financed political campaigns,  restrictions on outside income for public officials, increased financial  disclosure and a ban on lobbying by former officials for a year after they  leave office.  </P> <P> In a special session Wednesday, the council began attacking the package with a  blizzard of amendments generally intended to weaken it.  </P> <P> Among the most serious changes was an amendment that greatly softens a proposed  ban on gifts and honorariums. The amendment, sponsored by Councilman Joel  Wachs, bars only gifts and honorariums from people who do business with the  city.  </P> <P> "I don't think it matters to anybody whether my cousin from Minneapolis sends  my daughter a bat mitzvah gift," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who seconded  the amendment. "My cousin from Minneapolis is actually regulated more strictly  than Art Snyder" (the former councilman who is now a powerful lobbyist).  </P> <P> But Councilman Michael Woo, one of the drafters of the package, said the change  "has the effect of gutting the entire proposal." Woo said he will attempt to  repair the damage today.  </P> <P> Most council members had been skittish about publicly criticizing ethics  reforms, but a number spoke out bluntly Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Are we subhuman? Are we less ethical than any other profession?" asked  Councilman Hal Bernson, who declares Los Angeles "the cleanest city in the  world."  </P> <P> Bernson said the only incident "that has even been remotely connected with any  wrongdoing" has been the "alleged situation" regarding Bradley.  </P> <P> "Because of this, we're stampeded into a situation where we're going to declare  ourselves as not being thieves," Bernson said. "I am not a thief. . . . I'm not  going to support a package that declares we're all dishonest."  </P> <P> The council debate lasted into the evening and is to resume today. Council  members and observers said it is impossible to tell what provisions will  survive the amendment process.  </P> <P> The council barely touched on the most controversial provision -- publicly  financed campaigns.  </P> <P> In a move that gives the council far greater control over the commission, the  council voted to throw out the provision that automatically gives the new  ethics commission $1.5 million a year.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who offered the amendment, said the original proposal gives the  commission $1.5 million "whether they need it or not. . . . It is bad public  policy to guarantee a level of funding to any department."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said he could give the backers of the proposal -- including  Geoffrey Cowan, chairman of Bradley's commission -- his personal guarantee that  the commission would be adequately funded.  </P> <P> Cowan said Wednesday that council control over the budget "compromises" the  independence of the commission.  </P> <P> "Some provisions that we thought were important are not in the document as it's  emerged today," Cowan said when the session ended. "Whether those are . . .  fatal flaws is something we've got to give some thought to."  </P> <P> The package before the council is a compromise worked out by Cowan and Woo,  chairman of the council's Ad Hoc Ethics Committee. Cowan said last week that if  the compromise emerges from the council substantially intact, there will be no  citizens initiative on the June ballot that would encompass all the  recommendations of Cowan's commission.  </P> <P> In passing its own ethics reforms, the council is attempting to head off an  initiative.  </P> <P> In a brief address to the council Wednesday, Bradley urged passage of the  proposal without amendment.  </P></p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The surprise reduction in UK interest rates brought a turnround in a declining futures market on a day that once again saw strong volume in the traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. The early strength of the cash market failed to inspire a dull futures sector, where the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened at 3,430, a 10-point discount to cash. The announcement on the cut in interest rates brought a bounce to the March future, which had fallen to the day's low of 3,425. Buyers returned immediately, sending the contract soaring to the day's peak of 3,480 just before lunch. However, a poor gilts sector undermined March, as did the tentative start on Wall Street, and the contract drifted lower for the rest of the session, finishing at 3,440, a 3-point discount to cash. Volume remained good, reaching 20,289 lots by the official close. Business in the traded options was again heavy, particularly in the index options. Total turnover was 63,915 contracts, of which 26,420 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 9,901 in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. In the stock options, British Gas led with 1,916 contracts traded, followed by Hanson at 1,896 lots and Lucas Industries at 1,560. HSBC, BTR and BT were also active. Business improved on the OMLX Mid 250 market and 762 futures contracts had been traded by the close.</p>

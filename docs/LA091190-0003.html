			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: LO, THE NAKED INDIAN  </P> <P> You remember Ruth Simmons. She was the painfully shy Colorado housewife who,  under hypnosis, broke into a wild Irish jig and announced in a rich brogue that  she was Bridey Murphy of 19th-Century Belfast.  </P> <P> You remember Al Martinez. He is the former Oakland person who, under hypnosis,  announced in his usual mumble that he was Yazoo, a naked Indian.  </P> <P> Actually, it isn't clear what I said, due to a hereditary inability to  articulate. Even when I am not under hypnosis, I seem to be saying my name is  Elmer Teenez or, in some cases, Omar Teemus.  </P> <P> At any rate, Bridey made quite a splash in 1952. It was the beginning of a  reincarnation fad. There was a Bridey Murphy book, a Bridey Murphy cocktail and  God knows how many come-as-you-were parties.  </P> <P> Except for scattered periods of interest thereafter, the fad went the way of  hot pants and the Nehru jacket. Until now.  </P> <P> The movie "Flatliners" has created new interest in the near-death experience  and, hence, in the afterlife generally, including reincarnation.  </P> <P> After mentioning it recently, I received telephone calls from those who had  either experienced near-death or had been regressed to a past life.  </P> <P> One person offered to send me tumbling back through time to my own earlier  existence. I couldn't resist the temptation. Float along as best you can.  </P> <P> Her name is Grace Coveney and she's an exorcist. Well, actually, while she did  rid a house of ghosts once, she's more of a general psychic than an exorcist,  with a specialty in past-life regression.  </P> <P> We met at her home in the Valley, where a lot of psychics seem to live, and she  hypnotized and led me back in time to my prior life.  </P> <P> This was accomplished by putting me through a psychic tunnel. A similar  technique was used in "Flatliners," at the end of which a kind of demonic  conscience symbol named Billy Mahoney (Joshua Rudoy) was waiting to beat hell  out of the character played by Kiefer Sutherland.  </P> <P> I met Joshua in person later. He's a decent young man of 14 who seems  disinclined to fly into anyone's face like a psychopathic cat, kicking and  yowling. But I still don't want him waiting at the end of my tunnel.  </P> <P> As it turned out, there was only Yazoo at the end, and . . . well, listen to a  snippet of tape made during my regression. Coveney is asking the questions:  </P> <P> Q. Who are you?  </P> <P> A. (Unintelligible.)  </P> <P> Q. What?  </P> <P> A. (Mumbled) Yazoo.  </P> <P> Q. Yalu?  </P> <P> A. (Louder) Yazoo!  </P> <P> Q. Where do you live, Yazoo?  </P> <P> A. Forest. Naked.  </P> <P> Q. You're naked in a forest? What are you doing?  </P> <P> A. Woman bathing. Naked.  </P> <P> Q. You're watching a naked woman bathe?  </P> <P> A. In river. (I make a yummy sound here.)  </P> <P> Q. What do you look like?  </P> <P> A. Brown. Muscles. Black hair. Naked.  </P> <P> Q. Yes, well, is there anyone else in the forest?  </P> <P> A. Animals.  </P> <P> Q. I see. How did you die?  </P> <P> A. Old. Naked.  </P> <P> Other than an apparent preoccupation with nudity, I seemed relatively normal.  Even my voice, though characteristically garbled, remained much as it is in my  . . . well . . . present life. I never fell into the me-Yazoo stage.  </P> <P> I realize my description as brown, muscled and black-haired could have made me,  say, a naked Puerto Rican, but subsequent questions established me firmly in  the Indian camp.  </P> <P> Later, I asked a psychologist with an expertise in hypnotherapy what he thought  of all this. His name is Michael Aharoni and he gave me a well-maybe answer.  </P> <P> He pointed out that people like Shirley MacLaine are firm believers in  reincarnation, while others are equally skeptical.  </P> <P> "I suppose it's possible we've had past lives," Aharoni says. "There's really  no proof either way, but you've got to wonder where something like Yazoo, the  naked Indian, comes from."  </P> <P> In the long run, he says, it doesn't really matter where it originates, from  memory or imagination, because it's all useful in making our lives somehow  better.  </P> <P> Mine is better already. When asked in my Yazoo state about the "other side," I  found it serene with perfect weather and a little dull. Kind of like San Diego.  </P> <P> The one disadvantage to the hereafter, according to Yazoo, is you have to live  off the land. I'm thinking of taking a rifle, a portable barbecue and some A-1  Sauce when I go. Indian or not, I don't eat raw meat.  </P></p>

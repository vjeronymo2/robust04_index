			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Back to basics, Tokyo-style: The defeat of reform proposals may herald a return to traditional Japanese coalition politics Yesterday's fiasco in the Japanese parliament marks a retreat from the experiment that Japan embarked on last summer, when voters elected a government dedicated to shaking up the political system. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the seven-party coalition which five months ago ended 38 years of government by the Liberal Democratic party, was until yesterday afternoon making decisive progress in his campaign to remove the old, corrupt structures of Japanese politics. The surprise defeat at the final parliamentary hurdle of his plans to overhaul the political system, means the changes will be watered down and the balance of power will shift away from the coalition and back towards the LDP. Mr Hosokawa's survival now depends on his ability to strike a deal with his LDP enemies - who also happen to be former colleagues - on the plans to curb political funding and scrap Japan's unique and scandal-prone system of multi-seat constituencies. His biggest coalition partner, the Social Democratic party, accidental architect of yesterday's setback, can no longer be relied upon and is unlikely to tolerate a deal with its arch-enemies in the LDP. The socialists are, in any case, on the point of collapse after yesterday's humiliating defection of 17 members, who crossed the floor to vote against the government because they feared the proposed new electoral system would spell the end of their party. At the very least, the 17 defectors will be expelled from the party. On top of this, the socialists' leader, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, hinted he may resign. 'The party's responsibility is grave,' he said, in what must seemed to many like an ironic understatement. Now that the socialists have proved a real liability, the parliamentary majority of Mr Hosokawa's centre-right coalition is threatened and he needs to find new allies. It is unclear what kind of grouping will succeed Mr Hosokawa's alliance to face a general election likely in the next few months. But political observers believe it will resemble the LDP - itself a coalition of factions - if not be controlled by it. It is also likely to include Mr Hosokawa. His straight-talking style and authoritative air as scion of a famous Samurai family, has earned him a 60 per cent rating in recent polls - a valuable electoral asset at a time when the image of his profession is otherwise battered. Mr Hosokawa is not the only one to have lost a big gamble. Yesterday was a setback for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the 'shadow shogun' of the coalition, whose departure from the LDP last summer helped precipitate its downfall. He has been working ever since to destroy his old party as part of his strategy to build a new power base. Japan's political experiment has thus moved back more or less to where it started, just at the moment when it was poised to achieve results. Japanese television viewers could be forgiven for disbelieving their ears yesterday evening when the NHK public network interrupted the final minutes of the new year national sumo tournament to broadcast a press conference by a stern-faced Mr Hosokawa. Everyone knew the upper house vote would be close, but few had predicted that Mr Hosokawa's plans would fare so badly, given that the lower house - the more powerful of the two chambers - gave its blessing two months ago. Even the LDP was surprised by the size of the margin - 130 votes against 118. 'This was completely unexpected. The coalition thought it could do everything by sheer weight of numbers and by force. That is not the usual procedure. That is why it had a revolt,' said Mr Kaoru Yosano, an LDP member of parliament. Mr Hosokawa has vowed to battle on, to try to negotiate some kind of reform with the LDP in the few days left before the parliamentary session closes on January 29. If he fails to pull off a deal by then, his government will fall, along with its reform plans. The LDP will drive a hard bargain. 'There is strong opposition in the party to even discussing a compromise. We have been shamed publicly too many times,' said Mr Yosano. At the same time, the LDP leadership does not want to damage the party's already weak public popularity by killing reform entirely. 'I strongly feel we must do something to regain people's trust,' said Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP president. Mr Hosokawa said yesterday his next step would be to set up a joint panel of the upper and lower houses, with 10 members from each chamber, to hammer out a compromise. Under article 59 of the constitution, the panel needs a two-thirds majority for an accord and then to pass the revised plans to both chambers for approval by simple majority. Mr Hosokawa's chances of doing all this by the end-of-the-month deadline are slim. If he fails, he would face the choice of disbanding the cabinet, possibly with a view to re-forming it with LDP help, or calling an election. With Mr Hosokawa still keen to push ahead with reform, and neither side keen on an election, the government is in no position to refuse the LDP's terms. 'The coalition is ready to accept all revisions of the package earlier proposed by the LDP to prevent further confusion,' said Mr Yuichi Ichikawa, a close ally of Mr Ozawa and secretary-general of the Clean Government party, an influential group in the ruling coalition. Negotiations will centre on the coalition's plan to reduce the size of the lower house from the present 511 seats to 500, of which 274 would be elected from single-seat districts and 226 by proportional representation. The aim is to reduce the temptation for politicians to shower voters with cash and favours - such as unnecessary motorways and bridges - to win votes, and to increase the scope for competing on the quality of policy ideas. Under the plan donations to individual politicians would be banned (although donations to political parties would be permitted); the plan also proposes a Y30.9bn a year public subsidy for parties. Officially, the LDP leadership supports the general principle of scrapping multi-seat constituencies, though some of its older members privately fear that they will lose seats, some of which are dependent on generations of careful local patronage. The main changes sought by the LDP will be to increase the number of single-seat constituencies, to divide the proposed single national proportional representation district into several regional constituencies, and to allow political donations to individual politicians. Crucially, these changes would improve the LDP's chances of winning the next election, because they suit a large party with efficient and rich local organisa-tions. Mr Hosokawa's future is uncertain and dependent on his success in the frenetic bargaining in the weeks to come. However if, as seems likely, the LDP manages to impose its will on the reform plans, Japan looks set to revert to something like its traditional form of government - a broad coalition of centre-right groups - but under a different political system.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COUNTDOWN TO REFORM  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Jun 18:       Liberal Democratic party government of prime minister               Kiichi Miyazawa fails to survive no confidence vote.

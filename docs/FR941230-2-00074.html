Most distilled spirits sold within the Virgin Islands are imported from outside of the Virgin Islands. The imported distilled spirits are transported to the Virgin Islands mainly in container ships. A few brands of distilled spirits are produced within the Virgin Islands. Wholesalers like Topa purchase distilled spirits from suppliers, store them in warehouses and sell them to retailers who in turn sell to consumers in retail outlets. Every wholesaler and retailer must be licensed by the Virgin Islands government. Under Virgin Islands law, a wholesaler must obtain a license for distilled spirits wholesaling and is prohibited from retailing such products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALESA GROUP NAMES 13 FOR TALKS WITH WARSAW  </P> <P> A citizens group organized by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa nominated 13 people  Saturday to be on a negotiating team for historic reconciliation talks with the  government beginning Monday.  </P> <P> The 128-member citizens committee, created Dec. 18 as a link between Solidarity  and the communist government, also suggested nine subject areas for discussion  at the talks, with the re-legalization of the banned Solidarity union heading  the list.  </P> <P> Fifteen commissions of the citizens group have been meeting to formulate a plan  of action for the talks aimed at working out social, economic and political  reforms in a country facing a staggering $38-billion foreign debt, obsolete and  inefficient industry and rampant inflation.  </P> <P> The 13 nominations submitted Saturday must be approved today by the  policy-making Solidarity National Commission, which will name Solidarity's  representatives to the unprecedented talks.  </P> <P> Besides Walesa, they are expected to include Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik, both  of whom had been initially rejected by the government.  </P> <P> In the talks, 57 people, among them about 25 from opposition groups, including  Solidarity, will sit down together Monday with representatives of the  government, the Communist Party and the Roman Catholic Church.  </P> <P> Both the government and Solidarity have said they recognize that a plan of  action must be worked out to avoid more industrial unrest, or even worse.  </P></p>

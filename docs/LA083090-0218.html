			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET: THEATER;  </P> <P> 'INTO THE WOODS'  </P> <P> Stephen Sondheim's fairy tale musical, "Into The Woods," will be performed  today through Sept. 9 at the Moonlight Amphitheatre in Vista's Brengle Terrace  Park.  </P> <P> The run marks the first in the San Diego area since the play's preview at the  Old Globe Theatre in 1986.  </P> <P> "Into the Woods," based on the book by James Lapine, weaves the stories of 15  characters into a single, multi-sided tale that tells what happens after the  characters' "happily ever after" endings.  </P> <P> Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Rapunzel and the  Baker and his Wife are brought to life in the musical setting. Their wishes  fulfilled, they find that getting what they wanted is not all it's cracked up  to be, and they find they were sometimes impelled to lie and steal, blame  others and make dubious moral decisions. They even consider sacrificing Jack to  a vengeful giant to make things right again.  </P> <P> The musical is directed by Gary Krinke and choreographed by Ray Limon.  </P> <P> What: "Into The Woods"  </P> <P> Where: Moonlight Amphitheatre, Brengle Terrace Park, 1200 Vale Terrace Drive,  Vista.  </P> <P> When: Gates open at 6:30 p.m. for pre-show picnicking. Show begins at 7:30.  </P> <P> Cost: Picnic-style seating is $10 for adults and $6 for children 16 and  younger.  </P> <P> Call: 724-2110.  </P></p>

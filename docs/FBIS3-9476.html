			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- This evening the  assembly of the Srpska republic (RS) adopted a platform on the  future activities of the RS delegation at the peace talks, in  which it stressed that the RS could not join the Croat-Muslim  Federation because no conditions existed for a joint state.    The platform stresses that the RS is asking the  international  community -- before any peace talks take place -- to meet its  obligations toward Serbs regarding the suspension, i.e.,  abolition of sanctions.    The RS sees the Croat-Muslim Federation agreement and the  agreement on a confederation with Croatia as the realization of  the rights of these two nations to freely decide on their  political and state status. At the same time, the Assembly  maintains that the creation of a new federation and its entering  into a confederation with Croatia means a formal and legal  suspension of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    By not being included in the talks, the RS has in fact been  recognized as a state entity. The RS cannot join the  Croat-Muslim Federation because conditions do not exist for a  joint state, the platform stresses.    Since the new Croat-Muslim state can engage in hostile  activities against the RS, the RS must -- in the interest of  lasting peace and stability in the region -- secure just and  defendable borders that will encompass Serb ethnic areas, the  platform says, adding that when conditions for the continuation  of talks are created the RS will maintain a stand that the  negotiating process be conducted in stages.    The first stage is to conclude peace and freeze all military  activities without prejudging territorial solutions or the  nature of future interstate ties.    This would be followed by demarcation and the final  establishment of borders between the Croat-Muslim Federation and  the Srpska republic, and the recognition of the sovereignty and  independence of the Srpska republic.    Talks on mutual relations between these states, together  with  the review of possibilities for the establishment of different  ties between the newly created and former Yugoslav republics,  would be the last stage.    The resolution of the crisis, it was said, should be guided  by scientifically established facts about the Serbs, Croats,  Muslims, and their territories, as well as by international  documents on the creation of Yugoslavia.    The platform also proposes an alternative order of stages,  as  recognized by the international community -- including the  United States -- when Yugoslavia was founded in 1919 [sentence  as received].    In the first stage, apart from the already recognized Croat-  Muslim Federation, the international community should also  recognize the Srpska republic and leave territorial questions  for some later date.    The second stage would be to resolve territorial issues  peacefully, while the third would be to examine possible ties  between the states.</p>

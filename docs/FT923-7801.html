			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: LTV bankruptcy moves step closer to resolution ONE OF the most complex and fractious US bankruptcies moved a step closer to resolution, after a Manhattan judge gave LTV Corporation, the large steel company, permission to sell its missile and aircraft divisions for Dollars 475m late on Thursday. The buyer of the LTV businesses is a group comprising Loral Corporation, Northrop and Carlyle Group, an investment banking firm. Loral will take over the missile unit for Dollars 261m and Northrop/Carlyle will buy the aircraft operations for Dollars 214m. This bid, of which Dollars 450m is in cash and Dollars 25m in preferred stock, topped a Dollars 440m rival offer from Martin Marietta. Under the terms, the Loral group could be liable for a Dollars 100m payment if it fails to close the transaction, while Martin Marietta gets a Dollars 5m fee, in return for releasing LTV from its earlier pledge to accept its bid. The bankruptcy judge acknowledged the role Martin Marietta had played in the sale process, but declined to approve a Dollars 10m fee, suggesting Dollars 5m instead. The sale is probably one of the last dramas in the LTV bankruptcy, which has run for over five years. The company devised a reorganisation plan earlier this year which is likely to win creditor approval, but the sale of these businesses was a prerequisite to its adoption. If the reorganisation scheme goes ahead, LTV would emerge from bankruptcy as the nation's third largest steel maker and a major supplier of oilfield equipment.</p>

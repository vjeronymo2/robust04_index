			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Liquid assets Liquid assets: The Queen Mary II, a steamship used as a bar and restaurant in London, is for sale at Pounds 2m. The steamship, the last turbine-steamer on the Clyde, was called the Queen Mary in 1933. Two years later the shipbuilder was persuaded, by Buckingham Palace it is said, to amend the name since Cunard wanted to launch the liner of that title.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, July 8 (CNA) -- Lin Yang-kang, the ROC  [Republic of China] presidential hopeful, said on Wednesday [8  June] that he will resign his post as president of the judicial  yuan within a week.    Lin made the remark after the close of the regular meeting  of  the Kuomintang's decision-making Central Standing Committee, of  which he is a member.    Lin, who has been at his present post for eight years, said  he will tender his resignation in person to President Li  Teng-hui, but he added that the time for the meeting has not  been fixed.    The planned retirement is generally seen as the beginning of  his campaign to be the next Republic of China [ROC] president.  The presidential election is due in 1996.</p>

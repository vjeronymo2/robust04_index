			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORUM ON DRUGS GIVES CRANSTON RELIEF FROM LINCOLN S&amp;L QUERIES;  </P> <P> POLITICS: NARCOTICS AND GANGS DOMINATE PANEL DISCUSSION IN NORWALK. COLLAPSE OF  THE THRIFT INSTITUTION DOESN'T COME UP.  </P> <P> The pundits say he's finished and the pollsters say he's plummeting, but what  about the man on the street?  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, beleaguered by his entanglement in the Lincoln Savings  &amp; Loan debacle, held a community forum in Norwalk on Saturday and guess  which subject never came up?  </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> "I don't think this is the appropriate place for that," said Marsha Reed of  Downey. "And I'm glad it didn't come up."  </P> <P> That was the reaction of some others in the meeting, which was attended by  about 100 people in Norwalk City Council chambers.  </P> <P> "I'm here to get better informed on all issues," said Bill Vane of Norwalk.  </P> <P> What they all wanted to talk about was the topic Cranston himself had chosen:  drugs.  </P> <P> And although Cranston could control the first hour of the discussion and keep  it off the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, he was an easy target for  any questions on the matter during the last half hour, when those in the  audience got their chance to speak.  </P> <P> But that segment reflected the earlier one. In fact, what the senator witnessed  was riveting, often emotional, testimony from civic leaders and average  citizens who are determined to take their communities back from the gangs and  drug dealers.  </P> <P> "We need for more people in our community to get involved," said Richard Rios,  a member of the panel that assisted Cranston. "People assume that somebody else  will take care of the problem until suddenly it is on their doorstep."  </P> <P> He and others said they were impressed that a U.S. senator would spend his  Saturday morning with them.  </P> <P> A teen-age girl who is finally drug free after five hellish years pleaded to  the adults present, "Get involved with your kids!"  </P> <P> And Lee Baca, area commander for the Sheriff's Department, told the senator  that Los Angeles County has become "the gang capital of the nation" because  parents are not supervising their children.  </P> <P> Cranston, who raised two sons, nodded in agreement.  </P> <P> The senator seemed elated at the way the forum went. He scribbled notes,  applauded after some of the testimony and asked numerous questions himself.  </P> <P> For longtime Cranston-watchers, this was the signal that no matter how rough it  gets for the senator in the Lincoln Savings matter, he will stick to his  determination to run for a fifth term in 1992.  </P> <P> Although he began holding community forums after going to the Senate in 1969,  he did not seriously turn to them until January, 1985. Preparing to run for  reelection to the Senate in 1986, Cranston was considered extremely vulnerable  because of his failed presidential campaign in 1984.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Cranston began to show up everywhere in California, soliciting the  opinions of voters on major issues and using his clout to make civic leaders  and experts available at the forums.  </P> <P> But can a heavy schedule of forums over the next three years help Cranston  reverse his sagging prospects? Political professionals think it will be a tall  order.  </P> <P> Some Californians who testified in Congress recently blamed Cranston personally  for money they lost by investing in uninsured junk bonds that were sold by  Lincoln Savings out of its branch offices.  </P> <P> Almost overnight, Cranston's job rating plunged and even Democratic voters told  pollsters they thought he should resign his seat or at the least not seek  another term.  </P> <P> Cranston was one of five senators who met with federal regulators investigating  certain practices of Lincoln Savings. The senators did so at the request of  Lincoln Savings President Charles H. Keating, from whom they had received  contributions.  </P> <P> Cranston insists he was simply trying to force action on a matter that had  dragged on for years.  </P> <P> But with the issue not even arising in Saturday's forum, and with some of those  present professing little interest in it, Cranston may know something the  pundits don't.  </P> <P> Eve Nelson of Norwalk said the Lincoln Savings issue was "one of the factors  we'll have to consider when we vote (in 1992) but it isn't the only one. You  have to look at everything Cranston's done or not done."  </P></p>

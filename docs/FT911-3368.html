			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Of hard hats and brownie points - A government/commerce approach to road safety When Malcolm Rifkind, the UK's transport minister, launched a campaign this week aimed at improving safety for child cyclists, Halfords basked in the glow of its public-spiritedness. The motor accessories retailer is one of several companies to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Department of Transport to enhance their corporate image by helping to promote road safety. This year the DoT is raising the amount spent on road safety publicity from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 6m. Since last year, campaigns on subjects ranging from drink-driving to aircraft security have all come under the Safety on the Move umbrella. An important element is the initiative on child safety which concentrates on two big campaigns a year. The first of these last autumn featured Texaco's 'Children should be seen and not hurt' campaign. For the companies involved, the return on their investment - which typically includes disseminating literature and providing equipment at cost - cannot be measured in terms of profit on the promoted item promoted. It could, however, be argued that the products resemble loss leaders and win it more customers. Instead, they count on a boost to their image. 'We get the benefit of being associated with a government campaign. We are seen to be responsible retailers,' says Hugh Birley, a spokesman for Halfords. The DoT is not shy in extracting some benefit for consumers in return for the companies' public earning of brownie points. In Halfords' case it suggested that the retailer might supply helmets for child cyclists at a more accessible price than the usual Pounds 23 to Pounds 24. For the offer period, the helmet will be sold for Pounds 14.99, the wholesale price. There are, however, limits to the closeness of the relationship between government and the commercial concern. The department is keen to dispell any impression that it is using taxpayers' money to help a company's advertising campaign. No product is endorsed - 'we don't say buy this or buy that' - nor are there any exclusive arrangements. For instance, Mothercare and Elastoplast are also involved in the child cyclist campaign. Because of the delicacy of the relationship, Miller &amp; Leeves WAHT, the advertising agency used by the DoT, is careful which companies are invited to take part. Peter Jones, the director responsible, says: 'Part of our remit is to find companies interested in the marketing of road safety.' One company Jones describes as having a suitable track record is Kwik-Fit, the tyre and exhaust company. It is contributing to publicity about new legislation which, from July 1, will make it compulsory for adult back-seat car passengers to wear safety belts. The law applying to children came into force in 1989, when Kwik-Fit mounted its original 'Belt up in the Back' campaign. Peter Holmes, marketing director of the Edinburgh-based company, says it first ventured into the safety area in 1987 when it launched its offer to fit toddler safety seats for Pounds 34.90, with the promise to take back the seat and refund the money once the child had reached the age of four. The rear seat-belt legislation, however, can only go so far; it can only be enforced if the belts are already fitted and the DoT estimates that a third of the UK's 19m cars do not have them. Part of Kwik-Fit's role will be to offer a fitting service.</p>

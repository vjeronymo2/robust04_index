			<p>BFN     [Text] We have already talked about the Crimean situation a  few times today and now we have our correspondent in Simferopol  Vladimir Plotnikov on the line to the Mayak studio. Hello,  Vladimir, we're listening to you.    [Plotnikov] Good afternoon. There really is a lot to say on  the subject of Crimea, and Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the  Crimean Supreme Soviet, has just finished a news conference in  Simferopol. I'm sure that you'll get more information about that  later, but I'll tell you now what the gist of it was.    Well, first of all, he was saying that the situation is  tense; listeners already will know that, though media reports  are very contradictory. According to Sergey Tsekov himself, the  situation is tense but under control. There are no public  disorders whatsoever, and the resorts are functioning normally.  The weather's great, too.    The session of Crimea's Supreme Soviet went on today. One  way or another, the deputies touched on future relations between  Simferopol and Kiev and, as Sergey Tsekov said, they will  develop on the basis of talks and, first off, on the basis of  legality. A delegation of the Crimean Supreme Soviet has been  formed for talks on the problems in Crimeo-Ukrainian relations.  But it would be best if such a meeting was held in Crimea.  That would enable the situation to be examined more deeply on  the spot.    The main point at the talks will be the economic question. A  telephone conversation has taken place between the presidents of  Ukraine and Crimea, but Sergey Tsekov was unable to reveal any  of its contents. The Crimean Supreme Soviet has still to  receive any signals from Moscow either on the reaction of the  Russian State Duma to Crimean events.    The Ukrainian defense and interior ministries are continuing  to shuffle leading officials and deploy troops in Crimea without  consultaion with the leadership of the autonomous republic.  They are thus ignoring the law on delegation of  responsibilities between Crimea and Ukraine.    A picket in support of the Crimean president and Supreme  Soviet and the 6 May constitution is still outside the Crimean  Supreme Soviet building, but there are less people on the square  now and the cossacks have disappeared. On the whole, a pause  has settled over the war of decrees and in the relations between  Crimea and Ukraine. Clearly, a sort of status quo is emerging  before the start of the talks. The talks may be held in about  10 days' time.</p>

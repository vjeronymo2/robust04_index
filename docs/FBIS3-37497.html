			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We have just received by fax a Russian Foreign  Ministry statement. It says:    In recent days Russia has made additional efforts to give  effect to its initiative on getting the blockade of Sarajevo  removed and having the city handed over to the control of the  UN. That initiative was put forward back at the 47th session of  the General Assembly. We have been striving to implement this  initiative by acting openly within the framework of Security  Council resolutions.    This line is being continued by us also at the present time  despite the grave exacerbation of the situation around Sarajevo  for well-known reasons.    As a result of the steps undertaken by the Russian  leadership  and intense diplomatic work, this sustained and consistent line  which rules out unilateral ultimatums has borne fruit.    In response to our appeal, the Bosnian Serbs at their  assembly in Pale have taken a decision to withdraw their heavy  armaments from the vicinity of Sarajevo.    We consider that this display of goodwill by one of the  warring sides at a critical moment for a settlement will produce  equally specific steps in return.    We call on the Bosnia Government without delay to place all  its heavy armaments in the vicinity of Sarajevo under the  control of the UN forces in accordance with the secretary  general's plan, which he proposed in his letter of 10 February  to the Security Council.    We also call on our partners in a Bosnian settlement,  primarily the United States and the countries of the European  Union, in the spirit of their statements on a preference for a  political solution to the problem, to bring the necessary  influence to bear on the Bosnian Government in order that it  should cooperate with the UN as regards the total lifting of the  siege of Sarajevo and its demilitarization.    At this crucial moment, it is extremely important to exclude  the likelihood of any provocations and sabotage of this peace  process. On this depends the fate not only of Sarajevo, but of  the whole Bosnian settlement as well.    Once the siege of Sarajevo is lifted, the UN Security  Council  could, as we have suggested, proceed, as a matter of urgency, to  examine ways of establishing a UN administrative directorate in  the city, and also to examine measures to reinforce other  dangerous areas on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Increasing its concrete contribution towards ensuring a turn  towards peace, Russia is ready to send a part of its military  contingent, which is within the UN forces, to ensure  verification of the implementation of the understandings on the  lifting of the Sarajevo siege.</p>

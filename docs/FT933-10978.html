			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The Long View: Not so well-endowed WHY ON earth would you sign a savings contract at the same time you are borrowing money? It sounds like a contradiction in terms; yet, about 70 per cent of British homebuyers do this when they take out a mortgage. In most cases, they combine the loan with an endowment policy, a long-term savings contract provided by life companies. These endowment mortgages have been threatened several times already in the past 10 years, for instance by the withdrawal of tax relief on life premiums in 1984 and, more recently, by cuts in bonuses on endowment contracts. Now, they face their biggest and perhaps toughest challenge: the Treasury has decreed that banks and building societies must make a 'hard' disclosure to customers of the cash commissions they earn on these plans. Once, endowment mortgages made very good sense for those able to pay a little bit more each month. Maturing 25-year with-profits plans have proved extremely profitable, earning about 12.5 per cent a year compared with average inflation of 9 per cent. But the attraction has been eroded seriously. The endowment mortgage today reflects mainly a marketing, rather than an investment, opportunity: when Mr Prospect ventures into a mortgage office, he is uniquely open to sales patter based on the premise that an endowment mortgage is 'normal' and he should have one, too. What is the theory behind the endowment mortgage? It is all a matter of a comparison with a repayment mortgage, which is designed to repay the loan through level monthly instalments. At the beginning, the instalments consist almost entirely of interest, with only small amounts repaid; by the end of the term, the reverse is true. Under this structure, the monthly amounts channelled into repaying the principal are, effectively, earning interest at the mortgage rate. But suppose, instead, that they were invested separately at a higher rate; you would be better off than before. And if the margin were good enough, you could accumulate enough over, say, 25 years to repay the original loan in one lump at maturity, perhaps leaving a surplus. In the 1960s, these sums worked out extremely well. The mortgage rate was held artificially low by building societycartel arrangements (at about 7 per cent) and there was unlimited income tax relief on interest, with a standard rate of 30 per cent and higher rates of anything up to 75 per cent. On the savings side, life premiums received a subsidy of half the standard rate of income tax. The money could be invested prudently in gilts or company loan stocks earning 2 or 3 percentage points over the typical mortgage rate. By the 1970s, inflation was posing a threat to real returns on the savings side although this was more than offset by the negative real cost of mortgage interest (which in 1975 was about minus 20 per cent). There was a gap of up to 8 percentage points between the long gilt yield and the net-of-tax mortgage rate. Endowment mortgage plans began to accumulate big profits. Then came Thatcherism, and deregulation. In the 1980s, the mortgage rate shot up and gilt yields fell. The impact of the Pounds 25,000 loan limit for mortgage interest tax relief, imposed in 1974 and increased to only Pounds 30,000 in 1983, began to become more serious as house prices surged upwards (today's average new mortgage is nearly Pounds 50,000). Life companies shifted their investment strategy and turned to equities to provide the high returns essential to pay the required bonuses. Riskier assumptions were made. Endowment mortgages thereby ceased to represent a sensible exploitation of a reasonably predictable interest differential and, instead, became a stock market speculation. For several years, the gamble paid off. But a warning of how it could all go wrong came with the notorious home income schemes, which were back-to-front endowment mortgages sold in the 1980s. Pensioners would take out loans secured on their houses and put part of the proceeds into investment bonds, which would repay the interest and debt out of stock dividends and capital gains. But loan rates soared and the stock market crashed in 1987. Thousands of pensioners now dread eviction. The consequences for endowment mortgagees will not be quite so dire: the worst likely to happen is that they will be asked to raise the monthly payments into their endowments. The increases might be substantial in relation to the endowment premiums alone but, compared with the total outgoings including interest, they should only be modest. All the same, it is highly unsatisfactory that buyers have paid large commissions for being put into contracts which may prove of doubtful value. Meanwhile, the arithmetic of endowment mortgages continues to get worse. From next April, the maximum monthly tax relief on mortgage interest will shrivel to about Pounds 40 a borrower (relief at 20 per cent on a Pounds 30,000 loan). The gap between the mortgage rate and the long gilt yield is just about nil, and stock market returns have become more uncertain. Another way of looking at the whole question is to take account of the role of inflation in eroding mortgage debt. If you took out a 25-year, Pounds 20,000 loan in 1968 - a very large sum in those days - it will now seem very small at maturity because it is the equivalent of only Pounds 2,340 in 1968 money. It has been easy to accumulate that modest real sum in a parallel savings plan. But if future inflation is only 2 or 3 per cent, instead of 9 per cent, your savings will have to work much harder. Hard commission disclosure will provide a good opportunity for banks and building societies to look again at the viability of endowment mortgages. But it would be more encouraging if the interests of the customers, rather than regulatory embarrassment, were to trigger the re-think. Another blow for endowments? - Page IV</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Trident poised for Ukraine TV franchise Trident Television, a privately-owned UK company operating in Ukraine, is about to purchase a 25-year franchise for one of the two national television channels in Ukraine from the state television company. If the deal goes through, it will be one of the first of its kind in the former Soviet Union and give Trident a leading position in Ukraine's growing and largely untapped advertising market. Mr Andy Bain, managing director of Trident, expects the company's initial investment to be between Dollars 12m and Dollars 15m. The investment is to be made in the form of equipment and improvements to the transmission facilities of Derzhteleradio, the Ukrainian state television company. 'Certain assets in this country are selling for pennies on the dollar and we are getting one of them,' Mr Bain said. Trident, which is raising funds for the investment through a private offering, hopes to purchase the right to broadcast and sell advertising for 16.5 hours a day, seven days a week on Ukraine's Channel Three. Under the contract, Derzhteleradio will receive part of the advertising revenue as its licensing fee and will retain ownership of the transmission facilities. Derzhteleradio will continue to exercise full control over the news and political content of the channel. The state television company is subject to strong political control from the government. Mr Bain believes that part of the reason Kiev is selling the channel so cheaply is to create a popular, Ukrainian language alternative to Ostankino, the Moscow-based channel that broadcasts throughout the former Soviet Union. Ukrainian government officials regularly accuse Ostankino of politically biased reporting, but Ukraine's home-grown, provincial television channels are no match for the slick Russian station. Trident, which hopes to go on air next year, could change that, by offering in the Ukrainian language a mix of sitcoms, game shows, movies, and serials imported from the west and US-style programming produced in Ukraine. Mr Bain is confident that Ukraine's booming advertising market will allow Trident rapidly to recoup its investment.</p>

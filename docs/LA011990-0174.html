			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 9 CHARGED AS MURDERERS OF JESUIT PRIESTS;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: THREE ARMY OFFICERS AND 5 ENLISTED MEN ARE ORDERED HELD FOR TRIAL.  THE NINTH IS A FUGITIVE.  </P> <P> An army colonel, three lieutenants and five enlisted men were charged with  murder today in the November slayings of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper  and her teen-age daughter.  </P> <P> Judge Ricardo Zamora of the 4th Penal Court ordered the eight defendants in  custody held for trial on charges of murder with "premeditation and perfidy,"  which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years, according to court secretary  Nicolas Hernandez.  </P> <P> The ninth suspect deserted from the army in December and is a fugitive.  </P> <P> Zamora issued his ruling at the end of a 72-hour deadline that began Tuesday  when the prisoners, who have been under arrest since early January, were put at  the disposition of the court.  </P> <P> The ruling means there is enough evidence to make a case against the  defendants. The ruling begins a 120-day period during which the case is  prepared for trial, but this investigation phase can be delayed by motions.  </P> <P> Col. Guillermo Benavides, director of the Military College, is the  highest-ranking armed forces officer to be accused of a crime involving human  rights abuse in the 10-year-old civil war against leftist guerrillas.  </P> <P> The slain Jesuits were educators at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American  University, one of the region's top colleges.  </P> <P> The killings shocked El Salvador and the world and prompted calls in the  Congress for reappraisal of the $1.5 million a day that Washington supplies in  U.S. economic and military aid to this small Central American nation.  </P> <P> No military officer has been convicted before of a crime linked to human rights  abuses, even though rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated by the armed  forces killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> The Jesuits and the two women were slain in their campus home Nov. 16, five  days after the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas launched  their biggest offensive of the war.  </P> <P> The far right had long accused the Jesuits of being subversive ideologues  because they publicly argued that the civil war was the result of gross social  injustice rather than a Communist attempt to seize power.  </P></p>

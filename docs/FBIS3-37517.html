The data from the Economy Ministry reveals that the now  regular nonpayments crisis in industry began in September 1993  and the situation particularly exacerbated in December. As a  result, production in December fell by 14 percent and the latest  data shows it reached 43 percent in January 1994. The steps  taken by the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] and the government  in January and February 1994 to combat the nonpayments crisis,  such as extending stabilization credit to the amount of 5.4  trillion karbovantsi and repayable financial assistance to the  amount of 5.5 trillion karbovantsi, have so far not made the  situation change for the better.    Economy Minister Roman Shpek announced at the Cabinet of  Ministers sitting that various data pointed to the nonpayment by  Ukrainian enterprises of 40 to 80 trillion karbovantsi, which  caused industry to become uncontrollable. Roman Shpek demanded  that the real causes of the nonpayments crisis should be  established, thus making the secret become common knowledge.  Both the plan and the budget, in the economy minister's view,  should be revised. "Let us not pretend that the differences in  the policies of the Economy Ministry, Finance Ministry, and the  National Bank will somehow pass. Otherwise, no decisions will be  taken."    Asked by the Ukrainian president whether the fall in  inflation in January to 19 percent meant the government was  winning, Roman Shpek answered in the positive but pointed out  that this was "a victory over the people, pensioners, and the  economy." The economy minister predicted that the consequence  of this victory would be large emission which would push Ukraine  "towards an unprepared monetary reform."    Before a speech by National Bank of Ukraine Chairman Viktor  Yushchenko, a representative of PivdenMash [Southern Machine  Building] production association said he could not understand  how a situation was possible when "ministers cannot agree" and  when the president should exercise strict control over the NBU.    In his speech, Viktor Yushchenko stressed that the  nonpayments crisis "is not resolved by the amount of money  available for enterprises but is a reflection of the economic  crisis." Yushchenko's data shows that two to four trillion  karbovantsi per month are at present not being exchanged for  goods. As of 1 February alone, over 16 trillion karbovantsi in  circulation "did not return." Viktor Yushchenko said there were  different views on ways out of the crisis, rather than  antagonism in relations between the National Bank, Finance  Ministry, and Economy Ministry. Viktor Yushchenko called for  consolidation in support of anti-inflation measures. Yushchenko  added that "50 percent of price rises in May this year [as  received] are the result of the emission that already is there."    Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy remarked  that "all Yushchenko [National Bank of Ukraine chairman] is  doing is inciting Ukraine and harming the policy of the Cabinet  of Ministers."    Vice Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk also accused the NBU  leadership of "subversive economic activities." Landyk spoke  categorically against "flirting" with the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.    Finance Minister Heorhiy Pyatachenko stated that "we have  successfully ruined the old financial system without having  created a new one." Pyatachenko noted that credit resources  were not being returned. The finance minister joined in the  criticism of the National Bank and pointed out that the NBU "was  not taking account of anyone's views."    Supreme Council of Ukraine [Budget &amp; Planning] Standing  Committee Chairman Andriy Pecherov proposed to restrict "the  influence of foreign economies." Pecherov spoke in favor of  state regulation of the economy and called for "the introduction  of an economic state of emergency."    The Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the  leaders of which had been invited to this sitting, had on the  previous day submitted for examination by the government its  proposals regarding resolving the non-payments crisis. The  Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is demanding  in particular that an interbank offsetting of bills be  conducted. In accordance with its results bankrupt enterprises  will be determined, and it will be necessary to urgently begin  clearing up [sanatsiya] inefficient enterprises with these  bankrupt enterprises.    It is also proposed that the government appeals to Ukraine's  Supreme Council, which will continue plenary sittings on 22  February, so that the limit of primary emission for the first  quarter of 1994 be confirmed at 50 trillion karbovantsi. The  Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is also  demanding that draft basic directions of monetary and credit  policy in 1994 be submitted for examination by Ukraine's Supreme  Council. The Cabinet of Ministers sitting continued after lunch.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The first supply convoy arrived to Kabul today from  Shir Khan Bandar.    A source in the 20th Jehadi Division of Baghlan Province  reported to Bakhtar Information Agency that Shir Khan  Bandar-Kabul supply route has been repaired and was opened to  traffic through (Kotel-e Murgh). Esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud; and  Esteemed Abdul Hay Haqjo, commander of the 20th Jehadi Division  of Baghlan Province, accompanied by the high ranking  representatives of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, watched the  process of arrival of the supply convoy and transport vehicles  which arrived from Shir Khan Bandar to Kabul and travelled from  Kabul to Shir Khan Bandar via (Kotel-e Murgh).    Sayed Abdul Motaleb, official in charge of the repair and  construction of this road said that the repair and construction  of this road began two months ago with the cooperation of the  government officials and the Muslim people of Andarab and  (Neharin) districts and was completed recently. It is now  opened to traffic with this first supply convoy to pass through.    A correspondent of Bakhtar Information Agency adds that the  oppositions of the Islamic State of Afghanistan who are the  enemies of our land and Muslim people, were using the economic  blockade of Kabul city as a strong propaganda tool. The opening  of the road between Kabul and Shir Khan Bandar, which connects  Afghanistan with Tajikistan, in Central Asia, is a considerable  victory for the Islamic State of Afghanistan in removing the  economic blockade imposed by the oppositions of our country  against our Muslim nation and is another obvious defeat for the  opposition.    Once more supply convoys arrive to Kabul the price of food  will come down and the economic problems of our country will  become relatively less.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Reports on the crash of a Venezuelan National Guard  helicopter in Colombian territory continue to become more  confusing. We have arrived in the zone and have established  various issues there: First, the Venezuelan helicopter had  landed in Colombian territory hours before the crash; second, it  was not attacked by Colombian guerrilla groups, but it suffered  an accident because it was carrying too much weight--and its  crew members arbitrarily arrested various Colombian fishermen.  Third, the shots fired from the aircraft were actually fired by  the Venezuelan military to justify their actions.    The Army Commander has this document on his desk, the  official report sent by the Colombian Armed Forces concerning  the incident. The document's contents reveal: The confidential  report sent in recently by the 2d Operation Command to the  General Command in Santa Fe de Bogota registers, step by step,  the operation executed yesterday by the Venezuelan military.  Colonel Arcesio Barrero narrates to Army Commander General  Hernan Jose Guzman the actions executed by the Venezuelan  National Guard members. For example, he says the military  suddenly entered Colombian territory, beat up civilians,  insulted them, stole their money, and threatened them with  death. The document becomes the strongest evidence of a  violation of sovereignty that the government has in its power.  It is the report from an appalled high-ranking Colombian Army  officer who tells his superior about the Venezuelan Army's  capacity for aggression.    The document clearly establishes there was never an  intervention by the Colombian guerrilla forces, and the bullet  holes in the helicopter were caused by the Venezuelan military  members' own weapons to claim the aircraft had fallen due to a  subversive action.</p>

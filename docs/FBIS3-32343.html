			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 5 Feb (AFP) -- The private radio  station Radio Red has released a first account of the explosion  on Saturday afternoon at a state-owned Mexican Petroleum (Pemex)  plant in the southern State of Tabasco. The explosion killed at  least 10 people, and 20 were seriously wounded.    The causes of the explosion at the Ninive Plant of the oil  company and a fire between the towns of Gregorio Mendez and  Rancho Nuevo, Cunduacan Municipality, approximately 660 km  southeast of this capital, are still unknown, the radio station  reported, adding that one of the plant's internal pipelines is  what exploded.    So far 10 people are known dead, four of who were passing in  front of the Pemex installations in a particular vehicle, inside  which "they were carbonized."    The other six dead were workers of the enterprise who formed  part of a team of 26 workers who were working at the site at the  time of the explosion. The remaining 20 are seriously wounded,  the radio station reported.    The area Red Cross has confirmed to AFP some of the wounded  were taken to Pemex's hospital located near the oil plant,  others to medical centers located in the city of Villahermoza,  capital of Tabasco State.    The gas pipeline explosion occurred in a 200-meter stretch  and left a crater seven meters deep, the radio station reported,  adding that "more than 100 trees were blown down" by the  concussion of the blast.    Firemen controlled the resulting fire, although it prompted  the immediate evacuation, by the Red Cross, of at least 800  people who inhabit the town of Gregorio Mendez.    Pemex personnel were trying in the afternoon to prevent  contact between gas and crude oil circulating in the different  petroleum pipelines in the area by injecting water into the  plants near the Ninive Plant, where there are several ejidos  (communal lands).    Radio Red stated Pemex concentrates most of its drilling and  production activities in the Cunduacan area, where there is a  vast oil-drilling infrastructure.</p>

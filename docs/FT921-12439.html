			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / US savings and loan rescue to cost Dollars 1.2bn THE US government has taken control of Crossland Savings, a small New York savings and loan crippled by property loan losses, in a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 660m) rescue that is the largest US bank bail-out since regulators spent Dollars 2.5bn to take over the Bank of New England (BNE) a year ago. Unlike BNE, however, which was sold within months of its seizure, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said it plans to maintain control of Crossland for as long as two years before seeking to sell the bank. While the FDIC did not portray the Crossland move as a change of policy, the rescue is more reminiscent of the government's investment in the Chicago-based Continental Illinois Bank than of last year's BNE seizure. The decision is understood to reflect the personal judgment of Mr William Taylor, chairman of the FDIC. Mr Taylor, who rejected rescue bids for Crossland by Chase Manhattan and Republic National Bank, claimed the cost of the government owning Crossland would be less than its immediate transfer to another bank. Chase and Republic were not willing to acquire Crossland with its portfolio of bad debts. Some Dollars 1.6bn of Crossland's Dollars 8.7bn of assets are classified as non-performing. Around Dollars 800m of the Dollars 1.2bn government money is being used to cover loan losses, with the remaining Dollars 400m injected as Crossland's new capital. Although Mr Taylor has argued that the FDIC's ultimate cost will be less than Dollars 1bn, some bankers believe the FDIC has seriously underestimated the size of Crossland's bad debts. Mr Taylor said that if the bank had been sold rather than placed under government ownership there would have been a total of Dollars 2.5bn of loans that the FDIC would have had to accept. The FDIC moved swiftly to install its own top manager at the bank. Mr Maurice Reissman, Crossland's chairman, resigned immediately after the takeover as the FDIC named Mr Richard Kraemer, a veteran of New York savings banks with a reputation for restructuring commercial property portfolios. Crossland has 44 branches in the New York area plus another 32 branches in Florida, five in New Jersey and one in Utah.</p>

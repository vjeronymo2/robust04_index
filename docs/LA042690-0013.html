			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET, EAST GERMAN APOLOGIES  </P> <P> It's remarkable and long overdue that East Germany openly acknowledges and  apologizes for the horrors it perpetrated against Jews and others during the  Nazi era.  </P> <P> I wonder if it will ever be possible for our own country to officially  acknowledge and apologize for the horrors we visited on the blacks brought as  slaves from Africa, the destruction of the Indians, and the conquest of  northern Mexico.  </P> <P> We have begun to make restitution to the Japanese unjustly interned during  World War II -- also along delayed and still blocked. Can we now go a step  farther and do the same for the other victims of American history?  </P> <P> LORNE H. WARD  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

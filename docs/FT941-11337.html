			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Creston acquires property portfolio for Pounds 3.4m Creston Land &amp; Estates, the property concern, has agreed to acquire a portfolio of property for Pounds 3.4m from TR Property Investment Trust. The consideration is to be satisfied by the issue of 8.66m new shares, a Pounds 1.5m placing of loan stock and Pounds 1.07m in cash. One TR subsidiary will subscribe in cash for 4m new shares and Pounds 475,265 of loan stock, while the remaining Pounds 1.03m of loan stock will go to other TR subsidiaries. The loan stock will carry a coupon of 6 per cent and will be convertible into shares at 17 1/2 p each. As well as the loan stock issue directors also propose to raise Pounds 1.5m, before expenses, by way of a rights issue of 10m shares at 15p each. These will be allotted on the basis of 13 for every 79 shares and/or warrants held. Directors pointed out that the current net rental income from the properties to be acquired - in Stevenage, Gillingham and Edgware - totals some Pounds 380,000 a year. Progress on letting vacant areas is being made at both Telford and Clydebank and recent investments in new plant and machinery should assist in achieving 'improved operating results.'</p>

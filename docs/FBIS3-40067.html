The development should be sustainable, quick, and sound so as to  revitalize the machine-building sector and make it a real pillar  industry in Jiangsu. To meet this target, we must make ceaseless  efforts to emancipate our minds, seize every opportunity  available, and work assiduously and in a down-to-earth way to  fulfill all related tasks. Above all, we must correctly handle  the following 10 relationships with respect to our state of mind  and method of work:  <H3>  1. Correctly handle the relationship between strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control and developing the industry. </H3>   To meet the needs of developing the economy and deepening  the  reform, the party Central Committee and State Council have put  forth a series of policy-related measures aimed at strengthening  and improving macroeconomic regulation and control. This is  absolutely necessary and timely. A review of our province's  machinery industry shows that after breaking the 20-billion-yuan  mark last year, the gross output value of this industry  increased further by 55.31 percent during the first half of  1993, surpassing the province's industrial growth by 10.71  percentage points and the average growth of the nation's  machinery industry by 21.59 percentage points. For the same  period, increases in sales and in economic returns both outpaced  the growth of production. Affected by the increasingly tight  macroeconomic environment, however, this year's monthly  production growth has kept declining--each month the growth rate  has declined 2 to 3 percentage points. For the entire first half  of this year, the farm machinery sector registered a  17-percentage-point drop in its monthly production growth, while  for the construction machinery sector the decline was as great  as 31 percentage points. Meanwhile, there emerged more factors  that increased production costs and reduced profit yield; for  the first half of this year alone, a reduction in profit by 1.4  billion yuan was attributable to these factors. Losses suffered  by those known as loss-incurring enterprises climbed up to a  fairly big extent. Due to an acute shortage of circulating funds  in the hands of enterprises, only 14.4 percent of the funding  requirements could be met for key technological-upgrading  projects. As of the end of June, the three kinds of tied-up  funds [funds tied up by products in stock, by goods in transit,  and by receivables and prepaid accounts] had amounted to 6.69  billion yuan, up 20.9 percent from the figure registered a year  ago. Urgently needed primary and auxiliary materials were in  short supply, resulting in a surge in prices. Transportation  facilities and electric power supply were far from adequate to  meet the demands. If we do not promptly correct the above  situation by beefing up macroeconomic regulation and control,  the output and economic returns of the entire machinery industry  will continue to slide, and some sectors of this industry will  encounter more serious problems in production and operations and  may even be bogged down in predicament.    Although it has not been long since the macroeconomic  regulatory and control measures designed by the CPC Central  Committee were put into effect in Jiangsu, they have  nevertheless produced remarkable results. This has undoubtedly  provided a rare opportunity for the machinery industry -- which  serves as an equipment supplier in the entire economy -- to  adjust and develop itself. We should seize this opportunity,  value it highly, and make good use of it. On the one hand, under  macroeconomic regulation and control, we should be versed in  enlivening our microeconomic activities to achieve development.  On the other hand, we should see to it that the various  microeconomic activities we are carrying out are at all times  consistent with and subordinate to macroeconomic regulation and  control. That is, it is necessary to seriously implement the  party Central Committee's policy decision of strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control and, at the same time,  achieve a sustained, quick, and sound development of the  machinery industry. This year, our province's machinery industry  should make every effort to meet the targets of a sales revenue  of more than 30 billion yuan (a growth rate of 30 percent) and a  total profit and tax contribution to the state amounting to 2.2  billion yuan (a growth rate of 20 percent) so as to consolidate  its pillar-industry position.  <H3>  2. Correctly handle the relationship between the total  production increase and the three kinds of tied-up funds. </H3>   An increase in total output inevitably requires more  circulating funds. The two have a certain inherent relationship.  We should take such measures as enlivening the utilization of  the present assets and making best use of the increased capital  to avoid or minimize as much as possible the need for increasing  the circulating funds and to reasonably control the three kinds  of tied-up money. This way we will bring about a  self-perpetuating and highly efficient production growth.    A current problem of our province's machinery industry is  that with the growth of total output, the three kinds of tied-up  funds have kept increasing. In August, the stockpile of products  reached 4 billion yuan. Planning production in strict accord  with market demands and making an all-out effort to limit the  output of certain items, slash their stockpiles, promote sales,  collect and avert accounts receivables, and maintain a  reasonable amount of stock are key to controlling the three  kinds of tied-up funds. We should do this seriously so that we  may increase the machinery industry's total output while keeping  the three kinds of tied-up funds at a reasonable level and  achieving a fast and sound development of this industry.  <H3>  3. Correctly handle the relationship between production  speed and product quality. </H3>   In reality, this involves the question of how to correctly  handle the relationship between the quantity and quality of  production. We should reach a consensus of thought on the  following points and put them into practice in our work.    -- Without good quality, quantity will be meaningless, and  no  real, effective speed can be spoken of. Quality is the life of  enterprises. Failing to pay attention to quality, an enterprise  or a trade will have no future, and its development will be out  of the question.    -- While ensuring quality as a prerequisite, we should go in  for greater quantity and speed. Authorities in charge of the  machinery industry should guide the enterprises to operate "as  independent socialist commodity producers and dealers,  responsible for their own profits and losses and for their own  decision about whether to expand" with attention focused on  product quality. They should be guided to improve their product  quality as a way to boost their operational efficiency so that  they will really embark on the road of efficiency through  quality.    -- When contradictions arise between product quality and  production speed, it is imperative to adhere to the principle of  "giving priority to quality." This is especially important.  Sample quality inspections conducted by the state and by the  ministry concerned in the first quarter of this year revealed  that the percentages of standard-quality products turned out by  the province's machinery industry were only 67.03 and 66.67  percent, respectively. This shows that product quality is a  problem worthy of concern. Therefore, while production is  developing quickly, great attention should be devoted to the  question of quality. By taking the current drives to transform  enterprise operational mechanism and modify government functions  as an opportunity, we must seriously carry out the "Product  Quality Act" and use the market as a mechanism to gear up  quality control and supervision so as to ensure a sound and fast  development of production. It is necessary to rely on progress  in science and technology to raise our product quality in an  effort to catch up with the advanced world standards as soon as  possible.  <H3>  4. Correctly handle the relationship between product  development and the optimization of product mix. </H3>   Now, Jiangsu's machinery industry turns out nearly 20,000  different varieties and specifications of products. Among them,  close to 3,000 are main products. Recently my department has  made an analysis of the development levels of 7,821 products  made by the machinery industry and found that only 8.34 percent  of them are up to the world's standard of the 1980s. Those  meeting the standards of the "late 1970s and early 1980s"  account for 21.63 percent, those up to the standards of the  1970s, 55 percent; and those below the standards of the 1960s,  15.03 percent. As can be seen, the proportions of products in  terms of their levels of development are not so rational.  Further, products meeting high standards have been developed  slowly, while most products being turned out are of low  standards. Such a state of affairs neither meets the needs of  our economic development nor is in the interest of achieving a  sustained, quick growth of the machinery industry itself. For  this reason, in developing new products, we should not only pay  attention to expanding the variety and categories of products  and increasing the models and specifications in each category,  but also attach great importance to improving their quality. We  should strive to develop products made by high and new  technologies, products that are a combination of machines and  electric equipment, and other products belonging to the  technology-intensive category.    Meanwhile, we should constantly adjust and optimize of our  present product mix. With the market condition as a guidance and  using brand-name and competitive products as model commodities,  we should strive to transform, reorganize, and reform our lines  of production so as to boost the percentage of high-technology,  good-quality, highly profitable, and readily marketable  products. In addition, we should successfully adjust our  production plans to suit the demands by adopting the strategy of  "wresting the market for urgently needed products, expanding the  mass production of highly marketable products, upgrading the  quality of moderately marketable products, and replacing  nonmarketable products with marketable ones." This way we will  be able to constantly adjust and optimize our product mix. To  sum up, we should pay close and earnest attention to every  aspect of product-mix optimization, from setting targets and  developing new products to promoting technological  transformation and boosting the marketability of products.  <H3>  5. Correctly handle the relationship between the development  of the industry and the development of advantages and  characteristic conditions in various localities. </H3>   As an early developed traditional industry and an equipment  industry, the machinery industry has a relatively big influence  on and is rather closely related to other industries. Because  of this, it has received due attention in all regions (cities  and counties) and is listed as one of the key undertakings to be  developed locally. On the other hand, we have noted that the  products made by our province's machinery industry have a  serious problem of low standards, that the lines of production  in various regions show a tendency to be identical, and that the  development and production of new products are at a slow pace.  As a result, the industry cannot have a rational layout with  distinctive characteristics in each location -- a problem which  has affected the sustained and quick development of  machine-building enterprises. In view of thi s, all cities and  counties must give prime consideration to their respective  priorities, choose the fittest projects to develop, and display  their own distinctive characteristics in promoting the machinery  industry. They should change the mindset of seeking paralleled  and all-inclusive development and rushing to make "products that  sell well." Instead, they should dare to give up some of their  current undertakings and products, and go all out to develop  uncommon products, make good the shortage, and fill up the gaps  in the machinery industry. In developing themselves, all cities  and counties should keep to the track of making what others  don't have, beating competitors by turning out better products,  and giving full scope to their own characteristics, so that each  of them will have their strong points. This is the only path to  take in developing our machinery industry.    Now, competitive products with distinctive characteristics  have appeared in various parts of our province. Examples are  "vehicles, boxes, machines, and containers" [che xiang ji gui  6508 4630 2623 2681] made in Yangzhou; construction machinery  produced by Xuzhou; and farm machinery, mainly diesel tractors,  turned out by Changzhou. We should speed up the development of  the strong points of various localities. In doing this, we  should be oriented toward the domestic and overseas markets,  take the local economic and technological conditions into  consideration, bring into full play our strong points, and  sidestep our shortcomings. We should choose some characteristic  products as key targets to make breakthroughs, devote our  efforts to improving the quality of these products and expanding  their production scale, strive to develop them into competitive  products with distinctive local characteristics, and make every  effort to bring them up to the nation's advanced level.    To sum up, we should take the development of the strong  points and characteristics of various localities as a main task  in connection with the effort to increase the total output. We  should see to it that while increasing the total production, all  localities bring into full play their characteristics and strong  points, and that, in doing so, they also contribute to  increasing the total production and boosting the economic  returns.  <H3>  6. Correctly handle the relationship between developing  "small but specialized" enterprises and promoting conglomerates. </H3>   Jiangsu's machinery industry is characterized by large  numbers of small- and medium-sized enterprises as well as  township enterprises. Such an organizational structure makes it  necessary to develop scores of "small but specialized"  enterprises as basic units to supplement and coordinate with the  development of big and medium-sized enterprises. Based on their  characteristics, these small enterprises should constantly raise  their technological level, improve their product quality,  acquire advanced equipment, and distinguish themselves by fine  quality, low production costs, and expertise in their  specialized fields. More importantly, they should put stress on  developing conglomerates aimed at making competitive products as  the leading commodities, such conglomerates to be formed by  sharing assets on the basis of specialization and cooperation.  The purpose is to build an economy of scale, bring out the  advantage of the integrated whole, and boost the enterprises'  competitiveness so that they can get a foothold in the domestic  and international markets.    The competent government authorities can do something in  organizing such conglomerates. During the last two years, our  department did play a leading role in organizing three  provincial-level conglomerates. At the same time, a number of  conglomerates also came into being in various localities. The  year 1992 saw 48 enterprises and conglomerates formed in our  province in the machine-building field, each scoring an output  value in excess of 100 million yuan or providing more than 1,000  yuan to the government in the form of profit contribution or tax  payment. This brought an initial change to our province's  machinery industry, which had lacked big and effective  organizations. In the future, we should further use our polices,  laws, and regulations along with informational and economic  measures to guide enterprises to form conglomerates as a way to  spur the development of the machinery industry. Such  conglomerates may be formed by association or merger of  enterprises or through such methods as share-buying,  shareholding, or leasing. We should try to see that each sector  of our machinery industry has one or two conglomerates.  <H3>  7. Correctly handle the relationship between introducing  technology and capital from outside and making self-improvement. </H3>   Since the outset of the reform and opening-up drive, our  province's machinery industry has introduced some 120 new  technologies from abroad, established 156 partially- or  wholly-foreign-funded enterprises, and actually utilized foreign  capital in the amount of $117 million. This has accelerated the  updating and upgrading of our products and increased our sources  of capital. Acquisition of advanced designs, manufacturing  techniques, and management expertise from abroad has helped  promote our export trade to earn foreign exchange and has  brought in greater economic returns. Our practical experience  shows that such acquisition and joint investment with overseas  business interests are a significant way for our machinery  industry to achieve quick and effective results in making  technological progress, seeking quick development, and narrowing  the gap between itself and its foreign counterpart.    In the main, acquisition of foreign technology plays the  role  of raising our starting point in making technological progress,  while our foundation for technological progress is to beef up  our own strength in the field of science and technology.  Because of this, we cannot solely rely on the acquisition of  foreign technology. More important is a positive effort to  digest and assimilate what we have acquired from abroad and, on  this basis, create our own technology, expand our own expertise,  and raise our independent development capability. As an example,  the Wuxi Compressor Plant has created its own technology after  actively digesting and assimilating the oiled-screw-rod  technology acquired from abroad. The plant has developed two new  products, no- lubrication screw rods and screw-rod  refrigerators. These new products have provided it with a new  competitive edge and boosted its capability for sustained  development.    In utilizing foreign capital to solve the shortage of funds  at home, we should pay particular attention to the following:  Along with the capital acquired from abroad, we should also  obtain foreign advanced technology and equipment. We should  encourage the sectors and enterprises concerned to participate  in international division of work and to explore overseas  markets for their products. In addition, we should integrate the  work of utilization of foreign capital with the transformation  of old enterprises and go all out to win success in developing  the three kinds of partially- or wholly-foreign-funded  enterprises.  <H3>  8. Correctly handle the relationship between developing the  domestic market and exploring the international market. </H3>   In view of China's forthcoming "reentry into the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade," the quickened pace taken in  linking the domestic market with the international market, and  the internationalization trend of world economic development,  every enterprise and region must base itself not only on  developing the domestic market but also on exploring the  international market. It must act in both directions.    On the one hand, the machinery industry must meet domestic  market demands. It must make further efforts to capture a large  part of the domestic market and must compete successfully with  foreign companies and "imported goods" by means of flexible  marketing strategies, good after- sales services, and  fine-quality and low-price products. On the other hand, it must,  as a strategic measure, expand its international market and  boost its exports to earn more foreign exchange. While  consolidating and developing the current export market, it must  continue to expand the market abroad and establish transnational  companies to develop internationalized operations. In no way  should it relax or give up the exploration of international  market because its products are selling well at home.  <H3>  9. Correctly handle the relationship between the  transformation of government functions and the transformation of  enterprises' operational mechanism. </H3>   These "two transformations" are both needed in building a  socialist market economic structure. We should coordinate and  synchronize the work in these two fields, let them promote each  other, and really achieve the goal that "enterprises are acting  in line with the market condition, while the government is  functioning according to the needs of enterprises."    Enterprises should speed up the transformation of their  operational mechanism. In doing this, however, they should not  relax their internal management. Some time ago, "using contract  arrangements instead of strengthening management" and a relapse  of laxity in management appeared in varying degrees in our  machinery industry. This matter deserves our particular  attention. We must make a real effort to gear up management and  devote ourselves painstakingly to "internal work." Factory  directors of enterprises should properly exercise their  decision-making power while giving full play to the role of the  staff members and workers as the factories' masters.    The administrative department in charge of the machinery  industry should put in more efforts to transform its functions.  On the one hand, it must further implement the "Regulations"  [Regulations on Transformation of Operational Mechanisms of  State-Owned Industrial Enterprises], simplify its  administration, and delegate more power to enterprises so as to  create a relaxed external environment for enterprises to better  their services. On the other hand, it should not loosen its  control over this industry. Especially, it should not relax or  give up its supervisory functions (such as supervision in the  fields of quality, security, fixed assets, as well as party and  government discipline). It must learn to be adept at regulating,  controlling, and guiding the industry by using comprehensive  measures, including economic means, policy-based measures, and  legal, informational, and planning methods. Plus, it must gear  up investigations and studies, draw experience from selected  units to promote overall work, and pay attention to solving  tendentious problems.  <H3>  10. Correctly handle the relationship between reform and  development </H3>   Reform is a powerful propellant for development. An industry  without reform is hard to develop quickly. Similarly, an  enterprise without reform is hard to become lively. We cannot  use the old mindset and methods to solve the problems and  contradictions encountered in the development of an industry or  an enterprise. Still less should we go back to the old road to  solve them. The only solution is to deepen the reform.    Our present task is development, but it is more important to  be devoted to reform. We should seek development by means of  reform and, in the course of development, continue to deepen our  reform. Many of the above-mentioned tasks involve the work of  reform, such as the tasks related to the three enterprise  systems, the shareholding system, the property rights system,  and government organizations. We must make rock-firm efforts to  deepen the reform in various fields and strive to achieve  successful results.</p>

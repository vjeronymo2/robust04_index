			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURKISH CUISINE;  </P> <P> A DATE WITH HISTORY  </P> <P> This is Turkish food: Peppery radishes in a hummus-like sesame dressing.  Grilled quail, faintly sweet-sour from marinating in tomatoes, yogurt, olive  oil and cinnamon. Mastic ice cream, with an exotic flavor something like Juicy  Fruit gum; on the side, apricots stuffed with toasted almonds and slightly  soured cream so thick it's almost butter.  </P> <P> It may be little known in this country, but in the last few years, European  foodies have been discovering Turkish cuisine, and in the process a remarkable  food writer named Nevin Halici (her name is pronounced something like "Neveen  Halaja"). "Nevin Halici's Turkish Cookbook," recently printed in England, is  the first book by a Turkish cookery writer ever translated into English. The  food heavies see her as a sort of Turkish Paul Prudhomme.  </P> <P> In fact, she is not really anybody's image of a cookbook writer. The daughter  of a Sufi family long associated with the Mevlevi Order (known in the West as  the Whirling Dervishes), she is very much a traditional Muslim woman who wears  long-sleeved dresses and covers her hair with a sort of pleated turban. Some  people have the feeling that if the veil weren't illegal in Turkey, she'd  prefer to wear it.  </P> <P> But her quiet, pious manner should not lead anyone to underestimate her.  Halici's English may be halting, but it represents a triumph over centuries of  family opposition to educating women. And if that doesn't impress you, I have  seen her get a provincial Turkish Air Lines agent to change a plane reservation  in under half an hour, simply by an invincible sort of gentle persistence.  </P> <P> She is a diligent researcher and has published book-length studies in Turkish  of her country's various regional cuisines, which are quite various indeed. Two  years ago at a symposium on food history in Istanbul, she read a paper on the  little-known poppy-based cuisine of Turkey's traditional opium-growing area --  a cuisine likely to disappear because of the Turkish government's campaign to  restrict opium-growing.  </P> <P> And she is certainly an excellent cook. At a dinner she prepared for the  American Institute of Wine and Food in San Francisco some months ago, she made  a very ancient pasta dating from the days when the Turks were nomads in Central  Asia. Called manti, it is tiny triangular lamb ravioli cooked in a mixture of  lamb stock and garlicky yogurt sauce. Her version was dashingly topped with  reduced tomatoes, sage and mint.  </P> <P> She also made a tomato-sweetened eggplant salad that was subtly enfolded in a  roasted pepper, and a bulgur wheat pilaf with onions, green peppers, tomato and  mint, but her repertoire includes far more exotic dishes. One that she didn't  make for this dinner is Perdeli Pilav, a sort of chicken pilaf baked in a thin  crust which looks like a cake when it's done but has a rich flavor of chicken  and rice. Another is Tavuk Gogsu Kazandibi, a traditional Turkish pudding  flavored with an ingredient no one ever guesses: shredded chicken breast.  </P> <P> The most spectacular course at the San Francisco dinner was a variation on the  famous dish imam bayildi ("the imam fainted with delight"), where quinces,  instead of eggplants, were stuffed with the traditional filling of lamb,  currants and rice, achieving a dish of stunning richness. Contrasting with it  was a subtle and exquisite side dish that was simply leeks very slowly stewed  in olive oil with a bit of tomato.  </P> <P> At the end of the meal, she apologized for shortcomings in the food, which most  of the diners were in no position to recognize. The American white beans, for  instance, were really too small for the white bean salad. California radishes  are not as sharply flavored as Turkey's, and California rice takes longer to  cook, so the rice in the quince dish was not properly done by her lights.  </P> <P> Diners also learned that this scholar of Turkish food tradition makes her own  innovations. The idea of using quinces instead of eggplants in the variation on  imam bayildi was hers, so she had decided to name it Claudia bayildi, since it  was the Middle Eastern food expert Claudia Roden -- rather than an imam -- who  practically fainted with delight on tasting it. Someone asked her why she cut  her leeks lengthwise, rather than crosswise, as would be instinctive for a  Western chef, and she explained that in her experience it exposed more surface  to the sauce.  </P> <P> At this point her English began to give out on her, and the husband of the  Turkish Honorary Consul encouraged her, saying, "Go ahead, we will listen  carefully." She smiled gravely and replied, "If you will listen carefully, I  will answer in Turkish," and lapsed into the introspective harmonies of her own  tongue. If that quiet, pious face could show impishness, at that moment it did.  </P> <P> VARTAVIT  </P> <P> (Radish and Tahini Salad)  </P> <P> 1/2 pound daikon radish  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, pressed  </P> <P> 1/4 cup tahini  </P> <P> 1/4 cup grapefruit juice  </P> <P> Grapefruit slices  </P> <P> Black olives  </P> <P> Peel radish and grate pulp. Add salt and let grated radish sit 3 to 4 minutes,  then squeeze dry.  </P> <P> Place garlic and tahini in mixing bowl. Whisk in grapefruit juice. Fold in  radish. Arrange in middle of plate and garnish with grapefruit slices and  olives. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  The name of the following recipe is pronounced approximately hahvoochloo  jahjuhk.  </P> <P> HAVUCLU CACIK  </P> <P> (Carrot and Yogurt Salad)  </P> <P> 1/2 pound carrots  </P> <P> 1 cup Thickened Yogurt  </P> <P> 3 cloves garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon olive oil  </P> <P> Place unpeeled carrots in pot of boiling water. Cook about 15 minutes, or until  tender-crisp.  </P> <P> Remove carrots and place in bowl of cold water 5 minutes. Drain. Rub off skins  and grate carrots. Mix with Thickened Yogurt, garlic and salt. Drizzle with  olive oil before serving. Makes 2 servings.  </P> <P> Thickened Yogurt  </P> <P> 1 pint plain yogurt, preferably without starch stabilizer  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Mix yogurt with salt and place on 2 thicknesses of dampened cheesecloth in  colander. Cover and let drain in sink at least 3 hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  This festive pilaf with its decorative veiled appearance is the centerpiece of  wedding menus in the southern Turkish city of Siirt.  </P> <P> PERDELI PILAV  </P> <P> ("Veiled" Pilaf)  </P> <P> 6 ounces sliced almonds  </P> <P> Pastry Veil Dough  </P> <P> Shredded Chicken  </P> <P> Rice Pilaf  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon flour mixed with 2 tablespoons water  </P> <P> Butter 10-inch springform pan generously and press sliced almonds evenly to  sides and bottom of pan. Freeze until firm.  </P> <P> Set aside about 1/4 of Pastry Veil Dough. Take small round pieces remaining  dough and roll out on lightly floured board to 1/8-inch thickness. Line  prepared pan with dough, pressing pieces of dough together to seal.  </P> <P> Alternate layers of Shredded Chicken and Rice Pilaf in pan. Press down lightly  with back of spoon. Roll out reserved dough to cover pilaf. Put pot cover or  heavy duty foil over pan and seal edges airtight with flour and water paste.  </P> <P> Bake at 375 degrees 45 minutes or until dough turns faint pink. To serve,  unmold onto serving plate. If pilaf does not unmold easily, return to oven and  bake few minutes longer. Makes 8 to 10 servings.  </P> <P> Pastry Veil Dough  </P> <P> 1 large egg  </P> <P> 2 tablespoon olive oil  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons plain yogurt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 1/4 cups flour  </P> <P> In bowl stir together egg and olive oil with fork. Stir in yogurt, salt and  flour. Knead gently to form ball. Cover with cloth and let stand 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Shredded Chicken  </P> <P> 1 (2 1/2- to 3-pound) chicken, giblets removed  </P> <P> 4 quarts water  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, peeled and studded with 8 whole cloves  </P> <P> 1 carrot, cut in large chunks  </P> <P> 1 stalk celery, cut in large chunks  </P> <P> 1 leek, split and washed thoroughly to remove sand  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Place chicken in large pot with water. Bring to boil over medium heat. Cover  and simmer over low heat 1 hour.  </P> <P> Add onion with cloves, carrot, celery and leek. Cover and simmer another hour  or until chicken is very tender. Add salt and simmer 5 minutes longer. Remove  chicken and reserve 5 cups stock for Rice Pilaf. When chicken has cooled,  remove skin and bones and shred meat.  </P> <P> Rice Pilaf  </P> <P> 2 1/2 cups uncooked rice  </P> <P> 1 quart warm water  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 5 cups reserved chicken stock  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter  </P> <P> Seasoning Mixture  </P> <P> Rinse rice and soak in warm water with 2 tablespoons salt 30 minutes. Drain and  rinse rice again.  </P> <P> In 4-quart pot with tight-fitting lid, combine rice, chicken stock and 1 1/2  teaspoons salt. Cover and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes or  until liquid is absorbed.  </P> <P> Melt butter and pour over rice. Press over rice piece of wax paper or foil  large enough to cover surface of rice. Replace lid and cook over lowest  possible heat 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Remove from heat. Gently fold in Seasoning Mixture. Cover and let stand 10  minutes. Stir again and set aside.  </P> <P> Seasoning Mixture  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sliced almonds  </P> <P> 4 ounces chicken liver, chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon ground cumin  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon ground thyme  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves  </P> <P> Melt butter in small skillet. Saute almonds until very lightly browned. Add  chicken liver and cook over low heat 5 minutes. Stir in cumin, thyme, pepper,  cinnamon and cloves.  </P> <P>  This celebrated Istanbul dessert is for open minds. It uses chicken breast as  a dessert flavoring, as did the medieval European dessert blanc manger.  </P> <P> TAVUK GOGSU KAZANDIBI  </P> <P> (Chicken Breast Pudding)  </P> <P> 1 small chicken breast  </P> <P> Water  </P> <P> 1 quart milk  </P> <P> 1 cup rice flour or ground rice  </P> <P> 3/4 cup (7 ounces) granulated sugar  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter  </P> <P> Powdered sugar  </P> <P> Place chicken breast in small saucepan and add water to cover. Cook over medium  heat until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and soak chicken in bowl of cold  water until cool. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Cut lengthwise into 4 or  5 strips.  </P> <P> Hold ends of each strip with fingers and rub to separate meat into fibers.  Continue rubbing towards center of strip so that it is entirely separated into  fine shreds. Place shreds in cold water and set aside.  </P> <P> Heat milk gently to boiling. Quickly stir in rice flour. Simmer 15 minutes,  stirring continuously. Add granulated sugar and cook 10 minutes longer, still  stirring. Add drained chicken breast fibers and cook another 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Heat 10-inch heavy skillet over low heat. Add butter to melt. Add chicken  mixture and pat with hands or rubber spatula until round, then smooth with flat  of knife. Brown underside carefully over low heat, about 20 minutes, shaking  pan from time to time. Turn onto serving plate. When cool, sprinkle lightly  with powdered sugar and cut into rectangles and serve. Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P> <P> Note: If superfine sugar is unavailable, place 7 ounces granulated sugar in  blender container and blend on high speed until very fine.  </P></p>

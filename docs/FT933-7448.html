			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Vauxhall lifts prices by 2.1% VAUXHALL is to raise the prices of its cars and light commercial vehicles by an average 2.1 per cent from Wednesday. This is Vauxhall's second price increase this year. It raised prices by an average 2.9 per cent in March. Ford said yesterday that it intended to delay price rises it announced in July until the beginning of next month. The new-car market leader is to raise prices by an average of 2.5 per cent. The increases were due to take effect from the beginning of this week. The price increases will apply to 1994 model-year cars with changed specifications, which will be in showrooms from next month. The biggest change will be the fitting of an airbag on the driver's side as standard equipment across the Ford range. Airbags will be fitted to all Granada, Mondeo and Escort/Orion models from September. Airbags for the Fiesta small car will follow soon, while passenger-side airbags will be optional.</p>

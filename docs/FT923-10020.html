			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: The studious landlord My student son, having completed his BA, now intends attending another university for one year for his MA. If he lets his house on a short-hold tenancy, what does he need to do to protect his position? What tax relief can he claim (he now qualifies for the Pounds 30,000 - the mortgage is Pounds 31,000)? What would be the tax position on any profile? The solicitor who draws up the tenancy agreement will be able to guide your son through the pitfalls, and on matters such as obtaining the mortgagees' consent and notifying the insurers. The solicitor will also guide him on the tax aspects of the letting. If the house is let furnished, an arbitrary wear and tear allowance of 10 per cent of the rent will be given - as explained briefly in the free pamphlet IR87(1991), which should still be obtainable from local tax offices. Your son could also ask for pamphlet CGT14 (entitled Owner-occupied houses) from which you will see that the letting may not result in any prospective CGT liability on the eventual sale of the house. This again, is something which the solicitor will be able to explain in detail. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

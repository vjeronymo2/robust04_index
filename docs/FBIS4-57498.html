			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>   [Text] Havana, 11 May (PL) -- Speculation is an ancient and  objectionable occupation practiced by individuals who buy and  sell articles, merchandise, or property. Some clerical  employees make a living from it.    The former were held in check in Havana by official  provisions announced following the extraordinary session of the  Cuban National Assembly on 1 and 2 May. The provisions decreed  that property would be confiscated from individuals linked to  the black market, illicit enrichment, and other illegal  activities that are repudiated by the people.    The implementation of this decree-law is consistent with  requests that speculators and individuals who divert state  resources be punished. The requests were made by some 3 million  workers at approximately 80,000 parliaments in the workplace  held over the past few months throughout the country.    The decree-law is also one of several guidelines approved by  the deputies to reorganize Cuba's domestic finances in view of  the excess of currency in circulation, surpassing 11.2 billion  pesos (equivalent to the dollar at the official exchange rate),  and the approximately 4.2 billion peso budget deficit.    The clerks are "theorizing" while these measures are being  implemented in a country that must readjust 85 percent of its  foreign trade because of the fall of its former commercial  partners, particularly the USSR, and in the midst of the  intensification of the U.S. blockade.    While some people characterize the Assembly's decisions as a  "drastic adjustment plan," others view it as "slow, moderate  reform."    According to Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and price  minister,  Cuban experts have confirmed that the announced measures should  be implemented gradually over several months.    Some even say that the black market is "the most efficient  economy in Cuba," thus attempting to legalize the theft of state  resources with the trite phrase used by local diplomatic sources.    President Fidel Castro told the deputies that existing laws  must be enforced so those who conduct illegal trade or  activities will not go unpunished.    Others who speculate about Cuba's reality and ruminate about  the "hidden plan," go a step further and write about an  imaginary power struggle that has allegedly broken out among the  country's top leaders. This struggle pits politicians and  economists against each other and indiscriminately links  distinguished figures from either side.    National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon told PRENSA  LATINA that the consensus reached through the deputies'  decisions resulted from that body's preparedness for the debate  on the controversial subject and also from the process he  described as the parliamentarization of Cuban society, which  began several months ago.    Cuban politicians and economists say the informational  biases  that certain people unwittingly represent make them see darkness  where there is only light.</p>

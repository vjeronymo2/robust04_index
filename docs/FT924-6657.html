			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Stars and Stripes for Puerto Rico?: Islanders will vote on whether to join the union SEVERAL decades of debates about Puerto Rico's political status will end within 12 months when the 3m people of the US possession in the Caribbean will vote on whether they want to retain their current 'commonwealth' relationship with Washington, become a state of the union, or be politically independent. Dr Pedro Rossello, the governor-elect of Puerto Rico who will take office in January, has promised that a long-awaited plebiscite on the issue will be held next year. The result, he says, will be taken to the US Congress for approval. In December 1991, Puerto Ricans rejected a referendum seeking to maintain the island's autonomy. The issue of what status they do support has since been left open. Puerto Rico is officially described as having a 'freely associated' relationship with the US. Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but cannot vote for a president. The island's representation in Washington is limited to a commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation. Dr Rossello, the candidate of the New Progressive Party, won the island's gubernatorial election earlier this month with 50 per cent of the votes cast. His main rival, Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza of the Popular Democratic Party, received 46 per cent, with Mr Fernando Martin of the Puerto Rican Independence Party being supported by just 4 per cent. There is little support for political independence, as indicated by the Independence Party's showing, and the impending plebiscite is expected to determine whether Puerto Ricans want to continue and enhance their current status, or become a state of the union. Dr Rossello's NPP has consistently advocated statehood, but Puerto Rican analysts have cautioned that votes cast in the referendum will cut across party political lines. Dr Rossello's decision that the issue of the island's status must be decided soon is an apparent attempt to determine definitively a matter which has been the object of sometimes trenchant debate. Although the governor-elect will present the result of the referendum to Washington as a fait accompli, any decision by the US Congress will be affected by considerations such as Puerto Rico's geopolitical and strategic value to Washington. The island, at the north-eastern end of the Caribbean archipelago, is host to a large US naval base. Puerto Ricans' decision about their political future will turn on economics. The current 'commonwealth' status has allowed the island's economy an advantage under Section 936 of the US revenue code which encourages mainland companies with subsidiaries in Puerto Rico to deposit their profits in local banks. Totalling about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.9bn), these have assisted economic growth and stability. The economy also benefits from federal welfare funds of about Dollars 4bn a year and receives hundreds of millions of dollars from rebates of federal excise taxes and duties collected on exports such as rum. Support for the political options for the island will be determined largely by whether Puerto Ricans feel that this level of financial support will be available to them if they vote for statehood, and whether the economy can do without it.</p>

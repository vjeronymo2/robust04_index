			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Menem tries to break logjam over oil sale and pensions PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has resorted to emotional blackmail so as to shame legislators into passing a government bill stuck in Congress for over six months. In a surprise national television address late on Tuesday, Mr Menem promised to award a long-delayed increase in benefits for 3m old-age pensioners if the Senate were to pass a bill allowing the government to privatise Yacimientos Pe-trolferos Fiscales, the national oil company. It has been before the Senate since November. The senate, where the government has a majority, does not oppose privatisation of YPF, but there are objections to clauses by which the government would sell the company to private investors, local government and employees. Senators are also agitating for a softer government line over imposing tough economic reforms on the country's 24 provinces. The government is under permanent pressure from militant pensioners to increase their monthly benefit, equivalent to Dollars 150. Argentina has one of South America's largest contingents of old people and spends Dollars 10bn a year (over 7 per cent of GDP) on pensions. However, benefits are lower than those stipulated by law. Pensioners are entitled to benefits equivalent to 82 per cent of their final wage. However, the bankrupt state pension fund was unable to match this and has built up a Dollars 10bn 'debt' to pensioners. The government has cleared Dollars 7bn of that by issuing bonds, but it must recapitalise the pension fund to avoid creating a new, unsustainable deficit. Sale of YPF would yield some Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn over the next three years and Mr Menem promises that the money would be channeled to the pension fund. The sale would be the crowning glory of the government's privatisation programme. Mr Menem plans to sell all federal companies, except YPF, by the end of the year. However, his challenge to Congress has not impressed the pensioners' leaders, who denounced his ploy as a cynical manoeuvre. Opposition members of Congress dismissed it as 'dictatorial'. Mr Menem also demanded that Congress approve unaltered a draft social security reform package. This would reshape the tax structure and create compulsory private schemes to which employees would contribute 11 per cent of their incomes.</p>

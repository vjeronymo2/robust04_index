			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Monks warns unions of 'critical period' ahead Unions face a critical period with their memberships under threat and their resources hard-pressed, Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, warned at the end of this year's congress yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. Mr Monks said unions would have to modernise their organisation, and this could not be delayed if they were 'to come through their present problems'. The TUC would have to focus sharply on key campaigning issues at national level and give more support to union officials in the field. Union activity was much more decentralised and localised than it used to be, he said. 'The move away from national agreements, the growth of local bargaining and industrial contrasts, the decentralisation of public services and large companies, the need to recruit new members and retain existing ones' were all factors suggesting that unions should concentrate their resources where their immediate future lies.

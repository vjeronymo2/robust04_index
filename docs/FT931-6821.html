			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks and Small Companies: Business adjusts to tighter credit - The relationship between banks and small businesses is in upheaval. With 80,000 company failures last year and a similar number forecast for 1993, lenders are seeking a fresh approach to overdrafts, loans and equity finance. FT reporters assess the lending pressures on companies and banks JOHN FARMER, owner of PKI, an expanding coatings company in Chester, has mixed feelings about banks. He abandoned Lloyds after a dispute about his overdraft. 'We changed to Barclays, but I decided to get out of the hands of the banks as far as financing growth was concerned.' Today PKI has a Pounds 1.25m turnover and is growing at 25 per cent a year. The workforce at the company, which coats plastic components in imitation gold and silver, has grown from 46 to 60 in two years. Like many small businessmen Mr Farmer wanted a flexible overdraft facility because it offered easier access to working capital than a loan. He turned to Barclays after Lloyds declined to increase his overdraft limit to Pounds 180,000 and tried instead to set a Pounds 125,000 limit with higher charges. Although Mr Farmer now has an overdraft limit of only Pounds 50,000 at Barclays, he has continued expanding by using an intermediary finance house. The finance house - Griffin Factors, a subsidiary of Midland Bank - agreed to offer PKI debtor discounting, a system of speeding cashflow. At the end of each week Griffin sends Mr Farmer a cheque for 80 per cent of his invoiced sales. He pays Griffin when PKI is paid by its customers. The cost of what is, in effect, increased working capital works out at 2 per cent over base rate, compared with 2 1/2 per cent for his overdraft. Administration costs on his Griffin contract are less than the  1/2 point difference. His personal guarantee - his own risk - is only on the overdraft. Taking advantage of such facilities is an important shift from the 1980s when overdrafts were calculated by formula: 70 per cent of assets, plus half the value of money owed to a business by its customers. Grahame Elliott of Stoy Hayward, PKI's auditor in Manchester, says: 'Everything is a case by case situation now.' The changing relationship between banks and small companies is summed up by Paul Davidson, managing director of Bolton Business Venture, an enterprise agency advising small businesses. 'There are no formulae now. Information is crucial. The banks are carrying out validation of sales forecasts, making quarterly visits and demanding monthly management accounts. 'We had a meeting with local bankers to see if they had altered their criteria for lending. They all said they had a surplus of funds and were anxious to do deals, but that the quality of proposals was weak.' The banks' new approach is raising questions among accountants and advisers about whether small businesses will get the working capital many need to ride the expected economic upturn. Such capital is necessary to help companies avoid overtrading - not having the cash to pay wages, creditors and interest charges quickly enough to stay in business because finances are tied up in stocks, work-in-progress and debtors. John Evans, a Birmingham interior designer, says: 'Business in the last three months has come back with a vengeance. But the banks won't finance you and they won't release the money. It's not the price of it that's the problem, it's getting it.' Responses are patchy, however. Many accountants say banking facilities can vary widely according to lending terms drawn up by managers with different attitudes to small businesses. Access to funds has not been a problem for Jim Mundell, chairman of United Forgemasters in Dudley, whose forging group has taken on more workers to cope with increased orders. 'We are getting money at a sensible price,' he says. 'There has never been so much money flushing around the system. It is there because people are taking a more responsible attitude to how they're doing their lending.' His view is echoed at UKPS, an environmental engineering company on the Warwick University Science Park. It has changed clearing banks twice in the last 18 months - from National Westminster to Royal Bank of Scotland then to Barclays. 'There are problems but we are not hard up,' says Robert Eden, the managing director. 'When we need more flexibility we can negotiate,' Accountants say that in some cases banks have reduced overdraft ceilings to match the new balances created when debtors have made payments. Mr Elliott said: 'If values of property now start rising and businesses start doing better, there is a danger some banks will pounce to recoup loans by shutting companies down to realise the assets.' According to one Glasgow accountant companies should protect themselves against such eventualities by negotiating with the banks before embarking on expansion. 'It's no good taking a lot of new orders and then going to the bank to ask them to finance an increase in turnover. You've got to get the bank lined up first,' he says. 'The banks are realising that some companies with high working-capital needs are going to have major problems coming out of recession.' Many accountants believe the attitude of the banks could force small businesses to seek alternative funds from Britain's venture capital industry, which is estimated to have reserves of more than Pounds 1bn. Banks say they are into 'relationship lending' and insist no sound business will be starved of working capital. They say there will be tougher scrutiny. Overdrafts will be available for working capital only. Risk capital for new ventures might have to be sought elsewhere. But one banker warned: 'It's going to cost more. Scrutiny is going to push up charges.'</p>

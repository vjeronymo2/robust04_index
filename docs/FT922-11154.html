			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Hyundai shares sale probe SOUTH KOREA'S Securities Supervisory Board (SSB) yesterday said it would investigate the sale of shares in companies from the Hyundai group, the country's second biggest conglomerate, by Mr Chung Ju Yung, its founder. The investigation involves a Won172bn (Pounds 126m) sale of shares in unlisted group companies that Mr Chung offered to employees in January. Mr Chung used the proceeds to finance his new anti-government political party, the Unification National Party (UNP). Mr Chung is alleged to have violated trading rules by having sold the unlisted shares and collected the proceeds prematurely. The sale of unlisted shares must not take place until 20 days after the authorities are notified, but the SSB suspects Mr Chung conducted the sale during the mandatory waiting period. Although the case is considered only a technical violation of share trading rules, the government has been strictly interpreting financial rules pertaining to Hyundai, as part of its recent political conflict with Mr Chung. He sold some of his shares in Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Elevator, Hyundai Housing &amp; Development, Hyundai Merchant Marine and Koryeo Industrial Development. Of the 130,000 workers who took up the offer, employees of Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry were among the biggest purchasers of the shares. The SSB investigation will involve all seven companies. The case stems from a recent investigation of Hyundai Electronics Industries (HEI) by the Office of Bank Supervision to determine whether it illegally used bank loans to finance the UNP.</p>

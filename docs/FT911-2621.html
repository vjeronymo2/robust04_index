			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Justinian: Reform in an area of frailty One in every 10 of the population of this country suffers from mental ill-health during the course of a single year, more than half being severely affected. The mentally-handicapped forms another identifiable, but much smaller, group of adults which needs special care and treatment. Old people  -a growing number in an ageing population - deteriorate in their mental capacity and hence ability to manage their personal lives. In their various ways, all three groups display degrees of mental incapacity which increasingly call for public assistance in coping with their social handicaps, through legal and extra-legal procedures. Tomorrow, the Law Commission is publishing probably its most significant consultation paper on Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision-making. It is a weighty document that is bound to provoke a lively and inevitably protracted debate. The issues are complex, both legally and socially, and touch on fundamental problems of human beings in society. So much so, indeed, that there is a worry that the legislator's pen could potentially inflict a bureaucratic edifice that accompanies any new law in a way that would depersonalise the human condition. While there is at present a plethora of law governing the requirements of treatment - much of it dotted around the statute book - there is a paucity of rules which even touch on, let alone affect, other matters involving medical treatment for non-therapeutic purposes, such as sterilisation, abortion and cosmetic surgery. The absence of declared law was starkly pointed out in a case which was tested all the way up to the House of Lords two years ago. It involved the sterilisation of a severely mentally-handicapped 35-year-old woman. The ultimate ruling of the law lords that such a surgical operation on a woman mentally incapable of giving her consent could lawfully be performed if it was necessary 'in the best interests' of the patient was less than satisfactory. What constitutes the best interests of a patient was left undefined. Moreover, what the judges failed to do was to tell those responsible for the care and treatment of their patients about what the process should be in deciding whether the criteria for lawful intrusion of the individual's body were satisfied. Reformers - and reform appears to be needed in this area of human frailty - point to three basic principles that should govern any prospective legislation. First, the autonomy of the individual must be paramount. People should be enabled, so far as possible, and encouraged to take decisions for themselves. This principle has its main impact on the vexed legal and philosophical question of a person's consent to treatment. Does the patient's agreement to take a specific treatment merely reflect his or her ability or capacity to understand what is being proposed? Or does it involve a real understanding of the nature, purpose and likely effects of the treatment, based upon relevant information supplied to the patient by those proposing to administer the treatment? There are many who would go further by supporting the concept of informed and real consent; they assert that true adherence to autonomy demands that the issue be viewed as a question of a patient's capacity to refuse treatment. If consent or agreement to treatment is the right approach, there is a further point that the process of obtaining that consent should be not episodic, but continual. Consent should never be a snapshot decision. The second principle is that intervention should always be on grounds of necessity and involve the least restrictive form of intrusive treatment. Third, any decision-making for those mentally incapacitated must contain proper safeguards against exploitation by practitioners or the patient's family and relatives. Appropriate safeguards would primarily focus on the need to ensure that the mentally-incapacitated person was present and legally represented in the decision-making process. Vigorous testing of the medical diagnosis and prescribed treatment would have to be an essential feature of any procedural safeguards. The one area of the law which caters tolerably well for mentally-disordered or disabled people is in relation to property and finance as distinct from personal care and treatment. The decision last week of Mr Justice Hoffmann, distrib-uting the Pounds 1.6m estate of a 75-year-old mental patient ad-judged incapable of making a will, demonstrated the scope of legal powers to administer the property affairs of the mentally-incapacitated. The Court of Protection exists to safeguard the interests of anyone who is found on medical evidence to be 'incapable by reason of mental disorder of managing and administering his property and affairs'. The court has been criticised from time to time for its inaccessibility to all but the well-to-do, and even then is regarded as paternalistic in its procedures. At present, it handles 22,000 cases throughout the country by a small staff based in London. The extensive social impact in the framing or shaping of legal rules for handling the affairs of the mentally- incapacitated is such that the Law Commission has approached its mammoth task both tentatively and with sensitivity, aware that, as present constituted, it lacks the requisite expertise outside the law. Its embarking upon a study of such a distinct socio-legal topic will raise once more the exclusive lawyerly composition of the commission. Its consultation paper is peppered with proposals for multi-disciplinary bodies to make decisions on behalf of mentally-incapacitated adults. A multi-disciplinary approach by a body like the Law Commission, dealing with many, if not most, issues of law in modern society would seem likewise to be needed.</p>

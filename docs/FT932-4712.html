			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Losing lots of layers: John Gapper on the reshaping of NatWest's bureaucracy Mr Derek Wanless looks remarkably fresh-faced for a man in charge of a bank, given the unpopularity of the industry. A little over a year after becoming the youngest chief executive of a high street bank, he appears to have weathered the stream of criticism of UK banking with undiminished good cheer and optimism. Mr Wanless, 45, has been an employee of National Westminster Bank since graduating from Cambridge. So he might be expected to display some irritation over attacks on banks for offences as diverse as mixing up credit card charges, increasing fees to customers, and limiting loans to small businesses. But he has his reasons to remain chirpy, as he made clear yesterday in an interview on the changes he has brought about at the UK's second-biggest bank. While NatWest has had its share of criticism from customers - and even staff - it has recently avoided much of the opprobrium over management quality directed by shareholders at its rival, Barclays. Barclays had to announce this spring that it was seeking a new chief executive from outside to convince shareholders that it had made a clean break with the lending mistakes of the 1980s. NatWest had already acted decisively a year before by installing a largely new and young senior management team under Mr Wanless. Mr Wanless has thus been able to conduct management reforms in an atmosphere of relative calm. He emerged as chief executive after Mr Tom Frost stepped aside in March last year to concentrate on his defence to unfounded accusations of deception during a government inquiry into NatWest's part in a rights issue from the Blue Arrow employment group. Mr Wanless demurs at the suggestion that the Blue Arrow affair was a blessing in disguise in allowing NatWest to reshuffle senior management. 'I'm the wrong person to ask,' he says, in what remains a distinct north-eastern accent. 'But I find it very hard to think that what we went through for all those years was worth it.' Some of the new generation have come from outside. Mr Richard Goeltz, the chief financial officer and an American, joined last year from Seagram, the US drinks group. Mr Stuart Chandler, in charge of strategic development, came from the Bank of England. Mr Wanless has won respect in the industry, both because of his intellectual pedigree - he has a first-class degree in mathematics - and because he appears to understand most parts of what is a complex business. But High street banks are not easy institutions to change quickly. 'When I first came I had not seen so many layers of bureaucracy since I read Milton's Paradise Lost,' says one senior manager. 'There were archangels and angels, and seraphim and cherubim everywhere I looked.' The bank's entrenched conservatism is one reason why Mr Wanless argues that it would be counter-productive to impose changes too rapidly for staff to understand and assimilate. 'Most of the things we are trying are intended to improve service, but there is a danger that in putting those things into practice, you have exactly the opposite effect,' he says. This caution means that, although NatWest under Mr Wanless has displayed willingness to cut its vast array of businesses - shedding retail banking in France, Japanese domestic equity operations and US credit card merchandising in the US - some doubt remains about whether the bank is willing to take the most painful decisions, such as disposing of larger operations, if they prove necessary. Technological innovations in retail banking, including telephone banking, raise questions about whether banks such as NatWest will be able to reduce costs quickly enough to avoid being undercut by new forms of competition. Even the 7,000 job losses last year, and the 4,000 expected this year might not be radical enough. Mr Wanless rejects the suggestion that NatWest is too cautious to change at the speed required. 'There is no limit to the size of decision we would be prepared to make were it right for the bank,' he says. As evidence, he points to the recent flow of divestments in markets where it does not have 'a substantial enough starting point from which to develop'. The most important change has been is to reduce the size of the management group to which the bank's four main businesses report. These operations - UK branch banking, international business, US branch banking, and the NatWest Markets investment bank - are monitored by a head office staff that has been cut from 400 to 150, excluding staff in obligatory roles such as auditing. This group is split into three functions: Mr Chandler's human resources and strategic development; Mr Goeltz's performance management; and a group risk function under Mr John Melbourn. The idea is to enable the bank to have a clearer view of what businesses it should be in and how these should be operated. Mr Goeltz has been working on new performance measures to avoid a repetition of past mistakes. Part of this involves developing what Mr Wanless calls 'measures of long-term health' of NatWest's various operations. These measures include asset quality, unit costs, customer satisfaction and staff motivation. While some of these are 'soft' measures, others such as asset quality will be reflected directly in the profit and loss account in future years. Mr Wanless says unit costs are particularly important because they indicate the strength of the bank's defences against competitors which use technology to undercut its higher-cost operations on price. Yet he also thinks these measures will prevent the bank from adopting a short-term view, for example by cutting costs in ways that damage service and demoralise staff. The question is whether such a broad view of performance will deliver the sustained increase in returns on capital which all banks are now seeking. The alternative might be a gradual break-up of operations within the old unwieldy bank which Mr Wanless wants to slim down rather than divide. NatWest's chief executive thinks his bank can achieve results in line with companies in other sectors - given the reforms and greater economic stability. Lloyds Bank, recently the most successful clearing bank, has made its mark by emphasising shareholder value. But Mr Wanless says NatWest needs to please staff and customers too. 'It is too easy to say that in the long run all these things go together, but there is a considerable element of truth to it, especially in a service industry,' he says.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: LIG shares fall on sale of lossmaker Shares in London Inter-national Group fell 5p to 116p yesterday after the company said it had agreed to sell ColourCare International, its lossmaking photo-processing business, to a management buy-out for a nominal amount. LIG, which makes Durex condoms and Biogel and Marigold gloves, said the disposal was an essential part of the group's restructuring plan. LIG last month warned that it faced the near elimination of its net assets by a 'very substantial' restructuring charge for the year to March. Yesterday the group said this sale would lead to a substantial write-off, including goodwill of Pounds 47.5m. The net assets transferred to Boots had a book value of Pounds 32m. The company said the terms of the transaction reflected the poor performance of ColourCare, which was expected to have incurred an operating loss of Pounds 10.5m for the year to March. The sale does not include the 257 minilab operations located in stores of the Boots Group. Negotiations are being held with Boots regarding the future of this part of the business. 'In the meantime, it is expected that the effect on LIG of retaining the minilab business will be broadly neutral in terms of both cash and profits,' the company said. ColourCare, which will continue to trade under the same name, was sold to the management team free of debt and leasing commitments, but with trade debtors and creditors. LIG has agreed to loan the MBO team Pounds 6m for 18 months, which will be interest-free for the first year. The sale, which is subject to shareholders' approval, ends a disastrous attempt by LIG's former management to diversify into photoprocessing. It has cost between Pounds 60m and Pounds 70m in acquisition and rationalisation costs over the last 12 years and gave the group a 30 per cent share of a now sharply declining market. One analyst said: 'ColourCare was haemorrhaging cash. We thought they'd have to give it away, and they have. But there's relief that they have done it.' LIG said it was likely to announce a rights issue and new banking arrangements in June, when it publishes its results for the year to March which are expected eliminate net assets of Pounds 120m. Net debt is thought to have reached between Pounds 160m and Pounds 200m. Last month Mr Nick Hodges, the new chief executive, announced a restructuring, foreshadowed in December, which involved the closure of three UK plants and the loss of 1,000 jobs followed by another 1,000 losses worldwide. The group also sold its Buttercup, Liqufruta and Galloway's cough mixture brands. Mr Hodges said yesterday: 'We have every confidence in the success of our strategy of focusing on our global condom and specialist gloves business.'</p>

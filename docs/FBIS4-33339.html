			<p>BFN     [Text] Cochabamba, Bolivia 1 Jun (EFE) -- The preparatory  meeting for the "International Decade of the World's Indigeous  People" closed today in Cochabamba, Bolivia, with the approval  of a document to be submitted to the United Nations.    The document contains 53 resolutions vindicating the  cultural  identity of indigenous peoples, along with their political,  social and economic rights.    Guatemalan Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu presided  over the meeting which started on 31 May. She stated today that  indigenous peoples hope their demands will be formally  recognized by all UN member-countries.    Menchu said the resolutions approved in Cochabamba will  become mandatory for all countries worldwide once they are  approved by the UN General Assembly.    Commenting on what transpired during the meeting in  Cochabamba, some 400 km east of La Paz, Bolivian Vice President  Victor Hugo Cardenas -- himself an Aymara Indian -- said:  "Indigenous peoples can achieve development without renouncing  their own culture."    The "International Decade of the World's Indigenous People"  starts on 10 December 1994 and closes on 9 December 2004.    Beside Menchu and Cardenas, 120 delegates from diverse  indigenous communities and government organizations from  different countries attended the meeting in Cochabamba.</p>

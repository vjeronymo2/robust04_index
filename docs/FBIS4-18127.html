			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Frank Wehner commentary: "Inappropriate"] </F>   [Text] Did Kohl want to go to Normandy or did he not?  After long guesswork, now there came a clear German no. The  chancellor never thought of attending the celebrations on the  50th anniversary of the Allied landing; it would be  "inappropriate."    Well then: On 6 June, almost all of Europe will celebrate,  and the supreme European ducks his head and lifts it only two  days later for the reconciliation event in Heidelberg.    One does not feel comfortable about that. However, on the  other hand, this is better for everyone. Kohl would just feel  uncomfortable at Omaha Beach, and one would hardly know what to  do with him. At home all those would be angry with him who  still consider the "invasion" as an ignominy. Those, on the  other hand, who see D-Day as an important step toward the  liberation from fascism would have to be afraid that Kohl does  something embarrassing.    Or does anyone remember that he has ever been brilliant at  any event that dealt with the fascist past? As much as one  ponders, the only thing that comes to mind is the ghostly event  at the soldiers' cemetery of Bitburg. Yes, if there were still  Willy Brandt or if there were still any politicians who never  had problems in Volgograd! Kohl, however, likes to present  himself in many shapes, but no one has ever got the idea of  seeing him as the personification of antifascism. If he had  ended up at the Atlantic beach on 6 June, he would indeed have  stood around there as the representative of the vanquished.    No, June is not a good month. Only in late summer will Kohl  thrive again. Then he will wave farewell to the last Russians,  forgiving them for their grandfathers' having once come to our  country. Shortly afterwards, Berlin will be completely free from  the Allies. This is a way of coping with history that Kohl likes.    However, in May 1995 things will get delicate again. Oh, why  do we not have a chancellor whom we can show on all days! It  would be appropriate.</p>

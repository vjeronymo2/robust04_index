			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers resist pressure over oil tax plan THE CONSERVATIVE government is determined to face down backbench calls for a revision of proposed changes to the North Sea tax regime - even if it means suffering an embarrassing committee-stage defeat. The 36-strong standing committee that will consider the Finance Bill appears to contain a majority of MPs in favour of changing the government's Budget proposals in line with a suggestion by Mr John Butterfill, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East. Mr Butterfill has tabled an amendment to the bill that would provide some transitional relief for oil companies affected by the changes. The relief would be paid for by levying for a limited time a higher rate of petroleum revenue tax than the government proposes. But ministers insisted yesterday, ahead of today's Commons debate, that PRT would be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, as set out in the Budget, and that tax relief for exploratory drilling would be abolished. The government indicated that its proposals would be enacted even if changes passed in committee had to be reversed at the report stage. Some companies have said that the government's changes would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs. Ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the arguments advanced by the offshore supply industry, which fears the consequences of diminished exploration activity by their oil company customers. But ministers believe many of these companies are large and sophisticated enough to follow oil producers to other exploration sites if necessary. Ministers also argue that the supply industry will benefit from the surge in production they expect to follow enactment of the proposals. Some support for this view came yesterday when British Petroleum said it would bring forward a Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 2bn oil development project because of the proposed PRT changes. The company said yesterday its plans had been given 'significant impetus' by the tax changes. The project, which involves BP and eight other companies, will develop nine oil and gas fields containing 650m barrels of oil and 1,200bn cubic feet of gas. The improvement in the economics of the project mean production will start in 1998. BP said that under the old tax regime three of the fields would have paid PRT, making them less profitable. The government is also expected to argue today that changing its proposals now would penalise companies whose forward-planning had accommodated what was announced in the Budget. It is likely also to argue that the tax has actually cost the Treasury some Pounds 900m in the past two years. Gamble in the North Sea, Page 17</p>

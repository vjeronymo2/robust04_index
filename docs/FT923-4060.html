			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nordic paths diverge COHABITATION WITH Germany inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism when the D-mark is prone to powerful upward lurches against the dollar is no picnic. Living outside the ERM while trying to abide by its rules is even worse, to judge by the maelstrom that has consumed the Nordic economies. Yesterday the Finns reluctantly concluded, with Oscar Wilde, that consistency is one of the seven deadly virtues. Having busily activated their swap accords with the Bundesbank over the past week to defend the currency, they suddenly abandoned the attempt to maintain a fixed parity with the Ecu. The markka saw an instant de facto devaluation of about 13 per cent - its second devaluation in less than a year. The Swedish central bank, meantime, was forced to raise its key marginal lending rate by no less than 8 points to 24 per cent in order to cope with the currency market pressure that followed the neighbouring country's decision to float. Yet the two countries confront remarkably similar economic problems, among them, debt deflation, negative growth and rising unemployment. It follows that their respective exchange rate policies are unlikely both to be right. The striking feature of the Swedish response to recent economic events is that it looks like a re-run of the 1930s in reverse. Then, Sweden escaped from recession, as did Britain, through a policy of competitive devaluation. It built on its success in the post-war period by developing a welfare state that came to be regarded as the key component of a model social democracy. Yet its present plight derives from having too much of these two good things. In the 1970s and 1980s public expenditure took a disproportionately large share of gross domestic product, while devaluation failed to solve problems of declining competitiveness. Subsequent difficulties have been compounded by the 1980s credit boom which caused a property bubble. Today Sweden shares with its Nordic neighbours the highest real rates of interest in Europe and a lower rate of inflation than Germany. It is trying to reduce a budget deficit now approaching 8 per cent of GDP. Yet the present disinflationary policy of shadowing the Ecu is ill-designed to permit a significant transfer of resources into the tradeable goods sector, without which the economic growth that will make the public finances manageable is unlikely to be forthcoming. Against a background of debt deflation and weak labour markets, the inflationary consequences of devaluation should not be too threatening, provided a firm grip is kept on public spending. In the case of Finland, which last year suffered a 6 1/2 per cent fall in GDP largely because of the loss of trade with the former Soviet Union, higher prices will help in distributing the resulting real income losses. Even if the Swedish authorities are able to make modest reductions in nominal interest rates before too long, it is hard to see how the deflationary impact of continuing high real rates of interest will provide an escape from economic stagnation. Nor will it do much to re-establish the credibility of the currency. No doubt Sweden wishes to keep its options open in relation to the European Community. But the cost is high and the message for others discouraging. The flight from the krona after the Finnish float gives some indication of what might hit sterling if the Italian Lira is the subject of a unilateral downward realignment. And the failure of competitive disinflation to deliver economic growth in Sweden is something that the British Treasury might also ponder with profit.</p>

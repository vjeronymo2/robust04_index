			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: OFFICIAL SUSPENDED: SLOW RESPONSE ON FUMBLE  </P> <P> The National Football League has suspended, at least through this weekend, the  instant-replay official whose failure to act quickly on Jerry Rice's fumble  Oct. 8 gave San Francisco an unwarranted touchdown.  </P> <P> Gaylord Bryan made what the league called a "procedural error" in not  determining whether to study the play "in a timely fashion."  </P> <P> Commissioner Pete Rozelle will review Bryan's situation and decide whether any  further action should be taken. Bill Barron, the communicator in the booth  responsible for contact with the field officials, was not disciplined.  </P> <P> "They miss calls every day," said Eddie DeBartolo Jr., the 49ers' owner.  "Everybody's entitled to a mistake. If everybody's perfect, it wouldn't be any  fun."  </P> <P> Bryan was in the replay booth when Rice appeared to fumble at the New Orleans  one-yard line. The 49er receiver appeared ready to spike the ball, which fell  out of his hand and went out of the end zone. According to NFL rules, the ball  should have been awarded to the Saints at the point of the fumble. Before Bryan  called for a review, however, the 49ers kicked the extra point, and Bryan and  Barron let the touchdown stand.  </P></p>

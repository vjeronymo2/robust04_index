Addressing a meeting  in Wellington, DP candidate Hennie Bester proposed that parties  take urgent steps to prevent the situation from getting out of  hand. In another development the DP has dropped its plans to  open an information office on the campus of the University of  the Western Cape because the police are unable to give them  protection.    [Begin DP Youth Wing Chairman Colin Douglas recording] We  have no option but to cancel our events here. We are having an  emergency meeting today to see what we can do about the  situation, but right now it doesn't look like there's much  prospect of a free election here. [end recording]</p>

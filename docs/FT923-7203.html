			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report GOLD eased to Dollars 336.15 a troy ounce on the London bullion market while PLATINUM cut earlier losses after Nymex futures edged off early lows. 'Gold seems to be in real limbo at the moment. I wouldn't be surprised to see a range between Dollars 330 and Dollars 340 for some time,' one dealer said. Platinum opened around Dollars 4 below Tuesday's close at Dollars 343 to Dollars 344 after a sharp fall in the Nikkei share index overnight increased fears of falling demand from Japan, the world's largest platinum importer. A report from South Africa's Impala that world consumption would slightly exceed production in 1992 for the second successive year failed to boost prices. London COFFEE and COCOA both reversed the morning's weaker trends as their New York counterparts discovered good trade buying where further long speculator liquidation had been expected. However traders did not think the afternoon's rallies marked the start of concrete recoveries; more fundamental support was needed before either could be said to have turned the corner. In Chicago WHEAT came under pressure early on from the news that Canada had suspended grain shipments to Russia.</p>

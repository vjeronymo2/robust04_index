			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PIED PIPER OF 'PIPELINE' RIDING HIGH;  </P> <P> DICK DALE'S DEL-TONES SAVOR THE SURGE OF '60S PROPULSIVE SURF ROCK  </P> <P> The essence of surf music has been obscured by all the lightweight imagery that  went with it back when the Southern California dream was being retailed to an  eager nation: Frankie and Annette, beach blanket bingo, fun fun fun in the  California sun.  </P> <P> All those trappings may have helped sell surf music back in its early-'60s  heyday, but it is the core musical notion behind the style that makes it worth  listening to now. The idea was to infuse a rock instrumental with the feeling  of being caught up in a wild, elemental surge.  </P> <P> As the prime inventor of surf-guitar music, Dick Dale is not likely to neglect  that essence. It has been more than 30 years since he created the style in the  long-vanished dance halls of Balboa and Huntington Beach. But playing Friday  night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano with his current bunch of  backing Del-Tones, Dale showed that he still knows how to take his guitar on a  wild, dramatic ride.  </P> <P> Dale's two 50-minute sets covered the lighthearted, beach party aspect of his  genre with honking, horn-driven R&amp;B numbers, '50s rock classics and a few  of his own more chirpy oldies. But the real thrills came when Dale, 51, set the  bouncier stuff aside and got down to blazing dramatics.  </P> <P> After quickie renditions of a couple of his lighter signature tunes, "Let's Go  Trippin' " and "Mr. Peppermint Man," Dale began to play definitive surf rock  that featured fast, staccato picking, reverb-soaked tone and careening slides  down the neck of his old, gold-spangled Fender Stratocaster. It all came  together on a propulsive "Surf Beat," then continued as Dale changed the mood  to flamenco-style grandeur during a fine, shifting number that alternated  between flurrying riffing and slow, stately Spanish motifs.  </P> <P> The segment closed at a gallop, featuring the Del-Tones' punchy young  three-piece horn section.  </P> <P> At the end of the early set, Dale and rhythm guitarist Ron Eglit got into some  fiery dueling as they replayed the "Pipeline" guitar duet that won Dale and  Stevie Ray Vaughan a 1987 Grammy nomination (the Vaughan-Dale guitar shoot-out  is the closing track on a new, 18-song Rhino Records CD release, "King of the  Surf Guitar: The Best of Dick Dale &amp; His Del-Tones").  </P> <P> The ideal way to see Dale in concert might be in one of those old-time rock 'n'  roll revues of the early to mid-'60s, where each act got to display its best  stuff for 15 minutes or half an hour. Then the set could be one driving wave,  with maybe a couple of jaunty numbers like "Let's Go Trippin' " thrown in for  relief between surges.  </P> <P> But Dale and the Del-Tones also had a good-time, dance-band function to  fulfill. They did a capable job of it, judging from the lively dance-floor  traffic through most of the show (when the "Peter Gunn" theme turned out to be  a crowd favorite, Dale took his band through three different renditions of it).  </P> <P> Dale, looking like a craggy-faced John Wayne under his black cowboy hat, played  most of the show off the cuff, singing a snippet of one song, then launching  abruptly into another. A round-the-world routine in which Dale played just  about every instrument on the band stand, including trumpet, keyboards and  drums, had more shtick value than musical appeal.  </P> <P> Dale's audience ranged from old-time fans to fashionable, scrubbed-looking kids  who would not have looked out of place at a Depeche Mode show. Being a local  hero probably helps his continuing appeal, but Dale's playing remains a strong  attraction on its merits, and a must-see for guitar aficionados.  </P> <P> The surf-guitar style may be historic, but the wild rides Dale takes with it  are by no means history.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mikhal Sela'] </F>   [Text] The United States is considering the possibility of  opening an official representative institution in the Gaza Strip  after the withdrawal of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops from  the area. This was reported yesterday to DAVAR by a Gaza Strip  Palestinian who meets with Americans on a regular basis.    U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian toured the Gaza Strip 15  February and met with local Palestinian leaders.  Representatives of foreign embassies conduct weekly visits to  the Gaza Strip. It has not yet been decided whether or not to  open a consulate, culture center, or some other form of official  representation; however, the issue is occasionally discussed by  U.S. diplomats and Palestinian officials. The Americans have  already told the Palestinians that whatever form the  representation takes, it will not be established before progress  is made in implementing the Palestinian-Israeli agreement.    France and the United Kingdom maintain culture centers in  the  Gaza Strip. Representatives of various European countries are  also discussing the possibility of opening legations --  consulates, culture centers, or other institutions -- in the  Gaza Strip with local Palestinian officials.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Don Lyons] </F>   [Text] The Shenzhen government has embarked on a  collision course with the central Chinese government by claiming  it will not change the 20 per cent fee it charges developers on  the profits on the sale of a property.    During a recent Shenzhen property exhibition at the China  Resources Exhibition Hall, lawyer Zhang Zhuan Jiang of the  Shenzhen Land Planning Bureau said his government had sent a  report to the central government telling it "of our intent to  retain the current 20 percent policy".    The central government has announced plans to implement a  Land Appreciation Tax (LAT) on the profits of developers and  property investors. However, the government has not yet  announced how the tax will be implemented or how much it would  allow developers to make before implementing the tax. Mr Zhang  said irrespective of details of the LAT, Shenzhen would argue  "it was a special case" and need not necessarily abide by the  LAT.    He said Shenzhen authorities had emphasised to the central  government that their 20 per cent fee had been in place since  1988 and they must "ensure the continuity of their policy".    Mr Zhang said Shenzhen officials believed that since  investors and developers took a lot of risks in building their  projects, they should be guaranteed a certain amount of profit  before implementing the LAT. "So, the 20 per cent profit is  reasonable," he said.    The Shenzhen lawyer said he hoped the local government would  be provided with "sufficient leeway" in implementing details of  the tax and that it would be allowed to be flexible in applying  the tax.    Mr Zhang said the LAT had not deterred developers in  Shenzhen.    "Before, we had four levels of tax. This one tax is less  than before. So, the 20 per cent fee has not had a negative  impact on development," he said.    According to one Shenzhen official, property development is  the single biggest industry in the economic development zone.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA) -- The State Economic  Restructuring Commission and the State Council's Securities  Commission recently formulated supplementary provisions on  selling fixed amounts of shares to employees by joint stock  limited companies which raise funds from society. A relevant  official in charge of the State Economic Restructuring  Commission said: The enactment of these provisions was  necessitated by the absence of unified provisions regarding the  time when fixed amounts of shares sold to employees by companies  that raise funds from society can be listed and transferred  after the companies offer their shares to the public. Most  provinces and municipalities now have listed companies. The  formulation of unified national provisions are essential for  strengthening the management of stock markets according to  prescribed norms.    It has been disclosed that the "Opinions on Standardizing  Joint Stock Limited Companies" promulgated by the State Economic  Restructuring Commission in 1992 and the "Interim Regulations on  the Management of Stock Issuance and Trading" promulgated by the  State Council in 1993 contain clauses regarding the sale of  fixed amounts of shares to employees by joint stock limited  companies that raise funds from society. Because of the  continuous development and improvement of stock markets, these  clauses have become incompatible with the new situation. For  this reason, the two commissions formulated the supplementary  provisions. According to the provisions, joint stock limited  companies that raise funds from society may sell less than 10  percent of their shares to their employees without exceeding the  stock volume approved by the state for issuance. The prices of  shares offered to their employees should be the same as those of  shares offered to the public. They should obtain the consent of  state securities administrative departments regarding their  issuance methods. Principal organizations tasked with issuing  shares should do so within the issuing period in accordance with  relevant agreements. Shares sold to employees may be listed and  transferred within six months after the companies have issued  their shares to the public and listed them on stock exchanges.  If a company and a stock exchange have entered into an  agreement that specifies a period longer than six months, the  shares sold to employees should be listed and transferred  according to the agreement.    During a recent interview by this reporter with regard to  the  supplementary provisions, a relevant official in charge of the  State Economic Restructuring Commission's Production Structure  Department said emphatically: Companies that raise funds from  society may issue less than 10 percent of their shares to  employees without exceeding the stock volume approved by the  state for issuance. While company employees may buy fixed  amounts of shares, individuals in society can only buy shares  through lot-drawing after purchasing subscription forms or  depositing money. These two types of subscribers are permitted  to list their shares at different times because their chances  for buying shares vary.    The official said emphatically: Employees allowed to buy  shares are largely those stipulated in the "Provisions on the  Management of Share-holdings by Employees in Joint Stock Limited  Companies That Raise Funds from Specific Sources" promulgated by  the State Economic Restructuring Commission on 3 July 1993.  However, we should take account of the fact that only some  assets held in stock by some long-established, state-owned  enterprises and some of their employees become part of the joint  stock limited companies reorganized from those enterprises. To  inspire the enthusiasm of employees in state-owned enterprises  and to facilitate smooth progress in reorganization, companies  may include employees hired by the original enterprises among  those allowed to buy shares with the approval of departments in  charge of examining and approving companies.    The official said: Prior to the enactment of new provisions  by the state, a joint stock limited company that shifts from  funding by specific sources to funding by the public may convert  its employees' shares into public shares without exceeding 10  percent of the stock volume approved by the state for issuance.  These shares may only be listed and transferred three years  after they were sold to employees. Shares exceeding 10 percent  of the state-approved volume should be regarded as shares sold  to employees; they may not be transferred or traded and will  only allow holders to share in dividends.</p>

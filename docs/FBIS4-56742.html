			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 7 May (EFE) -- Today, the Bolivian Labor  Federation (COB) and the government signed an agreement to end  several weeks of stoppages, hunger strikes, violent  demonstrations, military deployments in the streets, and  roadblocks on all the country's highways. The COB, however, did  not want to include the government's last wage offer, which the  COB considered unsatisfactory, in the signed agreement.    The government's pledges not to raise the price of fuel and  to guarantee job stability for public employees are among the  highlights of the agreement signed early this morning. The  government also pledged to build 10,000 "social interest"  housing units for low-income families. In exchange, the COB set  aside all pressure tactics, which have paralyzed the country for  several weeks and placed it on the brink of a state of siege.    As for the wage demands, the government offered to raise the  national minimum wage from 160 bolivianos a month ($34) to 190  bolivianos ($41). It also offered a 12-percent raise to health  workers and teachers, a 9-percent raise for those earning less  than 1,000 bolivianos a month ($216), and a 6-percent raise for  those earning more than that. The COB turned down those  proposals as its wage demand is based on a national minimum wage  of 400 bolivianos ($86) a month. The average wage for teachers,  for example, is currently 350 bolivianos a month ($75). The  government plans to implement the new salary rates even though  the COB turned down the wage offer. At the conclusion of  negotiations with the government, the COB warned that a new  social conflict may flare up in a few days over the education  reform bill.</p>

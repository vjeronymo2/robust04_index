			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Carving profits from the ancient limestone - Clive Fewins visits an ancient quarry which is suddenly chic A DEEPLY rutted lane with grass in the middle so high that it scrapes the bottom of your vehicle. Skylarks flutter overhead and the odd hare scampers away from the motor car. There is one other noise, however, that can just be heard in the quiet of the Gloucestershire countryside when the car's engine is switched off. It is the sound of stone being sawn. Round the next corner and you will be confronted by Farmington quarry, worked on the same site - perhaps continuously - since the Romans built sections of the nearby Fosse way from its Cotswold limestone. There is stone everywhere - mountains of it, honey coloured and coarse grained, from huge two ton blocks waiting to be sawn into slabs, to walling stone being laboriously hand prepared by masons. The pristine stone looks as if it was laid down yesterday, not 200m years ago. Most of it comes from just below the surface, with reserves so vast that no member of the Barrow family that has owned and worked it since 1902, has bothered to estimate their extent. They have not needed to. Until five years ago the quarry was a quiet sideline to the Barrow's 1,000 acre farm, keeping half a dozen men employed, serving as home to around 50 cats, and managed by a long-serving character called Sam. 'Sam was a very efficient manager. He ran the quarry expertly for 35 years, trading with the people he chose to and making a 20-25 per cent profit,' said Captain John Barrow, the present head of the enterprise. However things are very different now for the soldier-turned farmer-turned quarryman. Sam's retirement coincided with a sticky time for the Barrow family's farming fortunes. Growing corn was rapidly proving unprofitable and John Barrow decided to reduce gradually the workforce on the farm from 20 to two, increase his flock of sheep and take a set aside payment on 500 acres from the European Community, under the Common Agricultural Policy which pays farmers to not use land. His really big decision, however, was to expand the quarry side of the business by joining forces with a masonry company in Bristol which would provide a ready buyer for the expanded output of stone he planned to extract from the quarry. At the same time he ploughed much of the family's accumulated wealth into new quarry buildings and cutting equipment which cost a total of nearly Pounds 500,000. Life thereafter became somewhat troubled when, after only 18 months, the arrangement fell apart following personal differences and Barrow found himself without a partner, with the new building and most of the new equipment onstream, and no obvious large outlet to sell to. He decided to buy out the Bristol company. Fortunately, as head of a wealthy family, he possessed the Pounds 500,000 to do it. He hired an accountant, Martin Robins, to help him run the company, moved the entire operation to Farmington and took on a number of apprentices under the guiding hand of master mason Peter Lee, who has been with the company 39 years. 'It was the biggest decision I have yet had to face. But we were more than halfway through the expansion programme, the recession had not yet hit us, and there was a big comfort factor in the form of a Pounds 750,000 contract (on a large Bristol development) that was very profitable,' Barrow said. The only way to go therefore was forward, and Barrow braced himself for the looming recession. If necessary, family wealth - the Barrows own most of Farmington village as well as the estate - would doubtless have cushioned any blow. But changing fashions worked unexpectedly in their favour. 'By 1989 we were living in greener days and already there was a demand from many architects - particularly those working for some of the large retailing and supermarket groups - for a return to real stone in many of the buildings in new shopping developments,' Barrow said. 'In a number of cases we were actually able to persuade architects to specify real stone rather than the reconstituted material that had been in vogue for so many years,' said Barrow. Barrow and Robins, the accountant, set up a contracting company, Ferris Stone and Barrow also started a design and drawing section in temporary buildings at the quarry. From the base of the five large portable buildings the staff of 35 now runs two companies with a combined turnover of well over Pounds 2m. Ferris Stone, with a turnover of Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.5m soon overtook Farmington Stone, with its Pounds 750,00 turn over - hardly surprising as it is a contracting and stone fixing company that, using largely subcontracted labour, carries out site work all over the country. In spite of the recession, which is especially bad in the building industry, business has held up well. Remarkably, Barrow and his staff have been able to produce artefacts such as architraves, fireplaces and garden ornaments in stone at the same price, and in some cases cheaper, than their imitators in artificial reconstituted (moulded) stone. There have been two reasons for this. The first is the high cost of making moulds for the artificial material, particularly for one-offs and small runs, and the other is the company's current policy of going for maximum volume and low profit margins. 'This policy makes us very competitive with artificial stone producers but at the wrong margins,' Barrow said. 'However we shall be in a strong position when the recession comes to and end. We have three apprentices nearing the end of their training, ample capacity - our plant is about half used at present - to cope with the upturn, and of course, virtually infinite resources in terms of our wonderful raw material - golden Cotswold limestone.'

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / International Company News: LTV registers further losses LTV, the large US steel group which has been in bankruptcy proceedings since 1986, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 43.3m, due mainly to the weakness of the US steel market. The loss compared with one of Dollars 46.3m a year ago. Group sales dipped from Dollars 1.43bn to Dollars 1.39bn, due to the exclusion this quarter of a vehicle manufacturing subsidiary, AM General, which has been sold. Sales were up Dollars 88.6m on the previous year, stripping out the effect of the sale. The two other leading US steel manufacturers, USX and Bethlehem, also reported continued losses this week, though both these companies managed to reduce the red ink in their steel operations. LTV reported a small rise in steel operating losses, from Dollars 48.8m to Dollars 52.6m, on sales which rose 9 per cent to Dollars 869.6m and shipments up 14 per cent to 1.75m tons. The group said the steel losses reflected lower selling prices, a less favourable product mix and higher employment costs, mainly from increased hourly wages and incentives under its current labour pact. The group's aerospace and defence business, in the process of being sold for Dollars 450m to Thomson-CSF of France and Washington's Carlyle Group, made Dollars 9.4m on sales of Dollars 455.8m, compared to Dollars 7.3m on sales of Dollars 549.5m a year ago. The 1992 figures excluded results for AM General. The sale of the defence business still has to be approved by the US Government's Committee on Foreign Investment, an inter-agency review panel. Many Congressmen have expressed opposition to the sale, on the grounds that it could mean the leaking of delicate defence secrets. Two military contractors which lost the bidding race for the LTV unit - Martin Marietta and Lockheed - are also lobbying for the sale to be blocked.</p>

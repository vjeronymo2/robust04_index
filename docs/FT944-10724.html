			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Agnellis strengthen Danone link The Agnelli family yesterday strengthened its links with Danone, the French food group, by buying a 12 per cent stake in Danone Asia for Dollars 53m. The acquisition was carried out by Ifil, the Agnellis' quoted industrial holding company in Italy, and Exor, which is linked to Ifi, the family's investment vehicle. Danone Asia is a holding company for Danone's food interests in 12 countries, including India, Malaysia, New Zealand and China, with headquarters in Singapore. It claims to be the market leader in biscuits in Asia and has a strong position in the yoghurt sector, cooked dishes and sauces. Its turnover in 1993, according to Ifil, was about L700bn (Dollars 450m). The deal follows last month's announcement of planned changes in the ownership of Saint Louis, the French food and paper group, which has a small stake in Danone. Saint Louis shareholders have been asked to approve a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 288m) capital increase reserved exclusively for Ifil. The operation would raise Ifil's stake in the company to 25.9 per cent from 15.7 per cent, and dilute the stake of Worms, the French holding group, to 27.8 per cent from 31.6 per cent. Ifil is to pay for half the increase in cash and half in shares of the Danone parent company, increasing Saint Louis' stake in the food group to 3.8 per cent, and keeping Ifil's indirect stake at just under 6 per cent.</p>

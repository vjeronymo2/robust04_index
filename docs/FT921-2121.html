			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual stocks continue to generate interest ONCE AGAIN, individual stocks generated the most interest yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was still nervous, marking time ahead of today's simultaneous expiry of four major options and futures contracts, but news and comment moved some shares. In banks, Bayernverein fell DM4.50 to DM421 in response to a one-for-ten rights issue at DM350; in chemicals, Schering which dropped another DM13.60 to DM835.50 on the expected official refusal to permit the sale of oral contraceptives in Japan. In carmakers, further press speculation about US problems for Volkswagen left the shares DM6.10 lower at DM360.40, while Porsche's lack of prospects left it DM19 down at DM570. However, BMW ended relatively strong on the day, DM1 higher at DM554.50 on 1991 profits slightly higher than forecast. After a 3.66 fall to 700.79 in the FAX index at midsession, the DAX closed 7.55 lower at 1,724.63. Turnover eased from DM4.3bn to DM4.0bn with Asko, the discount retailer, accounting for DM314m of that as it took third place among the most active stocks. Asko denied rumours that friends were pushing up the stock ahead of its planned rights issue which, it told analysts, will not happen until this autumn. There were also suggestions that a big buyer was around, taking a positive attitude to the company's exceptionally high financial gearing. PARIS followed domestic bonds lower on a growing consensus that market expectations of lower European interest rates had been premature. The Cac-40 index fell 6.19 to 1,921.99, off a high of 1,935.28, in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Among bigger stocks, Euro Disney slipped FFr21.0 to FFr161.30 on profit-taking triggered by the leisure stock's anticipated entry into the CAC-40 index. On the way up, LVMH added FFr9 to FFr4,499 after reporting results in line with expectations. Some dealers said the stock was attractive at current levels in spite of confirmation that Japanese demand for its cognac and luggage has fallen back this year. Smaller stocks were active, with Esso France jumping FFr22 or 3.1 per cent to FFr730 after Wednesday's doubling of the dividend. Volume in Moulinex was bloated by a large put-through of 113,000 shares by UBS for its own account. The stock eased FFr2.10 to FFr182.90 in total volume of 131,000 shares. MILAN continued to rise, but volume remained thin ahead of the batch of 1991 results over the next few weeks and the general election in April. The Comit index rose 4.25 to 514.34 in turnover estimated at L95bn after L87.1bn. Consob suspended the ordinary and savings shares of the state-controlled holding company Sifa pending details of the group's role in enabling a stock market listing for its parent company, Finmeccanica. Among industrials, Fiat closed L67 higher at L4,913 and Pirelli L32 higher at L1,229. Saipem, the oil industry services company seen as a turnround situation, was steady at L1,640 ahead of an analysts' meeting today. AMSTERDAM's sheaf of results did little to excite general interest and the CBS Tendency Index rose only 0.4 to 126.0. Hoogovens slipped after the steel group said it was to omit its dividend, but the stock recovered to close up 70 cents at Fl 52.30. Analysts said that the extraordinary charges it had taken to reorganise parts of its operations were lower than feared. Volmac, the software group, advanced 6.5 per cent following better-than-expected results, closing up Fl 1.90 to Fl 30.90, while Boskalis, the world's largest dredging company, firmed 20 cents to Fl 26.10 on a 52 per cent rise in net profits. Nedlloyd lost Fl 3.9 or 6 per cent to Fl 59.40 after two of its creditors, ABN and ING, said on Wednesday that they would be converting loans into shares. Heineken set yet another record high, closing up Fl 3.7 or nearly 2 per cent to Fl 190.50. Analysts said that buy recommendations from the US and UK have helped to stimulate activity. Elsevier declined Fl 1.70 to Fl 116.0 ahead of today's results. ZURICH saw active buying in Brown Boveri as the SPI index rose 6.9 to 1,140. Brown Boveri bearers rose SFr120 to SFr3,760; the company owns half of the Swedish-Swiss ABB, whose annual press conference pleased markets on Wednesday. STOCKHOLM registered record volume of SKr1.73bn as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 5.2 to 1,007.7. Asea B rose SKr11 to SKr350 on its share in ABB's fortunes, while SKr560m worth of Sandvik A were traded at SKr410 each. Dealers believed that the 1.3m A shares, 2.5 per cent of the equity and over 3 per cent of the votes, were sold by Custos to Skanska. BRUSSELS fell slightly: the Bel-20 index closing down 3.52 to 1,204.54. Banque Bruxelles Lambert closed down BFr70 francs to BFr3,350 following its announcement on Wednesday that it was going to involve all its insurer shareholders in its planned development of a banking-insurance network.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 19  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Hourly changes   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1152.77  1153.37  1152.86  1152.45  1152.35  1153.09  1153.53  1153.18  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1153.97          Day's Low  1151.75  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       Mar 18       Mar 17      Mar 16       Mar 13       Mar 12      1153.82      1151.88     1145.61      1154.40      1149.99  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

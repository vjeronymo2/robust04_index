			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT BUDGET OKD  </P> <P> The Culver City Redevelopment Agency on Monday unanimously approved a budget  for 1990-91 that includes an almost 36% increase in revenues and a 12% decrease  in expenditures.  </P> <P> The revenues for 1990-91 are expected to increase from $83 million to almost  $112.7 million, due mainly to proceeds from a bond sale last November, said  Deputy Redevelopment Director Debbie Rich.  </P> <P> Most of the $150 million raised from the bond sale went toward refinancing  existing debt and expenses from the sale, but almost $37 million was included  in the new budget, according to a staff report.  </P> <P> Expenditures, meanwhile, dropped from $58.5 million last year to $51.4 million  this year. Last year's expenses were higher mainly because of the $2-million  temporary City Hall and the inclusion of $885,000 to rehabilitate the Willat  Studio -- the "Witch's House," Rich said.  </P> <P> Owners of the studio in Beverly Hills recently decided against donating the  historic building to Culver City.  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Court ruling imperils work of Commission THE European Commission may have to make drastic changes in its bureaucratic procedures and could face a rash of law suits following an unprecedented European Court decision condemning the EC executive's internal decision-making processes. The Court of First Instance (CFI) - set up four years ago to help accelerate the EC legal process - yesterday quashed fines of Ecu24m (Pounds 17m) imposed on an alleged cartel of 14 Community manufacturers of polyvinylchloride (PVC) in 1988, arguing that the Commission decision was 'non-existent'. Commission legal experts are still poring over the 52-page ruling, but they are almost certain to appeal to the full European Court. This is the third time in a month that the courts have overturned an EC competition decision on procedural grounds. Yesterday's judgment is by far the most significant because it calls into question the daily workings of the Commission, which handles thousands of decisions annually. Ms Diana Good, a partner with Linklaters &amp; Paines, a law firm, in Brussels, said yesterday: 'It seems to me that the opportunity is there for a great many challenges (to other Commission decisions). I think the Commission has got a big problem on its hands.' Companies subject to a Commission fine normally have to appeal within two months, but EC lawyers believe even older cases may now be unearthed on the grounds that they never existed legally because of flawed bureaucratic procedure. The wider implications of the ruling will hinge on the CFI's ruling that all the language versions of the Commission decision should have been signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and Mr David Williamson, the secretary general, as laid down in internal rules. In practice, the Commission usually allows some of the many decisions to be signed in the president's absence, a practice which the CFI decided was unacceptable. The Commission was making no formal comment on the decision yesterday but officials were understood to be both confused and astonished by the judgment. One legal expert commented: 'This is a challenge to the whole way the Commission has done its work for 25 years.' But the European Court was adamant about the judgment. 'It strikes me as a perfectly ordinary administrative proceeding,' said one official. 'If the Commission doesn't break the law, it will have no trouble with the courts.' Brussels' legal experts will now try to separate the specific factors in the PVC cartel case from general criticisms of Commission procedure.</p>

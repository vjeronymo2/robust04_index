			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MARLA 'RIGHT UNDER IVANA'S NOSE'  </P> <P> One day after reporting the end of a romance between billionaire Donald Trump  and a former beauty queen, a New York newspaper today said Trump's friend  secretly lived for weeks in the same building as his wife and children.  </P> <P> The Daily News said Trump had hidden Marla Maples in his luxurious Trump Tower  building in mid-town Manhattan.  </P> <P> "Marla (was) hidden right under Ivana's nose," said the News, calling it,  "Trump's towering deception." Trump's spokesman declined to comment.  </P> <P> Maples had eluded the press since news broke last month that Trump's marriage  with Ivana, a former ski champion, was over. The real-estate developer then  moved out of the plush family apartment and into a bachelor pad three floors  higher.  </P> <P> Trump installed the 26-year-old actress-model in an adjoining apartment -- and  has been visiting her there ever since -- according to the Daily News.  </P> <P> The media's most wanted woman had now moved out, and was again untraceable, it  said. On Thursday, the News and the New York Post reported that the alleged  romance between Trump, 43, and Maples was over. Sources close to Trump's  glamorous 41-year-old wife reportedly told the News that Ivana will file court  papers Monday that will lay claim to half of Trump's vast empire.  </P></p>

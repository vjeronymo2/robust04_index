According to officers of the Russian operational group in  Dushanbe, over the past few days the Tajik opposition has  continued its armed provocations from the territory of  Afghanistan. The 12th and 13th outposts of the Russian border  troops and the positions of the servicemen of the Russian 201st  Motorized Rifle Division are being subjected to sporadic firing.  Fortunately there are no casualties among the servicemen of the  Russian Federation.    According to the Russian military, the new spiral of tension  on the border has been caused by the exacerbation of the  military and political situation in Afghanistan, where clashes  between various conflicting groups are taking place.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Observer: Dallara takes charge With close to 100 think-tanks fighting for attention in Washington DC, finding figureheads who will both fit in and be noticed by the international community can take time. But one post which has taken a particularly long time to fill is atop the Institute of International Finance. However, Observer is glad to report that the search is finally over. Charles Dallara, who takes over next month, has the sort of resume appropriate for an organisation whose two previous heads have been Andre de Lattre, former vice governor of the Bank of France, and Horst Schulman, long time German economic guru and, since the end of last year, president of the Landeszentralbank in Hesse. Dallara, 44, is currently a managing director at J P Morgan, in charge of most of its non-American financing and advisory business. But he is best known in Washington for his service in the Reagan and Bush administrations as US executive director at the IMF and then as assistant Treasury secretary for international affairs, which he left in the middle of 1991. He has all the right connections and is on the boards of bodies such as the German Marshall Fund, the American Council on Germany and the US-Japan Business Council. But the big question is whether a body set up to help sort out the problems of the third world debt crisis can find a new role for itself now that the debt crisis no longer looms so large in the affairs of its members.</p>

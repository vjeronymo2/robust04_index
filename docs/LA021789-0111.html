			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BANK PENALIZED FOR NOT SERVING POOR AREA  </P> <P> A Federal Reserve Board decision that for the first time penalizes a bank for  failing to serve poor neighborhoods appears to signal a new willingness by  regulators to enforce a 12-year-old law against such practices, community  activists said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Fed rejected a request by the Chicago-based Continental Bank Corp. to  purchase a small Arizona bank because, it said, Continental had not fulfilled  its duties under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to meet  local credit needs, including those in poor neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The law, on the books since 1977, is aimed at preventing "red-lining," the  practice of denying loans to an entire neighborhood based on the predominant  race or economic class of its residents.  </P> <P> "We hope this is the beginning of a trend," said Allen Fishbein, general  counsel of the Center for Community Change, a Washington-based group concerned  with housing and community development.  </P> <P> Continental's 14-month-old petition to acquire Grand Canyon State Bank in  Scottsdale, Ariz., was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday, with board members H.  Robert Heller and John LaWare opposed. Edward W. Kelley Jr. did not vote.  </P></p>

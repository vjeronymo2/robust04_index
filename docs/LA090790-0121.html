			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS '90;  </P> <P> THE DEFENSE;  </P> <P> LYNN'S AIM: CONFUSE 'EM, AGGRESSIVELY  </P> <P> If there was such a thing as a college course in Strategies and Tactics of an  NFL Defensive System, no doubt some idiot would take it, thinking, "Now here's  an easy A."  </P> <P> Finding he was sadly mistaken a few hours into the course, the student would  change his thinking drastically. "Why didn't I take Parapsychology or Aerospace  Engineering?"  </P> <P> With that in mind, here is what the course outline might look like. It will  concentrate on just one of the 28 NFL defenses -- the Chargers' -- and in this  lesson, emphasis will be on the front seven -- the linemen and linebackers.  </P> <P> Ron Lynn, the defensive coordinator, could be the instructor. His  qualifications: gentle, easy-going approach; ability to relate subject matter  in a positive manner; has built a defense -- once the laughingstock of the NFL  -- into one of the best in the league.  </P> <P> A national publication recently called Lynn "the best assistant coach who's  never been a head coach in the NFL but will be."  </P> <P> To which Lynn replied: "That's flattering. It's nice to hear those things. It's  also embarrassing. But it's better than reading you're a dork."  </P> <P> In the Chargers' system, everything begins with the front seven, and the first  thing to know about it is the basic alignment. The Chargers run what they call  a "Base 3-4" -- meaning three down linemen and four linebackers.  </P> <P> The first thing to understand about the Base 3-4 is that the Chargers almost  never deploy it. Rather, it serves as a focal point, the square one from which  all other defensive fronts are built.  </P> <P> Based on a number of factors, alignments, schemes and plays are developed  around the Base 3-4 set. Those factors include down and distance, score, time,  injuries and the opponent, its blocking schemes and pass routes and the  quarterback's ability and arm strength.  </P> <P> "Our basic approach," Lynn said, "is to give (the other team) as many different  looks as we can and hope to cause an offensive team to reduce its inventory of  plays so that they can't have their whole arsenal at their disposal. As soon as  we can ascertain what they've eliminated and what they're trying to emphasize,  we hope we can go to whatever we feel has the best opportunity against that."  </P> <P> Sounds simple enough. Confuse the heck out of them.  </P> <P> "Essentially," Lynn added, "we want to be an up-the-field team . . . attack,  create, make some things happen. Let's not sit on the line of scrimmage and  wait. Let's, as best we can, initiate what happens. We're not averse to dogging  or blitzing on any down. We want their offensive blockers to think that at any  time, any one of our people can be pass-rushers. And I think they (the  defenders) like the fact that it's a go-get-'em type thing. It's not a matter  of sitting and reading and letting this 320-pounder come off and do frontal  lobotomies on you all day."  </P> <P> Confuse the heck out of them, but do it aggressively.  </P> <P> To do so, Lynn wants quick, aggressive, intelligent athletes. Much like the  ones he has.  </P> <P> In the Chargers' Base 3-4, Joe Phillips is the nose tackle, Lee Williams and  Burt Grossman the defensive ends, Billy Ray Smith and Leslie O'Neal the outside  linebackers and Gary Plummer and Cedric Figaro the inside linebackers. Les  Miller subs at nose tackle, George Hinkle at defensive end, Henry Rolling at  outside linebacker, and Junior Seau and Richard Brown at inside linebacker.  Five of those -- Grossman, O'Neal, Seau, Smith and Williams -- were No. 1 draft  choices.  </P> <P> The key to the arrangement is that rarely, if ever, will all of the Base 3-4  "starters" be playing at their listed position at the same time. Everything  changes from game to game, quarter to quarter, series to series and down to  down. Along the line, forward or back, up or down . . . hardly ever will the  front seven line up the same way two plays in a row.  </P> <P> O'Neal will probably spend as much or more time as a down lineman than as a  linebacker. Smith, who normally covers the tight end, will also rush  frequently. Grossman and Williams will be used in some zone coverages while a  safety or two blitz. Plummer and Figaro will blitz and stunt regularly from a  number of different spots.  </P> <P> In other situations, anywhere from zero to three players could be replaced by  defensive backs. And any one of those replaced could be any one of the front  seven.  </P> <P> "What we're trying to do is get the best possible matchups, one-on-one, that we  can get," Lynn said. "If our feeling is that Leslie (O'Neal) is more suited to  play over this guy than Burt (Grossman), than we might just change the  alignments for that week. Their athletic abilities allow us to do that. Their  intellect allows us to do that."  </P> <P> So the possibilities then are endless?  </P> <P> "Let's put it this way," said Gunther Cunningham, the Chargers' defensive line  coach. "If you wrote down a script of 50 plays a team might run in a given  game, I guarantee you, we could and probably would line up 50 different  defenses. Easy."  </P></p>

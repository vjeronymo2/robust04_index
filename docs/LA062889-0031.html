			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAR UNCLE, PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH  </P> <P> Uncle Sam, put up or shut up. You are good at giving advice but you don't  follow it yourself. That is your problem. Here in Mexico, our problem is that  when we do pay attention to you, we cannot be sure that you will allow us to  reap the benefits.  </P> <P> You suggested that we balance our budget -- and we have done it because it  makes sense -- even though you have an enormous deficit every year because your  expenditures surpass your income. We now have a healthy surplus in our primary  budget. If it weren't for debt service, we would come out ahead each year.  </P> <P> You persuaded us to stop protecting our industry and this has forced us to  become export-oriented. But our new foreign trade surplus is rather precarious  due to your denied but effective protectionist proclivity.  </P> <P> Since World War II, you have consistently spoken in favor of free trade.  Indeed, you did believe in it as long as you were the most efficient producer  in the world. But once others began to nose you out in specific goods, you  began to zero in with specific protection: "voluntary" quotas, multilateral  "agreements," outright prohibitions, all kinds of nontariff barriers. And you  seldom speak of free trade in agricultural products, never in the case of those  you grow. All in all, you are estimated to be excluding many billion dollars'  worth of exports from other countries, a good half by means of one so-called  agreement imposed on fibers alone.  </P> <P> You have advised us to let in foreign investment, and we have because we need  new risk capital -- foreign funds and the money that our own investors exported  to your banks. But there won't be massive flows unless and until investors know  that they will be able to export their products to you. It's too dangerous to  invest millions in a new factory only to find the door closed once we prove our  capacity to export successfully. You have, Uncle Sam, a reputation for  forgetting all about the benefits of free trade once your manufacturers or  unions get upset about competition.  </P> <P> Let us give you some advice, Uncle. Balance your budget. We know that when our  neighbor's house begins to burn, the flames will reach ours. So we are not  happy to see embers glowing on your roof. Do whatever is necessary. But take  your hits and take them now.  </P> <P> Take whatever measures are needed to expand your exports to be the equivalent  of your imports.  </P> <P> Gently bury your sunset industries. Concentrate on those things you do best.  Don't encourage aged industrial sectors to hide behind their government-issue  security blanket. Make them face up to the real world.  </P> <P> Train displaced workers to qualify for other fields of work where higher  productivity will bring larger rewards. Don't condemn them to spend their lives  in jobs kept alive through intravenous feeding.  </P> <P> Do what you keep telling us to do. Modernize. Rationalize.  </P> <P> Whatever you do for your own benefit, let us sell to you whatever we can  produce competitively as a result of our own ongoing modernization and  rationalization. It is to take advantage of these actions that some of us here  in Mexico want a free-trade agreement with you. This would give us a reasonable  degree of guarantee of access to your market. It would permit Mexico to replace  the products of the sunset industries that you will have to phase out in the  next decade. In exchange, we can offer you a hundred million potential buyers  for your sunrise industries in the next decade. Their purchasing power is, of  course, less than the same number of Americans', but it will be rising again  during the 1990s.  </P> <P> Alas, those of us who have faith that we will be able to compete with the  "colossus of the north" are still a minority. But if you are willing to open  your doors in tandem with us, we are willing to work on our more timorous  fellow citizens.  </P> <P> Come on, Uncle Sam. You do your thing, we'll do ours.  </P></p>

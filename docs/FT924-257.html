			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Gilts: Economic data give investors incentives PRICES edged sideways in thin trading as the market digested recent indicators about inflationary conditions in the UK economy next year, together with the likely extremely heavy flow of new gilt issues. The economic data of the past week have again underlined the fragility of the UK economy. That gave investors more incentives to buy gilts on the assumption that inflationary pressures over the next 12 months will be weak. Set against these trends, however, are indications that in the 1993-94 financial year the Bank of England may have to issue new gilts of about Pounds 1bn a month to fund the likely large public-sector borrowing requirement. New issues on this scale could strain the government's system for channelling gilts into the market place and force up yields, with consequent downward pressure on prices. Last week, 10-year gilt yields stayed generally steady at just above 10 per cent. There was some buying pressure from investors, resulting from government data suggesting that the increase in imports in recent months may have started to level off, a sign that any overall economic recovery is proceeding extremely slowly. According to the Central Statistical Office (CSO), underlying import volumes, excluding oil and erratic items such as ships and aircraft, saw no growth in the three months to the end of November compared with the previous three months. The CSO also said that, in the third quarter, the savings ratio - the percentage of consumers' personal disposable income channelled into savings  -was 12.3 per cent, the highest quarterly figure since late 1984. The number was up from 11.4 per cent in the second quarter and indicates that consumers were still reluctant to step up spending - a development which, if repeated in the fourth quarter, is expected to hold back next year's expected economic upturn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has sent a letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus-Ghali explaining that he cannot  possibly accept the amended confidence-building measures [CBM]  package or have it approved by the people of the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. Denktas sent a letter to  the UN secretary general and reiterated the views of the Turkish  Cypriot side regarding the CBM package.    Recalling that the Turkish Cypriot side is committed to the  CBM package as it appeared in Butrus-Ghali's report of 1 July  1993, Denktas expressed his hope that the balance between the  risks and benefits that was upset in the package will be  rectified through indirect talks. Stating that he is ready to  continue with the negotiations and support Butrus-Ghali's  goodwill mission, Denktas pointed out that having the road  leading to Maras [Varosha] under UN control was not in the  initial CBM package and is contrary to the assurances given to  the Turkish Cypriot side by Butrus-Ghali and his representatives.    Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is ready to  provide the Greek Cypriots safe entry to Maras. Reiterating  that the lack of trust between the two sides is the real reason  for the Cyprus problem, Denktas added that the Turkish Cypriots  would like the embargo imposed on the TRNC eased and the  citizens of the TRNC given freedom of travel in exchange for the  opening of the fenced area in Maras.    Explaining that he had the initial package approved by the  Assembly after receiving assurances from the UN representatives  that there will not be any amendments or additions, Denktas  added that promises were made regarding the Greek and Turkish  Cypriots' benefiting simultaneously from the implementation of  the package. Stating that they were surprised when they were  informed that items in the 27 March 1994 nondocument that did  not exist in the original CBM package could not be changed  later, Denktas stressed that items in Butrus-Ghali's report of 4  April 1994 differed from those in the already accepted 1 July  1993 document.    In the letter he sent to Butrus-Ghali, Denktas reiterated  that the Turkish Cypriots are determined regarding the following  four points: simultaneous benefits to both sides from the  opening of the Maras and Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airports, air traffic  arrangements for airplanes using Lefkosa Airport, the issue of  customs duty at the Maras and Lefkosa Airports, and free access  to the area between the UN-controlled region and the fenced area  in Maras.    Denktas pointed out that the 11 March 1994 map, which shows  the area that will be opened in Maras, differs from the 19 May  1993 map that had been agreed on. Denktas stressed that in the  wake of all these developments, it will be very difficult for  him to accept the new package, which was changed by the United  Nations, and have it approved by the people of the TRNC.</p>

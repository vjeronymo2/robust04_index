			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / W German import prices up West German import prices moved up sharply between October and November, bearing out the Bundesbank's determination to combat future inflation as expressed in its latest money supply target for 1995. The November import price level was 0.8 per cent above that for the previous month and 2.2 per cent above November 1993, the federal statistics office said. The yearly rate is higher than the 1.9 per cent recorded in both September and October. Producer prices have also been rising more rapidly. Both indicators suggest a later upturn in inflation rates.</p>

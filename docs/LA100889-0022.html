			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL CHANG  </P> <P> Inasmuch as we never fail to blast your socks off when you report erroneously  regarding spiritual matters, it is only fair to compliment you when you publish  a balanced piece that does not misstate the facts.  </P> <P> With rare exception, secular media misses the correct interpretation of things  spiritual. We found that your lead article on Mike Chang did not  God-and-Christian bash. And for that we want to thank you.  </P> <P> MICHAEL LOFTIN BETHANY, ESTELLE BETHANY BOLTON, LOIS BETHANY JOLLEY, Los  Angeles  </P></p>

It also requires that stairs serving overpasses and underpasses comply with ADAAG 4.9 (Stairs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  An appendix note clarifies that overpasses and underpasses in hilly terrain may be approached at or near grade by public sidewalks with a slope at or less than 1:20. Since the construction of an overcrossing or undercrossing facility offers the opportunity to provide slopes that could not be achieved adjacent to roadways, however, grade-separated segments must be connected to the continuous passage at each end by means of ramps or elevators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM sought comment on whether there were constraints specific to overpasses and underpasses for which an exception should be allowed. Few commenters opposed accessible pedestrian overpasses and underpasses in new construction. Several commenters, including DREDF, recommended allowing a circular ramp if site constraints made that the only feasible option. The National Association of State Facilities Administrators (NASFA) favored an exception from accessibility requirements where the grade differential exceeds 14 feet. ITE members and several State transportation agencies noted that high spans may be too costly to construct to be accessible. One architect suggested that pedestrian actuated crossing signals and crosswalks be permitted in lieu of ramps and elevators where equivalent access could be achieved. The State of Illinois Department of Transportation recommended an exception for underpasses and overpasses serving remote transit parking if accessible spaces were provided at the station.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and the Department of Transportation regulation (49 CFR 27.75) implementing section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require that Federally funded highway construction comply with UFAS standards. Therefore, ramps have been provided in most new grade-separated pedestrian crossings in recent years. By their nature, overcrossings and undercrossings are costly to plan and construct. Careful planning in new construction can provide full accessibility. Furthermore, providing accessible ramps does not have a major cost effect on overall project expenditures. An alternative at-grade crossing for extreme differentials in grade does not seem practicable, as most overpasses and underpasses are provided where roadways are wide, speed is high, and vehicle volume is heavy. Additionally, studies have shown that, if an alternate shorter route is available, pedestrians will choose it in favor of a longer grade-separated structure even if it is more dangerous. This would defeat the purpose of providing separated crossings. No exception is included for new construction. An appendix note has been added to include information on circular ramps, which do not meet the requirements of ADAAG 4.8 (Ramps). Transit stations are covered by ADAAG 10 (Transportation Facilities) and not as public rights-of-way under section 14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM sought comment on whether stairs serving overpasses and underpasses that were also served by a ramp or elevator should comply with ADAAG 4.9 (Stairs). Commenters supported such a requirement, noting that its cost effect would be negligible because standards in most public works construction codes are similar to ADAAG 4.9 (Stairs). Commenters noted that the benefits of increased accessibility for persons who have difficulty traversing long ramped approaches justified the inclusion of such a provision in section 14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim final rule has been revised to include a requirement that stairs at overpasses and underpasses comply with ADAAG 4.9 (Stairs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NPRM proposed to include platform lifts where permitted under 4.1.3(5) as a means of access to an overpass or underpass. Several commenters noted that platform lifts were not a realistic option in such locations because of the limitations on run and operation imposed by ASME A17.1&hyph;1990 Safety Code for Elevators and Escalators, referenced in ADAAG 4.11 (Platform Lifts (Wheelchair Lifts)). EPVA also opposed platform lifts, noting that installation would require a finding that an elevator was infeasible. EPVA further noted that elevators could be provided in any location that could accommodate a platform lift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Under ADAAG 4.1.3(5), a platform lift (wheelchair lift) may be provided only when installation of an elevator is infeasible because of site or other constraints. In new construction, access to overpasses and underpasses can be designed to incorporate an elevator. The reference to ADAAG 4.1.3(5) and 4.11 (Platform Lifts (Wheelchair Lifts)) has therefore been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested clarification of the application of ADAAG 14 to elevated pedestrian networks, such as the extensive pedestrian network developed by public and private interests in Minneapolis (MN) and below-grade networks, typically connecting subway stations and major building complexes, in New York City.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To the extent that these networks are: (1) developed under the authority of a State or local government, (2) are intended for public pedestrian access, circulation, and use, and (3) occupy, along at least some of their length, air or ground rights in the public right-of-way, they must be accessible under this section. Because topography will not be a consideration, it should be possible in new construction to provide a level route along the continuous passage, which will typically connect to surface circulation networks by elevators, which may be provided in private facilities or at transit stations. ADAAG 4.3.1 requires skywalks and tunnels that are part of an accessible route on a site or within a facility to comply with 4.3 (Accessible Route). Where such construction lies in the public right-of-way and connects above or below grade to the accessible routes required of facilities on private sites, these pedestrian circulation networks must provide a continuous passage and comply with other provisions of this section. Direct connections from transit facilities are covered by ADAAG 10.3.1(3). Additionally, elements placed along above-grade or below-grade public pedestrian routes must comply with the requirements of ADAAG 14. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments from persons with vision impairments and several organizations representing them were concerned about traffic provisions such as ``right-turn-on-red'' and left/right turning phases, noting that such practices make it difficult to accurately perceive traffic cues at complex intersections. Other commenters recommended an extended crossing time interval at crossing controls for persons who cannot complete a crossing in the standard time allotted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

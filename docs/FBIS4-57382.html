			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the ""The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Following an appeal by various Indian, trade union,  and student groups to bring the country to a standstill, the  government is expecting a restless week of protests by the  people--probably with clashes between the demonstrators and the  police.    Indian leaders warned Sixto Duran-Ballen that if Congress  does not reject a draft agrarian law they consider harmful, they  will close highways and isolate the capital. Luis Macas,  president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of  Ecuador, said that if this law is approved, Indians will fall  back into the times of slavery. Our land would be taken away  from us, and we would be unable to produce, he added.    Macas said that the law jeopardizes the Indians' ability to  obtain food in the country, as it extends the landholders'  controls over agricultural projects with the sole purpose of  producing for export. Another Indian leader explained that the  draft law seeks to eliminate the agrarian reform, which would  deprive the Indian communities of their land.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / More than 250 feared dead in Amsterdam air freighter crash RESCUE WORKERS yesterday held out little hope of finding survivors among more than 250 people still missing after an El Al cargo aircraft crashed into two Amsterdam apartment blocks on Sunday. Eighty flats with 239 registered residents were reduced to smouldering rubble after the Israeli Boeing 747 ploughed into two connected apartment buildings shortly after 6.30pm. 'Rough estimates lead us to fear that more than 250 are missing. Unfortunately, there is little hope that they are still alive,' Mr Ed van Thijn, the mayor of Amsterdam, told a special meeting of the city council. The three crew and one woman passenger on board the aircraft also died. Six bodies have been recovered and seven others located in the debris. The search is expected to take three to four days because of the perilous condition of the buildings. Riot police last night moved into the mainly immigrant suburb where the aircraft crashed to guard the area against looters. In Brussels the European Commission said it was granting Ecu1m (Pounds 780,000) in emergency aid to help the families of the victims of the catastrophe. A mechanical or structural problem appears to have been the most likely cause of the crash, although the possibility of sabotage has not been ruled out. The Boeing four-engine 747 freighter crashed into two 10-storey blocks of flats as it tried to return to Schiphol airport outside Amsterdam, 13 minutes after take-off. The aircraft, with a cargo of perfume, electronic equipment, textiles and machinery and carrying about 70 tonnes of fuel, lost its two starboard engines soon after take-off when both caught fire. Dutch civil aviation officials found the engines, which are expected to help pinpoint the cause of the accident, in a lake about nine miles from the crash site. A pond is being drained in the search for the aircraft's missing flight recorder. Boeing, the airframe manufacturer, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the engine maker, have sent experts to help Dutch officials and two teams of Israeli investigators. The aircraft had a serious wheel fault on take-off several years ago, El Al said yesterday. Earlier the company had said the aircraft had no record of trouble. The engine trouble became apparent when the aircraft was above Almere to the east of Amsterdam, near Lake Ijssel. The Dutch civil aviation authority said the decision to return to Schiphol was made by the Israeli captain, disputing suggestions that the crew could have tried to touch down in the lake or on farmland. The civil aviation authority confirmed that the pilot chose to head for runway 27 - the closest and in his line of vision - instead of runway 6, as advised by Schiphol. The airport tower's preference would have taken the aircraft over a less densely-populated area but the captain's choice takes precedence in emergency landings.

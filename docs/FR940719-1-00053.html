			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) would set out the requirements for recordkeeping and countersigning of main mine fan examination records. Paragraph (g)(1) would require that by the end of the shift on which the examination is made, persons making main mine fan examinations would record all defects found during the examination that may affect the operation of the fan. Unlike the previous standard, the existing standard requires that only defects that are not corrected by the end of the shift be recorded. The preamble to the existing rule explains this approach as follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;* since the main purpose of this recordkeeping requirement is to alert miners on oncoming shifts of defects found during the fan examination that may affect their shifts, it serves no additional safety benefit to require a record to be made of deficiencies which are corrected by the end of the shift on which the examination is made.'' However, following publication of the standards, the Agency received comments that records of defects, corrected or not, serve to indicate recurring problems with mine fans. Upon reconsideration, MSHA agrees that recurring problems found during main mine fan examinations may be indicative of more serious defects and if mine management is not made aware of these problems through the maintenance of records they could ultimately lead to a fan failure. Therefore, similar to the previous standard, the proposal would require that all defects found during the daily fan examination be recorded. As with other proposed provisions of the rule, records required in paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages. Comments are specifically solicited on this approach and on an alternative approach wherein the Agency would develop, in coordination with the states, books specific for the required records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since promulgation of the current regulation, the Agency has become aware of some potential difficulties in reviewing records and data generated by fan monitoring systems and atmospheric monitoring systems. The problem involves the commingling of this information with other information, such as production or operations-related data produced by the computer systems of which they are a part. Since the physical volume of production, operations, and other data may be considerable, safety-related data may not be readily accessible which may discourage the regular review and proper use of the information. A possible solution is to require that all safety related data be printed on a dedicated printer. The Agency is not proposing this solution at this time but rather is soliciting comments on possible alternative solutions. At this time, the Agency is proposing, in paragraph (g)(2)(i), that the certified copies of data required by paragraph (f)(2) be maintained separate from other computer generated reports or data in order to facilitate the review of this data by the operator, the representative of miners, and the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g)(2)(ii) would require a record to be made of any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical or mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure. The records would be used to identify chronic or recurring problems with the system that could indicate the need for repairs, replacement of parts, or upgrades in hardware or software in order to keep the system functioning in a reliable manner. The record would be required to be made by the end of the shift on which the review of the data is completed. This requirement would help to assure that records are current and that potential problems are identified in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with existing requirements, paragraph (g)(3) would require that at mines permitted to shut down main mine fans under &sect;75.311, if a pressure recording device is not used, a record be made of the time and fan pressure immediately before the fan is stopped, and after the fan is restarted and the fan pressure stabilizes. A record of these pressures at both shutdown and restart would help identify any adverse change in ventilation that may have occurred during the fan stoppage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(4) would require that a record of the results of the tests be made by the end of the shift on which the monthly test of the automatic fan signal device or the automatic closing doors is completed. This requirement would help to assure that potential problems are identified in a timely manner so that proper operation of the automatic fan signal device and the automatic closing doors can be maintained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(5) would require that the records required under paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) be countersigned by the mine foreman by the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift. During an absence of the mine foreman, the person acting as mine foreman would countersign. The Agency intends that the mine foreman, the person most responsible for the day-to-day operation of the mine, be notified of the information contained in the reports. Allowing until the end of the mine foreman's next regularly scheduled working shift to countersign the report would assure that the mine foreman is aware of the results of the examination and would enable corrective actions to be taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal would also require that within two scheduled production days after the mine foreman has countersigned, the record of the examination be countersigned by the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable. The intent of the proposal is to assure that a higher level official, empowered to redirect resources, be aware of any condition requiring corrective actions. Since this second level official may not be physically located at the mine on a full-time basis, two scheduled production days are proposed as a reasonable period of time for countersigning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 75.313&blank;Main Mine Fan Stoppage With Persons Underground  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard establishes safety precautions for any unplanned main mine fan stoppage that interrupts ventilation while persons are underground. Paragraph (a)(3) requires all persons to be withdrawn from working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed when ventilation is interrupted by a main mine fan stoppage. Areas where coal is being extracted or mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed are typically the places in an underground mine where methane accumulation and other hazards to health or safety can develop quickly when ventilation is interrupted. To avoid exposure of miners to these hazards, timely withdrawal of persons is an important safety practice. Although the Agency believes that the promulgation of paragraph (a)(3) of this standard was done appropriately, it is being reproposed for the purpose of receiving and giving consideration to all pertinent comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerns have been raised about the possibility of methane migration following fan stoppage, and the danger of using electrical power to withdraw miners should this occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

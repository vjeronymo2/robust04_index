			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Hundreds of Pacific Bell strikers turned out early Thursday to picket in front  of the Pacific Bell office at 525 B St. to protest the death of a New York  striker who was run over while walking a picket line earlier in the week.  </P> <P> Members of the Communications Workers of America, Local 9509, wore black  armbands in memory of the victim. Local union leaders said a striking worker  was slightly injured Wednesday when she was bumped by a pickup truck entering  the telephone company's plant on Arizona Street.  </P> <P> According to a Local 9509 official, the unidentified woman was struck by a  truck driven by the husband of a worker who crossed the picket line. She was  taken to a local hospital, where she was treated and released, said the  official.  </P> <P> Pacific Bell officials acknowledged that a confrontation occurred, but they  questioned whether the woman was hospitalized.  </P> <P> The nationwide strike has entered its second week. Locally, negotiations have  stalled over medical benefits. The union has rejected a company offer to shift  some of the health coverage costs to the employees.  </P></p>

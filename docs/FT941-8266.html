			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Arts: Rigoletto a clear winner - Opera Among Nuria Espert's productions for the Royal Opera, her Rigoletto always looked like a clear winner. Some five years on, it still does; it began its fourth run on Saturday, expertly revived by Daniel Dooner. Ezio Frigerio's sets loom as superbly as ever, exuding dankness and menace, lit to gloomy perfection. I thought I remembered 'real' rain in the storm scene - none this time; but perhaps that had been an illusion conjured up by the visible gale-force pyrotechnics. On the other hand, the naughty Duke and Maddalena appeared here to be working up to a bout of toe-sucking: either that is new or we have become newly sensitive to such possibilities. With Claire Powell's sultry, sulky Maddalena and Francisco Araiza's ducal spiv, it seemed likely enough. It was good to hear Araiza's lusty, forthright tenor again, after a long absence from Covent Garden. A slight constriction on top notes suggested a passing cold, but it mattered little, and his troubled soliloquy in Act 2 conveyed a mature sense of loss. Leo Nucci returns as Rigoletto, with the histrionics well controlled and a magnificently scathing, desperate 'Cortigiani]'. His new Gilda is the Korean soprano Young-ok Shin, pretty, touching and precociously subtle. Under pressure the voice has (like some other far eastern sopranos) an electrical, fast vibrato, curiously effective. Their sad last duet is perhaps too brightly lit: that Grand Guignol exercise is better imagined than laid out for close inspection. There is a solid, chilly Sparafucile from Alastair Miles, and confident support from John Dobson, David Ellis, Eric Garrett and Peter Sidhom as various courtiers. The three principal roles will be taken by other singers in the course of the run, as has become the way with Royal Opera revivals - the Romanian baritone Alexandru Agache, the tenor Jerry Hadley and an American newcomer, the soprano Maureen O'Flynn; and a different conductor, Paul Wynne Griffiths, will lead the last two performances. The current conductor, however, is a notable discovery. She is a 32-year-old Australian, Simone Young. She makes her mark not by any gimmicks or radically 'new' readings (for which Verdi's tightly built opera really leaves no room), but by sheer professional command. There was plenty of energy, without haste or hysteria - nor any uncertain moment; the orchestral balance was impeccable; the singers enjoyed close, unfailing support. As the storm progressed, the off-stage male choristers who do the wailing wind slipped out of synch with the woodwind raindrops, but that amusing lapse was the only one. We must hope that Berlin and Munich will leave this excellent conductor time to visit Covent Garden often.</p>

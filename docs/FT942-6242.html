			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Greek warning to banks Greece's central bank governor, Mr Yannis Boutos, warned yesterday that commercial banks could not expect any assistance in covering losses incurred in the current upheaval on local financial markets. His warning came as competition for funds between banks and the finance ministry intensified. With liquidity still being squeezed, banks were offering much higher interest rates for short-term deposits yesterday. Private Greek banks were offering rates of 35-50 per cent on one-month deposits of more than Dr1m (Pounds 2,700). This compared with 27 per cent on the government's new zero-coupon one-month bond available to investors with more than Dr15m. Mr Boutos claimed the battle to save the drachma from devaluation had been won and that short-term interest rates, still at more than 100 per cent on the interbank market, 'would de-escalate over the next one or two weeks'. The drachma slipped against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at Dr148.1, down from Dr147.9 on Monday.</p>

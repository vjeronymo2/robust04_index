			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Observer: Programmed First prize for complicated erratum of 1993 awarded to Channel Four TV - or, to be absolutely correct, its diary department. 'The Channel's Week 1 starts on 4th January and not during the extended week 53 as shown in the diary which conforms to a different computer numbering system. This means that throughout this year Channel 4 personnel will be working one week behind the week number shown at the top of each page of the diary.' Do not adjust your set.</p>

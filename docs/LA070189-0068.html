			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT FLIES TO N. KOREA TO ATTEND EVENT;  </P> <P> S. KOREA DISSIDENT DEFIES FESTIVAL BAN  </P> <P> In an act of political defiance that could have major repercussions on the  divided Korean Peninsula, a young Korean woman from Seoul flew into Pyongyang  on Friday to attend a sports and cultural festival as a representative of  radical students in the south.  </P> <P> Im Suk Yong, 20, who identified herself as a fourth-year student majoring in  French at the Hankook Foreign Languages University in Seoul, was given a  tumultuous, red-carpet welcome at Pyongyang Airport, with music from a student  band and hundreds of organized greeters.  </P> <P> Im was embraced as if she were a long-lost relative by a few young women, then  surrounded by a shoving group of young male students and dozens of  photographers from the international press corps.  </P> <P> The crowd made up of Im, two or three bodyguards, the shoving students who were  part of the welcome and the struggling photographers made its way along a red  carpet past a cheering crowd and a portrait of North Korean President Kim Il  Sung.  </P> <P> "Reunification of the fatherland!" shouted the crowd, which included many women  in traditional flowing Korean robes of pink or light blue. "Welcome!"  </P> <P> Im, whose 10-day journey from Seoul took her through Tokyo, West Germany, East  Berlin and a Moscow airport, then stood on steps at the edge of the tarmac and  gave a brief press conference.  </P> <P> "On behalf of the million students of South Korea who are fighting against the  government, I have come to Pyongyang to take part in the Pyongyang festival,"  she said.  </P> <P> "When I left Seoul, I thought (how) one could come here in a car so easily --  it would only take four hours from Seoul to Pyongyang," Im said. "But it took  me 10 days to get here, through other countries."  </P> <P> Today is the opening day of the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students, a  sort of leftist quasi-Olympics and cultural event, in Pyongyang. This festival  was first held in Prague in 1947 and most recently in Moscow in 1985. About  12,000 athletes and other delegates or visitors have arrived and more are  expected, according to guides working for the event. The theme of the festival  is "anti-imperialist solidarity, peace and friendship."  </P> <P> For Pyongyang, this "anti-imperialist" theme means a demand for the withdrawal  of American forces from South Korea, where they have been stationed since the  1950-53 Korean War. The Pyongyang government and many South Korean student  radicals believe that the U.S. presence in South Korea is a force blocking  progress toward peaceful reunification.  </P> <P> American and South Korean supporters of the U.S. troop presence argue that it  is necessary to ensure stability on the peninsula and deter any possible attack  on the south by the north.  </P> <P> The South Korean government, concerned that the festival would be used for  propaganda, has banned participation by South Koreans. In addition, all visits  to North Korea by South Korean citizens are illegal without the Seoul  government's advance approval.  </P> <P> The largest dissident student organization in South Korea, the National Council  of Student Representatives, usually known by the Korean name Chondaehyop, had  been determined to send delegates to the festival. The chairman of Chondaehyop,  Im Jong Chul, who apparently is no relative of the woman who arrived in  Pyongyang on Friday, participated in a June 24 telephone dialogue from Seoul  with North Korean student and youth representatives in Prague.  </P> <P> Im Jong Chul, who was already in hiding but allowed South Korean television to  report on the call -- was immediately accused of national security violations,  and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He has not yet been apprehended.  </P> <P> Im Suk Yong declared that she had come as the organization's only  representative.  </P> <P> "I am very sorry to be taking part in the Pyongyang festival alone, without  lots of my friends, because the South Korean authorities blocked the South  Korean students from taking part in the festival," she said. "This shows that  the South Korean government is anti-reunification. Nowadays, the forces which  want reunification are being suppressed."  </P> <P> Accompanying Im upon her arrival were several other Koreans, apparently  including two or three originally from South Korea who now live in West  Germany. The presence of these people was not considered politically  significant, however. It appeared that Im would indeed be the only activist  South Korean citizen to attend the festival.  </P> <P> In making an unauthorized visit to the north, Im is following in the footsteps  of a dissident South Korean clergyman, the Rev. Moon Ik Hwan, and opposition  assemblyman Suh Kyung Won.  </P> <P> Moon made an unauthorized nine-day visit to Pyongyang in April, with the  announced intention of promoting reunification. He has been imprisoned since  his mid-April return to South Korea and is now standing trial.  </P> <P> Suh, a member of the Party for Peace and Democracy led by Kim Dae Jung, made an  unauthorized trip to Pyongyang last August. He was taken into custody early  Wednesday and charged with violating the National Security Law, which bans  unauthorized trips to North Korea and communicating and meeting with North  Koreans without government approval.  </P> <P> Investigators said they are trying to find out if Suh was spying for North  Korea. He met President Kim Il Sung and other Pyongyang officials during the  visit, they said.  </P> <P> Any similar treatment of Im could fuel the radicalism of leftist students in  the south. But South Korean intelligence authorities said she will be arrested  and charged with national security violations if she returns home. The South  Korean prosecutor general's office ordered an investigation into the funding  and arrangements for her trip.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Seoul, thousands of riot police firing tear gas stormed the  campus of Hanyang University to thwart a planned march by radical students to  protest the ban on participating in the North Korean festival. Some students  fought back with steel bars, clubs, rocks and firebombs, and at least 80  students and police officers were injured, police officials said. By nightfall,  hundreds of students were barricaded in four buildings ringed by police. The  campus was littered with rocks, clubs, tree limbs, broken chairs and lumber.  </P> <P> More than 500 students were arrested on the campus, and another 50 to 60 were  arrested after trying to pass checkpoints leading to the demilitarized zone  that divides the peninsula.  </P> <P> Friday evening, several North Korean student and youth officials held a press  conference at which they criticized the Seoul government for refusing to allow  student dissidents to visit the north.  </P> <P> Kim Mun Hyon, an official of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea,  who participated in the June 24 telephone dialogue with Im Jong Chul, assailed  Seoul for its stance on reunification and South Korean student activism.  </P> <P> "The fact that we succeeded in having dialogue with the South Korean student is  denounced by the South Korean authorities as a crime," Kim declared. "All this  means is (that) the South Korean regime is a fascist regime and is against the  reunification of the country."  </P> <P> Pok Chun Sim, a 43-year-old store salesclerk who was part of the welcoming  group for Im at Pyongyang Airport, said that she was "deeply moved" to be able  to join in greeting Im.  </P> <P> "Now, I feel that Korea is one," she said. "Nobody can divide our nation in  two."  </P></p>

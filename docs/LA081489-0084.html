			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RASMUSSEN LIFTS LONG BEACH PAST METROPOLITAN ALL-STARS  </P> <P> After the 24th Metropolitan League all-star game Sunday at Anaheim Stadium,  announcer Ken Hill asked the crowd of about 400 to stay for the announcement of  the most valuable player.  </P> <P> The plea did little to hold the audience, though, because the choice was  obvious.  </P> <P> Mark Rasmussen sealed his honor with a two-out, three-run double in the eighth  inning to lift the Long Beach 49ers to a 3-2 victory over the league's  all-stars.  </P> <P> Rasmussen was an All-Sunset League outfielder at Huntington Beach High School  in 1985. He started in right field for the next two seasons at Orange Coast  College, then transferred to Lewis &amp; Clark College. He played on its 1988  National Assn. Intercollegiate Athletics championship team in 1988. He said he  sat out the 1989 season for disciplinary reasons at Lewis &amp; Clark.  </P> <P> "I plan to return to Lewis &amp; Clark," Rasmussen said. "But I'm also keeping  my options open."  </P> <P> The double ended an afternoon of frustration for the Long Beach batters. Before  the eighth, the league champion 49ers managed four hits and a walk off five  pitchers.  </P> <P> Especially impressive was starter John O'Donahue of the Cypress Dawgs. He  struck out the first two hitters, allowed a triple, then struck out the final  four hitters he faced.  </P> <P> Erick Gomez of the Pomona Colts followed with two shutout innings. Todd Long of  the Huntington Beach Rustlers and Tim Kelly and Matt Lipscomb of the Fullerton  Blues each pitched a shutout inning.  </P> <P> "You just get a little more amped pitching in the Big A," Kelly said. "There's  no doubt it adds another three or four miles per hour to your fastball."  </P> <P> The all-stars led, 2-0, going into the eighth. Jim Short of Fullerton had an  RBI groundout in the fourth and Rob Donlan of the Anaheim Amigos had an RBI  double in the seventh.  </P> <P> The 49ers loaded the bases in the eighth on a walk, a single and an error off  losing pitcher Shane Romney of the Huntington Beach Rustlers.  </P> <P> Romney then fell behind Rasmussen, two balls and a strike, before giving up the  game-winning hit.  </P> <P> "I was looking fastball all the way," Rasmussen said. "I'd missed a slider on  the pitch before and I just told myself I had to wait for the fastball."  </P></p>

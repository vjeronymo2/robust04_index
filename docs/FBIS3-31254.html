If a single bomb falls on the Serbian positions in Bosnia,  it  is said in yesterday's announcement, the SSJ will activate the  military agreement with Zhirinovskiy's Liberal-Democratic Party  and invite Russian volunteers. The SSJ warns that in case the  war escalates, it will use the Russian secret weapon [the  Elipton], obtained from Zhirinovskiy, against the aggressor's  manpower and enemy aircraft.</p>

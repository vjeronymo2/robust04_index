			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers tumble Fears of a renewed price war among food retailers sparked a slide in some of the leading shares in the sector. The retreat came early in the session when a rumour went round the market that J Sainsbury was about to embark on a round of price promotions, a move dealers would interpret as the trigger for another round in the price war between leading food retailers. The fall was particularly surprising to market watchers given that north of England supermarket chain William Morrison had just posted a sparkling set of interim figures. However, analysts put the slide down to 'some confusion about Tesco's recent comments on lower regional pricing in parts of the north of England.' This appeared to steady some nerves but was not enough to bring about a recovery in the shares. Sainsbury closed 9 lower at 416p, after trade of 4.4m and Tesco surrendered 4 to 239p, in hefty trade of 7.9m. Argyll Group fell 10 to 277p, with volume reaching 5.1m. Late profit-taking in Morrison, which revealed a Pounds 9.2m profits increase to Pounds 47.4m, saw the shares retreat from the day's peak to finish a penny off at 138p.</p>

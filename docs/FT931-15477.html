			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: German retailer plans hive-off ASKO DEUTSCHE Kaufhaus, the German retail group which is majority-owned by the Swiss-based Metro group, is planning to hive off four of its operating subsidiaries through partial stock market flotations, the company's chief executive said yesterday. Mr Klaus Wiegandt, speaking at the first press conference since Germany's Federal Cartel Office gave approval to Metro to proceed with the Metro purchase at the end of November, said the plan was to reduce the group's debt by DM1.5bn (Dollars .920m) from its level of about DM4.5bn over the course of the year. This would be achieved through a mixture of outright sales, rationalisations and partial flotations. The first subsidiary to be floated is to be the Praktiker DIY business. Mr Wiegandt said that Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, was working on a plan to float 25 per cent of the company. The other subsidiaries to be spun-off in this way are: Adler, which includes the group's fashion and textile businesses; its Ungar and Roller furniture chains grouped under a company called Mobel; and Deutsche SB-Kauf, which will include the SB supermarket chain. The Massa supermarket chain, another Asko subsidiary, is publicly-quoted. Asko's parent company lost DM269m in 1991 after a profit of DM106m in 1990; sales this year are expected to be in the region of DM20bn. The high debt balances reflect a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s, culminating with the purchase of Co-op in 1989. Analysts said the company would have to sell off at least one large stake, possibly its holding in the AVA supermarket chain. The fusion of Asko with the privately-owned Metro will create one of the world's largest retailers, with combined sales approaching DM70bn. Mr Erwin Conradi, Metro's Dusseldorf-based chief executive, said that the acquisition was motivated by the need to strengthen both companies' food-retailing business. Mr Conradi said that the companies' combined turnover in this sector would be DM23bn-DM24bn, making the group the sixth largest retailer in this sector.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The chief of staff of the Armed Forces High Command,  General Moises Shriqui, acknowledged yesterday that the group  that calls itself "Vivid Red" does in fact exist within the  military. In recent days the group has circulated pamphlets  denouncing the high commands and demanding greater attention to  military requirements.    He said that the organization, which is apparently made up  mainly of midranking officers and noncoms, has been operating  for some time, despite which the direct superiors have been  unable to identify its members, who in many instances have been  denouncing a series of alleged irregularities in the running of  the military.    "`Vivid Red' is an underground group in the Armed Forces.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to discover anything about  these pamphlets that are coming out periodically. There could be  two or three people, but they cannot be identified, inasmuch as  a single person could put out a series of anonymous pamphlets,"  the chief of staff of the high command asserted.    He attributed its existence to the heterogeneous makeup of  the Armed Forces and to the discontent among some of its  members. "Ours is a large institution. Not everybody can be in  agreement with the things that happen in any command or any  unit," General Shriqui said, adding that "they have to be  military personnel because they are very well informed about the  things that are going on."  <H5>  Commander in Chief </H5>   When asked about the same issue, the commander in chief of  the Armed Forces, General Fernando Sanjines, indicated that  because of the annoyance that the pamphlets circulating  periodically are causing among servicemen, Department II of  military intelligence is investigating the matter.    "We are doing the appropriate follow-up," he said, noting  that "they are anonymous, and we should not attach importance to  an insignificant issue."    Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes made a similar remark,  asserting that "the only thing I am familiar with is the  pamphlet that I read once, but I do not attach any importance to  it and it should not be taken into account."</p>

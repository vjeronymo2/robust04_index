			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / N-rules broken by India, says Oslo NORWAY has obtained fresh evidence that 12.5 tonnes of heavy water destined for Romania in 1986 was illegally re-routed to India, a senior public prosecutor said in Olso yesterday. Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, is used to produce plutonium which in turn is used in nuclear weapons and atom bombs. 'We have documentation which shows that the heavy water was shipped to the Directorate of Purchase and Stores in Bombay,' Mr Anstein Gjengedal, the public prosecutor said. The Bombay address has been linked by Norway to a branch of the Indian atomic programme. Norway has for several years suspected that India's nuclear programme has been developed with the help of its heavy water which was illegally acquired, according to the terms of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The 1986 heavy water shipment was destined for Romania. According to Mr Gjengedal, in 1985 Romania signed an 'end-user' statement that the heavy water would be used in a power plant and guaranteed that it would not be re-exported outside Romania. These assurances allowed the Norwegian government to approve the deal and issue the necessary export documentation for its shipment. 'When we investigated the case in Romania we accessed documents which told us that the heavy water shipment left Oslo on West African Airlines bound for Bucharest where it stopped for a crew change, without unloading, before going on to Bombay,' Mr Gjengedal explained. The Norwegian government has unsuccessfully sought India's co-operation in investigating the matter. Mr Bjoern Blokhus, a Norwegian foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday that Norway had informed the Indian government of its findings. 'We are giving them reasonable time to respond,' Mr Blokhus said. But he indicated that if the government had not been contacted by Indian authorities by February 13, it would be forced to pursue a tougher strategy in order to substantiate Mr Gjengedal's findings. He would not indicate what options the government would examine. In 1988, Norway banned exports of heavy water because of a series of embarrassing scandals which underscored how lax controls over its export and sales had become. But by that time it had already made its way to at least 35 nations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today, in  editorials dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the March 1  popular uprising in 1919, call on the compatriots at home and  abroad to join in the struggle for smashing the moves of the  separatists and reunifying the country with concerted efforts of  the nation.    NODONG SINMUN says the thorough implementation of "10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the  reunification of the country" put forward by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song is the key to making our nation repulse  aggression and interference of any outside forces and accomplish  the cause of national reunification in the '90s.    Noting that the desire of the March 1 uprisers to live in a  land without aggressors and traitors has been realised only in a  half of the country and the South Korean people are still  languishing under the colonial rule of foreign imperialists, the  paper says that if the country is to be reunified at an early  date, it is imperative to achieve the great unity of the whole  nation.    The paper continues:    Great national unity is never achieved by words. It is won  and cemented when all the Koreans take a joint action by pooling  their will and strength in the struggle for national  reunification. All the political parties, organizations and  compatriots of all strata in the North, South and overseas must  keep pace and unite with each other organizationally for  national reunification. The South Korean people must wage a  relentless struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam group, which  is standing in the way of national reunification and trying to  plunge the nation into a nuclear holocaust in league with  outside forces.    The South Korean puppets must give up the foolish design to  obstruct the country's reunification and slay the fellow  countrymen in the North with the backing of outside forces and  step down from power without delay as unanimously demanded by  the people.    MINJU CHOSON demands that the United States renounce the  moves to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea over the "nuclear issue" and keep to and implement the  principles agreed on between the DPRK and the United States so  that the nuclear issue may be resolved in a fair way on the  Korean peninsula.    It says the Japanese reactionaries must apologize for the  monstrous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in  the past, make an adequate compensation, stop clamouring about  the non- existent "nuclear threat" from the DPRK and refrain  from doing things obstructive to the peace and reunification of  Korea.</p>

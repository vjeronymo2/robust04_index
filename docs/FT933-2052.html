			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Radical surgery to restore health: Capacity cuts are needed to rescue the EC steel industry European steelmakers, politicians and bureaucrats are closer than ever to casting a gleaming rescue plan for the EC industry out of the pleas and promises submitted by producers over the past year. But September 30, the date set by the European Commission for receiving offers of capacity cuts totalling some 30m tonnes of annual output, will pass without a final decision on the overall package. It is almost a year since the crisis in the European steel market - a result of low prices, overcapacity, and recession in customer industries - forced producers to seek financial and political help from the Commission. The result, early this year, was a series of planned measures, including capacity cuts, designed to help raise prices, return the industry to financial health, and prevent further bankruptcies among private producers. But the Commission's sensitive negotiations with the Spanish, Italian and German authorities, aimed at limiting subsidies to the main state-owned steel producers, are at least two months behind schedule. The question is: can the Commission's original ambitious plan to support the EC industry survive such a delay, or will it collapse in recriminations? In spite of the delay, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, will go into today's meeting of EC industry ministers in Brussels more optimistic than at any time since the crisis arose. Most of their delicate plan is already in place. Steps have already been taken, or proposed, to help protect the EC industry from cheap non-EC imports; to monitor the steel market and forecast demand; and to set up a fund through which producers in certain sectors of the market will finance the closure costs of those in the same sector which cut capacity. EC officials believe producers are now moving in the right direction, and most will be ready with a package of voluntary capacity cuts by a week tomorrow. But the commissioners know that the producers' paper commitments will not be implemented if ministers do not act to limit state aid. Without restrictions on subsidies, private-sector steelmakers, many of which underwent painful restructuring in the late 1980s, will refuse to carry out the reductions in capacity on which the success of the plan depends. The main reason why some ministers have been slow to tackle state subsidies is that the gains for the whole industry are outweighed by the domestic political pain of job losses, often in regions already hit hard by recession. So reluctance by the Commission to push the ministers to a decision by tabling formal proposals is understandable. Decisions on state aid require unanimous approval by member states, and a veto by any single minister could accelerate the crisis. That is why there will be no vote at today's meeting on the three biggest state aid cases. Instead, the Commission is likely to wait until the next scheduled meeting of industry ministers in November to propose a formal solution to the state aid dilemma, giving itself a further two months to cajole Bonn, Madrid and Rome into an acceptable deal. But the Commission still hopes ministers will make progress at today's meeting, by beginning to suggest a balanced compromise between state aid and capacity cuts. 'The key question is: can the whole thing be finalised at the November council? That's only possible if this council isn't just a talking shop, but a critical session about how to settle the three aid cases,' says one senior Commission official. The Commission is taking a risk, but it knows that while postponement will create difficulties for many private-sector producers, outright failure would be a disaster. The Community's steel industry is estimated to have lost more than Pounds 3bn last year, and could be facing similar losses this year - prices may have recouped some of the falls since 1990 but remain depressed. Continental European markets have worsened this year, with demand in Germany, which accounts for about a third of European consumption, still falling. Private-sector producers warn that the present trend will result in further bankruptcies, following the collapse of Saarstahl in Germany this summer. They worry that state-subsidised steelmakers are simply hanging on and waiting for market conditions to pick up. According to British Steel, a further strengthening of prices generally is urgently required by even the most efficient producers. In Germany, Thyssen warns that failure to reach agreement on subsidies means continued heavy losses for the industry. 'Finally, this might lead to a situation where private companies will no longer survive in the steel market,' it says. Under the restructuring plan, the industry's effective capacity, excluding mothballed plant, will drop to 130m-140m tonnes annually, leaving enough slack to encompass any potential upturn. With a slimmer production base, the need to sell steel at suicidal prices simply to cover heavy fixed costs is reduced. The longer the industry has to wait for restructuring to be implemented, the longer the market remains distorted by allegedly unfair competition. For example, the Commission estimates that debt at Ilva, Italy's state-owned producer, will rise from L10,250bn (Pounds 4.2bn) at June 30 to L10,720bn by the end of the year. This amount would be unsustainable without state support, according to Brussels. While the Commission is still wrestling with Italy, after a summer of hard negotiation it has published the outline of a deal with the Spanish authorities, which should receive the unofficial backing of ministers today. The Spanish intend to find private funding for the building of a mini-mill in the sensitive Basque region, and will bring forward by 18 months the closure of some 2.3m tonnes of capacity at Anzio, also in the Basque country. Privatisation is emerging as a crucial element in the attempt by national governments to win the Commission's support for restructuring state industries. Ilva is submitting a new restructuring plan - the latest of several - which is based on privatisation, while Brussels is insisting that any new capacity to be built at Ekostahl, east Germany, should be financed mainly with private cash. There are still many hurdles to overcome, however. Most important, the Commission knows that if private investment is used as a cover for public funding, the Community's hard-liners - British Steel and the private German producers - will queue up to denounce Brussels for going soft on subsidies. The British government, for one, is openly suspicious about the possibility of public support 'through the back door', and private steelmakers are already sharpening their invective. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, last week warned the Commission against 'window-dressing' solutions to the problem. And Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, has said that, if the subsidies issue is 'fudged', the UK producer might not pay its share of the proposed EC-backed levy scheme to pay for the capacity cuts. Some even see the subsidies issue as having implications that go beyond the steel industry. 'If the Community cannot sort out the subsidy issue, then you would have to question what it is for,' says Mr David Rea, director of the British Iron and Steel Producers Association. The alternative to agreement is certainly unpalatable. If the steel industry goes into 1994 without any deal on subsidies, there is a risk that state-controlled producers, which still account for about half Europe's production, could sit tight and wait for private companies to collapse. That explains why the private-sector German producers, with their high labour costs and depressed domestic market, are nervous about the slow progress of the restructuring plan. They are hoping for a clear sign today that a solution will soon be cast in iron.</p>

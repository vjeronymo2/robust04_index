In a discussion with leading comrades from the  provincial department of transportation, the Changji Autonomous  Prefecture, and concerned departments of the Autonomous Region,  he pointed out the need to definitely make highway construction  an important task to be emphasized in Xinjiang's development.    He said that six of the eight highways turned over in 1993  to  the state by the Xinjiang Transportation Department were  assessed as fine projects, being a great contribution. Highway  construction in Xinjiang is particularly important, so must  definitely be made an important task to be emphasized. In such a  large place as Xinjiang, highways carry 84 percent of Xinjiang's  freight and 97 percent of its passenger traffic. In Xinjiang,  highway construction is a matter of economics, culture, and  stability, with more and better-built roads strengthening unity  among the people of all nationalities, thus being a blow against  ethnic separatism. As 1995 will be the 40th anniversary of the  founding of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, we will need  to put more energy and funding into building better roads to  make Xinjiang more thriving and prosperous.    Tomur Dawamat inspected the second phase of the motor  vehicle  highway from Changji to Hutubi in the blowing snow, visiting  with highway construction workers of all nationalities. The  second phase of National Highway No. 312, the section from  Changji to Hutubi, is 49.86 km long, being a westward extension  after the first phase from Urumqi to Changji was completed and  opened to traffic, and having been built in the five years  beginning in September 1988 by the Xinjiang Transportation  Department's Second Highway Construction Office. The  Examination and Acceptance Commission has assessed it as a fine  project.</p>

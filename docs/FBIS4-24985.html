			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Xi Mi from the "Opinion" page: "Who Really Owns </F> the Township Enterprises?"]    [Text] The introduction of shareholding into co-operative  systems should give township enterprises a new edge according to  Lu Yongjun, an official with the policy bureau of the  Agriculture Ministry.    Ever since their rise in the late 1970s, township  enterprises  have contributed handsomely to the country's economy growth.    In 1993, their output value totalled 2,902 billion yuan  ($330  billion)--71 percent of the output value in rural areas.    Their export value reached 235 billion yuan ($27 billion),  about 45 percent of the country's total .    However, in the current transformation of the nation's  economy, from a centrally planned to a market economy, the  development of township enterprises has been increasingly  hampered by ambiguous property rights.    Who really owns township enterprise is a burning question  which must be answered.    In rural enterprises sponsored by local communities, such as  townships or villages, the property right belongs to the whole  community, but no individual in particular.    As a result, the community leadership randomly interferes  with the enterprises' internal management, thus preventing the  workers themselves from bringing their initiative into full play.    The production factors of different regions, trades and  ownerships cannot be transferred, let alone be used efficiently.    "To solve these problems, township enterprises must speed up  reform of property rights," said Lu Yongjun.    To promote property right reform and to ultimately establish  a modern enterprise system, the Agriculture Ministry recently  issued a non-mandatory document giving advice on how to conduct  shareholding co-operative reform in township enterprises.  <H5>  Dividends </H5>   Township enterprises which have adopted co-operative  shareholding generally perform better than those which have no  shareholding system.    According to Lu, shareholding co-operative enterprises refer  to those enterprises formed by at least two investors, who, on a  voluntary basis invest either money, materials, technologies or  land use right in an enterprise. As shareholders in the  enterprise they can receive dividends according to the  performance of the enterprise in relation to their percentage  shareholding.    Shareholders should have a voice in advising the management  of the enterprise.    According to Lu, the township shareholding cooperative  enterprises comes into being in three different ways.    First, some of the self-employed and private businesses  establish enterprises themselves.    Secondly, some township enterprises introduce the  shareholding co-operative system themselves to achieve better  management, performance and profits.    Thirdly, there are some newly opened enterprises which  adopted the shareholding model from their very beginning.    "Up to 1993, co-operative shareholding enterprises amounted  to 10 per cent of the country's township enterprises," said Liu  Zuyin, another official from the Ministry.    The increasing pressure of market competition and sometimes  the die-hard prejudice against private enterprises, have been  two driving forces for the formation of shareholding  co-operative enterprises which are collective in nature.    To implement property right reform, an effort should at  first  be made to define and clarify it, so as to make possible its  transference through sales, merger, bankruptcy and auction,  inheritance and donation.    "At present, the most important thing is to evaluate  enterprises' assets. This assessment should be realistic,  scientific and plausible, in line with the related standards,  procedures and methods stipulated by the State," said the  Ministry.    Township authorities should invite specialists and  representatives from the community and workers from the  enterprise to attend assessment work in order to carry out  careful planning, full investigation and accurate assessment of  the value of property.    Based upon the clarification of the ownership of property  right, shares can be made available to townships, individuals,  social institutions and overseas investors.    In certain selected areas, markets which trade in property  rights should be established.    In principle, property rights should be held by original  investors. The owners can manage the property, maintain and  increase its value, and benefit from the progress.    But there is still some ambiguity concerning the shares  belonging to the townships.    "For the sake of boosting productivity, enterprises are  encouraged to explore whatever ways are necessary to solve  ambiguities," Liu said.    Han Jun and Zhang Qingzhong, two researchers from the Rural  Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,  offer three options to solve ambiguities.    They suggest that the shares of township enterprises be  transformed into prior stock, so the local authorities can only  gain extra dividend from their shares, but have no say in the  enterprises' management.    Another option is to cut up the cake. This would involve  canceling collective shares and converting all the enterprise's  stored property into shares completely owned by the individual  employees.  <H5>  Modification </H5>   However, certain articles of the State's codes governing  township collective enterprises stipulate that the property of  the collective enterprise belongs to all members of the township.    The researchers call for a change of such irrational  articles  of State, because they only provide local authorities with a  legal basis for interfering in the management of enterprises.    The third option is to auction the property of the township  collective enterprise to employees, social institutions and  individuals.    Income of the shareholding co-operative enterprise should be  distributed according to the performance of the worker and it  should also be in proportion to the volume of shares they hold.    A percentage of profits should be turned in as tax and a  contribution to the accumulation fund. Part should also be used  to balance any operational deficits from previous years. Any  remaining profit might be shared out as a dividend among  shareholders.    Revenue from the sale of township shares should be used for  the enterprises' further expansion, social welfare, or to fund  agriculture in the environs of the enterprise. They should not  be used to cover the township government's administration fees,  said the Agriculture Ministry's directive.    Local authorities should not interfere in any administrative  sense with co-operative shareholding companies. Instead, they  should try to provide management guidance and services.  Enterprises must of course, listen to the supervision of the  local authorities and observe their social obligations.    Liu said that this directive is non-binding. "The  shareholding co-operative system was actually invented by  farmers. What we are doing now is trying to collect valuable  experiences from the co-operative shareholding system so they  can be passed on to other township enterprises."    Liu acknowledged that the research of the shareholding  co-operative system lags far behind their traditional role in  the economy of blazing new roads to prosperity.    In Zhejiang Province, the number of township enterprises is  80,000; in Shaoxing County alone there are 506 of them, with 1.2  billion yuan ($138 million) in capital.    Liu said that when workers become real owners of their  enterprise, they will surely try to improve their internal  management. But whether or not they select boards of directors  or call meetings for shareholders depends upon the enterprise  employees themselves.    Liu emphasized that while encouraging the cooperative  system,  the government also supports enterprises to be contracted,  leased or merged so long as they can become efficient.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas at </F> the National Congress for the inauguration of the congressional  period on 25 January -- live]    [Text] Engineer Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse, honorable  president of the National Congress of the Republic; Orlando  Rosendo Lozano Martinez, honorable president of the Supreme  Court of Justice; General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, commander in  chief of the Armed Forces of Honduras; Messrs. magistrates of  the Supreme Court of Justice; ministers of State; presidential  designates; Your Excellencies members of the Diplomatic Corps;  Messrs. presidents, managers, and directors of autonomous  institutions; honorable members of the Board of Directors of the  sovereign National Congress; ladies and gentlemen; beloved  countrymen:    Allow me to first state my most sincere congratulations to  the women of Honduras, and especially those who are part of this  legislative assembly today. [applause]    I come before this august hall for the last time, in  accordance with the precepts established in the Constitution of  the Republic, before the honorable representation of the people  in my condition as constitutional president to render my report  on my activities as ruler of Honduras.    In the next few hours, I will relinquish power over the  nation to my legitimate successor, who was chosen by the people  through the democratic system, which Hondurans have respected  since 1980 -- free suffrage, whereby the will is reflected as  the sovereign expression of the people.    As ruler, as an Honduran, I am pleased to hand over the  power  in a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, which is the result of a  harmonic policy we applied on all the national sectors, seeking  concerted agreements to all the national problems to find the  proper solutions which would allow us to create plans that would  prove to be consequent with the Honduran reality.    Recently, in a ceremony in my honor, hosted by the previous  assembly -- and I again acknowledge Rodolfo Irias Navas, former  president of the Congress of the Republic -- I said: Ruling is  not an easy task. Managing public businesses can be difficult as  is satisfying the people's different aspirations because the  nation's resources are not sufficient to fulfill everyone's  desires, thereby making it necessary to establish priorities  that serve as a framework to attain, mid- or long-term, the  objectives aimed at benefiting the people.    In the government report I will give to the secretariat of  the sovereign National Congress, you honorable deputies will  find details of the work undertaken during the first trimester  of 1990 and their effects, which really interest us as they  contribute to the national development in all of its aspects.    I am pleased, and I say it honestly, to have placed Honduras  on the promising path to a free economy, freeing us from the  chains of paternalism and protectionism that hindered Hondurans'  creativity, overburdened the State, and paralyzed particular  initiatives for production and competition.    It was also an honor for my government to have made gigantic  steps in modernizing the highway system, technology, expanding  telecommunications, and making accessible the extraordinary  world of computers to our children. They are now available in  the schoolrooms of our beloved Honduras.    I can say with deep emotion and pride that I have laid a  groundwork for the future, when new leaders and generations will  expand on our efforts regarding environmental protection, human  rights, which are respected now more than during any other time  in our history, and Honduras' reconciliation through ideological  tolerance, which we have established, and the initiatives that  we have sponsored with the determination to deal seriously with  corruption.    In the field of education, which I want to emphasize, we  have  built a number of primary school classrooms throughout the  country. This reveals my government's firm support for  education, because we have built schools for thousands of  children who lacked school facilities in their communities; in  addition, thousands of desks were donated through the Honduran  Social Investment Fund. These desks have alleviated the  discomfort of the many young Hondurans who had to sit on the  floor. On handing over the administration, I can say that no  child will have to be ashamed and sit on the hard floor. Our  determination to stimulate education in Honduras is indicated by  our help in refurbishing primary and secondary schools and  constructing new centers, particularly trade schools, which give  thousands of young people an opportunity to learn working skills  to the benefit of the area in which they live.    In the health sector, hospitals were repaired, and hundreds  of health centers were built during my administration. They  were equipped with everything necessary to serve the people. In  many instances, semidilapidated buildings were all that remained  of previous administrations. People often despaired of never  having an adequate place to which to go for treatment of their  most pressing health needs. An organized health sector work  structure will be handed over to the new government, which will  assume office on 27 January. Diseases which have ravaged the  child population were put under control. We have tackled the  terrible cholera with determination via prevention drives, the  speeding up of construction of latrines, and by making the  people aware of the need to take sanitary measures to defeat the  epidemics that crossed our border to obliterate the lives of  hundreds of Hondurans.    In the social area we have sympathized with sectors that for  a long time have been relegated or excluded as the result of  neglect. For this reason, we have established a bonus for unwed  mothers, an economic aid instrument to help them take care of  the basic problems of their children, children whose extreme  poverty has barred access to food and education. In addition,  school bags and footwear were given out to the children of many  schools in municipalities, villages, and hamlets via the family  assistance program. My administration's relationship with rural  and urban workers has been consistent with a policy of  understanding, within the patriotic purpose of maintaining a  climate of harmony, which translates into national well-being.    Fellow countrymen, ladies and gentlemen, deputies, before I  hand over the presidential office, I would like to express my  deep satisfaction over the fact that, with the cooperation of  worthy and distinguished Hondurans and well-known international  jurists, it fell on me to end the old territorial dispute with  our neighbor, El Salvador. The century-old controversy, which  weighed down on the two countries like a dissociating factor of  the regional peace, ended with a fair ruling, which confirmed  our sovereign rights on the sacred national territory. I will  keep this achievement, which we Hondurans share proudly, as a  reminder of what we can do when we join forces. At all times,  and regardless of political inclinations, we contributed as  Hondurans to a common cause, which in time had alienated us from  the unionist principles envisioned by the immortal hero of La  Trinidad.    Ladies and gentlemen, deputies, today, during my last  official intervention as Honduran president and in the presence  of a new Congress elected by the people, I would like to  recognize the entire nation, because we have demonstrated again  our people's political maturity and deep-rooted reliance on  democracy. I am leaving my performance as president printed on  history's pages so that what I wanted to do for my homeland can  be assessed in the future. To point out achievements or  mistakes should not be the part of sectarian inclinations,  rather, of a position that will make it possible to review in  the future what we did to reinforce Honduras preserving its name  and prestige as a result of our democratic training.    History is wise, because when Marco Aurelio Soto decided to  reform Honduras, the critics of his time shot poisoned arrows at  his honorable person, not realizing that those changes would  allow us to begin a new century of hope. Such was the case of  late illustrious President Juan Manuel Galvez who founded the  national banking system, modernized education, allowed all  Hondurans to participate in the matters of state, and spoke on  behalf of free expression in every possible way. History was  also late in recognizing the social contribution of Jose Ramon  Villeda Morales, another illustrious Honduran who [applause] as  president gave the people social security, labor law, and land  reform.    Deputies, with devotion for Honduras I would like to say  that, in setting aside by political feelings, I feel proud to  reach such a significant moment in my public life, when I can  pass on the presidential sash in an atmosphere of peace and  harmony to the citizen who captured the people's approval, Mr.  Carlos Roberto Reina. [applause]    Honorable representatives of the people, my mission as the  leader of Honduras' destiny is about to conclude. I encourage  you to make a united supreme effort, from your high posts, as  vested upon you by the people and only by the people, to  continue living in democracy, maintaining the highest national  interest first and foremost. I thank you one and all, and I  especially thank the Honduran people for the highest honor ever  granted to my family, my wife Norma, and myself, of serving this  beloved country, Honduras. Thank you.</p>

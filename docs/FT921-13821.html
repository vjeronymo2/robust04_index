			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Kunick tumbles 29% KUNICK, the fruit machine and nursing homes group, more than halved its final dividend as pre-tax profits plunged 29 per cent to Pounds 12.4m in the year to September 30. Although the results were in line with warnings issued by the group in October, the sharp dividend cut from 1.4p to 0.6p took most analysts by surprise. The total pay-out for the year was 1.4p, 30 per cent down on the previous year. In May, Kunick anticipated paying a final dividend of 1.2p, barring 'unforeseen circumstances'. Mr Russell Smith, chairman, said that the unforeseen circumstance had been 'very poor trading', with 'no prospect of an upturn'. The chairman blamed the hard-pressed pub sector for many of Kunick's troubles in the game machine business. During the recession some 10,000 to 15,000 pubs had ceased trading, he said. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the brewing industry was also blamed for creating unfavourable turbulence. The leisure division, which claims 43,000 amusement machines as opposed to 46,000 at the end of last year, posted a 28 per cent decline in profits. Political uncertainty was affecting the care services division, which reported an 83 per cent rise in operating profits. Kunick's visitor attractions division - including the waxwork dungeons in London and Paris - suffered badly last year although it continued to make profits. Following the Pounds 17.6m rights issue in May, a debt restructuring and the Pounds 2.5m sale of a minority stake in the French holding company, Amira, Kunick's gearing fell from 73 to 50 per cent. Fully-diluted earnings per share tumbled from 4.93p to 3.1p. Turnover rose from Pounds 108m to Pounds 116m. COMMENT Kunick's theory that fruit machines can fund its nursing homes took a thorough drubbing last year. So did shareholders who have seen the stock fall from 45p less than a year ago to last night's 13 1/2 p. That unhappy shareholder base might be one reason to avoid the shares, while the outlook for pub trading this year makes an even stronger case against. Forecasts of Pounds 10.5m, with a prospective p/e of 8.5 might make the shares look cheap, but only the most daring would risk it right now. Still, with such an operationally geared business as fruit machines, and a sound long-term strategy for the care services side, the shares are certainly not a sell. Hang on for the eventual upturn.</p>

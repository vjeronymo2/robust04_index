Signature to Memorandum -- Society Will Finally See  Who Is Interested in a Political Breathing Space, Who Does Not  Want To Reach Agreement, and Who Violates the Accords"]    [Text] President Yeltsin had a meeting in the Kremlin with  representatives of parties, political movements, the parliament,  and the government on the subject of preparing a draft  memorandum on civil peace and accord. An idea that arose as a  result of the emotional events of late February and early March  connected with the political amnesty has thus begun to acquire  organizational dimensions. Boris Yeltsin believes the draft  document may be ready in two weeks.    We would remind you that the package of amnesty documents  which the State Duma adopted 23 February included the  "Memorandum of Accord," which spoke of the need to exclude  violence from political life. However, statements by one body  -- even one as prestigious as the State Duma -- are patently not  enough to secure civil peace. Accord presupposes agreement  among all parties to the political process -- the authorities,  the social forces and their leaders, who should probably also  encompass those people who today more than anything generate  suspicions regarding the intention to or possibility of  destabilizing the country's political life. That was why the  president started off the process of preparing the memorandum,  which is designed to be the means of maintaining tranquillity.  The plan is for the document to be signed by as many political  parties and movements as possible.    However, can a document -- even such a reputable and  representative document -- prevent the country slipping into  chaos? Hardly. A memorandum is not a law, it is a political  statement of intent. Everything depends on whether the  country's leading political and social forces with influence  among the masses really intend to do everything they can to  maintain civil peace, or whether for some people this is nothing  more than a tactical maneuver. Whether people who disagree with  the reform course, as well as its supporters, are really  prepared to use constitutional and legal means and methods alone  in their political campaigning. And, last, whether politicians  are ready to renounce for a while quite legal but "drastic" and  therefore dangerous methods (rallies, demonstrations, strikes)  that may capsize the ship of state.    In order to ensure that the memorandum does not become just  another piece of paper without any real force, I believe that  these intentions should be announced in public before the  agreement is signed -- after they have been seriously and  thoroughly discussed by all structures in society. Signatures  to the memorandum will only mean something once these signatures  are backed up not just by leaders' personal aspirations but the  clearly expressed will of political and social groups large and  small. Definite steps and statements on the part of the  president and the government would probably also not be  superfluous to the achievement of trust: Stability in society  does not only depend on political leaders' activeness but also  on the actions taken by the authorities, their readiness to heed  public opinion, take a calm view of dissent, and cooperate  constructively with all social structures.    Needless to say, no one will provide absolute guarantees  that, first, all significant forces involved in the political  process will want to subscribe to the memorandum and, second,  that even if they do sign, they will not breach the agreement.  But even in that case the idea of a memorandum has one plus  going for it -- its visibility [naglyadnost].    A social contract primarily means the redistribution of  responsibility. Social structures voluntarily assume some of  the duties of maintaining social peace in the common interest.  But that does not mean that the state authority can thus shift  its responsibility onto society's shoulders. The memorandum on  civil peace and accord may indicate to the authorities whether  they are capable, in conditions of a political breathing space,  of creating a material base for real and not just "agreed"  political stability -- primarily to stabilize the economy, curb  crime, and limit bureaucratic tyranny. Society is getting a  chance to test not only the strength of its own influence but  also the real strength of the authorities -- the extent of its  competence, political will, reformist potential, and  responsibility to the country's citizens.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Correspondent Wu Yadong (0702 0068 2639): "Need </F> To Increase Understanding of the Importance of Concentrating on  Stability, Paying Close Attention to Political and Legal Work is  Wang Lequan's (3769 2867 3123) Emphasis at Autonomous CPC  Committee's Conference on Political and Legal Work"]    [Text] At the Autonomous Region's CPC Committee Conference  on Political and Legal Work, which ended on 29 January,  Autonomous Region CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and Deputy  Chairman Wang Lequan emphasized the need for further enhancing  party leadership of political and legal work to increase  understanding of the importance of concentrating on stability  and paying close attention to political and legal work.    He said it is necessary to concentrate hard on the position  and role of political and legal work from the high plane of  maintaining the concept of class struggle and strengthening  dictatorship, from the high plane of safeguarding modernization,  and from the high plane of maintaining the unity of the  motherland and opposing ethnic separation. The most important  concern for CPC committees and all levels in leading and  supporting political and legal work is leading and supporting  political and legal departments in maintaining the basic line of  "a single center and two basic points," and leading and  supporting political and legal departments in eradicating  impediments and interference in strict enforcement of the law.  It is necessary to uphold a combination of expert work and the  mass line, closely relying on the masses of all nationalities to  concentrate on stability. CPC committees and governments at all  levels must give energetic support to working conditions. All  jurisdictions must also show sufficient concern and support for  the real difficulties of political and legal departments, making  a needed tilt in favor of political and legal departments in the  allocation of operating expenses and providing material support  to increase inputs into political and legal departments.    In a speech at the beginning of the conference, autonomous  region CPC committee standing committee member and political and  legal committee secretary Li Fengzi [2621 6646 3320] said that  the emphasis in the 1994 "severe blows" battle should be on  "breaking big cases, striking at gangs, and pursuing escaped  convicts." Criminals who have committeed serious crimes that  hurt the people's welfare, damage the social and economic order,  and endanger public safety such as murder, robbery, rape, grand  larceny, and the production and sale of drugs must be resolutely  punished severely and quickly according to law. Each  jurisdiction must set its own emphasis as conspicuous local  problems warrant, focusing on crimes that can be attacked in a  concentrated way such as robbery, car-jackings and police  officers putting up roadblocks to collect fines and fees, and  hit and run offenses, as well as criminal activities about which  there is strong public reaction. A targeted, planned, and  step-by-step struggle that has specific goals and specific  actions must be organized promptly. An unrelenting battle must  be waged to eliminate pornography and eradicate the "six evils."  A resolute attitude and strong measures must be taken against  disgusting social acts that the public strongly opposes like  prostitution, drug taking, and gambling to bring them under real  control, cracking down on them severely and stamping them out  according to law, punishing them strictly in accordance with  regulations, and positively not allowing them to run rampant.</p>

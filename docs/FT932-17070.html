			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Arts: Ricochet - Theatre Are you, like me, a sucker for murder stories? If so, you will be happy to see the following newspaper advert on the posters and programmes for Malcolm Taylor's new play Ricochet: 'PERFECT murderer offers Pounds 10,000 to equally perfect murderer. Box No 3049.' The advert has been placed by Lord Qualtrop; but for what reasons? It is answered by one Inspector Sparrow; but what kind of inspector is he? He is greeted by the butler Disraeli; and what kind of butler is he? Which of the three is a killer? Who will get killed? Surprise caps surprise caps surprise caps surprise. The audience laughs more often than it squeals. What larks] Bath's Theatre Royal is filled by an audience that wants larks of these kind  -and wants to see Nigel Havers and Keith Barron. Like people all around me, I left the theatre with my head buzzing with the play's circuitous intricacies; and I make tactful efforts now to give none of them away. The play often has comic lines of an exquisitely sinister nuance. The inspector says to the butler, ''The butler did it.' Have you ever done it?' The butler replies, 'That's for me to know, Sir, and you to discover.' The second inspector says to a suspect 'I wouldn't try anything. I got passed over for promotion this morning.' And yet I felt no concern for any character onstage; worse, no great sense of suspense; worst, no awareness that murder is evil. True, one character sometimes says that murder must go punished because it wrecks the lives of the living - but this attitude does not prevail. A comedy is not much of a comedy if it does not take something seriously - in this case, murder. And a thriller is not much of a thriller if it it is mainly conceived as a you'll-never-guess-what-happens-next joke. The point of Ricochet is merely to manipulate its audience. In this respect it succeeds cleverly enough - though its plot will bear little scrutiny for either probability or logic. But Sleuth and Deathtrap took murder more seriously, and thereby were more riveting and more fun. Ricochet amounts to nothing but gameplaying. The taste that leaves is unpleasant. Part of the gameplaying - this is hard to explain without explaining too much - involves the roles. If there were one reason I might want to watch Ricochet again, it would be to re-examine the acting that leads up to the big unmasking halfway through Act Two. Nigel Havers and Neil Stacy, as Lord Qualtrop and Bulstrode, execute one piece of virtuosity each that is impressive afterwards, once you know what it was. But at the time it is actually rather laboured and indistinct. Havers's role is otherwise the usual engaging Havers exercise in classy charm. Out of practice as a stage actor, he shows no great mastery of stage projection, dynamics or pacing, but will doubtless gain more authority with further performances. I note also that he is one of the two directors of Havahall Pictures, which co-presents this play. David Taylor directs. Keith Barron gives a performance that is absolutely right for the play - deft, convincing moment by moment in an ambiguous way, lightweight. At the Theatre Royal, Bath, until April 3</p>

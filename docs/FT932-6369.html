			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Speckled Hen helps Morland grow MORLAND &amp; Co, the Thames Valley-based brewer which beat off a hostile bid by Greene King last year, announced a 29 per cent profits increase and a trading agreement with Bass covering its fast growing Old Speckled Hen ale. Pre-tax profits in the half-year to March 31 increased to Pounds 3.63m, against a restated Pounds 2.82m, on turnover up 28 per cent at Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 18.8m). A 45 per cent rise took operating profits to Pounds 4.82m (Pounds 3.32m) but net interest costs jumped to Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 349,000) reflecting sharply increased net borrowings of Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 8m). Gearing stands at 26.3 per cent. Earnings per share amounted to 11.9p (9.4p restated) and the interim dividend is raised to 2.78p (2.42p). The 1992 figures have been restated to comply with the FRS 3 accounting standard. The main change is in the treatment of exceptional items and the bid defence costs last year. On the old basis pre-tax profits would have increased by 20 per cent from Pounds 3.06m to Pounds 3.66m and earnings from 10.5p to 12p. Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chairman, said he was 'quite pleased' with the results 'given the recessionary background against which they have been achieved.' He noted that overall sales of the group's own ales grew by 22 per cent over the period. In particular, sales of Old Speckled Hen had risen by well over 200 per cent, and represented 20 per cent of total production. Under the trading agreement with Bass, the UK's largest brewer, Old Speckled Hen will be distributed to selected managed houses in the south east and Midlands. In return Morland will stock draught Bass as a guest ale. Morland already has trading agreements for Old Speckled hen with Whitbread, Courage, Adnams, Charles Wells, Everards, Fullers and Marstons. Free trade volume, including wholesalers, grew by 48 per cent. The group's retail division increased turnover by 22 per cent, with food sales increasingly important. Meanwhile, the 101 pubs acquired from Courage have been integrated and are trading well, while the 72 pubs purchased last year from Inntrepreneur Estates made a first time contribution. Moorland's shares closed up 2p at 500p.</p>

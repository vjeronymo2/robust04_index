			<p>BFN     [Text] Niamey, 14 Apr (AFP) -- Muslim fundamentalists who  took refuge in Kolouka after occupying the neighboring town of  Bani Bangou, (180 km to the north of Niamey), began to surrender  at midday today, Niger Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou told  AFP.    A detachment of the Nigerian Army encircled the village in  the early hours of the morning and threatened to attack if the  fundamentalists, who are members of the Izala sect, did not  surrender.    On 11 and 12 March, clashes between members of the sect and  security forces left 10 dead at Kolouka. The fundamentalists  succeeded in leaving Bani Bangou during the evening of 12 March  to return to their village.</p>

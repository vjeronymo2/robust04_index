			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.15(d) of the proposed rule provides that each Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall require applicants or sponsors to provide such other reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Bank, in addition to the reports and documentation required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by &sect;960.15 of the proposed rule, as the Bank deems necessary in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to fulfill its monitoring obligations under &sect;960.14 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Corrective and Remedial Actions for Fraud or Non-Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With AHP Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 10(j) of the Act is silent on what specific corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and remedial actions should be imposed when there is fraud or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance with the requirements of the AHP. See 12 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1430(j). Accordingly, the Board has the discretion to determine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a matter of policy, what those requirements should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board's existing AHP regulation provides that, where funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided under the AHP will not be or are no longer being used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their approved purposes, the amount of committed but unused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy or improperly used subsidy shall be recovered and made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available by the Bank for future AHP projects. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.8(a). The existing regulation requires the Bank, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recapturing such funds, to take any or all of the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, without limitation on other remedies, in its discretion:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Reprice the advance at the interest rate charged to members  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on non-subsidized advances of comparable type and maturity at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of the original advance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Call the advance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Assess a prepayment fee; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Require the member to reimburse the Bank for the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the unused or improperly used subsidy on the advance or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;960.8(b). In addition, some Banks have adopted procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that require a direct subsidy to be converted to an advance if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project is found to be in non-compliance with the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of concerns have been raised about this recapture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. First, it may not be equitable to require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant to reimburse the Bank when it is the sponsor that is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance with the AHP requirements. Second, requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recapture of the AHP subsidy could in some situations result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant having to foreclose against a property in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recover the funds to repay an advance to the Bank, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating affordable housing units even when only a few of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in the project may be out of compliance with AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, it has become clear through the operation of the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the recapture remedy may not be the appropriate remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action in all circumstances. Other less severe remedial actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be more appropriate depending on the nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance that has occurred. In addition, the remedial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions should be directed only at the parties that are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance. Accordingly, the proposed rule contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions that tailor the remedial actions required to the nature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the non-compliance and the party committing the non-compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are discussed further below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Fraud or Willful Non-Compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fraud and willful non-compliance are the most extreme examples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of non-compliance with the AHP requirements. Accordingly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule applies the most severe remedial actions_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion or suspension from future participation in the AHP and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery of the full amount of the AHP subsidy_to parties that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have committed fraud or are in willful non-compliance with respect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the AHP requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, &sect;960.16(a)(1) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of an applicant's, sponsor's or owner's fraud with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the AHP requirements, the Bank shall exclude the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant, sponsor or owner, respectively, on a permanent basis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from future participation in the AHP. In the event of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant's, sponsor's or owner's willful non-compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP requirements, the Bank shall suspend the applicant, sponsor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner, respectively, at least on a temporary basis, from future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the AHP during the period such willful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance continues, and may exclude such party permanently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from future participation in the AHP. The Board specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments as to whether the Banks should be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine whether fraud or willful non-compliance has occurred, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether such determination should be made by the Board, or by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the Bank or the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, &sect;960.16(a)(2) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of an applicant's fraud or willful non-compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the AHP requirements, the Bank shall recover from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant the full amount of the AHP subsidy provided to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.16(a)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the sponsor or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner by the applicant and returned to the Bank or, if previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the Bank from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor or owner. If efforts to recover the AHP subsidy from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponsor or owner are unsuccessful, the applicant shall not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liable for such funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to be able to implement this recapture requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant is required, under proposed &sect;960.16(a)(3)(ii), to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have in place either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

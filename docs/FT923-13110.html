			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Name-dropper who haunts corporate Japan: The head of one of Tokyo's credit information agencies is enjoying the recession THESE polite words of warning come courtesy of Mr Eiji Tamaki: 'Please read this letter. If you do not answer, your name will be registered on a computer, and it will be difficult for you to get a loan, credit or a lease. If you have already paid, please forgive us.' Mr Tamaki's credit information and collection business, Consumer Credit Clearance, is prospering in inverse proportion to the woes of corporate Japan in these debt-burdened days. Having built the company by studiously following the advice of a weathered 1959 US manual, Starting and Managing a Small Credit Base and Collection Service, the effervescent Mr Tamaki has discovered that his time has come in 1990s Japan. New clients have increased by more than 20 per cent over the past six months and Mr Tamaki smiles genially as he tells, with a blend of wonderment and satisfaction, that his recent customers have included some of Japan's better known companies. 'I can't tell you who they are. We have to be discreet in this business. But I never thought these companies would come to me for help. As a matter of face, they don't want to admit to these debt problems, but they can't wait any longer.' Mr Tamaki also smiles broadly when suggesting that his birth in 1929, the year of the crash, destined him to a life in credit research. In the late 1980s, Japanese banks, consumer credit companies, and department stores were more intent on finding new clients than on checking creditworthiness. Those years of excess have returned to haunt financial institutions. Last year, personal bankruptcies rose to 23,287 from 11,273 a year earlier, and the liabilities of failed businesses jumped from Y1,996bn (Pounds 8.35bn) to Y8,149bn. Banks are under extreme pressure to accept delayed payments from troubled companies, whose property and securities collateral has evaporated as magically as it appeared. These are fertile fields for debt collection, but the mainstream industry's growth has been restricted by a general awareness that debt collecting in Japan is done by the yakuza, or gangsters, whose methods are less polite than Mr Tamaki's letters. A spate of loan-sharking and strong-arm collecting by gangsters a decade ago prompted the government to introduce the Consumer Lending Act, which outlined acceptable methods of collection and redefined the boundaries for Mr Tamaki's credit operations. 'People can see my hands. I have all my fingers,' said Mr Tamaki, referring to the missing little finger that often identifies gang members. Not long after its founding in 1969, CCC received threats from gangs, which saw Mr Tamaki moving in on their territory, and he still occasionally gets a call from a gangster type. 'We just give our address and make clear to them that our office is directly opposite Kojimachi police station.' The legislation a decade ago limited collection for profit to lawyers, but Mr Tamaki has got round that restriction by establishing a separate 'voluntary membership union' which takes fees of 30-40 per cent of money recovered for its 5,000 members. But Mr Tamaki's real achievement is building a data base that gives the company leverage over the debtors of his client companies. There are four other credit information companies, but by specialising in bad debts, CCC is able to warn a delinquent consumer that he or she will soon be given a spot on Japan's largest credit blacklist. Having watched debts mount and companies crumble, Mr Tamaki is amazed at the laxity of corporate Japan: 'Companies have just jumbled all their uncollectable loans together and reported them as loan assets. They know there are serious problems, but no one wants to take responsibility for them.' A reason more companies are turning to CCC, he said, is that 'bubble era' executives have retired or resigned and the new management is less reluctant to highlight the sins of the past. One of those sins has been to provide too much credit to consumers poorly educated in its dangers. The non-profit Japan Credit Counselling Association assists consumers who are tangled in credit. Small investors and shoppers have been left exposed by the ebbing tide of the Japanese economy, as overtime payments have fallen, and collateral (such as stock holdings and golf club memberships) has collapsed. Calls to the association rose from 2,929 in 1990 to 5,243 in the fiscal year to the end of March. In the first quarter this year, there were 1,887 inquiries, with the average caller a young man or woman between 20 and 29 years owing a total of Y5m (Pounds 20,900) to 11 separate companies. None of this is news to Mr Tamaki, who explained that the loan-sharking of a decade ago generally claimed working-class victims, but the credit boom of the late 1980s has left debts spread across society. This trail of wreckage is often difficult to follow, as the counselling association found that 27 per cent of bankrupts had moved house and only 31 per cent remained in the same job. Tracking down delinquent debtors has always been part of Mr Tamaki's business, but the real growth is in providing credit information to burned but wiser companies before they lend. For CCC, the only problem is finding enough staff to deal with the new demand.' We really are making money,' Mr Tamaki explained. 'But it is a bit difficult to find young people who want to work in debt collection. People still think it's only the business of the gangsters.'</p>

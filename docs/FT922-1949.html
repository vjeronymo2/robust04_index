			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ford, Chrysler 'lowest cost' makers FORD MOTOR and Chrysler of the US have become the world's lowest-cost car manufacturers, helped by the fact that American vehicle parts manufacturers have a 27 per cent cost advantage over Japanese rivals, claims a US study released yesterday. The report, by the independent Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, could prove controversial. US analysts agree that Ford and Chrysler have made great advantages over the past few years to narrow the production cost gap with Japanese rivals, but many believe the Japanese, and Toyota in particular, still have a significant edge. The study, carried out with the help of the highly-regarded Office for the Study of Automotive Transport at the University of Michigan, estimates that the direct cost of producing a small car is Dollars 5,415 at Ford, Dollars 5,841 at Chrysler and Dollars 6,216 at Toyota. However, the severe problems facing General Motors, the largest US manufacturer, are underlined by the finding that it requires Dollars 7,205 to produce a small car. The report said one reason for this was that GM relied on outside parts suppliers - more efficient than in-house subsidiaries - for only 30 per cent of its supplies, compared with 50 per cent for Ford and 70 per cent for Chrysler. GM, which also lags the other two companies in utilisation of its factories, is in the throes of a huge restructuring which involves both plant closures and a rationalisation of its parts supply network to slash costs. Other analysts said a weakness of this kind of study was that it made comparisons in terms of currencies, which can fluctuate widely over time. The figures showing Ford and Chrysler on top also assume that all factories work at full capacity, and they do not include pension and healthcare costs, and differences in costs of capital between the two countries. The study estimates that US plants ran last year at 62 per cent of capacity, compared with 95 per cent for Japan, adding Dollars 800 to Dollars 1,500 to Detroit's costs per car. It also faced a Dollars 600 disadvantage because of the high US cost of pension and healthcare benefits. When these factors were taken into account, Toyota became the lowest-cost producer, with Ford slipping to second place. Mr Clyde Prestowitz, president of the policy institute and a critic of Japan's trading practices, argued that Detroit's survival was still threatened by factors beyond its control, and he called for action by Washington to support the industry, including easing its welfare benefits burden. The study will be regarded as helpful ammunition by the auto parts industry in its campaign to sell more to Japanese assemblers. The US industry has long argued that it is more efficient than Japanese rivals, but has been kept out of assemblers' plants by the keiretsu system of inter-locking Japanese corporate ownership.</p>

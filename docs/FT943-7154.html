			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Bhutto denounces N-bomb claim: Opposition backtracks on Sharif's assertion of nuclear capability Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, yesterday denounced as irresponsible the assertion by former premier Nawaz Sharif that Pakistan has nuclear weapons. Mr Sharif on Tuesday warned that any attack on Pakistan by India could spark nuclear war between them. India has seized the occasion to demand international action to halt any nuclear weapons programme in Pakistan. 'The curtain of ambiguity about Pakistan's nuclear programme has fallen off,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi said. 'It is a matter of grave concern that Pakistan is actively pursuing this nuclear weapons programme and is clandestinely procuring materials in this regard, as is evident from recent reports,' he said. The Indian spokesman was referring to investigations by Berlin authorities into an alleged conspiracy to smuggle plutonium, used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons, to Pakistan. Islamabad has denied involvement in any plutonium plot. Pakistan's opposition Moslem League party yesterday tried to back away from Mr Sharif's statement that Pakistan had produced nuclear weapons. Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir which both nations say belongs to them. They came near a third war in 1990 and many fear any future battle could quickly escalate into a nuclear exchange. Like India, Pakistan is believed to have all the necessary components needed for a bomb and the ability to assemble one in a matter of days or even hours. Pakistan's military and political leaders say the nuclear programme is needed to deter India, its arch-rival. But successive governments, including Mr Sharif's, have maintained that the country has stopped short of building a bomb. Mr Sharif refused to answer journalists' questions after a three-hour meeting of his party's leadership in Islamabad yesterday. Instead, Mr Chaudhary Shujaat Hussain, an opposition senator, accused Ms Bhutto's government of 'exploiting the issue surrounding Mr Sharif's statement, to divert attention from a planned opposition campaign next month'. But some officials suspected Mr Sharif had sparked the controversy in an effort to seek public support, especially from nationalists, ahead of an anti-government protest planned to begin in about three weeks. Others, however, suggested he had probably miscalculated the sensitivity of the issue. 'Sharif must now be thinking it was wrong to make such a statement in public. The nuclear issue can be extremely testy in the west,' one senior western diplomat said last night.</p>

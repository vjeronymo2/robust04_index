			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, presidential </F> candidate of the Democratic Alliance, by Lyssette Condassin;  place not given -- live]    [Text] [Condassin] Dr. Arnulfo Arias [founder of the  Arnulfist Party] became an immortal personality for Panamanians.  You, in a certain way, also became a very important personality,  not only because you are the first woman to compete in the  [presidential] elections, but because you are perhaps very close  to becoming the first woman president of the Republic. Dona  Mireya, as a woman, how do you feel? What can you tell us?    [Moscoso] I feel very happy to see that the Panamanian  people  have given me support, affection. I have been walking for three  months and wherever have I walked people have welcomed me with  plenty of affection. They came out to receive me at their  doorstep only to shake hands. Some wanted me only to touch  their children and allow them to shake hands; others wanted me  to bless them. I have received during these walks so much  satisfaction from thousands of people. As a woman, this has  been a challenge for me, but I am very happy with this challenge.    [Condassin] If you come to power, what would your first  action be?    [Moscoso] If tonight or tomorrow I am declared president,  the  first thing I would do would be to call on all Panamanians, all  parties, to join forces. My government will be of national  unity. We want the Panamanian people, after 21 years, to be like  a family; that we forget the past, the fights; and that this be  a government of national reconciliation.    [Condassin] Well, Mrs. Mireya, we want to ask you just one  more question because we imagine you are very tired. We want to  know, did Dr. Arnulfo Arias ever give you any sort of advice on  perhaps how to rule the country?    [Moscoso] [chuckles] Dr. Arias gave me plenty of advice. The  truth is that he was a marvelous man; he was my best teacher.  Today we have remembered him very much. I believe that  wherever Dr. Arias is he must feel very proud of what I have  done for his party and what I am doing for the people. This is  work that he was not allowed to complete and I know I will  complete for him.    [Condassin] Did you, while you were his wife, ever imagine  that you could be president of the Republic of Panama?    [Moscoso] Never. He was this country's leader; he was  president five times, elected by the people's will. I was only  his companion; I was his wife, but I never thought I would  attain this position. I am in this position because God has  placed me on this path, but I never imagined.    [Condassin] Dear viewers, Arnulfist Party members have a  very  positive attitude. Even though results are still not official,  these results greatly favor this party, according to the  Arnulfists.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Burns to unveil shake-up of Treasury today Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury's permanent secretary, will today spell out details of a long-awaited internal restructuring plan to the department's 1,400 staff. The proposals, which some reports suggest could lead to the departure of perhaps 20 senior officials and a substantial number in lower grades, will reflect the findings of a fundamental review of the Treasury's spending and running costs announced in last November's Budget. This has been combined with an internal inquiry into the style, workload, and external image of the Treasury that was initiated in early 1992. The outcome will be one of the most exhaustive reviews of a ministry. Mandarins elsewhere in Whitehall have looked on in quiet amazement at the intensity with which Sir Terry has presided over the investigation into the Treasury's operations and his determination to reshape Whitehall's pivotal ministry for a greatly changed role in the future. The pressure for change has come from Sir Terry rather than Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, although it is known that Mr Clarke has an interest in improving the efficiency of the Treasury, 'delayering' management where possible, and ensuring that the department functions as a broad economics ministry. Much of the impetus for the restructuring has come from developments elsewhere in government. It has become increasingly difficult to reconcile the Treasury's traditional 'command and control' style of public-sector management with an environment in which other ministries operate in a more decentralised manner and more responsibility is given to executive agencies. During the summer Sir Terry said that this change in Whitehall management culture meant that the Treasury was 'looking quite fundamentally at the sort of jobs we do and asking 'Should we be doing them?'.' Sir Terry's aim has been for the Treasury to place more emphasis on setting the agenda for policy and be less involved with detail and second-guessing other ministries. It has become apparent in recent weeks that this process would leave some officials who have monitored activities in spending departments surplus to requirements. The review has been handled by Mr Jeremy Heywood, a young Treasury high-flier who was principal private secretary to Mr Clarke and Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor. The process has been supervised by Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI. It is unclear how far the proposals, which will be given to staff by Sir Terry and other top officials at meetings today, will be negotiable. Treasury officials yesterday declined to comment on a report in the The Guardian newspaper that the proposed shake-up could result in the departure of a third of the Treasury's 24 under-secretaries.</p>

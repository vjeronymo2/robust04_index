			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: House of Fraser Private investors, by now used to being squeezed in small flotations, will have to get used to being squeezed in large ones if the House of Fraser float is any guide. The Stock Exchange is allowing SG Warburg to place 75 per cent of the issue - without any clawback - leaving only around Pounds 100m-worth in an offer for sale. Yet given the flow of retail funds into the stock market, it is hard for the exchange to argue a lack of interest. The tilt on the playing field seems to have shifted further in the direction of an easy life for lead managers and guaranteed allocations for institutions. In the circumstances it is fortunate that House of Fraser is unlikely to prove a glittering star. Its large, if not particularly saleable, property portfolio provides a solid asset base. But its growth prospects as a retailer are hardly electrifying. Much-needed remedial work by its new management means that some improvement must be possible, but the company's ability to invest in the business is constrained by its cash flow. The company also faces a struggle to present high quality service at the same time as cutting staff and introducing more part-timers. Department store retailing is increasingly unfashionable and, while House of Fraser's performance may improve, that of other retailers will improve faster. The Fayeds have also been trying to sell the company for a long time. That argues for a discount to the sector. Presumably such considerations are why Warburg wants to control the float, though if it can tickle the price up in the placing, there will be even less for retail investors to shoot at.</p>

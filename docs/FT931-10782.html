			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / That terrible tap on the shoulder: Japan's middle management is losing its identity When 35 managers at Pioneer Electronic, the video and audio equipment maker, were given the 'shoulder tap', as compulsory retirement is known in Japan, the collective disbelief of middle management echoed through the country's business magazines, which concluded unanimously that the salaryman warrior faces an 'identity crisis'. The number of redundancies pales in comparison with the large-scale lay-offs at IBM or General Motors or DAF, the truck maker, but the outrage and the insecurity prompted by Pioneer's pruning reflects a deep disillusionment among the middle-aged men popularly believed to have rebuilt Japan since the second world war. Pioneer has extended the deadline for the 35 'samurai', who were supposed to have cleared their desks by January 31. But the decision still stands and most of the group have already accepted that they have no future at the struggling company, and are coming to terms with a role as a 'wet autumn leaf', clinging uncomfortably to their wives at home. A 56-year-old among those to be made redundant complained that no explanation was given as to why he was chosen: 'All they told me was that I was not of use - what does that mean, not of use?' The sense of uselessness undermines the self-image of his generation, which began careers in the late 1950s, when the semi-spiritual drive to build a strong Japan provided a well-defined role for the selfless salaryman. Managers are not alone in their confusion. Japan as a country now longs for a well-defined role. The clear targets of post-war economic revival have been met, and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, now talks curiously of making the nation a 'lifestyle superpower'. The country is searching for a new role in Asia, a new relationship with the US, and a new international identity. The Pioneer case also emphasised to workers that past loyalties are up for renegotiation in a period of corporate restructuring. Cost-cutting programmes have generally targeted women and part-time workers, who are not thought to be party to lifetime employment agreements and whose retrenchment does not cause controversy. Companies other than Pioneer have already told middle managers to move on, but less bluntly. Managers working in head office may be told that they will be transferred to a remote sales branch, meaning that there is no place for them within the company. The verdict is often delivered in obscure language, though a lack of explanation is considered to be the 'Japanese way'. The 59-year-old wife of one of the Pioneer 35 argued that this vagueness is unacceptable to a worker faithful for four decades, singing the company song, eating in the canteen, and devoting most of his 'quality time' to the office and not the family: 'He's been with them for 40 years. I guess there's no point in being angry, but things should be clearer. It's really very difficult to accept.' It's also difficult for the same generation to accept that their corporate devotion no longer inspires younger Japanese, who have more pity than respect for the Burberry-coated men half-asleep on the late train home. Over the past month, several Japanese researchers have concluded that the average middle-aged manager is abrasive in handling his juniors, prompts women to turn the other way on train platforms, and tends to forget his wife's birthday. Another survey, by the prime minister's office, found that middle management attitudes are themselves shifting. About 48.4 per cent of employees in their 40s now believe that job-hopping is acceptable compared with a mere 17.1 per cent in 1983. The result gives the impression that workers are becoming less loyal just as companies are unable to afford loyalty. But Japanese workers are yet to be 'empowered'. They may be in favour of job-hopping, but the risks of moving daunt individuals still unclear where obligations end and rights begin. The afternoon tabloid newpapers, aimed at the middle-aged male worker, provide a clue to the image this generation finds appealing. Each day, the papers are dominated by the name and an action photograph of Mr Shigeo Nagashima, 56, a legendary slugger who has returned from a 12-year retirement to coach the country's best-known baseball team, the Yomiuri Giants. The well-dressed Mr Nagashima's training tips are plastered across the news pages, giving the impression that he is a modern-day oracle. He is taken far more seriously than the country's politicians, who are keen to be photographed in his presence. A youth magazine surveyed its readers on the man they would most like to have as the department head in their office, and Mr Nagashima came out on top. At least in one respect, some of the younger generation still share the ideals of their superiors.</p>

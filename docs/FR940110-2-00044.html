CNG states that increased rates are necessary primarily to recover increased operation and maintenance expenses, increased costs of material and supplies, increased costs of transportation by others, increased depreciation expense, increased taxes, stranded costs, and increased plant investment. The filed rate of return is based on a capitalization of 65.73 percent common equity and 34.27 percent debt with an equity return of 14 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG's filing includes primary and alternate tariff sheets. CNG states that the primary tariff sheets reflect the end of CNG's gathering rate moratorium and the establishment of a two-part gathering rate. The alternate tariff sheets reflect continuation of the gathering rate moratorium that was approved for CNG in Docket No. RP88&hyph;211. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG states that it has posted and served its filing in accordance with &sect;154.16 of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211).

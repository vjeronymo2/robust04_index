			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / South Africa's economy goes into further decline THE fragile economic background to South Africa's political transition process was yesterday underlined by Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the country's central bank. Speaking at the bank's annual general meeting in Pretoria, Dr Stals described the past year as one of 'frustration and disappointment'. The country had experienced a deepening of the longest recession since 1945  - real gross domestic product fell at annualised rates of 2 and 2.5 per cent in the first and second quarters of 1992. Despite the weak state of the economy Dr Stals resisted calls to relax monetary policy in order to boost the economy. He also rejected pleas to devalue the rand, as endorsed last week by the Old Mutual, the country's largest insurer. Dr Stals also said the country could only enjoy lower nominal interest rates when inflation had been brought down. Inflation, which has exceeded 10 per cent a year for 20 years, is now running at 15.1 per cent, according to the June consumer price index. 'The reduction of the inflation rate must remain a policy priority, even in the present subdued economy,' he said. Acknowledging that serious problems of poverty, unemployment and a declining standard of living would be exacerbated by another year of contraction - 1992 will be the sixth year of decline since 1982 - Dr Stals commented: 'Neither the cause of, nor the solution to this dilemma, should be looked for in monetary policy.'</p>

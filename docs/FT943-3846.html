			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banesto sells stake in zinc group Corporacion Banesto, the Spanish industrial holding company, has sold 23 per cent of Asturiana de Zinc (Azsa), Europe's largest zinc producer, for Pta10.6bn (Dollars 82.6m) to a group of international investors for Pta1,500 a share, reducing its stake to just over 50 per cent. The sale represents the third large disinvestment in less than two months by La Corporacion, whose parent Banco Espanol de Credito Banesto, was acquired this year by Banco Santander in a Dollars 2bn takeover. AB Asesores, a Madrid investment bank, Germany's Deutsche Bank and Robert Fleming of the UK managed the Azsa disposal. Banesto said La Corporacion policy was to dispose of its assets gradually as price opportunities arose. 'We are overhauling the management of all the companies controlled by the holding company and we are not conducting a fire sale for any of the companies.' The mining company, exposed both to the cyclical price of zinc and to the dollar-peseta exchange rate, reduced its losses by 47 per cent to Pta2bn in the first half of this year and is forecast to post 1994 losses of Pta4.4bn, against losses of Pta8.3bn last year. Analysts expect the company to break even next year.</p>

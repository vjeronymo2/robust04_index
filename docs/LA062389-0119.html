			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Pieces of unstretched, silver-coated primed canvas ripped into rectangles form  the ground for John McCormick's tantalizing fragments of written narrative. His  stark paintings usually consist of a single rough black sketch related  literally to the lines of script. Often the words are obscured by the image as  they verbally weep thoughts of death or frustrated dreams. The power of  McCormick's images lies in their poignance. Phrases are intriguing. They make  up in poetry what the drawings lack in invention, capturing something of the  soul-bruising pain of an encounter with conscience.  </P> <P> Next to McCormick's paintings, Steve Tannen's precise irregular wood panels are  cut and dried. Each painting is a abstracted Puritan work ethic parable touting  steadfast effort in the pursuit of noble ideals. If the geometric symbolism  seems simplistic, the work is alluring nonetheless for its glowing color and  the sheer excellence of its craft and painting.  </P> <P> In the front entry of the gallery is a fragmented, colorless and cynical  installation by Steve Heino entitled "Naval Science." Suggesting instruments  used in navigation and a ghostly hull floating in thin air, the works create a  haunting but frustrating walk though a unmarked navy museum for the terminally  lost. More a collection of unrelated individual items than a single  installation, these beacons and buoys refuse to interrelate so that every line  of sight leads determinedly to a blank wall. Stoic isolation and a series of  dead ends makes each piece an island of purposeless existence. (Jan Baum  Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to July 8.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

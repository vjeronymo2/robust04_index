			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Watchdog attacks 'flaws' in GCSE marking This year's GCSE exams, which showed an improvement in standards, were more rigorously marked than last year's but still showed 'serious flaws', it was announced yesterday. Mr John Patten welcomed the findings by Ofsted, the education watchdog, but called for a 'back to basics' change to the marking scheme for exams next year to ensure consistent marking for spelling, punctuation and grammar. He said: 'We must ensure that a consistent system is in place before the next round of GCSE examinations.' The Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department quango chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, has been charged with introducing the new system. Sir Ron echoed Mr Patten's call: 'We will work with the examining boards to eradicate remaining weaknesses in the GCSE including, in particular, the way that the basic skills of spelling, punctuation and grammar are assessed.' Inspectors found that criteria for assessing basic literacy skills were flawed, with some candidates being penalised for spelling mistakes when they were attempting to use complicated vocabulary. In science exams some candidates were marked down for poor spelling and grammar even though their exam scripts provided little evidence of this. Inspectors were also concerned that the correct balance was not being struck between exams and coursework, both of which count towards the GCSE qualification - the principal examination for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. They said levels of attainment were 'worryingly uneven' across the whole syllabus, while there was a danger that some more demanding parts of a syllabus 'will be given insufficient attention in the classroom'. In English, coursework was strongly presented and organised but 'let down by an inability to rise to the challenge of a timed, formal examination'. Last year the inspectors delivered a damning report on the GCSE results, saying they had 'little confidence' that standards were being maintained. The GCSE was introduced in 1988. Mr Patten welcomed the inspectors' latest finding that the exams had been marked more rigorously than in 1992. This followed the introduction of a new code of practice by the examining boards after Mr Patten had said that apparent improvements in results were due to lower standards, rather than improved performance by pupils.</p>

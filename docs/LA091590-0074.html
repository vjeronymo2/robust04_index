			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEWHALL PARENTS PRAISED  </P> <P> Hats off to the Newhall School District parents for their willingness to make  personal sacrifices in order to provide a new, much needed, school for their  children.  </P> <P> If these parents can manage this monumental task, maybe there's a money  management lesson to be learned by the state of California. Every community  deserves the same caliber school the Newhall School District will have. Wake  up, California. Where are your priorities?  </P> <P> SHARON KELLEY  </P> <P> Canyon Country  </P></p>

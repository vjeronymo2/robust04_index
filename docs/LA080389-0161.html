			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> SNAVELY SENTENCING DELAYED  </P> <P> Sentencing of South Gate Councilman Odell L. Snavely for harboring two teen-age  girls at his toy store when he knew they should have been in school has been  postponed until Sept. 15.  </P> <P> Municipal Court Commissioner J. Francis Spelman last week allowed Snavely to  change lawyers and gave the new attorney, Walter R. Urban, time to acquaint  himself with the case.  </P> <P> Snavely pleaded no contest in February to two misdemeanor charges of  contributing to the truancy of a minor.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department conducted a six-month investigation of the councilman  after two South Gate Junior High School girls, ages 13 and 14, said Snavely  touched them on the breasts while they were working at his business.  </P> <P> According to a Sheriff's Department report, which is part of Snavely's court  file, four girls claimed they had been molested by Snavely, who paid them to  help clean his store.  </P> <P> Snavely has denied molesting anyone. He said the girls fabricated the  accusations to distract from the theft of some jewelry from his store. He said  he threatened to report them for truancy unless they returned the jewelry.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Freeman did not object to the continuance. He has  recommended that Snavely serve a year in jail and a five-year probation.  </P></p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Checking out your bank account - In A Nutshell Ninety-five per cent of business bank accounts contain errors, according to a survey of 152 accounts carried out by Bankchek, a specialist consultancy. It found that in 75 cases banks had overcharged their customers, while in 70 they had undercharged. Only seven accounts were correct. The average amount overcharged was Pounds 1,412 a year while the undercharging amounted to Pounds 956. Bankchek ascribed the high error rate to poor administrative systems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Elisabeth Crona report: "Johansson Views Ruling as a </F> Victory"]    [Excerpt] Prime Minister Carl Bildt (Moderate Coalition  Party) is clearly disappointed with the Water Rights Court's  ruling and clearly irritated that the bridge consortium did not  provide the court with the full figures.    The matter must now be settled as soon as possible, he  declared at a news conference yesterday afternoon. At the same  time he reiterated that the new supplementary investigation must  not be "a rushed and slovenly job."    Yesterday, Carl Bildt was several times in contact with  Danish Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democratic  Party). Their comments have been restrained in tone and well  coordinated.    But according to information received by SVENSKA DAGBLADET,  the Danish Government is extremely impatient that the go-ahead  from Sweden is taking such a long time.    Every time there is a new delay the Danish media show  pictures of the places where hundreds of houses have already  been demolished to make way for the bridge and interviews with  unhappy former house owners.    At the same time internal Danish criticism is growing. And  Denmark, like Sweden, will hold elections in the fall.    However, Center Party leader and Environment Minister Olof  Johansson is happy and while on an election tour visiting a high  school in Harnosand commented as follows on the court's  pronouncement:    "This is something of a victory for the Center Party," he  said, speaking of a "rebuff for the consortium," a new round of  consultations, and a possible decision as late as this fall,  perhaps after the election.    Carl Bildt responded by saying that the question of a new  round of consultations has by no means been decided and that he  dislikes Johansson's talk of victory.    Johansson is confusing his roles, the prime minister hinted:    "If he is approaching the issue in party political terms,  this could bring him into conflict with his responsibility as  the minister who must deal with the matter."

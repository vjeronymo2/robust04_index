			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 28 (BTA) -- Yugoslavia and Bulgaria  could play the leading role in the establishment of new  relations in the Balkans, Belgrade's ambassador to Sofia, Mr.  Rados Smilkovic, told the KONTINENT daily. He believes in the  need for a new philosophy of peaceful co-existence. "The  Balkans will either constitute a free, democratic and developed  part of Europe or will not exist at all," he said.    In his opinion, the sanctions against Yugoslavia have long  become unwarranted, as Serbs are no longer involved in the war  in Bosnia; the war is now between Croats and Muslims and among  Muslims themselves. Besides, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have yet  another thing in common: They both suffer from the embargo.  Yugoslavia's neighbours which are most affected by the embargo  should insist that the United Nations lift the sanctions, he  said.    Yugoslavia assigns top priority to its relations with  Bulgaria, he said. "Our relations are good, but are not up to  the inner needs and the potential of two neighbour nations." In  his opinion, the Bulgarian minority in Yugoslavia suffers  relatively less from the sanctions owing to the humanitarian aid  it receives regularly from Bulgaria and to some unspecified  "other benefits" from life along the border. According to Mr.  Smilkovic, there is no reason to worry about the preservation of  the national identity of Bulgarians in Yugoslavia. "I have  never read in the Bulgarian press that Bulgarian minorities  anywhere enjoy more rights and are more satisfied with their  lives," he said.    In an interview for STANDART NEWS in January Mr. Smilkovic  said that Bulgarians in Yugoslavia were not many at the time the  federation was formed and that they were embarrassed by the fact  that they were receiving aid from Bulgaria on an ethnic basis.  "We are sorry that we have to deny the words of the ambassador  of the country whose citizens we happen to be," Mr. Dimitur  Dimitrov, member of the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in  Yugoslavia in Bosilegrad, writes in a letter to the same daily.  Another member of that organization, Mr. Marko Shukarev from  Tsaribrod, also denies statements of Ambassador Smilkovic in his  interview in January. He disagrees with Mr. Smilkovic's  assertion that the problems of the Bulgarian minority in  Yugoslavia are needlessly politicized by the Bulgarian mass  media. Mr. Shukarev also denies that the newspaper of the  Bulgarian minority is no longer published because of the UN  sanctions. Neither the Democratic Union of Bulgarians in  Yugoslavia nor the Bulgarian newspapers are raising nonexistent  problems, he said. Not a single problem has been settled so  far, be it educational or religious. "Do not blame Bulgarians,  they know what they lack!" reads the headline in STANDARD NEWS  which carries both letters.</p>

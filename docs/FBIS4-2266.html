			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 7 (XINHUA) -- World Bank officials, on  a visit to Shandong from April 4-6, said that the bank's  operations in this east China province had been very successful.    Nicholas C. Hope, the new director of the bank's China and  Mongolia Office, said he was very satisfied that projects  financed by loans from the bank had been going so well.    On his first day in his new post, the director visited the  expressway connecting Jinan, the provincial capital, and the  port city of Qingdao, and an irrigation project in Qufu, the  home of Confucius, both backed by World Bank loans.    He was accompanied by Pieter P. Bottelier, the bank's chief  of mission to China, and officials from the Chinese Ministry of  Finance.    Mr. Hope said he was deeply impressed by the province's  strict management and efficient organization in project  operations, and that the province had never delayed repayment of  loans.    From 1982 to the end of last year, the World Bank had  provided loans worth 824 million U.S. dollars on 26 projects in  agriculture, traffic, health and education, and 16 of them have  been completed.    Mr. Hope said that Shandong has great development potential  and provides many profitable investment opportunities. He  expressed the wish that the bank would continue and expand its  good cooperative relations with Shandong.    At the end of his visit, Mr. Hope received six applications  from the provincial government for loans for six projects in  coastal environmental protection, traffic, power supply and  rural housing development. The proposed loans total 1.6 billion  U.S. dollars.    Mr. Hope said he would take the applications to the bank's  Washington headquarters, and that he would personally actively  support them.</p>

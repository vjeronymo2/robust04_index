			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: McDonald's earnings at Dollars 228m peak McDONALD'S Corporation, the world's largest hamburger chain, reported record earnings for both the year and fourth quarter, and modest gains in sales, particularly overseas. For the quarter, net income was Dollars 227.9m, or 61 cents a share, up 14 per cent from Dollars 200.4m, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 10 per cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 5.2bn a year ago. Revenues, which due to franchising agreements are below sales, were Dollars 1.8bn, up 6 per cent from Dollars 1.6bn a year ago. For the year, McDonald's earned Dollars 958.6m, or Dollars 2.60 per share, up 12 per cent from Dollars 859.6m, or Dollars 2.35 cents, a year ago. Sales for the period were Dollars 21.9bn, compared with Dollars 19.9bn, and revenues were Dollars 7.1bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars 6.7bn. US sales grew 6 per cent in the year and 9 per cent in the quarter, while overseas sales gains were stronger. Overseas sales were up 17 per cent for the year and 13 per cent for the quarter. At December 31, 39 per cent of McDonald's sales, 44 per cent of its operating income, and 32 per cent of its restaurants came from outside the US. McDonald's said improvements in the US were largely due to cuts in operating and development costs, and its value pricing programme. Overseas, expansion and improved operating margins bolstered profits.</p>

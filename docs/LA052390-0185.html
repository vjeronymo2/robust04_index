			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIMULCASTING DISPUTE REDUCES PURSES AT NEW YORK RACE TRACKS  </P> <P> Purses are being reduced at New York thoroughbred tracks and Yonkers Raceway, a  harness racing facility, officials of the tracks said today, blaming revenue  lost through a simulcasting dispute.  </P> <P> Because of a contractual dispute with Catskill OTB, there has been no  simulcasting of Aqueduct and Belmont Park races at Yonkers Raceway since Jan.  10.  </P> <P> NYRA purses will be cut almost 14% effective Saturday, and Yonkers purses will  be reduced by about 12% effective Memorial Day, the organizations said in a  joint statement.  </P> <P> NYRA officials estimate that loss of revenues because of the dispute will mean  a decline of $3.75 million a year in funds available for purses.  </P> <P> "Without legislative help it is unlikely that these purse cuts can be  restored," NYRA President Gerard J. McKeon said.  </P></p>

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Bosnian Croats take key town A heavy combined force of Bosnian and Croat soldiers yesterday overran the strategic town of Kupres in central Bosnia, in a substantial setback for the Bosnian Serb army. It is the first important town the Bosnian Serbs have lost since the early days of the 31-month war in Bosnia and raises fears the war will spread, possibly forcing Serbia proper to come to their aid. The Kupres plateau, dubbed the door to Bosnia, is of strategic importance for all three communities. The joint offensive yesterday fuelled speculation that Croats and Moslems could now fight each other over Kupres, which was 51 per cent Serb and 39 per cent Croat before the war broke out. UN officials last night confirmed the presence of regular Croatian army units in the fighting for Kupres, which casts a shadow over any prospects for progress in Serbo-Croat peace talks. Fresh talks between Croat officials and rebel Serbs from Krajina, the self-styled state in Croatia, ended yesterday in Knin, the Serb stronghold just over the border in neighbouring Croatia, with little sign of progress towards agreement. Yesterday, cracks appeared for the first time in the news blackout on the conflict imposed by Serbia. Belgrade radio reported the Serb setbacks against the week-long Moslem offensive which it had completely ignored. The end of the media blockade signals mounting pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia from the Yugoslav army and within his ruling Socialists to re-supply Serb-held lands in Bosnia. The Bosnian Serbs have blamed the blockade imposed by Serbia three months ago for their recent losses.</p>

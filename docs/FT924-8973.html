			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Hawks and Handsaws: Take me to your hologram EVERY time I visit the FT's London office I cross from the north bank of the River Thames to the south bank: from civilisation and well-being to the stinks and stews of Southwark; from probity and moral order to chaos and licentiousness; from dancing and feasting and women in glass slippers to dirt, danger, darkness and depravity. I cross at Southwark Bridge, and always glance down - horrified at the rubbish in the Thames and at the colour of the river. Filth-coloured. Sludge-coloured. The colour of despair. There are times when the Thames seems to glow with an apocalyptic sheen. I am sure it is radio-active. Imagine my amazement, then, every time I read an article about efforts to re-establish the Thames as a river fit for salmon. It is a story in which I have an ancestral professional interest, for one black evening in the 1970s I was dispatched by the News desk to a hastily-called press conference in Fleet Street at which the Thames river authorities displayed - wrapped in tin-foil and mildly refrigerated - the slim, still corpse of the first salmon found in the Thames for many a long year. As the corpse was unveiled, the Telegraph reporter, a mature and well-topped woman, recoiled and almost wept. I wrote 400 words of story; put them over to copy; was hailed by the News desk for all-round speed and dash; replaced the receiver gently; checked my hair in a mirror; adopted an innocent look; sidled across to the Telegraph; asked sweetly if she was better, and offered to victual and comfort her. No limits bound her gratitude. Amidst all the shenanigans, I had not failed to detect that the purpose of the press conference, the point of parading this salmon, was to foster the impression that the Thames was on the road to recovery. It was no longer a notorious sewer or a conduit for industrial waste but a gentler, fairer river than at any time since the mid-19th century. No doubt it is a gentler, fairer river than in 1850, say, when the sewage of 2m Londoners was emptied straight into the river and the famed Thames salmon was extinct. (In 1822, the Art of Angling had claimed that Thames salmon 'surpassed all others in flavour' and rated the Thames England's principal salmon river). And no doubt the efforts by the authorities and the Thames Salmon Trust to re-establish the Thames salmon run are admirable for their ingenuity and single-mindedness in the face of maddening odds. But what a vexing and costly business. What an extravagant piece of PR, for the Thames still looks like trash, still looks radio-active, however many demented, returning fish can be enticed to make the fatal run from the estuary to Teddington or beyond. The recorded number of salmon passing through the Thames Salmon Trust's fish trap at Molesey this summer was 261, indicating, says the trust, that the number that returned from the open sea to the river was about 500. Its target is 1,000 returnees. But the effort is immense. This year, more than 200,000 parr and smolts will have been tipped into the Thames and its tributaries. The cost of fish-passes on weirs is Pounds 40,000 or more. Eleven have been installed; 11 more are needed. It is all amazingly silly - PR at its finest, which means PR at its worst. But I believe I have a solution: a run of mechanical salmon, a shoal of clockwork fish. I am sure Japan would make them for a surprisingly modest sum. I envisage about 400, some of 90lb, 20lb greater than the one landed from the Thames in April 1789, which had a girth of 36in and was sold for a shilling a pound. Three times a day, every day of the year, my clockwork run of salmon would zip gleamingly up-river, leaping as they went - and then zip down again. But why stop there? In the era that lies before us, the age of virtual reality, we won't need mechanical salmon; we will do it all with lasers. Britain won't have nuclear submarines - just grey and ghostly illusions diving beneath the waves. Above all, we won't have Laurel and Hardy to wreck and crucify us. Our leaders will be holograms, and all the better for it.</p>

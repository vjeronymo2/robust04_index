The Plaza program will culminate with a  bilingual production of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" called "Nuestro Barrio"  next spring. CalArts jazz instructors and master students will work with eight  high schools in the Watts Towers area to eventually present two jazz concerts  next spring and possibly form a high school jazz band.

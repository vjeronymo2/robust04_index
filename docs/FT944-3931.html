			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Ferranti gets DTI grant The government is giving Pounds 500,000 in regional selective assistance to help fund the management buyout of Ferranti Technologies in Oldham, Greater Manchester. The deal was completed yesterday, a year and a week after the company went into receivership, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey. The money will reduce the company's overdraft requirements to about Pounds 2.5m. The management is buying the business from Arthur Andersen, the receiver, for Pounds 3m, of which one-third is deferred for two years and the rest split equally between equity funding and a bank loan. Ferranti Technologies makes computer systems and components for the avionic, transport and defence industries. Mr Trevor Tuckley, who will head the company, said the grant from the DTI had been the final funding link to close the deal.</p>

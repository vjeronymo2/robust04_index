			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> April 18, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would relocate the fire protection requirements of Technical Specifications (TSs) 3.14 and 4.12, and fire brigade staffing and training requirements of TSs 6.2.2(f) and 6.4.2 from the TSs to administratively-controlled operational specifications. Specifically, the proposed changes would add the NRC standard fire protection license condition to the Operating License, update the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) to include the Fire Protection Program by reference, and relocate the fire protection requirements from the TSs to the Indian Point 3 Operational Specifications Manual. The proposed changes have been developed in accordance with the guidance contained in NRC Generic Letter (GL) 86&hyph;10, ``Implementation of Fire Protection Requirements,'' and GL 88&hyph;12, ``Removal of Fire Protection Requirements from the Technical Specifications.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards based on the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed amendment merely relocates the fire protection program elements from the Technical Specifications to the Operational Specifications and the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report]. No reduction in content is being made to the Technical Specification requirements that are being relocated. Operating limitations will continue to be imposed, and required surveillances will continue to be performed in accordance with written procedures and instructions auditable by the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although future proposed changes to the fire protection program elements previously located in the Technical Specifications will no longer be controlled by 10 CFR 50.90, proposed changes to the Fire Protection requirements relocated to the Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, programmatic controls will continue to assure that future proposed fire protection program changes will not create an unreviewed safety question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the safety analysis report is not created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed amendment merely relocates the fire protection Technical Specification requirements from the Technical Specifications to the Operational Specifications. No reduction to the fire protection Technical Specification requirements is being made and thus the change does not create the possibility of a new or different accident from those previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, future changes to the requirements in the Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Response:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The margin of safety as defined in the bases for any technical specification is not reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed amendment does not involve a reduction to the approved fire protection program or Fire Protection Technical Specification requirements. The Technical Specification fire protection requirements are being relocated, with no reduction in content, to the Operational Specifications. Since there is no reduction in the requirements, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, proposed changes to the Fire Protection Technical Specification requirements relocated to the Operational Specifications will be evaluated by plant administrative procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10601.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Charles M.

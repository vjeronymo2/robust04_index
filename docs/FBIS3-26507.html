Mrs. Annamaria Kokeny,  deputy head of the International Treaties Department, Ministry  of Finance said in an interview with CNA that a treaty on the  elimination of double taxation should be an intergovernmental  agreement, but Hungary can't sign such a document because it has  no diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.    The formalities needed to approve an investment protection  treaty have been changed recently, she said. Now a  parliamentary endorsement is also necessary, thus the legal  situation is the same as in the case of other interstate  treaties.    However, it would be possible to enter into an investment  protection contract between the chambers of commerce. The  Hungarian official added that such an agreement could include  only recommendations and rules, and would not have mandatory  force. In her view the existing laws and regulations on  investments -- both in Hungary and Taiwan -- make most  investments quite secure.    According to official records, Hungary has valid bilateral  treaties or treaties awaiting parliamentary confirmation on the  elimination of double taxation with 41 countries.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Macro 4 improves 14% to Pounds 3.8m Increased turnover and profits in its overseas subsidiaries enabled group turnover and pre-tax profits at Macro 4, the independent software company, to rise by 9 per cent and 14 per cent respectively in the six months to December 31. This was in line with the board's expectations, said Mr Terry Kelly, chairman. Taxable profits advanced to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 3.37m) and were struck on turnover of Pounds 8.83m (Pounds 8.1m). Earnings rose to 11.5p (10.1p restated) and the interim dividend is lifted to 5.14p (3.825p). Mr Kelly said that the UK had continued to be 'a cautious and nervous marketplace against a depressed economic background'. Longer purchase decision cycles were also noticeable in Scandinavia and Australia.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Midlands cheered by prospects for exports BUSINESS leaders looked at the new world and found it, if not good, at least better than on Tuesday, or last week - or even last month. Yesterday's meeting of the west Midlands regional council of the Confederation of British Industry pondered the fate of the floating, devalued pound and the government's stricken anti-inflation policy. When participants came out of the council chamber they smiled. 'The meeting was not depressed by any means,' said Mr Bryan Townsend, the chairman. But manufacturers in this traditional manufacturing region are far from jumping for joy. On the domestic market 'confidence is low, the state of trade is depressed', according to Mr Townsend. Yet losing the restraints of the exchange rate mechanism means opportunities for exporters have suddenly emerged. 'A year down the road, people may be saying this (the devaluation) was a jolly good thing,' said Mr Edward Roberts, chief executive of Heath Springs, a Redditch company which saw orders evaporate in June. Since the early-1980s recession, west Midlands manufacturers have become much more energetic in export markets. Painful bouts of cost-cutting have made them generally more competitive. A devalued currency adds an extra competitive margin. Sterling Tubes, the Walsall steel tubemaker, exports 70 per cent of its production. Fighting narrowing margins on an oversupplied market, the company was asking itself, said Mr Bill Good, the managing director, 'can we afford to remain in the US? Now we are committed to stay - 10 per cent from two dollars to the pound is worth Pounds 0.5m.' For Wagon Industrial, the Telford group with materials handling, engineering and automotive interests, devaluation is 'an extremely good thing'. Not only will it be able to export more, but also, said Mr John Hudson, the chief executive, 'the 50 per cent of group profits coming from overseas subsidiaries will be more valuable when translated into sterling'. The assessment is widely shared. 'In terms of us exporting, especially to the US,' said Mr Steven Mills, managing director of Bromsgrove Industries, an engineering mini-conglomerate, the lower pound-dollar rate 'will be much more conducive'. Although Mr Mills believed 'something was needed to give a kick-start to the economy' and that the lower pound 'in a perverse way will help', there remain nagging worries about immediate prospects. Treating devaluation as broadly good news, Mr David Probert, chairman of W. Canning, the speciality chemicals and electronics distribution group, added the caveat: 'One doesn't know how the funny games have affected business confidence.' Mr Roger Pauli, managing director of Stuart Crystal, feared further weakening of consumer confidence. 'We've enjoyed a modest level of retail growth this year but a weakening of consumer confidence could reverse that trend.' According to Mr Gilbert Johnston, deputy chairman of JC Bamford Excavators, the Staffordshire group, the events of the past few days 'are not going to help the construction industry, which is in its worst recession since the war'. What JCB would like is what many others want. 'It would obviously be better for interest rates to go down substantially to encourage our business and everybody else's,' said Mr Johnston. West Midlands CBI wants the government to bear down on inflation by 'continuing to keep public-sector costs down, by keeping wage demands down,' said Mr Townsend.</p>

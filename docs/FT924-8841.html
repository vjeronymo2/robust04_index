			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / International Company News: Enlarged Critchley rises 27% to Pounds 1.28m CRITCHLEY Group, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer which is seeking a stock market listing through a share placing later this month, yesterday reported higher interim profits. At the pre-tax level they rose by 27 per cent to Pounds 1.28m on turnover 23 per cent ahead at Pounds 11.2m. Fully diluted earnings worked through at 8.4p. The figures for the six months to end-September included a contribution from EPC Identification Systems, a US-based company which was acquired at the start of April. Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive who led a Pounds 4.5m management buy-out of the company backed by a consortium of five institutional investors in 1984, said the interim results 'show that sales and profits are strongly ahead' and the business continues to expand. The group also issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday ahead of the placing which is designed to raise up to Pounds 15m, valuing the Stroud-based concern at about Pounds 25m.</p>

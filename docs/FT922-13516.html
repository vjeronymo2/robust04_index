			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Asia's fast-growing economies defy the world recession ECONOMIC growth in Asia is expected to accelerate this year and next, despite sluggish economies in the western world and Japan, the Asian Development Bank forecast yesterday. The annual economic outlook published by the Manila-based institution predicted growth for the region's developing economies of 6.5 per cent in 1992 and 6.7 per cent in 1993, faster than 1991's 5.8 per cent rise in real gross domestic product. Increased intra-regional trade and investment were helping to maintain rapid development in Asia, despite the weak performance of big industrial economies, especially the US, which is the region's biggest export market. Malaysia is expected to achieve the fastest growth in the area, followed by Thailand, China and Taiwan. Economic reforms are expected to boost recovery in South Asia. The ADB warned that environmental degradation, infrastructure bottlenecks and rapid population growth could reduce growth in some Asian countries, and that the slowdown in Japan would affect the region. It urged governments to spend more to protect the environment and control pollution. 'The rapid deforestation of south-east and south Asia under the onslaught of population pressures and indiscriminate logging and farming have increased the incidence of floods and droughts, and created havoc in local economies.' The ADB forecast an Aids epidemic in the region. Of 40m people expected to be infected worldwide by 2000, most would be in Asia. 'Preventive measures have to be given top priority by governments sooner rather than later,' it said. In its economic forecasts, the bank said labour shortages, particularly in Hong Kong and Taiwan, could push up wages and increase pressure to import more manpower. It recommended a shift away from labour-intensive industries. Rapid economic growth in China, forecast at 7.8 per cent for 1992, will not be sufficient to halt a rise in unemployment, which will intensify because of rises in the workforce and structural changes in the economy. China's imports are expected to grow faster than exports, and control of inflation will be essential, the ADB said. South Korea was confronted with 'a large and growing trade deficit, a relatively high rate of increase in wages and prices and infrastructure shortages that are beginning to undermine international competitiveness'. It said the Seoul government was faced with tough choices in an election year when fiscal restraint may be more difficult.</p>

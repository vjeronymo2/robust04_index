			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KENNEDY MEETS THE CHALLENGE WITH VICTORY OVER PACIFICA  </P> <P> After losing its first Garden Grove League game of the season, Kennedy High  School Coach John Mayberry issued a challenge to his players, telling them  their "magic number was 13."  </P> <P> And despite a slow start and making only 33% of their shots from the field  Friday night at Kennedy, the Fighting Irish met Mayberry's challenge. They  completed league play with their 13th victory, a 55-48 triumph over Pacifica.  </P> <P> Kennedy's victory, coupled with Rancho Alamitos' 78-64 victory over Bolsa  Grande Friday, placed the teams in a tie for the Garden Grove League  championship. Both teams finished with 13-1 records in league play, splitting  their two games against each other.  </P> <P> "Before the game tonight, I told the kids that if they don't win this one, the  other 12 don't mean anything," Mayberry said.  </P> <P> Kennedy came out tight, making only four of 15 shots in the first quarter, and  fell behind Pacifica 15-10 after one quarter.  </P> <P> Forward Jim Barker's game-high 25 points, 13 in the first half, kept Kennedy  close early. The Mariners built a 26-23 halftime lead, and Mayberry gave his  team another challenge.  </P> <P> "I told them at halftime, 'It is your championship to win, "' Mayberry said,  "'If you want it, go and get it. I have over 200 wins and six championships  already.' But another one is always nice."  </P> <P> Kennedy responded by scoring 11 points in the first two minutes of the third  quarter, and Pacifica never threatened again.  </P> <P> Center Jermaine Galloway defended the inside with eight blocks, and Barker made  six free throws in the final two minutes to seal the victory.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Garden Grove 84, La Quinta 64 -- Forward Mark Perry scored 22 points to pace  host Garden Grove (10-13, 8-6). Forward Joe Squires added 21 points and center  Bob Ioja had 19 for Garden Grove. Center Justin Sogoian led La Quinta (2-20,  2-12) with 15 points.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos 78, Bolsa Grande 64 -- Paul Preuss scored 21 points to lead  Rancho Alamitos, which rallied in the second half. Bolsa Grande led at the  half, 34-33, but Rancho Alamitos outscored Bolsa Grande, 26-20, in the third  quarter to take the lead. Rancho Alamitos ends the regular season 20-3, 13-1.  Hinh Bui scored 25 points for Bolsa Grande (8-13, 6-8).  </P></p>

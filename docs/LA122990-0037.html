			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> PONCHO SANCHEZ ADDS A DASH OF THE BLUES TO SALSA MIX  </P> <P> With nine albums to his credit, and as many years leading his own group, Poncho  Sanchez, who opened Thursday at the Vine Street Bar and Grill in Hollywood, has  become one of the most dynamically dependable symbols of Latin jazz.  </P> <P> Like most bands of its kind, his eight-piece ensemble is built essentially  around the percussion section. With the leader on congas, Ramon Banda on  timbales and Jose (Papo) Rodriguez on bongos, the three-horn front line often  plays a secondary role.  </P> <P> With David Torrez now serving as pianist and musical director, much of the  music is composed or arranged by him. The tunes, a mixture of old-time salsa  numbers and Latinized jazz pieces, sometimes lean toward blues-like elements  and boppish figures.  </P> <P> Sanchez has two remarkable soloists in the trombonist Art Velasco, who  dominated the Duke Ellington standard "In a Sentimental Mood," and the  trumpeter/fluegelhornist Sal Cracchiolo, a powerful performer with range and  chops to spare.  </P> <P> Typically, in some of the more traditional mamboesque works, Sanchez and a  couple of his sidemen will burst into good-humored vocals that are higher in  spirit than artistry. But the band comes vividly alive when the leader is  brewing ingenious cross-rhythms on his congas. During one 6/8 number, he stood  up and attacked them with sticks, and in the final "Bien Morena," he made  astonishingly facile use of a cowbell.  </P> <P> Gene Burkert lends an ethnic touch with his flute solos, doubling adequately on  tenor and alto sax. David Torrez's most significant role at the piano is that  of supplying hypnotic, repeated figures during the percussion interludes.  </P> <P> Although this may not be a seriously innovative idiom (one of the blues-like  numbers was a ringer for "Fascinating Rhythm"), it does build enough rhythmic  tension to maintain a generally engaging level of vitality and excitement.  </P> <P> Poncho Sanchez, Vine Street Bar and Grill, 1610 Vine St., Hollywood, (213)  463-4375, through Sunday.  </P> <P> LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

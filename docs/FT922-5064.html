			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Chambers offered single roof: Moves to merge two business organisations ON THE brink of the 21st century, the business organisations that have represented British companies since the end of the 19th are belatedly bringing themselves up to date. Plans for a merger between the Association of British Chambers of Commerce - founded in 1860 - and the National Chamber of Trade - established in 1895 - mark an important step towards consolidating the voice of smaller businesses. Their fragmented lobbying efforts have frequently been blamed for their ineffectiveness in influencing government policy. A merger would also represent an important boost to plans launched by the association just over 18 months ago to strengthen the chamber of commerce network. By linking with the NCT, which mainly represents retailers, the association would enhance its role as one of the country's big three national business groups, second to the Confederation of British Industry with 250,000 members and ahead of the Institute of Directors with 33,500 UK members. If the merger - in effect a takeover by the association of the less financially well endowed NCT - goes ahead in the autumn, it will end the confusion of two very similarly named organisations competing for public attention and for members in towns and cities up and down the country. The NCT draws a large chunk of its membership from 28 affiliated trade organisations representing among others booksellers, coal merchants and sports goods distributors. It also has 150 chambers around the country. The association heads a group of more than 100 chambers but is trying to improve patchy national coverage by creating a network of 55 core chambers. Around those will cluster smaller local chambers, some of them no more than social clubs. For the NCT, difficulties are even more acute. Average membership of local chambers of trade is 60 people. Even the largest six chambers of trade in towns such as Sheffield, Carlisle and Eastbourne have only 400 to 500 members. That compares with the larger chambers of commerce in London and Birmingham with 5,000 and 5,400 members respectively - although even those are tiny compared with the large, publicly funded Continental chambers. None of the chambers of trade is expected to have the resources to join the the association's core network. Both the association and the NCT have to cope with unaffiliated chambers that use the chamber title but are outside national membership for financial reasons or because they have fallen out with the national body. Although at first sight the addition of 150,000 new members to the association would be welcome to an organisation in the middle of a national recruitment drive to boost numbers from 83,000 to 150,000, many of the new members would be one-person businesses and corner shops. They do not conform to the association's target of dynamic businesses set on growth. They would, however, be welcome at a time when the association's own expansion programme has run up against the recession. With the impact of its recruitment drive yet to show through, the association is nursing a 7,000 loss in membership over the past two years. The association and the NCT have been trying for many years to merge. The two most recent attempts, in 1984 and 1986-87, failed because of differences of opinion about the relative weight of the two organisations in the combined group. So why do they now think they can get together? Mr Bernard Tennant, NCT director-general, believes it is because the association wants to fill an important gap in its coverage of UK industry sectors, namely retailing. The NCT is willing to accept a subordinate role as a retailing and small firms division of the association, prompted possibly by the sharp contraction in the number of smaller retailers in recent years - although not in its membership - and by financial constraints. The NCT still has a strong balance sheet but has made operating losses in the past two years because of a reluctance by member chambers to raise subscription rates. The association's reorganisation is being led by Mr Ron Taylor, a former head of Leeds chamber of commerce and the organisation's first director-general in living memory to have a chamber rather than a Civil Service background. Mr Tennant is a long-term member of the NCT's headquarters staff, who became director-general in 1987. The two men have known each other since the 1960s, when Mr Tennant also worked for the chambers of commerce. He later headed Bolton's chamber of trade, which, wealthier than the local chamber of commerce, invited the latter to take office space in its new headquarters. As the terms of the proposed merger suggest, that power relationship has changed.</p>

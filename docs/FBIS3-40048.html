			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ugur Sefkat report: "Gures: We Can Intervene in a Regional </F> Crisis"]    [Text] Ankara--General Dogan Gures, chief of the General  Staff, has said that the military strength of various countries  cannot be regarded as the only threat to Turkey's security, as  has been the case in the past. He noted that the political,  economic, and social instability in those countries and the  border disputes, struggles for power and influence, and acts of  terrorism in the region also threaten Turkey's security.    In a statement to the DEFENSE AND AVIATION MAGAZINE, Gen.  Gures asserted that intervening in a regional crisis is one of  the Turkish Armed Forces' main strategic objectives. He said:  "In addition to the crisis situations in the region, the  Turkish Armed Forces have to be prepared to intervene in crisis  situations in the world, which pose a threat to peace and in  which human rights are violated. Of course, that is subject to  the political decisions made by the Turkish Government.  Meanwhile, preparations are being made in light of the lesson  we learned from the Gulf crisis, the developments linked to the  Turkish Armed Forces' strategy from the 1990's to the following  decade, and the concepts of military structure and use of  military strength. Our military strategy has been updated in  accordance with the principles of maintaining a deterrent  military strength, establishing superior maneuvering capability,  intervening in crisis situations, establishing advance defense  capabilities, maintaining a high level of preparedness until  stability is established in the region, establishing collective  security, acquiring modern arms within the limits of the Treaty  on Conventional Forces in Europe, and organizing well-trained  units that will be capable of effectively using modern arms  against any aggressor. We have to maintain a reliable and  deterrent military force in our region in which a crisis  situation may create multiple threats."    Regarding Turkey's security, Gen. Gures said: "Turkey's  short-term, medium-term, and long-term security depends on the  maintenance of NATO's importance; Turkey becoming a member of  the Western European Union; and the establishment of close  relations with friendly and allied countries, including  countries beyond the Atlantic Ocean."</p>

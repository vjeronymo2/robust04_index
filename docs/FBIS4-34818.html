			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Approximately 100 Ecuadoran  Indians are refusing to leave the cathedral in Riobamba, capital  of the Andean province of Chimborazo, to protest the state of  emergency declared in Ecuador on Tuesday.    The spokesman for the Curia of Riobamba, a city located 188  km south of Quito, told EFE that church authorities had allowed  Indians to spend the night in this church, as well as in others,  over the past few days. Today, however, the Indians decided to  formally occupy the cathedral.    The spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous, added: "The  Riobamba Curia supports the Indians, and tomorrow Victor Corral,  the bishop of the dioceses, will confirm this position upon his  return from Rome."    The Indians began protests on 13 June in most provinces to  oppose an agrarian law that was sanctioned on that same day,  calling the law "illegal, racist, and ill-advised."    The Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador  [Conaie]  and unions grouped under the United Workers Front decided the  night before to combat the "state of mobilization"jointly, one  of the elements of the "state of emergency" that was based on  provisions in the National Security Law.    Within this context, the Indians and union members scheduled  joint marches and demonstrations in the days leading up to a  general strike called for Tuesday.    A Conaie leader said, "We have fallen back to devise new  strategies," while explaining the virtual nonexistence of  confrontation with the military, which the state has authorized  to open roads that have been blocked by the Indians for 10 days.</p>

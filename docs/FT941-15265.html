			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Bergerac emerges from the shadows - A new generation is influencing one of France's less well-known districts To the outside world, the Bergerac district of south-west France is known less for its wines than for the fictional Cyrano, although production began many centuries before he made his appearance. Most were white until about 60 years ago but now they are 70 per cent red, the balance being dry, medium-dry and sweet whites. The grapes are the same as in next-door Gironde. The reds are Merlot (70 per cent overall), Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc, plus a little Malbec. The whites are Sauvignon, Semillon and Muscadelle. As in much of St Emilion, the soil is chalk and clay, producing fairly full-bodied but not very tannic red wines which drink very agreeably after four or five years. The dry whites are for early consumption, but the sweeter varieties deserve more time than most of the reds. Although vines dominate the landscape, particularly on the hillsides of the Dordogne river valley, the 12,900 hectares that produce 50,000 to 60,000 hectolitres a year total only 10 per cent of Bordeaux's huge output. This is part of Bergerac's problem for, lying in the shadow of its better-known neighbour, prices and quality have been affected adversely in the struggle to market its wines. The problem remains, but things are changing thanks to a new generation of proprietors and an influx of young oenologists. Now, nearly half the production is sold in bottle and a fifth is exported. Another difficulty is a surfeit of appellation controlees: there are 13 of them and more are threatened. If Bergerac is not a prominent name on world markets, then its locally prized sub-districts of Montravel, near the Gironde border; Saussignac, south of the river but further east; and Pecharmant (described by wine buffs as 'the Medoc of Bergerac') on the hillside above the town, mean even less to outsiders. Montravel has three ACs for its dry, medium and sweet whites and would like a fourth for its reds, now classified as Bergerac rouge - by far the biggest appellation. Then there is Rosette, the six growers of which make an annual average of only 1,100 cases of sweetish white wine near Pecharmant. In addition, there are superior Cote ACs for the hillsides. The only well-known sub-district is Monbazillac; its splendid chateau dominates a section of the southern hillside and has its own vineyard. Improvements are in train for this appellation, which covers 2,500 hectares. Its quality and reputation fell when it adopted machine-picking in 1979, but an official decree last year insisted on hand-picking and at least two or three passages (triages) through the vineyard to pick only fully-ripe grapes, plus a minimum natural alcoholic content of 14.5 degrees. Hand-picking is three times more expensive than machine picking, however, and output of this delicious, inexpensive sweet wine may be reduced by growers who cannot afford it. Instead, they may pick early and sell as Bergerac Sec. The many separate appellations are a bar to promoting Bergerac's products but not a criticism of the wines themselves. Montravel whites are attractive, especially the liquorous ones, and so are the Saussignacs, which are rather less luscious than Monbazillacs adjoining them on the hillsides. Fermentation and ageing in oak have been increasing in the superior properties in the sub-districts and the Cotes. A pioneer in introducing Bergerac wines to Britain is Nicholas Ryman, of the handsome Ch La Jaubertie. He used to own a London stationery business, but emigrated with his family to the south bank hillsides in 1970. Today, he believes that Bergerac's future lies in white wines, especially the sweet ones. A more recent English newcomer is Richard Doughty who acquired a property near Saussignac and renamed it Ch Richard in 1988. He makes both reds and whites. Like many French wine districts, Bergerac is in a state of transition, some of it negative. Partly because of recession and reduced consumption, and partly because of new world and east European competition, vineyards are being abandoned or replanted with other crops. Up to 100 vignerons (1,700 now declare a crop) are said to be leaving the Dordogne's top wine-making district each year because they can sell to the trade only at a loss. On the other hand, modern techniques are being employed with success, although prices are still low. Among British merchants usually listing Bergerac wines are: Berawell &amp; Jones, Ipswich, Suffolk; Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, London SW1; Bibendum, London NW1; Haynes, Hanson, Hanson &amp; Clark, London SW8; Lay &amp; Wheeler, Colchester, Essex; Oddbins; and the Wine Society, Stevenage, Herts. Prices range from around Pounds 4.50-Pounds 6.50 a bottle, with Monbazillac and the sweeter wines from Pounds 6-10.</p>

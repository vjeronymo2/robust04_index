			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR INSURANCE  </P> <P> I almost laughed myself silly when I read the letter (April 16) from the  insurance industry official saying that the industry was doing all it could to  obey the law and help the consumer. I have lived in California one year and  just received my renewal notice. My wife and I have had no accidents, no  tickets, no claims, and I received a 20% increase in my premium. With help like  that, I will grow poorer while the insurance companies will grow richer.  Proposition 103 be damned and the public too.  </P> <P> IRA J. HORN  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Cost-cutting at a premium: Competitive pressures in the insurance market look set to claim victims Chaos. Over-capacity. High costs. Entrenched attitudes.' Such bullet points could have been chosen to describe the outlook for UK manufacturing industry at the start of the 1980s: thousands of jobs were subsequently lost, many large companies disappeared, survivors had to find different markets and new, more efficient ways of working. In fact, the list comes from a presentation given four years ago by Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer, on future prospects for the life insurance sector. This week such warnings of upheaval in the industry - not just among life companies but also general insurers - appear prescient. Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, announced on Tuesday that up to 2,000 jobs (about a fifth of its workforce) would be lost from its life and general insurance operations in the next three to five years. Two days later Royal Insurance, the composite insurance group, forecast that its UK workforce would drop by 10 per cent over the next three years. At first sight, there appears to be little cause for gloom. Royal's prognosis came as the group announced a tripling of the group's pre-tax profits in the first nine months of this year. Commercial Union, one of the UK's largest composite insurers, this week announced a doubling of pre-tax profits over the same period to Pounds 305m. Similarly buoyant figures are expected next week from General Accident. Mr John Carter, CU chief executive, says the UK insurance industry is enjoying a 'golden scenario': rises in premium rates over the past few years have boosted income, while favourable weather conditions and improving crime figures have led to fewer claims on policies. But the latest set of results may come to be seen as the top of the wave in a notoriously cyclical industry. A combination of factors is leading many in the industry to expect tougher years ahead: computer and communications technology has opened the way for a rapid expansion in telephone selling; the life industry faces a tighter regulatory environment; and signs are growing that segments of the insurance industry are becoming saturated. Norwich Union does not expect to be the last company to announce job losses. However, Mr Philip Scott, the company's general manager for life and pensions, says: 'It is difficult to predict whether they will be companies like ourselves, acting in anticipation to make some quite significant changes, or companies slower to react which then find that change hits them round the ear.' So far the number of people employed in the insurance industry has been remarkably steady at about 250,000 or above in recent years - while some companies have shed labour, others have expanded their workforces to grab market share. That may be about to change. 'General insurance businesses are using fewer people, while life insurance and pensions businesses are having to reduce their costs,' says Mr Tony Baker, deputy director-general of the Association of British Insurers. 'I believe we will see employment falling fairly significantly.' The number of sales agents employed by life insurers, for instance, has already dropped sharply. The total either employed directly by a life company or acting as representatives had fallen by more than a third from a peak in 1991 to less than 120,000 by the end of last year. Job losses in the pipeline at some large insurers - most notably Legal &amp; General - mean that total will drop again this year. The motivation behind this job shedding, shared by companies across the general and life sectors, is desire to cut costs. In practice there is little alternative in the UK: subdued consumer spending is limiting the market's growth rate. Improvements in product specification can quickly be copied by competitors and bring only shortlived gains. The task of cutting costs is not made any easier in the life and pensions sector as official regulators become more demanding and set tougher standards to ensure that sales agents are competent and properly trained. Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive of Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance group, believes such compliance costs are now seven or eight times higher than at the beginning of the decade. At the same time, regulation is increasing the need to cut expenses. From the beginning of next year, new rules will oblige sales agents to tell customers the costs of selling the policy, including any commission they are paid for making the sale. That will focus increased attention on charges imposed by the insurance companies. 'Commission disclosure and charges disclosure are going to have a significant commercial impact,' says Mr David Prosser, chief executive of Legal &amp; General. Low inflation and interest rates are adding to the pressure to cut costs in the life industry. 'We estimate that you will be doing well to average a 10 per cent investment return a year in the 1990s,' says Mr Scott of the Norwich Union. 'If your expenses are still 4 per cent, that leaves just 6 per cent for the investor and you have a big problem.' Yet the special problems of the life industry have not stopped new entrants. Halifax and Nationwide, the UK's two largest building societies, are poised to start selling their own life policies from next year, ending the current relationships by which they sell only the products of Standard Life and Guardian Royal Exchange respectively. Marks and Spencer, the high street retailer, is due to start selling its own life insurance and pensions policies from April. That tide of new competitors extends deep into the traditional businesses of the general insurance companies. The most serious challenge to the big UK composites is the trend towards direct selling of insurance to private individuals via the telephone. Leading the pack has been Direct Line, set up by Mr Peter Wood in 1985 with backing from the Royal Bank of Scotland and now the largest UK private motor insurer. Direct Line will announce soon that it has 2m motorists on its books. The new arrivals are snatching market share in the private motor insurance sector with a dramatic impact on the existing insurers. Commercial Union is now insuring 18 per cent fewer private motorists than a year ago. The lower overheads of the direct sellers - they are often sited in cheap locations and do not use brokers - mean they can push prices lower. After rising rapidly in the early 1990s, motor insurance rates are tumbling. Industry estimates suggest a 5 per cent fall over the past year, a figure that observers regard as conservative. Mr Steven Bird at securities house Smith New Court, says: 'Anyone who has renewed their cover in October or November knows that they can get more than a 5 per cent reduction, unless they have had an accident.' SG Warburg, the investment bank, reckons that by the end of this year rates may have fallen by 10 per cent. Established insurance companies have followed Direct Line's example in adopting telephone selling. Royal Insurance set up its own direct selling company, The Insurance Service, soon after Direct Line's arrival and it now serves about 400,000 motorists. But total private motor business underwritten by the Royal group has actually fallen recently. Even where direct sales companies are not active, insurance companies are unlikely to enjoy the increases in premium rates of recent years. The pace of increase in premiums for commercial insurance policies, for example, is slowing. The worry for the big insurance companies is of a a spiral downwards in premium rates, with lower-cost operators forcing them ever downwards and making others cut their own throats to retain market share. With many direct sellers expanding into home insurance, premium rates on such policies have already fallen substantially over the past year. This could also affect the life business, with Direct Line already selling mortgages and due to launch a range of term assurance products next January. But there are signs that the main insurance companies have decided not to try to beat the direct writers at their own game. 'There is a general recognition that the pursuit of market share is a mug's game,' says an insurance executive. Instead, the established insurance companies may decide to be more selective  -for instance, abandoning the private motor sector if the price war becomes too bloody. They also question whether consumers will want to buy an ever-expanding range of products over the telephone. If they can successfully persuade consumers that products such as life insurance or home cover are too complex to be purchased over the telephone, they have a chance of retaining market share. The bigger companies can also look to overseas growth. Commercial Union argues that its acquisition last month of French insurer Groupe Victoire will increase the diversity of the group's life and general businesses. Other companies are using their UK experience to expand telephone-selling operations elsewhere in continental Europe; or trying to take advantage of European Union attempts at deregulating the insurance industry to enter new markets. In most of Europe, however, opportunities for expansion are limited. So UK insurance companies have little option but to review their sales methods, distribution costs, and claims handling to find the best means of retaining profitability. Few doubt that the competitive pressures in both general and life insurance will claim victims. Earlier this year, a study by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggested that 40 per cent of UK life companies had expense ratios that would make them vulnerable in a price war. Direct motor writers admit privately the motor market has become overcrowded and casualties are likely over the next few years. Premium income for the large composites may fall. For those that can become leaner, however, there is the prospect of thriving in the longer term. Unlike manufacturing, there is no suggestion that the UK financial services sector is in terminal decline. Many life companies, for instance, believe pensions and healthcare policies will become increasingly popular as the state becomes less willing to provide for the old and ill. If the large companies are able to stand back from a price war, short-term losses in profits may be rewarded by a longer-term smoothing of the premium rate cycle. For those which are prepared to take the pain of job losses, the longer term gains will be worth achieving.</p>

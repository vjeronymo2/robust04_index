			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Heritage Heritage, the USM-quoted housewears distributor, continued its advance with an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 53,000 to Pounds 115,000 in the six months to October 31. The outcome was struck on turnover up from Pounds 6.17m to Pounds 6.59m. Earnings per share improved from 0.98p to 2.14p. Directors said, however, that trading had remained volatile and it was still not considered prudent to pay a dividend.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PROPOSES $40 MILLION FOR ROCKWELL CLEANUP PLAN  </P> <P> The Department of Energy's five-year blueprint for cleanup of federal energy  research and weapons sites includes about $40 million for decontamination and  environmental testing at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory  west of Chatsworth and its De Soto Avenue plant in Canoga Park, according to  documents obtained from the DOE in Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> The draft proposal includes more than 20 specific projects for the local plants  during the next five years, ranging from improved chemical storage and  ground-water testing to cleanup of old nuclear reactor buildings and tainted  soil. Since the 1950s, both Santa Susana and the De Soto plant have done  nuclear research for the DOE and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.  </P> <P> Although the draft report, recommending $19.5 billion for the first phase of  cleanup of federal energy sites nationwide, was ordered released Tuesday by  Energy Secretary James Watkins, DOE officials in Washington and San Francisco  said they still did not know exactly how much money had been earmarked for the  Rockwell sites. The $40-million estimate was derived from a review of dozens of  individual data sheets, spelling out funding levels for specific cleanup  projects.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Final Version  </P> <P> Dick Nolan, special assistant to the manager of DOE's San Francisco operations  office, said Wednesday he believed the total proposed for the local plants was  "in the high 30s", but that he wasn't sure. He said a final version of the plan  is scheduled for release in three weeks.  </P> <P> Officials with Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, which operates the Santa Susana  and De Soto plants, said late Wednesday they hadn't seen the plan and couldn't  comment.  </P> <P> But Nolan called the five-year plan "a living document" that will be  periodically updated to reflect newly discovered cleanup needs and priorities.  Some pollution problems, such as chemically tainted ground water, could take  much longer than five years to correct.  </P> <P> Once the plan is made final, it will still depend on funding by Congress.  </P> <P> Despite extensive cleanup needs, officials of Rockwell and the DOE have  repeatedly said Santa Susana poses no immediate health hazard. The federal  Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed that position in a qualified way,  noting that more monitoring of air and ground water is needed to make sure the  lab is safe.  </P> <P> Most of the cleanup projects -- including the big-ticket items -- are at Santa  Susana, which includes DOE's Energy Technology Engineering Center, where  Rockwell does research with non-nuclear components of atomic power plants. From  the mid-1950s through the early '80s, 15 nuclear reactors also were operated at  Santa Susana for the federal government, and contamination remains despite  several decommissioning projects.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for spending $7.1 million over four years to decontaminate  Santa Susana's Building 59, where contaminated steel, sand and ground water  were left after shutdown of a test nuclear reactor. Rocketdyne officials said  some of the work has been done. Another $4.4 million is recommended for cleanup  of former reactor test areas in Building 24.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sodium Burn Pit  </P> <P> The proposal includes $2.27 million for decontamination of soil, buildings and  a leach field at a complex called the radioactive materials disposal facility,  and more than $6.4 million to clean up chemical and radioactive contamination  at a disposal site known as the sodium burn pit.  </P> <P> The draft plan calls for spending as much as $5.2 million to decontaminate the  "hot cell" at the lab in the Simi Hills.  </P> <P> The hot cell is a heavily shielded structure used to declad, or take apart,  intensely radioactive nuclear fuel. This is done to remove plutonium and other  materials for future use at other government sites. Rocketdyne's last fuel  decladding contract with the DOE ran out in 1986. But the company has said it  hopes to get future work and has applied for renewal of its hot cell license  with the NRC, a request being opposed by some local groups.  </P> <P> Rockwell officials said Wednesday that inclusion of the hot cell cleanup  project did not mean they had given up hopes of doing nuclear fuel work in the  future.  </P> <P> DOE and Rockwell officials were unable to fully explain a proposed $177,000 for  disposal of plutonium and other radioactive waste from two pending lab  experiments. One of the experiments would involve "disposal of depleted uranium  waste from a DOE/Rocky Flats explosion forming process," according to one of  the data sheets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Metals Not Explosive  </P> <P> Bob Tuttle, radiation and nuclear safety manager for Rocketdyne, said he did  not understand that description of the work, which involved a process developed  at Rocky Flats, the problem-plagued nuclear weapons plant near Denver run by  Rockwell for the DOE. He said the radioactive metals used in the experiment  were not explosive.  </P> <P> The largest of the De Soto projects is a proposed $500,000 program to monitor  ground water beginning next year for chemical and radioactive pollution. State  water officials, saying they had not been aware of the extent of nuclear work  at De Soto, asked for the testing several weeks ago. Rockwell officials said  they do not expect to find any radioactivity.  </P> <P> The De Soto plant operated a small nuclear reactor from 1959, when it opened,  until 1978. The plant also manufactured nuclear fuel for the Atomic Energy  Commission and its successor, the DOE, from 1959 until 1982. Decontamination of  the 100,000-square-foot fuel fabrication area in 1984 involved removal of some  soil where radioactive water had leaked through pipe joints.  </P> <P> Rockwell still operates a gamma irradiation cell at De Soto, and the draft DOE  plan called for spending $123,000 to decommission it by 1995.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Alan C. Miller contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Using paper gridded with lines R. Doen Toby fills hundreds of quarter-inch  quadrants with small quick scribbles of conte, graphite or metallic pigment.  From a distance, the works have a minimalist less-is-more elegance, along with  the meditative rumblings of oriental calligraphy and color field abstraction.  </P> <P> In fact, Toby seems more a thinker than a paint pusher, as she views each mark  as a diary entry concretizing a moment in time and space. One large horizontal  piece has some 360 or so quadrants to represent each day in 1986. The shimmery  uniformity of the little marks is broken up only by an occasional variation --  a small red square to indicate some out of the ordinary event, or a tiny black  mark to log the death of an acquaintance.  </P> <P> Toby's works seem seeped in the crisis of figuration that spawned both  conceptual and abstract art: how to convey intangibles like ideas, feelings,  time, space, etc. without resorting to beleaguered literal depictions. However,  this artist's solution is so whisper soft and personal that it fails to  communicate with most of us.(Kiyo Higashi Gallery, 8332 Melrose to Nov. 9).  MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

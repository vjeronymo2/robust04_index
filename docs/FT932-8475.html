			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Revenue denies staff overstep powers THE DEPUTY chairman of the Inland Revenue yesterday rejected criticism that tax inspectors placed undue pressure on taxpayers. Mr Leonard Beighton told the tax faculty of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales there was no independent evidence of inspectors overstepping their powers. The targets set for inspectors were not yield but the number and quality of cases they considered. 'Our job is to assess and collect the proper amount of tax, not the most tax we can collect,' he said. The person appointed to the new post of adjudicator 'will most certainly not be a Revenue poodle', he added. He said the Revenue was placing greater responsibility and accountability on staff by shortening lines of communication and reducing layers of management. The traditional divide between the tax assessment and collection divisions in the Revenue was being dissolved, with an expansion in the number of district offices and of taxpayer assistance offices. He said the Revenue was responding to findings in surveys of taxpayers which highlighted the need above all for tax to be assessed accurately first time. It had set up initiatives such as a review into why errors are made. The Inland Revenue will accept computations of business profits in figures rounded to the nearest Pounds 1,000 from single businesses or companies with an annual turnover of not less than Pounds 5m, Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. The aim is to reduce the compliance burden on large businesses which produce their statutory accounts in round thousands but have to repeat the accounting work in exact pound units solely for tax purposes, he said in a parliamentary answer.</p>

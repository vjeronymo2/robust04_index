"Besides seeds, there are not enough necessary raw materials  for sowing," Miroslav Sandzakov, Vojvodina assistant secretary  for agriculture, told TANJUG.    A record 1.35 million tonnes of oil were produced in  Vojvodina last year, sufficient to cover one-quarter of the  country's overall needs. According to the energy balance made by  the government, agriculture has absolute priority.    Around 800,000 hectares of the 1,080,000 hectares in  Vojvodina have been plowed so far. Agricultural producers  expect the state to ensure the necessary fuel for the plowing of  the remaining 280,000 hectares.    Due to the ban on imports of natural gas, factories for the  production of artificial fertilizers are working at reduced  capacity. It is estimated that around 60 percent of this year's  needs will be met and this will consequently lower the output.    Experts estimate that the northern Serbian province of  Vojvodina could under normal conditions provide food for four  times the number of inhabitants of the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia.    Besides its 10.4 million inhabitants, the Federal Republic  of  Yugoslavia cares for refugees from the former Yugoslav republics  torn by war. There are around 500,000 registered refugees but  the total number of refugees is estimated at 700,000.    According to data of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture,  the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is currently in the group of  countries which cannot feed their own population. Until the  introduction of the international blockade in May 1992,  Yugoslavia not only satisfied its needs in foodstuffs but also  exported significant surpluses.</p>

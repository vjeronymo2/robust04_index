			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S IRAN-CONTRA ROLE CLEARER, MITCHELL SAYS  </P> <P> Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, asserting Sunday that the  Oliver L. North trial has indicated that former President Ronald Reagan was  implicated in the Iran-Contra scandal more than was known previously, called it  probable that "history will render the final verdict" on his role.  </P> <P> Recalling investigations by Congress and the presidential commission headed by  former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.), along with the just-concluded trial testimony,  Mitchell said that "at each stage of the process in which more information has  been made available, President Reagan's involvement becomes clearer and more  deep."  </P> <P> Mitchell dismissed the Tower board's portrait of Reagan as a benign, uninvolved  figure. "That was clearly in error," he said, "viewed now with the benefit of  hindsight."  </P> <P> Mitchell stopped short of calling for reopening the congressional investigation  into the scandal but cited "serious questions about the document-producing  process," repeating his vow to seek a congressional inquiry to find out why the  1987 congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal did not see  certain White House documents that showed up at North's trial.  </P> <P> "We ought to look into it and will," said Mitchell, who was on the Senate's  Iran-Contra panel.  </P> <P> Mitchell's comments, made during an interview on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation,"  came as jurors in the North trial took Sunday off. They resume deliberations  today.  </P> <P> North, a former Marine and former White House aide, faces 12 felony counts  centering on charges that he lied to Congress about secret efforts to aid the  Nicaraguan rebels and blocked investigations of his activities.  </P> <P> Mitchell complained that versions of documents provided to the committees did  not contain handwritten and typed notations by President Reagan linking him to  the illegal aid efforts.  </P> <P> For example, one North memo to Reagan outlined what the President should say  about a "quid pro quo" during a 1985 telephone call to Roberto Suazo Corazon,  then president of Honduras. Reagan's handwritten notes on the memo indicated  that Suazo agreed to support the Contras in exchange for secret U.S. aid.  </P> <P> Another document, Mitchell said, bore the typed notation, "Carbon copy to the  vice president," a reference to George Bush. "That notation did not appear on  the documents provided to the committee."  </P> <P> President Bush has contended that the committees did not get the documents  because the FBI failed to deliver them.  </P> <P> Mitchell allowed that "anyone can make human error" but he added: "It's  difficult, however, to understand how oversight could account for the receipt  by the committees of documents in one form and then another form that is a more  detailed form going to the court."  </P> <P> Despite all his misgivings and dissatisfactions, Mitchell acknowledged in  response to a question that the matter of Reagan's involvement may be closed.  </P> <P> "Oh, that may be the ultimate result," he said. "Sure, and history will render  the final verdict."  </P></p>

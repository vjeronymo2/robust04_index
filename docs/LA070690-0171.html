			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> DASHING VAL EARLY FAVORITE IN CHICADO V  </P> <P> In what could be billed as a preview of the 1990 Los Alamitos Championship  Invitational, stakes standout Dashing Val totes high weight against a field of  all-star quarter horses in Sunday afternoon's $25,000 Chicado V Handicap at Los  Alamitos.  </P> <P> Dashing Val has been made the 9-5 early favorite for the 400-yard showdown to  post his fourth consecutive win.  </P> <P> Here's the complete lineup from the rail out with riders and weights: Called To  Account (Ralph Seville, 119), Dashing Val (Roman Figueroa, 125), Sig Hanson  (Kenneth Hart, 118), TH Dasher (Eddie Garcia, 119), Heisajoy (James Lackey,  123), Jazzing Hi (Bruce Pilkenton, 121), and Griswold (Danny Cardoza, 120).  </P> <P> Dashing Val has been sensational since opening his 5-year-old campaign. After  going winless last year, the son of Dash For Cash has rattled off three  consecutive stakes wins this season.  </P> <P> Heisajoy and Jazzing Hi are the two choices to upset Dashing Val.  </P> <P> Heisajoy made his season debut on June 22 in the Double Bid Handicap. The  gelding posted a three-quarter length win. The victory pushed Heisajoy's career  record to 11 wins in 17 starts.  </P> <P> Jazzing Hi turned heads at Los Alamitos on June 5 when Bruce Pilkenton piloted  him to a neck verdict in the Vessels Maturity.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVIEGOER LAUDS LISTENING DEVICES  </P> <P> Speaking as a professional with disposable income, I will be honored to dispose  of part of my income at the Laguna Hills Mann Theatres. Due to my hearing  impairment, I have limited myself almost exclusively to foreign movies with  subtitles or legitimate theaters with . . . listening devices. Now a county  movie theater has added (the) devices.  </P> <P> I was thrilled to read about what Mann is doing in your business section  ("Infrared Devices Bring Talkies to Hard of Hearing," May 30) and just hope the  competitive market or occasionally even social concern will move a few others  to join.  </P> <P> So thank you, Mann Theatres. You'll be happy to know I buy popcorn and usually  bring a date.  </P> <P> LARRY MEYERS  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

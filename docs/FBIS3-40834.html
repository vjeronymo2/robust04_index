			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P.S. Suryanarayana: "Efforts To Continue To </F> Resolve Kashmir Issue"]    [Text] Islamabad, Jan. 3. India and Pakistan on Monday  agreed to make "sincere efforts" to resolve "the Jammu and  Kashmir problem" in "all aspects," although both sides  "recognised that there are basic divergences," according to a  joint statement, issued here at the conclusion of the latest  round of talks between the Foreign Secretaries.    The sentiments expressed implied a polite agreement to keep  the current process of the bilateral parleys on course without  actually setting a date for the next round of talks.    India had offered to make specific new proposals on the  Kashmir as well as other issues like Siachen, Wular barrage and  the Sir Creek estuary. Pakistan expects to receive these new  ideas from India in about two weeks' time.  <H5>  Not Linked </H5>   Pakistan, it is understood, had not linked the Siachen  question to the Kashmir issue.    The Indian Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, said he held  "a  preliminary discussion on some suggestions" on the Kashmir issue  which, according to him, "have to be considered by both sides."  In his view, it now remains to be seen as to "how we can proceed  on those suggestions" during future consultations. Mr. Dixit did  not say what these Indian proposals were.    Both Mr. Dixit and his Pakistani counterpart, Mr. Shahryar  M.  Khan, stood their ground during the talks here, to uphold the  vital interests of their countries. But the two sides, in  accordance with the joint statement, are expected to "consult  each other on the question of further talks at the Foreign  Secretary or other level."    It was in this context that the two Foreign Secretaries in  their statement, reiterated "the need to engage in a meaningful  dialogue with a view to addressing all outstanding problems" in  the bilateral relationship, including "all aspects of the Jammu  and Kashmir problem.    Mr. Dixit left for Delhi after addressing a press conference  with Mr. Shahryar Khan, with whom he held four sessions of  talks, two each on Sunday and Monday, besides protracted  informal conversations.    Answering a question regarding the apparent failure of the  latest round of talks, Mr. Dixit said: "We (India and Pakistan)  are (still) in the same position (on Kashmir as at the start of  these talks). The joint statement says that there are  divergences. We are dealing with a complex problem. It is not  necessary that accomplishment should emerge immediately like  Minerva out of the head of Jupiter."    Mr. Dixit explained "the very fact that, after such a long  gap of time, we met, and (also the fact that) we have addressed  this specific question of Jammu and Kashmir...is progress  enough." The two countries, which "have addressed this specific  question" after a period of many years, now "agreed to find ways  to move forward to resolve this problem...despite the very  fundamental differences of opinion about the situation on the  ground (on both sides of the line of control in Jammu and  Kashmir)."    Mr. Dixit said India's negotiating principle in regard to  Kashmir and all other Indo-Pakistan issues was to "reason  together with our friends in Pakistan in the hope and the  confidence that we shall find some solution even if it takes  some time."    Mr. Shahryar Khan, too, insisted that the fact of India's  participation in the latest round of talks and, more important,  its entering into a dialogue with Pakistan over the basic  Kashmir issue "in great seriousness" should be seen as "a step  forward," albeit a "small one" in the direction of a new  equation between the two countries. "In diplomacy, every small  step counts."    The Pakistan Foreign Secretary did not, however, seek to  discount the "basic divergences" on the Kashmir issue. He said:  "It is our belief that, at the appropriate time, it is better to  engage in a dialogue to try and resolve differences than to  resort to other means." It was in this spirit that Pakistan had  resumed the Foreign Secretary level talks, he explained in an  apparent bid to contain the vocal criticism in some quarters  here that the Benazir administration might be unwittingly  walking into a parleys trap set by India.    Mr. Shahryar Khan also allayed the fears of a possible  sell-out of the interests of the Kashmiris by asserting that  "the Kashmiris are central to the resolution of the Kashmir  issue." And, "at the appropriate time, the (Kashmiri)  leadership, which has to be recognised (by India and Pakistan)  should participate in their own destiny," he added. "In what  manner and at what time" this could be done, he said "needs to  be discussed in the future."    Mr. Dixit intervened to say that he had now conveyed to Mr.  Shahryar Khan a policy statement that was recently made by the  Home Minister of India to affirm that Delhi would, "for (the  purpose of) any political solution, take into confidence all the  people of Jammu and Kashmir." He declined to give details.    It was also evident at the joint process conference that  noticeable differences over the relevance of the old United  Nations resolutions on Kashmir came into sharp focus during the  talks here. Mr. Dixit said the "irrelevance" of these  resolutions had been repeatedly emphasised by India. Mr.  Shahryar Khan, on the other hand, said the U.N. resolution could  not, in any sense, be regarded as having "withered on vine."    On the issue of human rights Mr. Khan said the resolution  planned to be moved at a U.N. forum sometime ago had only been  shelved and that Pakistan still reserved the right to revive it  in some form or other.    Asked about the pre-conditions for dialogue that the  Pakistan  Foreign Minister, Mr. Assef Ali, had reportedly set when the  Indian High Commissioner, Mr. S.K. Lambah, supposedly met him,  recently, Mr. Dixit said he was told of such conditions when he  himself called on Mr. Assef Ali today. Mr. Dixit clarified that  Mr. Lambah had not in fact met Mr. Assef Ali.    Mr. Dixit outlined Delhi's stand that any talks aimed at  settling "a really complex and an almost intractable problem"  like that relating to Kashmir could only be held "without  pre-conditions."    Mr. Shahryar Khan, who spoke to the international media for  a  second time on Monday, soon after seeing Mr. Dixit off, said  "the situation on the ground will be the determinant of our  (Pakistani) attitude to the question of resuming talks" with  India.    Outlining a host of issues which would influence the  thinking  of Pakistan, Mr. Khan said Islamabad had already asked Delhi to  release the political prisoners in Kashmir, to allow the  international media as well as diplomats "a free and unfettered"  movement across Jammu and Kashmir and to reduce the number of  additional troops that India had recently deployed in the State.  The Hazratbal issue, as also the continuing "repression" in that  State, were causing unmitigated concern to Pakistan, he added.    As for Pakistan's role in terrorist-subversive activities in  Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Khan said Islamabad would accept a  mechanism of neutral international observers to monitor the  alleged cross-border forays from Pakistan. In a related move,  Pakistan would be willing to allow monitoring in  Pakistan-occupied Kashmir too.    These issues would not, however, cloud the fact that  Pakistan  "regards the talks as a precedent for the future discussions on  Jammu and Kashmir," Mr. Shahryar Khan said.  <H5>  PTI reports: </H5>   Mr. Dixit returned to New Delhi tonight. He is expected to  brief the Prime Minister tomorrow.</p>

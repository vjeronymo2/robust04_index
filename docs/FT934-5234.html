			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / US consumer confidence leaps ahead US consumer confidence rose nearly 11 points to 71.2 in November, one of the biggest monthly gains in 25 years and further confirmation of the accelerating pace of economic growth. In another sign of economic strength, the Chicago purchasing managers' index was reported up sharply last month at 65.3 against 57.0 in October, suggesting buoyant conditions for local manufacturers. The jump in the consumer confidence index far exceeded Wall Street projections and prompted a sharp decline in bond prices and a strengthening of the dollar. This reflected traders' fears that more rapid economic growth would put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Share prices, disturbed by the fall in bond prices, rose modestly. 'An improvement of this magnitude has occurred only rarely in the 25-year history of this survey,' said Mr Fabian Linden of the Conference Board, the New York business analysis group that compiles the consumer confidence index. If confidence continued to strengthen 'we can expect pent-up demand to come to market,' he said. The board's latest survey of 5,000 households indicated consumers had become more optimistic about current conditions and about the outlook for the next six months. The proportion rating business conditions 'bad' was the lowest in three years. The proportion rating jobs 'plentiful' was up. The level of consumer confidence remained relatively subdued by the standards of previous recoveries, when the index rose well above 100. The index gain is the last piece in a growth jigsaw. In recent weeks, figures for factory orders, industrial output, retail spending and home sales all pointed to an acceleration of economic growth to an annual rate of about 4 per cent in the current quarter.</p>

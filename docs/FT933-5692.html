			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Labour offensive claims Pounds 1,000 tax 'bombshell' LABOUR LAUNCHED an autumn offensive yesterday with the claim that the 'tax bombshell' in the March Budget meant that a family on average income would pay Pounds 1,000 a year more in tax by April 1995, when the changes were fully in place. At the centre of the campaign is renewed opposition to the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel and a warning to ministers not to extend the VAT base further in the November Budget, to areas such as food, books and children's clothes. The attack, based on the theme 'stop the rot - start to build', is aimed at a broad range of policies on which Labour says the government has betrayed its election promises, including education, crime and public services. A lobby by pensioners of the Tory party conference in Blackpool and the organisation of a petition to parliament, as well as efforts to set Conservative local councillors against the government's policy are among the tactics planned for the coming weeks. The campaign comes against a background of criticism from some Labour MPs at the way in which Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, has abandoned the tax policies put forward in the party's general election manifesto. Labour also hopes that it will reverse the trend of recent months in which its standing in opinion polls has slipped slightly, although it has maintained a decisive lead over the Conservatives. Highlighting the impact of the tax increases already planned, Mr Brown said that taxation was 'the one card the Tories could play at successive elections, and it is no longer available to them'. The warning of a 'tax bombshell' was a deliberate echo of the Conservatives' election campaign attack on Labour. Mr Brown conceded that under European Community agreements the government's ability to reverse the extension of VAT to domestic fuel - even if it wanted to do so - was extremely doubtful, but insisted that his party's campaign was still worthwhile. He said there were four ways in which to deal with the deficit: economic growth, cutting unemployment, tax reforms - including a windfall tax on the 'excessive profits' of the privatised utilities - and some savings in public spending, such as the agriculture budget. Labour's figures - which were dismissed by the Tories - are based on the changes in income tax, allowances, mortgage tax relief, vehicle excise duty, excise duties and national insurance contributions, as well as the extension of VAT.</p>

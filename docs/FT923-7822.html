			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Belfast yard loses two ship orders HARLAND &amp; WOLFF, the Belfast shipbuilder, has lost orders for two bulk carriers for Hong Kong-based China Navigation Company - part of what was said to be the biggest merchant shipping order placed with a UK shipyard. The cancellation is a setback for the yard, which has lost the orders for five of the six ships in last year's record Pounds 230m deal. Work has just started on the single remaining ship for China Navigation for delivery at the end of next year. China Navigation, a subsidiary of British shipping company John Swire and Sons, agreed last August to buy three of the yard's Capesize vessels at a cost of about Pounds 37m each. The weakness of the dollar has increased the real cost of its ships, and China Navigation says it can afford only one. One hundred temporary workers are to be laid off as a result of the decision. Last month Cenargo International, the UK-based shipowner, pulled out of a deal to buy three of the ships. Harland &amp; Wolff is to go ahead and build the ships, which will be operated by Trassey Shipping, a Harland subsidiary, probably on a charter or joint venture basis. The orders for the six ships, which represented nearly half the yard's order book, appeared to safeguard employment of the 2,500-strong workforce at the yard until 1995. Cenargo and China Navigation had co-operated in placing the order, which was won against competition from Korean and Japanese yards. The order was the first for new ships won by the shipyard since it was privatised three years ago, other than for ships associated with Fred Olsen, the Norwegian shipping company that owns 47 per cent of Harland &amp; Wolff. Mr John Parker, Harland &amp; Wolff chairman, said China Navigation had cancelled its ships because of deteriorating conditions in the world shipping market over the past six months, exacerbated by the world recession and the exceptionally high level of sterling against the dollar. He said: 'China Navigation is very disappointed that it can't go ahead at this time. The company thinks the strength of the pound at around Dollars 1.93 is completely distorting the deal they did at around Dollars 1.65 less than a year ago. All shipping deals are conducted in US dollars.' Harland &amp; Wolff has retained the option to resell two cancelled contracts and has been concentrating its efforts on marketing the Capesize - built to its own design - directly to end users, particularly Australian companies. Mr Parker said: 'The outlook for the medium-to-long-term shipping and shipbuilding markets remains optimistic, but the next 18 to 24 months is likely to be a very difficult period for shipowners and builders alike, particularly if the world recession does not abate quickly and the pound is not realigned to more acceptable levels against the US dollar.' The 162,000 tonnes deadweight Capesize ships are designed to transport coal and ore around the Cape of Good Hope. They will be faster than conventional bulk carriers and built with less high-tensile steel, allowing greater strength. The ships are designed to combat the problems of break-up associated with bulk carriers, highlighted in a report by Lloyd's Register, which certifies ships' seaworthiness. The report blamed structural weakness for the loss of 34 bulk carriers at a cost of more than 250 lives since 1990.</p>

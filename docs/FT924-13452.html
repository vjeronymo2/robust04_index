			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian, Chinese export hopes buoy US wheat CHICAGO WHEAT markets have responded positively this week to announcements that are likely to result in large quantities of US grain being shipped to Russia and China. Wheat futures for December delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade have risen 16 cents a bushel since the US Department of Agriculture last Friday awarded Dollars 525m in export credits and food aid to Russia. The former Soviet republic rushed to consume the credits, bidding on Tuesday for 750,000 tonnes of US maize and 190,000 tonnes of soyameal. Yesterday morning talk that Russia had placed a bid for 1.6m tonnes of soft red winter wheat, the variety traded in Chicago, boosted futures. The bid was made under the US Export Enhancement Program at a price of Dollars 119.90 a tonne. Analysts said that was on the low side and added that the USDA, which administers the EEP, might reject it and seek a price closer to Dollars 124. Russia would like the wheat shipped within the next 60 days. Russia received a total of Dollars 190m in wheat credits in the package announced last week. The US also came to an agreement on Friday with China for more open trade between the two countries. China, usually the US's second-largest wheat customer, has stonewalled US traders this year, protesting at the Bush administration's tough position on trade rules, and more recently, the president's campaign promise to sell F-16 fighter jets to China's rival, Taiwan. The new trade accord has revived rumours that China will make a big wheat purchase before the US presidential election on November 3, where Mr Bush badly needs the farm vote to retain his office. 'Bush and China are very close. Bush used to be Ambassador to China,' said Mr Daniel Basse, director of research for Chicago-based AgResource Company. 'It would make sense for them (the Chinese) to come in and support him.' China bought 3.8m tonnes of US wheat in 1991, and having bought nothing so far in 1992, could come in with a pre-election bid for as much as 1m tonnes, traders say. China has US EEP allocations for no less than 7m tonnes, which even the most optimistic Washington bureaucrat does not expect them to consume. Money, more than politics, may prompt a Chinese wheat purchase soon. The Chinese have a reputation for being among the world's shrewdest wheat traders. Their absence from US markets allowed world wheat prices to sink through the summer. However, with the entry of Russia and other EEP buyers into the markets in recent weeks, US wheat prices have begun to rise. A longer wait might causes China to miss the year's optimum prices. Wheat for December delivery closed at Dollars 3.41 1/2 a bushel in the Chicago futures market Friday, and traded as high as Dollars 3.56 a bushel early yesterday. That is the highest level the contract has seen since the beginning of the US wheat harvest in June.</p>

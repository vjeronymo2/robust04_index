			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank There is more than one precocious offspring in Royal Bank of Scotland's brood. Direct Line insurance has overshadowed Citizens Financial, but the acquisition of the failed New England Savings Bank from the authorities continues a prodigious rate of growth in US banking this year. Both Citizens and its parent have enough capital to stand the strain. NatWest, the other clearer with ambitions in US retail banking, must be envious on that score despite yesterday's issue of preference capital. The only worry is that Royal Bank's capital strength gives it rope with which to hang itself. By remaining a regional bank concentrating on retail business, Citizens has so far taken a conservative line. The arrangement to sell immediately the commercial loan assets of New England Savings is a case in point. If that policy is adhered to from here on, Citizens might avoid the kind of real estate loan losses which blighted NatWest Bancorp. But avoiding pit-falls is not enough to guarantee a decent return on capital. Royal Bank has seen only a modest return on its original investment in 1988. Expanding Citizens' loan book and gearing-up its capital base are thus necessary to keep profits rising. While loan demand is slack, buying smaller rivals may be a safer way of proceeding than forcing growth from within - always assuming exhaustive due diligence procedures are followed. Royal Bank deserves credit for installing management with local knowledge. It has yet to prove it can keep a transatlantic grip during the growth phase.</p>

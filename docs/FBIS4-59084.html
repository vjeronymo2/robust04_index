			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has stated the following:    The political leadership is following the sincere brotherly  initiatives launched in the past two days by some fraternal and  friendly states that aim to help our country overcome the  serious and difficult circumstances.    We appreciate the good intentions that prompted all these  brothers and friends to take their initiatives, and value highly  all the efforts they exerted in the past to end the sharp crisis  fabricated by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and the secessionist clique in  the Socialist Party. We also want to remind them about how far  the political leadership has gone in the past months to respond  positively to these initiatives and good offices, and to remind  them of the tolerance and patience it displayed and the  concessions it made, even at the level of sacrificing certain  election gains, hoping that the Socialist Party leadership would  reconsider its position and abandon its intransigent positions.  It also hoped the Socialist Party leadership would abandon its  insistence on continuing the crisis and not allow its arrogance  and extortionist attempts to reach the extent of plunging into  defiance and rebellion and entrench a de facto division.    However, al-Bid and other members of the secessionist clique  in the Socialist Party did not stop at that point. First, they  started to kindle the fire of sedition among the ranks of our  one Yemeni people. When they discovered that they failed in  this attempt, they moved to incite fighting among the ranks of  the Armed Forces by using some of the hardline military  commanders who are members of the Socialist Party itself and who  are involved with them in the scheme of secession and insurgency.    The sequence of the conspiracy against unity and  constitutional legitimacy and the attempt to drive the homeland  into the furnace of fratricide continued. The first episode was  the futile attack against the al-'Amaliqah Forces in the Abyan  area the day after the Pledge and Accord Document was signed in  Amman on 10 Ramadan, corresponding to 20 February, and the start  of fighting in (?Harf Sufyan) and Shabwah. That series reached  its climax in the 'Imran camp, where the 3d Armored Brigade  attacked the 1st Brigade, which was stationed alongside the 3d  Brigade in the same camp. The result of that painful and bloody  fighting was tragic by all standards and caused the hearts of  all honorable people in Yemen to bleed. Large number of  soldiers from the two brigades were either killed or wounded and  our Armed Forces lost scores of tanks and equipment, as well as  many valiant men.    Leader President Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had  wished that this tragic incident and major loss would be the  last of the tragedies and calamities at this difficult and  serious stage in the history of our great people. Instead, the  insurgent secessionist gang controlling the Socialist Party did  not learn from this very costly lesson. It embarked on an  all-out war in a flagrant defiance of all requirements of  constitutional legitimacy and in a painful and flagrant  insurrection that runs counter to all values and traditions.  This started by ordering the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar to  mobilize and deploy its tanks outside its camp and inside the  city without any justification, and to start an attack against  the Republican Guard battalion stationed at a distance from it.    Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council  chairman and supreme commander of the Armed Forces, was  distressed by the escalating situation. In a serious and  sincere attempt to contain that serious development, which  started at 2010 on Wednesday 4 May, he issued his decisive and  prompt orders to immediately cease fire. He also ordered the  commander of the Republican Guard battalion not to respond to  fire from the Ba Suhayb Brigade, even unilaterally, regardless  of how long the Ba Suhayb Brigade continued to open fire.  Indeed, the Republican Guard battalion ceased fire upon the  orders of the brother president while the Ba Suhayb Brigade  continued to fire its bombs and rockets in all directions, even  in the direction of the houses of defenseless families.    Less than an hour later, the guns and tanks of insurgency  and  secession in Aden started fierce attacks against the Central  Security soldiers, who only had automatic machine guns as  weapons. Meanwhile, military elements from the gang of  insurgency and secession stationed in al-'Anad, Lahij  Governorate, started a fierce and ceaseless attack against the  2d Brigade, which is stationed in (?Rassal).    With these escalating, serious developments, the political  leadership found itself facing a flagrant mutiny, a clear  military coup d'etat attempt, and a state of a comprehensive  aggression. It had to confront that handful of conspirators and  mutineers after things reached a climax.    The people, with all their honorable factions and national  forces, particularly their valiant Armed Forces which abides by  the constitutional legitimacy, are confronting the mutineers who  deviated from the national and popular consensus. The political  leadership is assuming its responsibilities and powers to  protect law and order, unity, and democracy in all parts of the  one and united Yemeni homeland.    In the light of what we mentioned before, it is very clear  that what is going on in Yemen is, beyond any doubt, not a civil  war or a struggle between two powers or the south and north, but  an operation carried out by a rebellious outlaw group that  refuses to come under the canopy of constitutional legitimacy  and seeks to fragment the homeland and unity, abort unity and  democracy, and return to the time of division and authoritarian  role and the time of pre-22 May 1990. This is a battle we have  no choice but to fight. It was dictated on us by those who took  terrorism and violence as a profession and who have exercised  suppression, plunder, and the violation of all human rights  throughout their long criminal history, and those who were  intoxicated by devious Communist ideology.    It must be clear that any solution that returns the homeland  to the time of fragmentation and authoritarian role and the  single party system is out of question. All fraternal states  must realize that the matter is not a struggle between parties  over power, but a struggle between the entire people and the  elements of insurgency and division who violate law and order.    There is a type of man whose speech about this world's life  may dazzle thee and he calls God to witness about what is in his  heart, yet is he the most contentious of enemies. [Koranic  verse]</p>

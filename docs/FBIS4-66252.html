			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Under general heading "Foreign-Financed Banking </F> Institutions in China (Part 1)" special article by own  correspondent Jin Jianhang (6855 1696 2635): "Ways Open for  Foreign-Financed Banks To Enter China--Not Yet Free for RMB  Business"]    [Text] How many branches in China are foreign-financed  banks?    According to official figures, foreign-financed banks have  started up almost 100 business organizations in China.    At the same time, there are almost 100 foreign-financed  banks  that have opened own offices in China.    How, then, is China controlling this situation? Recently,  the  State Council promulgated "Regulations for the Administrative  Control of Foreign-Financed Banking Organizations," which are in  force since 1 April. Some representatives of foreign-financed  banks stationed in Beijing voiced their opinions to reporters on  such questions as the competition between foreign and Chinese  banks, business in RMB, etc.  <H5>  Another Step Forward in a Systematic Progress </H5>   Since the early years of the 1980's, China has admitted  foreign-financed banking institutions, and for their  administrative control has applied the regulations on special  economic zones, and the Shanghai regulations for the  administrative control of foreign-financed banking institutions.  Now, the State Council has promulgated control regulations that  have nationwide validity, and this event has generally been  welcomed by all foreign-financed banking institutions.    Ms. Rong Fenge [2837 7685 1230], chief Beijing  representative  of the Nanyang Commercial Bank, expressed the opinion that the  promulgation of these regulations has newly provided rules that  give guidance, and have enhanced clarity, be it regarding the  state's administrative control or regarding procedures to be  followed by foreign-invested banks that intend to enter the  Chinese market.    Mr. Guo Zhonghua [6753 0112 5478], chief Beijing  representative of the Royal Commercial Bank of Canada said, this  is another step forward in the systematic progress of China's  reform of the banking system. Methods of operations on China's  financial market have become more and more standardized and  mature. He said, although China's financial market is rapidly  becoming internationalized and increasingly open, the said  regulations prescribe that foreign-financed banks that intend to  establish business agencies in China are required to have had  representative organizations for two or more years. When  applying for permission to establish a bank branch, the  applicant's total assets must be no less than $20 billion. These  regulations restrict short-term operations by foreign-financed  banking institutions, and reduce the chances to nil for smaller  banks to come to China for risky speculative operations. China,  in this way, achieved one objective in connection with the entry  of foreign-financed banking institutions: lots and lots of  capital, less and less risk.   <H5>    No Possibility for a Few Firms to Constitute a Monopoly </H5>   It was still a unique affair in 1981 when the Nanyang  Commercial Bank established the first foreign-financed bank  branch in the Shenzhen SEZ, but today China has welcomed in a  virtual flood of foreign-financed banks, it is like the  "hundreds of flowers in spring vying with each other." According  to statistics of the People's Bank of China, up to the end of  1993, banking organizations from 15 countries and territories  have established 98 business agencies in China. They are mostly  concentrated in such places as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xiamen,  Guangzhou, and Dalian.    Competition between foreign-financed banks is unavoidable.  On  this point the chief Beijing representative of the Bank of  Tokyo, Mr. Isao Okubo, has a deep understanding. When the news  spread in Beijing, in the middle week of February, that 2 to 3  foreign-financed banks will open offices, Mr. Takagaki, the  president of the Bank of Tokyo--the bank had been first in  setting up an agency in Beijing--flew into Beijing. He called on  leaders in the Beijing Municipality and in the People's Bank of  China and renewed his request to open a branch bank. There were  40, 50 other foreign-financed banks that equally intended to  open branches in Beijing.    At present, the bank that has most business in China is the  Chartered Bank. Its Beijing representative, Mr. Bai Lian [4101  4409 1344], revealed that the Chartered Bank had already opened  seven branches, in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Nanjing, Tianjin,  and Haikou, and had opened representative offices in another  seven places, in Dalian, Beijing, Ningbo, Hangzhou, Guangzhou,  Nanjing, and Qingdao. Bai Lian said that the Chartered Bank will  in the future open up in a few more places.    The First National City Bank of New York, also not to be  left  behind, is about to transfer its China head office from Hong  Kong to Shanghai.    These "roots" of foreign-financed banks seem to show no fear  of competition in the market economy.    Ms. Rong Fenge expressed optimism when she said, because  each  bank has its own clientele, each has its own particular work  sphere. At present, business in China would essentially require  to open one branch bank in every place, so that the situation of  several banks forming a monopoly will not arise, as it will  rather be a competition in coexistence.  <H5>  Trading in RMB is a Slow Train Affair </H5>   In the said regulations there are ten paragraphs listing  operations allowed to foreign-financed banks. Most reason for  concern is the last paragraph: "approval for trading in local  currency."    During his interview with a Reuters correspondent on 26  February, Zhou Zhengqing [0719 2973 1987], a vice president of  the People's Bank of China, said, conditions are not yet ripe to  allow foreign-financed banks to do business in RMB in the  interior of China. However, he indicated at the same time that  conditions will be ripe when three preconditions will be  fulfilled:    1) taxes and levies will be equal for Chinese and foreign  banks, and their burdens will in this respect be  identical; 2) the system of commercial banks will have been  perfected; 3) financial laws and regulations, such as a "Law  Governing Commercial Banks," will be in place.    Most foreign-financed banking institutions have accepted the  concept that for them "in the matter of business activities in  RMB, there is nothing else to do but to wait patiently." The  difference is that they believe that the crucial point in the  matter of freeing RMB transactions is raising the  competitiveness of the domestic Chinese-financed banks.  <H5>  Chinese-financed Banks Must Gain Strength </H5>   In comparison with the Chinese-financed banks, the  foreign-financed banks have five great advantages: Abundant  strength, diversity of banking procedures, a broad information  network, and perfect credit facilities that make for low banking  costs; A wealth of expert personnel well versed in international  banking practices and highly efficient in their performance;  Structural elasticity that allows full use of methods of price  competition, combined with complete sets of advanced equipment.  The Chinese banks are evidently lagging behind in efficiency,  attitudes, and quality of service.    At present, Chinese and foreign banks are "in a fight at  close quarters" in handling settlements and documentary bills in  the import-export trade where risks are small and profits large,  and in some areas the foreign-financed banks have gained the  upper hand. According to statistics, import-export trade  settlements through foreign-financed banks in Shanghai in 1992  accounted for one-fourth of the whole amount done in that city.    Mr. Okubo, who had been concerned with this question all  along, expressed: The "Regulations" that allow entry of foreign  banks into the Chinese market constitute an external pressure on  the Chinese banks to enhance their competitive strength.  However, the actual work that still has to be done is to deepen  the reform of the Chinese banks in the interior, get them become  commercial banks, become international banks. When that will  have been achieved, the ideal state will have been reached in  that there will be no difference in business operations between  foreign-financed and Chinese-financed banks.</p>

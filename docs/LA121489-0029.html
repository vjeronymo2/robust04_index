			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR WORLD OF THE '90S, A RETURN TO SQUARE ONE;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THIS HISTORIC MOMENT SHOULD PROVIDE OUR IMPETUS TO DEVELOP FROM  SCRATCH A PENTAGON BUDGET BASED ON EMERGING THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES.  </P> <P> With the Soviet empire crumbling, we are probably witnessing as profound a  change in the international system as that which occurred at the end of World  War I, when the Soviet state was born, or at the end of World War II.  </P> <P> Although the transition will be harder, since the Cold War has been one of the  verities of our age, the obvious implication is that we should be approaching  the questions of defense policy afresh. It is a time for zero-based defense  budgeting, for rejecting premises that were the basis of policy for the past 40  years and developing instead an entirely new budget and plans based on emerging  threats and opportunities. Yet the Administration is considering adjustments of  a few percent from current levels, arguing that we must be cautious about major  changes in policy and programs because of a possible reversal of trends in the  Soviet Union, and that we must maintain strength in order to negotiate  effectively with the Soviets.  </P> <P> The first argument demands serious consideration. One can envisage three  trajectories for the Soviet world. A best case would have perestroika  succeeding and the Soviet Union emerging as a major constructive force on the  international scene. A worst case would have the Soviet empire disintegrating  into a congeries of feuding, unstable states and ethnic groups. But the case of  greatest concern to the Bush Administration is one of retrogression, in which  the empire is held together under an authoritarian, xenophobic leadership that  is committed to repression at home and dependent on military strength for  influence abroad.  </P> <P> We can discount the last vision. While there will surely be backsliding in the  Soviet Union, significant retrogression can only contribute to instability and  an increased likelihood of the triumph of chaos. Moreover, the immediate  troublesome effects of a victory of Soviet conservative elements would likely  be internal. In the world at large, the "correlation of forces" is now so  overwhelmingly favorable to the West as to virtually preclude adventuristic  expansionist or interventionist policy by any rational Soviet leadership.  </P> <P> What of the Administration's other argument? One should always be suspicious of  claims that new weapons programs are needed so that the United States can  effectively negotiate arms control and disarmament pacts. Here one should ask  what is most likely to lead to significant restraint or reductions in Soviet  military efforts: bargaining from strength, or unilateral actions on our part  that the Soviet leadership might see as offering them a plausible rationale for  cutting programs judged redundant, irrelevant or too costly?  </P> <P> In the current climate of uncertainty, zero-based budgeting ought not imply  total disarmament. Considering the implausibility of the threats that have  dominated national security planning since the 1950s -- a disarming attack  against the United States and/or a large-scale attack against Western Europe --  we need reductions of 50% to 75% in force levels and budgets and great  restraint with respect to most new programs.  </P> <P> The case for "modernization" of our strategic nuclear forces can be dismissed.  The possibility of a deliberate attack against us, already seemingly  infinitesimal, is hardly likely to be reduced much by our acquisition of new  systems, nor can one imagine how such weapons could contribute to reducing the  likelihood of, or the damage from, local conflict arising from instability in  and around the Soviet empire.  </P> <P> In the same vein, we should not be asking what is needed to cope with an attack  on Europe or prolonged worldwide conflict with Warsaw Pact forces, but rather  what role conventional military force can play in peacekeeping and in coping  with localized conflict that might threaten world peace and our interests. The  implications are for substantial reductions at least in forces committed to  NATO defense and to the maintenance of sea lines of communications. Considering  that the Soviet Union is now turning inward, and that the determining factor in  our sad experience in Southeast Asia was not inadequacy of military force,  major reductions in force projection and interventionist capabilities are  indicated as well.  </P> <P> With the possible exception of providing more economic support for the  reformers in Hungary and Poland -- and maybe soon elsewhere in the East -- it  is hard to imagine opportunities for initiatives that would be more  meaningfully responsive to the realities of the '90s than a truly radical  rethinking of U.S. defense needs.  </P></p>

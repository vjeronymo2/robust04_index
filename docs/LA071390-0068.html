			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPDATE / THE CAMBODIA WAR;  </P> <P> REBELS' GAINS ON BATTLEFIELD OVERSHADOW 5-NATION TALKS  </P> <P> The increasingly unstable situation in Cambodia appears to be offering fresh  proof of the old soldier's maxim that a government cannot achieve at the  negotiating table what it fails to win on the battlefield.  </P> <P> A new round of talks is scheduled to open Monday in Paris involving officials  from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The five --  Britain, France, China, the Soviet Union and the United States -- are trying to  reach a consensus on the best way to achieve a cease-fire in the 11-year-old  Cambodian civil war and to hold U.N.-supervised elections.  </P> <P> Rebel Victories  </P> <P> But the talks are increasingly overshadowed by the recent battlefield gains by  the Khmer Rouge, the hard-line Communist guerrilla group that ruled Cambodia  from 1975 until early 1979 and has been blamed for causing more than 1 million  deaths through brutality and starvation.  </P> <P> With an army estimated at 35,000 hardened and motivated fighters, the Khmer  Rouge is the strongest branch in a loose, three-party resistance coalition  fighting the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh government from bases in neighboring  Thailand.  </P> <P> Last month, the Khmer Rouge announced a series of military victories, including  the brief but psychologically important occupation of Kompong Thom, a  provincial capital just 80 miles north of Phnom Penh.  </P> <P> Refugees' Flight  </P> <P> With the fighting, about 20,000 refugees have streamed into provincial towns in  recent days, provoking memories of the similar exodus from the provinces in  1975 that preceded the Khmer Rouge's defeat of the U.S.-backed regime in Phnom  Penh.  </P> <P> This time, however, relief workers believe that the Phnom Penh government may  be deliberately encouraging the refugees to leave their homes in order to deny  the Khmer Rouge a base of support in rural areas.  </P> <P> "There has been a fair amount of fighting around Phnom Penh," said one Western  diplomat. "The pace of fighting has definitely picked up momentum in the last  month."  </P> <P> Winds of Diplomacy  </P> <P> At least two factors have helped accelerate the resistance offensive, according  to military analysts.  </P> <P> The first was the start of the annual monsoon last month, generally a time when  guerrilla forces in the region take the initiative because the government's  more mechanized units are unable to maneuver effectively in the rain-soaked  countryside.  </P> <P> This year, the Khmer Rouge offensive also appeared timed to inflict maximum  damage to coincide with talks in Tokyo between Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the  nominal leader of the fractious resistance coalition, and Premier Hun Sen of  the Phnom Penh government.  </P> <P> At the end of their talks, Sihanouk and Hun Sen signed an accord calling for  military restraint as a prelude to the creation of a Supreme National Council  that would run the country until elections are held.  </P> <P> Power-Sharing  </P> <P> Under the plan, the Supreme Council would be composed of six representatives  from Phnom Penh and six from the resistance. But the Khmer Rouge rejected the  Tokyo talks, which had been arranged by Japan, Thailand and the United States,  because the formula appeared to give equal standing to the Phnom Penh  government and the resistance.  </P> <P> The Khmer Rouge reiterated its demands, which are unacceptable to Cambodia and  Vietnam, that the Phnom Penh regime hand over power to a four-party coalition  government, giving equal authority to each of the four factions.  </P></p>

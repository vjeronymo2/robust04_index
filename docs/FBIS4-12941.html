			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza--Quds Press--The Islamic Resistance Movement  (Hamas) has called for a comprehensive dialogue among the  Palestinian forces in order to prevent internal conflict among  the Palestinians.    Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, one of the Movement's leaders in the  Gaza Strip, told a Quds Press correspondent that the Palestinian  leaderships must hold a dialogue in order to avoid any conflicts  that could arise among the Palestinians after the implementation  of the agreement on self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the town of  Jericho. However, he denied reports that coordination between  Hamas and the PLO leadership had begun. He accused what he  called "some parties to the Oslo agreement" of trying to give  the impression through press statements on these [coordination]  meetings that there was some sort of political flirtation going  on between parties that support and parties that oppose the  present settlement.    The Palestinian spokesman said that the Hamas Movement will  not at all take part in the elections of a self-rule authority  or in the self-rule parliament and administration. However, he  explained that the Movement will take part in all the popular  elections which serve the masses such as municipalities and  professional unions.</p>

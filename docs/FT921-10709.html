			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Management: Little bit of sauce on the side - Health Check Many business executives look on eating as a 'pit stop' in a race. Others see it as a part of an antiquated reward system where sugar and alcohol are dished out as prizes and comforts. Few executives view nutrition as part of a strategy to help keep them sharp throughout their career. I suspect that few would treat their cars as badly. Nutrition is central to your life. Your cells are constantly regenerating themselves, using what you eat as building blocks. What passes your lips will determine your overall energy level, your weight, your risk of heart disease and cancer, diabetes, hypertension and mental lucidity. The goal is to provide the right amount of energy for your body in a pleasurable way without making you tired or ill. The first tip is to go back in time. Our bodies have not evolved as quickly as our lifestyles; as we move towards the 21st century, we expect the body to convert new, synthetic fuels into high performance. What we forget is that the body - and genetic code - is still coping with the changes wrought by the introduction of agriculture 10,000 years ago. As our technology makes us more sedentary, our food is becoming more processed, more laden with fats and sugars, with the result that heart disease, cancers, chronic fatigue and obesity have all become commonplace. The solution is to take a step back and eat more like our predecessors. The second tip is to remember that not all fuels are equal in terms of storing energy. Suppose you had to cross the desert with only one of the following: 1 kg of protein, 1 kg of starches (complex carbohydrates), 1 kg of sugar or 1 kg of fat. Which do you choose? The first three store only 4 calories per gram so you wouldn't get too far. To ensure survival, you should choose fat, as it is the most efficient form of stored energy, able to yield 9 calories per gram. For the desk-bound manager the equation is different: it is less a matter of physical survival, but of avoiding the diseases of affluence and chronic fatigue. Of the three building blocks - fats, starches, and proteins - the one that is the most help in keeping your stamina up and the safest for your sedentary lifestyle is starches. You can power the body with refined sugars, such as soft drinks or sweets, natural sugars like fruits, vegetables and juices, or complete grains - cereals, rice, pasta, potato, legumes, beans or whole breads. But the best choices for the long- and short-term, are natural sugars and complete grains as they provide clean energy that is slowly released efficiently without clogging your arteries. Moreover, refined sugars, would give you a burst of energy for which you would pay almost immediately with sluggishness, irritability and hunger. Insulin shuttles the rapidly-absorbed sugar in the cells to where it can be used, creating a hot-running engine on a rollercoaster, destined for burn-out. Coffee, with or without added sugar, will have the same effect. So go easy on the fats, load up on starches and lean proteins - fish and poultry - and develop a healthy fear of sugar. Most importantly, there is no reason why going for both pleasure and success for every meal should be drudgery. But don't make the classic mistake of ordering a plate of pasta, smothered with a fatty sauce. That is one step forward and five steps back. Order the sauce on the side and add judiciously. Cut all the visible fat and skin off meat. Don't drink alcohol on an empty stomach - 25per cent will be absorbed directly through the stomach wall. And leave enough time at the end of the meal to walk it off. This is the way to go until you have re-programmed your reward system and have felt the real benefits of eating for success and pleasure.

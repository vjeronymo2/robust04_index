			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: U.S. LEADERS GET GLOOMY VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT  </P> <P> It's not easy to be gloomy in this sun-washed resort town, nestled 7,908 feet  above the cares of the world in the lush stillness of the Rocky Mountains.  </P> <P> But 400 representatives from the peaks of U.S. business, academia and  government who gathered here last weekend did their best.  </P> <P> The occasion was a symposium marking the 40th anniversary of the Aspen  Institute, a combination think tank, retreat and upscale adult education center  that exposes business and government leaders to the great books of Western  literature and philosophy.  </P> <P> But the proceedings more resembled a wake for the American Century.  </P> <P> Under crystalline blue skies disturbed only by an occasional passing  thunderstorm, the panelists surveyed the American social horizon -- and found  it shrouded with dark clouds.  </P> <P> Speaker after speaker lamented the decline of American education,  competitiveness and moral fiber, the stagnation in productivity growth and the  slippage of average real wages. In this enclave of $10 hamburgers, $45 designer  T-shirts and million-dollar condominiums, they bemoaned the widening gap  between rich and poor.  </P> <P> "We are en route to becoming one of the largest Third World nations on the  globe," said Leonard A. Lauder, president and chief executive officer of Estee  Lauder Companies.  </P> <P> "With one rationale or another, we seem to be in a position of justifying  retreat," said former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker.  </P> <P> "All of us feel an . . . uneasiness about the next five to 10 years," said John  J. Phelan, chairman and chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The conference opened Thursday with the presentation of a distinguished  leadership award to President Bush. But once he retreated to Air Force One and  the meeting got down to shirt sleeves, Bush took his lumps.  </P> <P> He was never criticized by name, but no one misunderstood who TV commentator  Bill Moyers had in mind when he chided politicians who confuse leadership with  "waving flags and refusing to eat their broccoli."  </P> <P> In all, the tone at this summit meeting of the earnest, the wealthy and the  powerful was as grim as the platform-writing sessions at the 1988 Democratic  National Convention.  </P> <P> Only occasional shafts of optimism peeked through the gray. For all the  nation's problems, Phelan observed, it remains a magnet for ambitious people  all over the world.  </P> <P> Harvard international affairs professor Joseph S. Nye Jr. complained that the  bleak assessments of American competitiveness only presented "one-half of the  ledger." American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker noted that,  despite all the holes in the educational system, as a nation we graduate a far  higher percentage of students from high school than 50 years ago.  </P> <P> As often in these international gatherings, the most encouraging prognosis for  America came from a gracious Japanese guest. Former Japanese Finance Minister  Kicchi Miyazawa declared that "eventually the U.S. will be the greatest nation  in the world" -- although, he allowed, only after an economic restructuring  that "will not be an easy process."  </P> <P> All this was less striking for its content -- the catechism of American decline  has been a staple of public policy conferences since the publication of Paul  Kennedy's "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" -- than its source.  </P> <P> These grave warnings about the erosion of leadership came primarily from people  who are themselves leaders -- an incongruity that at once underlined the  pervasive concern about many of the trends in American life and the inability  of anyone to effectively mobilize that sentiment behind any agenda. Nothing was  more apparent than the eroding confidence of these opinion leaders that the  people living in the foothills and lowlands care much about their opinions.  </P> <P> Sunday morning, the conferees listened to Moyers and Barbara Walters lead a  panel that summarized the previous days' indictment of American drift, then the  dignified notes of the American Brass Quintet, and finally a vigorous call for  "a new global community" from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Then,  inspired or discouraged or confused, they filed out toward paneled rooms and  four days of accumulated messages in Washington, Boston, New York and Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> And on the trails beyond the conference center, mountain bikers in neon Gor-tex  and skintight Lycra chased the cool summer breeze, just as they do every  August, no matter how the tides of history are running.  </P></p>

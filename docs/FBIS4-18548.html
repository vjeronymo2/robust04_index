			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with South African Foreign Minister Roelof </F> Botha by Robert Hochner -- live; Botha statements in English]    [Text] [Hochner] I now welcome South African Foreign  Minister Roelof Botha in our studio. Good evening, Mr. Minister.    Mr. Minister, in your opinion, how great is the chance that  the Zulus will participate in these first really free elections  in your country?    [Botha] I think I must first of all clarify some very  important points. The Zulu people are divided. According to  our information, the African National Congress also has strong  support among the Zulus. What is, of course, very, very  important is that the king of the Zulus certainly has the  support of the majority of the Zulus. But this is now causing a  tremendous tension because the majority of the Zulus support the  king because of their loyal feelings and emotions toward the him.    On the other hand, the majority of the Zulus want to take  part in the elections and this is the crux of the matter. The  South African Government is in between. We are doing our  absolutely best to try to bring about reconciliation.    The day after tomorrow, Friday, a very important meeting  will  take place. For the first time, the four leaders, namely  President De Klerk, Mr. Mandela, as well as the Zulu king, and  Chief Buthelezi, will meet first bilaterally and then later  jointly. We do hope that some way of this present impasse could  be found.    [Hochner] I understand that it would be best for South  Africa, for your country, if this solution were achieved. But  what will happen if it is not achieved? Is a postponement of  the elections conceivable, in order to have more time and to  talk to Zulu King Zwelithini? Or is an election possible that  takes place in the whole of South Africa, but not in KwaZulu and  Natal?    [Botha] You are asking a very important question. The fact  of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of the South  Africans want to vote. The greater part of the country is free  of violence. I am afraid that media concentrate only on  violence. In the greater part of South Africa you can travel,  you can relax, and find no violence whatsoever. I am not  blaming the media for concentrating on the violence, but I  thought I should tell my friends in Austria and Germany that  South Africa is not going up in flames.    I have a very real hope that the elections will take place.  There will be turbulence. We could not do what we have done  without turbulence because the change has been too dramatic.  Both in the minds of the whites and the blacks there are  tremendous doubts, but we are resolved to go ahead to have the  elections. My party will be a prominent member of the new  government. We trust that a solution will be found for the  position of the Zulu king.    [Hochner] One could say that the whites are ceding or giving  back the power to the majority, the black majority. Might the  blacks not only get the political, but also the economic power  back from the whites in a relatively short time and might  disputes over economic questions and influence in the economy  arise between the white minority and the black majority?    [Botha] We are not thinking in terms of color any longer.  Those days are past.    [Hochner] Are you sure that this also applies to the black  majority?    [Botha] Yes, yes. I can testify to this. I accompanied  President De Klerk last Sunday to one of the biggest religious  meetings in the world where 2 million black South Africans  gathered. They belong to the Zionist Christian Church. The  friendship and warmth that President de Klerk and myself were  seeing was astounding. My own party has a growing number of  black followers. My aim is to have a majority of blacks  supporting my party in the Transvaal Province. I wish Europe  would start accepting that this is a new South Africa.    [Hochner] Thank your very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. Good  luck to you and your country for the elections.    [Botha] We need it.    [Hochner] Thank you.</p>

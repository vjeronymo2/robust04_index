			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / World machine tool production down 19% as recession bites WORLDWIDE production of machine tools fell 19 per cent last year to Dollars 34.6bn (Pounds 24bn), underlining the severity of the recession in virtually all the main markets for the metalworking machines on which manufacturing industry depends. Consumption fell 20 per cent from Dollars 39.4bn to Dollars 31.4bn in the 34 countries covered by American Machinist in its annual survey of the industry. The declines are the worst in the 30 years since the US magazine started its surveys. The declines are led by a staggering fall of 31.8 per cent in Japanese consumption (36 per cent if measured in yen), while production has fallen from Dollars 11.6bn to Dollars 8.7bn. Domestic demand has fallen because of excess capacity in the car and other customer industries. Japan retains its position as top producer and user of machine tools, but Germany has closed the gap in second place. Even so, German consumption fell 16.8 per cent in dollar terms and is still falling this year. The fallout from reunification, combined with high interest rates caused by heavy capital transfers to Germany's eastern states, is discouraging investment in machine tools in western Germany. In the US, the world's third largest producing and consuming market, consumption fell 10.7 per cent but production was down only marginally from Dollars 3.27bn to Dollars 3.19bn. Several machine tool builders have said recently that the US market is picking up steam, and domestic orders rose 2 per cent last year. The few bright spots in the survey come from Asia. China reported an increase of 20 per cent in production - from Dollars 1.44bn to Dollars 1.74bn - which took it from 10th to fifth place, while consumption rose 27 per cent to Dollars 2.31bn. The rises, says the magazine, seem to be the result of growth of a market economy in the southern provinces close to Hong Kong. However, it notes Chinese production figures are reported in renminbi, the internal currency and therefore may be inflated in dollar terms. In Taiwan, domestic consumption rose 17.6 per cent to Dollars 759.8m. But total production fell for the first time in living memory, albeit very marginally, from Dollars 992.2m to Dollars 983.7m. In contrast, both production and domestic consumption fell sharply last year in South Korea, where the machine tool market is in recession and producers' stocks have been rising.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY TO FIGHT STATE CURBS ON KEY DUMP  </P> <P> The Lopez Canyon Landfill, dumping site for half of the city's garbage, would  have to be shut down to meet restrictions imposed by the state Waste Management  Board, the director of the Los Angeles sanitation bureau said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The restrictions include reducing the height of trash mounds, the size of the  landfill and the number of trucks taking garbage to the Lake View Terrace dump  daily. The board also is considering a reduction in the amount of trash the  landfill can accept, from 4,000 tons to 3,100 tons a day.  </P> <P> However, city Sanitation Director Delwin A. Biagi said the city will appeal the  restrictions at a waste board meeting Friday in Sacramento. He criticized the  board for overreacting to a public outcry against the dump.  </P> <P> "I begin to wonder what the Waste Management Board's job is," Biagi said. "I  thought that they were there to keep a focus on solid-waste management and on  its future. But it seems like they're on some sort of a kick now."  </P> <P> Chris Peck, board spokesman, acknowledged that loud and furious opposition from  neighbors of the East San Fernando Valley landfill -- coupled with a March gas  leak that resulted in two workers fainting -- played roles in the board's  decision to issue the strict restrictions. But Peck said the city-operated dump  would eventually have come under board scrutiny as part of a systematic  statewide review of landfill permits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contents of Letter  </P> <P> In a letter released Monday, the Waste Management Board said the landfill has  violated several provisions of its 1977 permit: trash exceeding the maximum  height of 1,725 feet, allowing more than 400 trucks a day to dump there,  dumping on more than 140 of its 392 acres and spilling garbage out onto seven  acres of adjacent U.S. Forest Service land.  </P> <P> The board has asked the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, which  polices the dump, to force the city to cease the violations within 10 days.  </P> <P> However, Biagi said the city will argue at Friday's meeting that the 1977  permit was updated with more generous figures that were included in a 1983  engineering report sent to the state.  </P> <P> "As far as we're concerned, that's part of our permit," Biagi said.  </P> <P> Peck said the board has researched circumstances of the 1983 document and  determined that it was requested after a rainstorm sent rivers of garbage into  nearby Kagel Canyon. He said the city never asked that that become part of the  permit.  </P> <P> News of the state's action was greeted with surprise and elation by neighbors  of the landfill, who have been working for several years to close the dump.  When the city last year announced plans to double the landfill's size and  extend its life beyond the projected 1992 closure, that battle heated up.  Opposition reached an even more urgent level after the two workers fainted  March 8.  </P> <P> "Thank God the board is jumping into the fray," said Kagel Canyon resident Rob  Zapple. "It's all the things we've been saying for so long. They're finally  giving some credence to it."  </P> <P> Zapple and some of his neighbors maintain that the increasing height of the  landfill has robbed them of an hour of sunlight daily. They also complain that  odors regularly waft from the dump, and they worry that it could be fouling  ground water and streams in the area.  </P> <P> In the past, Charles Coffee, who inspects the dump as director of the county's  environmental management section, has been reluctant to crack down hard on the  landfill because, he said, he believes that it is operating within the law.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Coffee said he has asked the county counsel's office to review the  state's latest list of restrictions to determine whether he is bound to enforce  them. He said he agrees with the city that the 1983 document should stand.  </P> <P> "They are no worse than any other landfill operator," Coffee said. "The things  that we've found that were wrong up there were wrong with other landfills. They  are things that are part and parcel of running a landfill."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The secretary of China's once prominent dissident  Wei Jingsheng is held in connection with suspected criminal  activities. This follows the detention and interrogation of Mr.  Wei. Public Security Ministry spokesman said the secretary,  Tong Yi, was being investigated for matters of violating the  laws of China. He declined to specify the charges that might be  brought against the two, saying that nothing could be reviewed  until investigations are completed. The Chinese authorities say  that Mr. Wei was being interrogated and placed under  surveillance because he violated the law on many occasions and  is suspected of having committed new crimes when he was deprived  of his political rights and on parole.</p>

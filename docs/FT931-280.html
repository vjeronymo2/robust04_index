			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Dehaene in deal to solve budget crisis MR Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, yesterday succeeded in finding a solution to the budget crisis which was threatening to topple his year-old coalition government. King Baudouin announced he had refused the resignation of the centre-left government submitted last week, after Mr Dehaene forged a deal to raise BFr110bn (Pounds 2.27bn) and bring Belgium's budget deficit in line with the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary union. Mr Dehaene took less than 36 hours to fulfil the mission given to him by the king on Monday to 'mediate' between presidents of the government parties - Flemish- and French-speaking socialists and Christian Democrats. It is understood all four parties had agreed to scrap plans to tamper with indexation of Belgian wages. That proposal alienated the union-backed French-speaking socialists and precipitated last week's resignation. Belgium's budget deficit last year reached 6.9 per cent of GNP, and drastic measures are needed to cut it to a 4.7 per cent target by the end of next year.</p>

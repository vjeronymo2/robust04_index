			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING STARTS INCREASE 29.6%  </P> <P> Mild temperatures in January helped push new-home construction up a record  29.6%, the Commerce Department said Thursday, but analysts warned that talk of  a boom is premature.  </P> <P> Builders hampered by exceptionally bitter cold in December were able to take  advantage of unusually warm weather last month to increase starts on both  single-family homes and apartments after a 6.9% drop in December.  </P> <P> Total starts climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.63 million units  from 1.25 million in December.  </P> <P> It was the best showing since 1.66 million starts in January, 1989, and far  exceeded some forecasts. But analysts warned that mild weather, rather than a  market change, accounted for the increase.  </P> <P> For example, while housing starts rose in all regions, the sharpest increase  came in the usually frigid Midwest (42.6%).  </P> <P> HOUSING STARTS  </P> <P> Seasonally adjusted annual rate, millions of units  </P> <P> Jan.

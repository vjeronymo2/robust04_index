			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (4): Tricky balancing act - Ernesto Zedillo prepares to name his cabinet When asked if he ever thought about becoming president of Mexico as a young man, Mr Ernesto Zedillo breaks into a spontaneous laughter and says only fools have such plans. Enormously hard-working and ambitious, Mr Zedillo always sought to avoid the impression that his sights were set on the presidential office. In his five years in the cabinet - first as budget minister and then as education minister - he avoided the limelight, built few alliances inside the ruling party, and earned a reputation for being a political loner. He won the ruling party's nomination largely by default. After the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the former presidential candidate whose electoral campaign he managed, he was practically the only member of President Salinas's inner circle who was eligible for office - most of the others were disqualified by a constitutional article which prevents sitting cabinet ministers from running for presidential office six months before the election. Despite his political inexperience, Mr Zedillo proved an effective, if uninspiring, candidate. He smoothed over divisions in the PRI that followed by his nomination by appointing key figures from different sectors of the party to campaign positions. He won some public support by stressing his poor roots - he is the son of an electrician and a nurse - and his administrative experience in government. He also set out in detail the policies he would follow were he elected. He used to the full advantage - and with no apparent shame - the PRI's huge electoral machinery, spending many times more money than opposition parties. Despite the extravagance of his campaign, Mr Zedillo's most striking electoral pledge was his promise for far-reaching democratic and legal reform. In a key-note speech, Mr Zedillo committed his government to a fundamental reform of the PRI, of the country's judicial and legal system, of the relationship between federal and state government, of the role of Congress, and of the federal electoral institute. Mr Zedillo has already set in motion the reform of the PRI and he has agreed in principle to give the Federal Electoral Institute full independence of the government. Campaign officials are working on a comprehensive overhaul of the judiciary and police, to make them more professional, and promote honesty and independence from the executive. But the hard part has still to come. Many are sceptical that Mr Zedillo will be able to push through political and legal reforms on such a sweeping scale. Others are worried that if he does, there could be fierce resistance from his own party, and a loss of presidential power and increase in political instability. The first test of Mr Zedillo's political abilities will come with the naming of his cabinet. He will have the difficult task of balancing political interests in the ruling party, rewarding his closest and most loyal colleagues, and putting the most capable people in the right slots. The inner circle of Mr Zedillo's associates destined for senior positions are all trained economists, reflecting Mr Zedillo's background. Key figures are said to be Mr Jaime Serra Puche, 43, trade minister and a colleague from their days at Yale University; Mr Guillermo Ortiz, 46, deputy finance minister, and another personal friend; Mr Esteban Moctezuma, a youthful 40-year-old who worked with the president-elect in the education and budget ministries and was his campaign strategist in the election; Mr Luis Tellez, 36, former agriculture under-minister and now Mr Zedillo's main adviser on government policy. Mr Serra or Mr Ortiz are expected to become finance minister, with the one losing out going to another senior cabinet position, such as communication. Mr Moctezuma has little political experience, but is viewed by some as a candidate for the development ministry, education, or possibly for the powerful interior ministry. Mr Tellez may become chief of advisers, or go to trade or agriculture ministries. The big question mark is over the political positions, especially the interior ministry. There are few old-style politicians with close ties to Mr Zedillo, but some will have to be appointed. Apart from Mr Ignacio Pichardo, head of the PRI, Mr Zedillo may consider giving political slots to Mr Arsenio Farrell, the former labour minister; and one of the governors of the states of Mexico, Aguascalientes, and Veracruz. Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance ministry and one-time rival of Mr Zedillo, has made no secret of his desire to spend more time with his family. But he is likely to be offered a post, and may come under pressure to accept Pemex, the state oil company, the labour ministry, or perhaps the foreign ministry. Apart from Mr Pichardo, other PRI officials expected to win cabinet-rank jobs are Mr Jose Angel Gurria, the multi-lingual former debt negotiator who is considered a possibility for the foreign ministry or transport ministry; Mr Oscar Espinosa, former head of the state development bank. Mr Humberto Mira Lora may be rewarded for doing a good job as PRI's electoral chief. Mr Zedillo is also close to some relatively unknown mid-level bureaucrats - Mr Rogelio Gasca Neri, deputy minister of transport; Mr Pascual Garcia, competition commissioner; Mr Juan Diaz Canedo, a former banker; Antonio Meza, former private secretary. One or two may make it to the cabinet, and others will become under-ministers or advisers in the office of the president. At least two women are expected to be appointed. Despite run-ins with Zedillo, the front-runner in this group is Maria de los Angeles Moreno, the new secretary-general of the PRI. One opposition or no-PRI figure is likely to be named to the cabinet - perhaps to the attorney-general's office, but more probably to a lesser position. The nomination of a businessman might send a positive signal to the private sector - Mr Gilberto Borja of ICA, Mexico's largest private company, is mentioned as a leading candidate.</p>

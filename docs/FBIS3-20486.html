Government subsidies are one main means  of protection, that is, a government directly or indirectly  protects agricultural development and farmer interests through  subsidies in various forms, thereby ensuring the relative  stability and continuation of agricultural yields. China is in  the process of changing from a planned to a market economy. The  market economy assault on agriculture may be greater than that  upon other industries. Agricultural development will be greatly  affected and peasants come to grief if mishandled. Therefore,  drawing on foreign experience, it is extremely important under  market economy conditions that China, such a large country with  a huge population, ensures sustained stable agricultural  development.    Subsidies of various countries surpass highs and  lows--brief introduction to foreign agricultural subsidy methods    Considering the issue of foreign agricultural sub sidies as  a  whole, although subsidies emphasize different things, take  various forms and are of infinite scope, various gove rnment  agricultural subsidies mainly start from three things: One  subsidizes the agricultural production process, the second  subsidizes agricultural products in the process of exchange, and  the third subsidizes agricultural products in the consumption  process. Some of these directly support agricultural production.  Others are indirect supports.    Production subsidies    The main forms of these subsidies are: 1) Agricultural  infrastructure building subsidies. Peasants are indirectly  subsidized through state subsidies for agricultural  infrastructure building and agricultural science research. For  example, Japanese Government subsidies for farmland capital  construction are as high as more than 90 percent. Central  government fin ancial assistance is the source of 45 percent of  funds; 50 percent comes from local governments and farmers  themselves only be ar 15 percent of the burden. To promote  agricultural modernization in member countries, the European  Economic Community stipulates that it shall provide 25 percent  of the funds for purchasing large-scale agricultural machinery,  land amelioration or construction or repair of irrigation  projects, with 75 percent resolved by the country itself. India  and other countries are in the midst of a "green revolution"  through free government improved variety development selection  and promotion. 2) Production cost subsidies, including various  subsidies from planting to pesticides. For example, the EEC  implements various production subsidies for mountainous grain  farmers. The Japanese Government subsidizes backbone farming by  supporting production. Subsidy costs can account for 50 percent  of total costs. In many developing countries, there is a wide  scope of production cost subsidies. In particular, chemical  fertilizer subsidies are rather common. Chemical fertilizer  subsidy rates in these countries almost surpass 30 percent in  transport costs and sometimes are as high as 90 percent. In  general, subsidy levels are 50 percent to 70 percent. 3) Credit  subsidies. This mainly means states provide low interest or  interest-free bank loans to agricultural producers to see that  they obtain needed funds. The government subsidizes banks for  differences between loan interest rates and the domestic  financial market. For example, Brazil frequently has increased  agricultural credit and lowered loan interest rates to support  agricultural production. In the mid-1980s, in one year Japanese  farmers received 1.5 trillion yen in subsidies in the form of  low interest loans. The United States Government practices low  interest loans for low yield farmers: in 1992 560,000 farmers  received low interest production loans of $2.3 billion.    Circulation subsidies    This mainly refers to price subsidies implemented for  producers in the process of exchanging agricultural products. 1)  Protectionist price subsidies. Different agricultural product  production costs, the supply and demand situation and price  levels in recent years individually determine protected or  target prices. When market prices are l ower than these prices,  the government procures agricultural products at protected  prices. For example, the Japanese Government adopts a high price  grain procurement policy to protect grain farmers. Their prices  often are six to eight times higher than international market  prices. Approximately two-thirds of agricultural products in the  United States enjoy price support. There are target prices on 70  percent of EEC agricultural products. 2) Trade price subsidies.  In order to protect imports and exports or ensure domestic  market price stability, governments implement price subsidies  for grain imports and exports in international agricultural  product trade. For example, when importing foreign grains, EEC  countries levy a price differential tax which is used to  subsidize and protect the agricultural development of the  importing country. The United States and other excess  agricultural product producing states often hold down  agricultural product export prices; the government s ubsidizes  differences between domestic and export prices. The United  States Government generally subsidizes 20 percent ot 3 0 percent  of its toal agricultural product exports, and in some years the  figure exceeds 80 percent. Agricultural product price  differential subsidies are at more than $20 billion, or even  more.    Consumption subsidies    This is a form of indirect agricultural production subsidy  directly aimed at protecting consumers. For example, Japan,  India, the ROK and other countries normally procure grains  produced by farmers at relatively high prices and then resell  them to consumers at relatively low prices. The government  subsidizes price losses. The United States implements a "food  stamp" policy to assist low income households. At present more  than 20 million people in the United States nationwide draw food  stamps which costs the gove rnment more than $10 billion. The  government's consumer price subsidies actually are acts of  procuring agricultural products and processed goods. They play  an undeniable role in stabilizing domestic agricultural product  prices and protecting agricultural production and farmer  interests.    Other forms of subsidies    Some market economy countries, particularly developed  countries which have excess farm produce, often have other forms  of subsidies. For example, the United States Government  implements subsidies to limit yields because it has excess farm  produce. Any farming household which has signed a limited  production and sale contract with the government can enjoy such  subsidies. Subsidy scope and standards continuously fluctuate  and are readjusted depending on crop yields and domestic and  foreign market conditions. In the past limited production  subsidies were implemented only on wheat, corn and cotton, but  at present have expanded to more than 20 items and the trend is  increasing. Limited production subsidy standards are target  prices set by the government. When market prices are lower than  the target price, the government pays qualified farmers who  enjoy subsidies the difference. The United States and other  countries also have idle field subsidies which are issued by  land banks which restrict the total output of certain  agricultural products by reducing the input of land.  Specifically, at a high rent corresponding to approximat ely 60  percent of the value of the land, the government leases back  land on which there is a serious surplus of agricultural product  which is left idle or soil conservation measures are taken. Some  countries also have disaster subsidies. For example the United  States Government gives to qualified farmers disaster subsidies  based on the area affected, scope of reduced ou tput and target  prices. Japan grants subsidies for major crops on a national  scale through agricultural assistance insurance; the government  grants subsidies of approximately 15 percent of insurance costs.  When there is a disaster, it grants insu rance costs of 10 to 30  percent of a normal year outlook. Some developing countries  grant disaster subsidies in the form of free government grain  supplies or agricultural tax reduction or annulment.    Subsidies have advantages and disadvantages, rarely  used appropriately foreign agricultural subsidy advantage and  disadvantage analysis    In general, under market economy conditions, there are  advantages and disadvantages to government subsidies for  agriculture.    Advantages analyzed    Subsidies promote production and development. Direct  government subsidies have improved greatly agricultural  production conditions, in particular, agricultural  infrastructure, technology, equipment and agricultural  scientific research. They have strengthened agricultural  productivity and can turn the fruits of agricultural research  into productivity as soon as possible. For example, because the  United States practices a series of agricultural protection  policies encompassing agricultura l subsidies, its agricultural  production consistently has maintained relatively stable  development. By 1992, U.S. soybean output was 54.40 million  tons, more than one-half the world total, putting it in first  place. It ranked second worldwide for grain output of 320  million tons and cotton output of 3.90 million tons.    Subsidies increase farmer incomes. Some agricultural  subsidies are directly granted to farmers in the production  process while others are granted indirectly in various fo rms.  Farmers obtain material benefits in these ways. At the same  time, because subsidies promote increased agricultural output,  farmers therefore can obtain suitable incomes. For example,  average net income per farm in the United States is $280,000 and  income per agricultural laborer is $180,000.    Subsidies promote agricultural exports. In developed  countries with agricultural surplusses, agricultural product  export trade is greatly promoted because the government  subsidizes agricultural exports. Taking the United States as an  example again, cereal export volume accounts for about 40  percent of total export volume and approximately one-half of  cotton is exported. Agricultural product exports are at more  than $40 billion. Under conditions of a more than $100 billion  deficit in national foreign trade, there is a more than $17  billion surplus in agricultural product foreign trade.    In sum, government subsidies for agriculture to a large  degree have altered agriculture's disadvantageous position in  market economies, reduced agricultural risk, enhanced farm  product competitiveness on domestic and foreign markets and are  commonly welcomed by farmers. At the same time, they also play  an important role in ameliorating domes ic supply and demand  contradictions for farm products and stabilizing domestic  economic and social order.    Disadvantages analyzed    Subsidies place an enormous fiscal burden on governments.  Agricultural subsidies are government acts and expenses for them  mainly are paid from government coffers. It is a rather heavy  burden, whether for developed or developing countries. For  example, the United States requires several tens of billions of  dollars annually for agricultural subsidies including farm  product export subsidies. Japan needs several billions of U.S.  dollars annually for rice subsidies alone. Therefore, many  countries are reexamining and determining agricultural subsidy  policies with the trend toward reduced numbers of subsidies.    Agricultural product export subsidies often create trade  friction between countries. The most prominent example is the  stalemated negotiations between the EEC and the United States  regarding reducing farm product export subsidies at the [GATT]  Uraguay round which were stalled. No agreement could be reached  because of high subsidies on agricultural product exports. This  not only affected normal trade developments between Europe and  the United States but also brought about disruption in some  countries such as France. Regarding subsidizing farm product  exports, although the starting point is protection of a  country's agriculture and farmer interests, under certain  circumstances the opposite may result.    Subsidies have created definite unequal competition. Market  economies talk about fair competition and oppose monopolies.  Government agricultural subsidies actually grant agriculture  rather superior competitive conditions although it originally is  at a disadvantage.    Therefore, in some countries there is controversy regarding  government agicultural subsidies. For example, there has been  opposition in the United States regarding excessive price  supports for agriucltural products.    Secure stones from other mountains to polish gems for  China--suggestions for China's agricultural subsidies    From the introduction above, under market economy  conditions,  almost all governments implement definite subsidy policies.    Profit is the highest principle in market economics. Under  market economy conditions, capital always flows towards  industries which can obtain relatively high profits. Agriculture  normally is a rather low profit industry. Because agricultural  capital is organized below industry, farm product prices cannot  rise as quickly as those of industrial products. It is difficult  to realize parity prices between industrial and agricultural  products; thus agriculture generally cannot obtain equal  profits. For a country's economic development and the people's  livelihood, agriculture is indispensible. Relying on the role of  market mechanisms alone, it is difficult to resolve the  contradiction between the importance of agriculture and  relatively low profits. Subsidies themselves are not the outcome  of market economics. However, as government actions, they are  macroeconmic readjustment and control measures which supplement  roles that the market cannot fulfill. Agriculture's relative  disadvantageous position is very clear as China builds a  socialist market economy. Therefore, for a relatively long time  period, the government still must subsidize agriculture.  Otherwise, agricultural production may slump and there will be  no relief of the contradiction between farm product supply and  demand. It will not only be impossible to solidify the position  of agriculture, but may limit China's national economic  devleopment for the long term.    Subsidies must conform to a country's actual  conditions, models cannot be copied indiscriminately    Considering the agricultural subsidy policies of various  nations of the world, they differ in terms of aim, form and  specific scope. Some emphasize price subsidies for inputs, other  stress price subsidies for farm product purchases and sales.  Some are mainly credit subsidies, others are chiefly subsidies  in kind. Some limit production, others promote production, and  so on. In sum, the starting point must be a country's actual  conditions to establish the most effective agricultural subsidy  system. The Chinese Government's subsidies of agriculture  naturally cannot be indiscriminate copies of those used abroad.  Considering the aims of subsidies, the fundamental aim of  China's agricultural subsidies should be promoting developments  in agricultural production and continuously improving the  quality and quantity of agricultural products. Because of  fundamental conditions in China, namely, a large population  which will continue to grow within the next few decades, a small  arable land area which may shrink further in line with economic  development, the supply and demand contrad iction for farm  products, especially grains, will exist for a long time while  grain imports will be restricted in various ways. So in the end,  how should subsidies be implemented? In terms of the scope of  subsidies, one, we must enhance subsidies for agricultural  capital construction, including agriculture infrastructure and  scientific and technical research promotion to improve basic  agricultural production conditions and improve technical levels.  Two, subsidize high yield, top quality highly efficient  agriculture, in particular we must support development of large  projects in this respect. Three, subsidize comparatively  large-scale farm product commodity production bases. Four,  implement insurance subsidies for major natural disasters,  establish a disaster subsidy system relying on insurance  companies with appropriate state fiscal subsidies, and lower the  risk to agricultural producers. In terms of subsidy form, one,  we must complete the price subsidy system. The actual  effectiveness of China's current system is not ideal because of  scattered subsidies and irrat ional pricing. We should set up a  producers target price subsidy system that can really play a  role and gradually establish a n agricultural product trade  price subsidy system to encourage exports. Two, we must augment  credit subsidies and it would be best to establish an  agricultural policy bank as soon as possible.    Agricultural subsidies must be in appropriate amounts    Considered as a whole, the role of agricultural subsidies in  various countries has been brought into rather full play. But  there are two extremes: subsidies in developing countries are  too low, which is disadvantageous for promoting agricu ltural  development or protecting the interests of farmers and  consumers. Some developed countries overly subsidize agricult  ure, which creates rather enormous financial pressure for the  government although it is good for agriculture and farmers. In  particular, overly high subsidies on export farm products often  leads to trade friction with other countries, affecting normal  economic and trade relation devleopments between nations. In  this way, the aim of subsidizing actually is not met. Therefore,  government subsidies of agriculture must consider factors  overall and determine appropriate amounts.    China is a large agricultural country with limited fiscal  power, relatively backward agriculture and comparatively low  peasant incomes. If subsidies are too low, they will not play a  role and if they are too high the government could not bear the  burden. In the past, the Chinese government actually subsidized  agriculture a lot; grain procurement price underpriced fiscal  subsidies reached around 40 billion yuan annually. This is no  small fiscal pressure! Therefore, it is extremely essential to  determine appropriate subsidy amounts under the premise of fully  considering the state's fiscal load capacity. Government  subsidized agriculture will attain its aims if the state coffers  can bear it, agricultural production is promoted and the  peasants basically are satisfied.    In sum, learning from foreign experience, we should strive  to  find an agricultural subsidy route suited to China's national  conditions and actual situations.</p>

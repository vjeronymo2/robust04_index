			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jimmy McGregor, legislative councillor and member of the </F> Democratic Foundation: "Excessive Sentence a Sign of Fear"]    [Text] I was 15 years old when World War II began in late  1939. I had just completed secondary schooling and had, with  some luck, done well and made my parents very happy.    The German attack on Poland and the declaration of war by  Britain and France on Germany fired my youthful patriotism. I  volunteered to join the Royal Air Force. My application was  accepted and I was in uniform and under intensive training soon  after my 16th birthday.    I served my country throughout World War II and until I came  to Hong Kong in 1951. In a different sense and certainly in a  different service, I continued to serve my country when I joined  the Hong Kong Government in early 1954 and until 1975.    During all of that time my love for my country was not  simply  based on blind patriotism nor on any sense of superiority over  any other race or country, although I did think Scotland  produced the best footballers.    I certainly had the deepest feeling, based on study,  observation, participation and example that the system by which  Britain was governed was relatively fair and open and  accountable to the people. I was taught and I never forgot that  all men should be equal before the law and that the law must be  fair to all men.    I was well aware, however, that the system and the law did  not always work fairly and that some people were more equal than  others. Improvements were always necessary.    But I also learned that within a democratic system of  government, the rights of the people were established and  sacrosanct. These were the rights that World War II enshrined  forever and for which millions died and countless millions more  suffered in varying degrees. These are the human rights which,  since my years in the Royal Air Force, I have treasured and  which I will with all means defend. At the heart of them lies  the dignity and sanctity of the human spirit.    How strange then that I should become a civil servant in a  colonial government which denied at least one of the basic human  rights to the citizens for which it was responsible -- the right  to vote. By denying that right it also meant the right to  participate in the government of their own affairs was never  granted to Hong Kong citizens in my 22 years in the Hong Kong  Government.    Yet I was conscious of the many rights that were taken for  granted by Hong Kong people -- rights that made them free men  and women in a society that rewarded personal and family  initiative. I have therefore been happy during the last 10  years that political rights were at last gradually added to the  others, even if imperfectly and too hesitantly.    I have always been very conscious of the looming might of  China. Nothing that is done in Hong Kong by the Government or in  the private sector can disregard the power of China over Hong  Kong. No government policy during the last several decades and  no doubt long before that could be complete without an  assessment of the impact on China, or its likely reaction.    Great care has always been taken by the Hong Kong Government  to do nothing that will provoke a hostile response from our  mighty neighbour. In fact, many things that might have been  done to improve Hong Kong were not done because China's reaction  was feared.    We have had great times and very bad times. We have  undergone terrible stresses and strains as China herself has  writhed and groaned under the calamity of revolution and violent  change. Through it all, the Hong Kong people have remained  essentially Chinese patriots, loving their mother country  despite being at odds with the political system which governs it.    Hong Kong people have also learned to judge human rights in  comparative terms. Where Hong Kong has been found wanting, the  people have demanded improvement. The Government has  increasingly listened to the chosen representatives of the  people and has acted accordingly. Steadily and perceptibly,  Hong Kong people have been drawn into protecting the rights they  now clearly treasure. They will not be content unless and until  they have the same rights as citizens in other advanced  societies enjoy.    But what do they feel about these human rights and freedoms  when they consider 1997 and beyond? Hong Kong people know that  China, with its different kind of government and with a  different set of priorities when it comes to human rights, is  not likely to take kindly to a future Special Administrative  Region (SAR) government that insists on retaining laws and  practices which irritate or frustrate the authority of the  central government and its many branches.    The Chinese assurance that Hong Kong people will rule Hong  Kong may begin to crumble if, for example, the Hong Kong media  persists in criticising the SAR or bringing Beijing policies and  actions into disrepute.    Non-intervention by Beijing will encourage Hong Kong people  to continue to speak out for what they espouse, even in support  of liberal and democratic political systems. Intervention by  Beijing, on the other hand, may stifle the freedoms which give  life and vitality to the Hong Kong system and society.    Any serious intervention by Beijing, before or after 1997,  will certainly have a sobering effect on those who believe Hong  Kong can best prosper under a democratically elected government.    Many democrats in Hong Kong look hopefully north for signs  of  a change in attitude. They seek evidence that the dream of a  Hong Kong ruled by Hong Kong people with a high degree of  autonomy is realisable. They listen carefully and assess  anxiously the statements by Chinese leaders and the actions  taken by the Chinese Government to extend improvements in human  rights to the people of China.    They have been encouraged many times and just as often have  suffered disappointment and even despair. China moves in fits  and starts with human rights. Two steps forwards, one step --  sometimes two steps -- backwards.    It is as if the Chinese leadership itself is wracked by  doubt, being led this way or that way, unsure how far or how  deep or how quickly some improvement or change of policy should  go.    The immense problem of carrying China forward in economic  terms is sometimes too great to allow Chinese consideration of  political moderation as well. Yet one element cannot move  forward without impacting the other. Chinese leadership must  every now and again bear down on some unfortunate miscreant with  great harshness and cruelty to provide others with the kind of  lesson that will never be forgotten.    Recent Chinese history is littered with such examples -- Wei  Jingsheng, Wang Juntao, Chen Chiming and now Xi Yang provide sad  and terrible evidence of the treatment that can be meted out by  a totalitarian state seeking to silence opposition and punish  these who do no more than seek information.    This treatment, applied extensively over a long period of  time with severity and often with the utmost disregard for human  feeling and dignity has created fear and loathing in Hong Kong.  It cannot have improved confidence in the long-term future nor  in the promises which have been solemnly provided by the Chinese  Government.    All my personal background, education, training, experience  and human instinct cry out at the severity of the sentence of 12  years on Xi Yang. I will protest to the Chinese authorities as  best I can and I pray that the voices of all those who seek his  release will be heard in Beijing.    China must move forward, not backward. Excessive punishment  is a sign of fear not maturity. The freedoms enjoyed by the  people of Hong Kong, including a free press, will be adversely  affected if fear replaces confidence. I urge the Chinese  authorities to reconsider the case against Xi and release him.</p>

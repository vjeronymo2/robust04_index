			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Polish coalition in crisis talks Poland's two-party coalition was due to meet last night to try to resolve its most serious crisis since taking power last autumn, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, last week dismissed Mr Stefan Kawalec, a deputy minister, against the wishes of Mr Marek Borowski, the finance minister and deputy premier responsible for the economy, prompting a dispute over control of the Finance Ministry. The finance and privatisation ministries were allocated to the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) while Mr Pawlak, the Peasant Party (PSL) leader, got the post of premier. Mr Borowski has now indicated he may resign. Lionel Barber adds from Brussels: Mr Pawlak yesterday called for a 'partnership for development' between the EU and the former communist countries of eastern Europe.</p>

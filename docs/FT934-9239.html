			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hozelock valuation Pounds 60m with pricing at 250p HOZELOCK, the garden equipment manufacturer, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 250p to give the company a higher-than-expected market capitalisation of Pounds 59.5m. Last month, when the company announced record operating profits of Pounds 5.1m on turnover of Pounds 32.3m for the year to September 30, the capitalisation was expected to be Pounds 50m. Mr David Codling, chief executive, said the company had been 'very encouraged by the level of interest from investors'. Hozelock is placing 11.2m ordinary shares with institutions, of which half will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. At the offer price pro forma earnings per share were 14.1p for the year ended September, giving a p/e of 17.8. The notional dividend of 6p gives a gross yield of 3 per cent, and is covered 2.3 times. The flotation will raise Pounds 18m net, of which Pounds 5.4m will be used to redeem existing preference shares and Pounds 8.5m to repay bank and shareholder loans. The remainder will be added to working capital. The company underwent a Pounds 24m management buy-out from Ropner in 1990. It has more than 300 products, and accounts for two-thirds of the UK watering and spraying market. The group is now owned 14 per cent by its management, with the rest in the hands of institutions. After the flotation the management and institutions will hold 53 per cent. Mr Codling said the company saw plenty of potential to expand in Europe, where it had built its market share to 2 per cent. COMMENT As with many companies in the recent wave of flotations, Hozelock stands alone in its market sector, making a judgment of its performance difficult. It is dominant in the UK, with 66 per cent of the watering equipment market. While there is probably room for organic growth and broadening of its markets at home it will have to look increasingly towards Europe. In those markets it will be faced with stiff competition from Gardena, the private company that dominates the German market and has annual sales of more than DM300m (Pounds 122m). While a strong brand name and sound management since the buy-out are likely to prove attractive to many investors, at a p/e of 17.8 the shares are fully priced.</p>

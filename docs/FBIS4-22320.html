			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Borodulin: "The Government Intends to </F> Increase the Number of Its Agents"]    [Text] The statements by members of the government  about the need to increase investments in the economy in every  way possible are gradually assuming specific characteristics. By  yesterday, the Ministry of Economics had prepared as a minimum  two documents aimed at attracting private capital to industry. A  distinctive feature of them is that they are oriented toward  capital from Russian investors, not foreign investors.    The arsenal of funds at the government's disposal to  stimulate investments is potentially quite extensive. First of  all, there are the preferential investment credits, the various  tax exemptions, the direct purchase of enterprises' securities  and the issuance of state guarantees for the securities being  issued. At the same time, experience shows that the first two  methods prove to be ineffective--the credits (not reimbursable,  as a rule) and tax exemptions are turned into a camouflaged form  of state subsidies. The adherents of privatization see  nationalization of enterprises in the purchase of stock shares  by the government, and for this reason, the Goskomimushchestvo  [State Committee on the Administration of State Property] reacts  coolly toward such proposals. So the only real way at present is  by granting state guarantees.    In this connection, Ministry of Economics specalists have  prepared draft government decrees "On Specialized Institutions  to Implement State Investment Policy" and "On the Council for  Structural and Investment Policy Attached to the Russian  Government and Agreement with an Investment and Financial  Consortium." In the words of Leonid Paydiyev, who authored the  first document, there is practically nothing that is new in the  concept being worked out to attract private capital--it was  utilized to one degree or another by the tsarist government when  it built the railroads.    The concept being proposed essentially involves the creation  of a state guarantee fund under the aegis of the Ministry of  Economics. Special agents of the government will issue state  guarantees on the securities for investment projects with shared  participation by the state. Both state enterprises and  investment companies (funds) may act in this role. In order to  establish a broad network of agents, it was proposed to  implement "measures to transform existing checking investment  funds into investment companies, banks, and bank branches (with  restrictions on commercial activity and clearing transactions)."    If this concept is considered from the viewpoint of  interdepartmental relationships, it is apparent that such a  radical version of restructuring the state investment system can  expect a lengthy period of coordination, during which many of  its elements either will disappear altogether or undergo  substantial modification. For this reason, it is more likely  that agreements between the government and the special  investment and financial consortium which is being established  will make their appearance in the very near future.    This was confirmed during a visit which Vice Premier  Aleksandr Shokhin made to the KOMMERSANT Publishing House. In  his words, the document should be signed as early as next week.  Th government will put 500 billion rubles [R] into the  consortium being created, and investment projects will be  guaranteed. It is expected that establishment of the fund will  help to attract private investments of R1.5 trillion. We note  that in the event of "an insurance case," such as bankruptcy of  an investment project, the funds to make up for an investor's  losses will be transferred from the Federal Treasury in a  procedure not requiring acceptance.    They are saying that the basic reason for the nearly 2 weeks  of coordinating the document draft in the Ministry of Finance is  that the machinery for the consortium's responsibility to the  government was not worked through sufficiently. In the meantime,  the actions by the minister of economics, who is insisting on  approval of this document as quickly as possible, are easily  explained--the launching of this project should provide evidence  that the Chernomyrdin government is prepared to devote attention  to stimulation of investments not only in words and with the aid  of budgetary funds, but by establishing efficient "market"  mechanisms.  <H8>  * * * </H8> <H5>  Requirements for the Legal Status of Government Agent </H5>   The firm which controls the assets of a given investment  company should be a separate juridical entity.

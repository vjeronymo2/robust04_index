Suways said he has confirmed information and evidence, which  he obtained one and a half months ago, indicating that the  United States has sent a direct threat to the Jordanian  Government. He said the threat hinted that the situation in  Jordan will be turned into the situation that exists in certain  sisterly Arab states (Egypt and Algeria) in terms of violence,  chaos, and instability on the domestic front.    The threat, Suways says, aims to put pressure on the  Jordanian Government in the peace process with Israel,  particularly on the Jordanian-Israeli and the  Palestinian-Israeli tracks, and stop it from creating any  obstacles that would hinder or slow down the process.    Suways also said the PAAF demands the Government to set up  an  inquiry into the corruption file opened by the health minister.  The PAAF also urges the Jordanian House of Representatives to  assume its role in defending the citizens by opening all cases  of corruption, he said.    The PAAF's first statement says the PAAF rejects the Madrid  Conference, the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, the agenda agreement  between Jordan and Israel, and the Syrian-U.S. talks. It also  says the PAAF will seek to abort the current talks on the  Jordanian-Israeli track.</p>

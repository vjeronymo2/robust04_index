			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: NYSE firms incur Dollars 404m deficit in second term The New York Stock Exchange said yesterday that member firms which do business with the public lost Dollars 404m after tax in the second quarter, a sharp decline from last time's Dollars 1.5bn profit and the Dollars 852m profit recorded in the first three months of this year. The results were achieved on total revenues of Dollars 16.4bn, down from Dollars 17.9bn a year ago. For the first six months, NYSE member firms earned an after-tax profit of Dollars 448m, compared with Dollars 3bn in the first half of 1993. The data, which cover the big Wall Street firms' domestic activities, are the latest illustration of how rising US interest rates have disrupted financial markets and undermined earnings in US securities. The losses were not evenly distributed. Of the 302 firms which reported to the exchange, 200 made a total profit of Dollars 888m. Those gains, however, were overshadowed by losses at 102 firms totalling Dollars 1.5bn. The NYSE members' results are not broken down, but they do include revenue from sources, such as proprietary trading, interest and commissions. Based on the individual results of the biggest publicly-quoted securities houses, the worst-hit area has been trading, where falling bond prices and volatile currency markets have left many big firms nursing losses in recent months. Wall Street has also suffered from a sharp downturn in underwriting activity, as rising interest rates and falling share prices have deterred many US and foreign companies from raising funds on the capital markets. However, these results do not show up in the NYSE figures. In spite of the problems at the big stockbroking firms, the NYSE's 'specialists', those which exclusively buy and sell shares for brokers and their clients on the exchange's trading floor, were still profitable during the second quarter, earning Dollars 29m after tax.</p>

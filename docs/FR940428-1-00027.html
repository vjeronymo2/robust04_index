			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;222.7 of the proposed rule requires eligible individuals or entities seeking a grazing permit to make written application, using one of the forms listed in &sect;222.12. Currently this requirement is established in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration Handbook, FSH 2209.13, section 14, which provides that applicants must submit an application and any other information requested by the authorized officer in order for the officer to determine that all permit requirements have been satisfied. This requirement belongs with other requirements in the rules rather in agency directives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;222.7 of the proposed rule requires that applicants, permittee(s), and affiliates(s), have a satisfactory record of performance under previous or currently held federal grazing permits to be eligible for a permit. An applicant, permittee, or affiliate, if any, with a history of prior grazing use on federal lands that has had a Forest Service grazing permit canceled, in whole, pursuant to &sect;222.10(b) (2), (3), (4), or (5), or other federal grazing permits cancelled for similar reasons within 36 months prior to application, would be presumed to have an unsatisfactory performance record. This provision is a substantive change from the existing rule and would conform with the intent of FLPMA which requires that, in order to be given first priority for receipt of a new grazing permit, existing permittees must be in compliance with the terms and conditions in the permit and any applicable rules and regulations. Under the current rule, permittees who have their permits cancelled because they have violated their permit terms and conditions may, be reorganizing as a new entity, remain eligible to hold a permit provided that they are otherwise qualified. This situation is contrary to the public interest and to the intent of FLPMA and would be remedied by this proposed &sect;222.7(a)(3) which would protect the public interest by allowing only those who have satisfactory performance records to hold a grazing permit. In determining eligibility for a new permit or for reissuance of a permit, under the proposed rule an authorized officer would consider current performance under federal grazing permits held at the time of application as well as performance under other federal grazing permits held within the past 36 months. A 36-month period is believed to be a reasonable period of time to consider in establishing a record of performance under grazing permits. This consideration would extend to any affiliates of the applicant or permittee and would include review of all federal grazing permits or leases held by those parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 222.7(b) of the proposed rule establishes additional requirements that are applicable only to term grazing permits. Specifically, &sect;222.7(b)(1) would establish that term permits may only be issued to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A citizen of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An alien who has filed a petition for naturalization with the proper authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A corporation or other business concern that is authorized to do business in the state where the graving activity is sought or is otherwise licensed to do business in that state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Tribal governments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, the Forest Service Manual (FSM 2231.21) identifies who is eligible for a grazing permit. These eligibility standards belong with the other requirements in regulation, not in an internal agency directive, and, therefore, and being incorporated in the proposed rule at &sect;222.7(b). The current Forest Service eligibility requirements do not allow corporations or other business concerns to hold a grazing permit unless 80% of the capital stock is held by American citizens (FSM 2231.21). This policy would be eliminated by adoption of the proposed rule, which at &sect;222.7(b)(1)(iii) would allow foreign corporations or other business concerns to hold a grazing permit if they are licensed to do business in the state in which the grazing permit is sought. This change will make eligibility requirements for graving permits consistent with requirements for all other Forest Service permits and with those of the Bureau of Land Management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 222.7(b)(2) of the proposed rule would establish that an applicant or permit holder must own the livestock to be graved under permit and such base property as required by the Forest Service. This requirement is the same as that in &sect;222.3(c)(1)(i) of the current rule. However, in contrast to the current rule, the proposed rule would allow for five exceptions to the livestock ownership requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first exception is at proposed &sect;222.7(b)(2)(i) and would allow livestock owned by children of permittees to be run under the parents' term grazing permit for up to 50 percent of the permitted numbers. The inclusion of this section makes an existing Forest Service practice currently authorized in the Forest Service Grazing Permit Administration Handbook (FSH 2209.13, sec. 12.22) a part of the grazing regulations. The intent of this exception is to allow children who own livestock for 4&hyph;H, Future Farmers of America, or similar projects, or those who want to build up their own livestock herd and ultimately take over the family ranch operation, to run livestock under the parents' permit and to encourage family operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

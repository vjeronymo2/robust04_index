			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] Ecuadoran Indian communities have begun a  peaceful 48-hour mobilization with marches and blockades on the  country's main roads to reject the economic measures established  by the conservative government.    President Sixto Duran-Ballen, who is facing the second  paralyzation of activities in less than six days, said that  strikes lead to nothing but loss for the country.    In addition, high school and university students have  resumed  clashes with Quito police, and the government has responded by  stating that it has not ruled out the possibility of  implementing emergency measures to protect public and private  property.    The Indian communities joined the workers' and students'  general protest that began last week as a means of pressuring  the government into revoking a fuel price increase of up to 71  percent.    National government spokesmen reiterated that the adjustment  measures will not be revised and called for a tripartite  dialogue among businessmen, workers, and the government to reach  agreements that will not result in losses for the country.  President Sixto Duran-Ballen told reporters that a consensus  must be sought and that the parties involved must come to the  dialogue with open minds and a willingness to accept valid  arguments from others and to admit that they are wrong.  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of  Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, held a news conference and  proclaimed the strike a success as all provinces are  participating.    Radio and television reports stated that the Indian stoppage  has been carried out in a peaceful manner and that activities  are normal in the central and western regions of the country.  The Indians' stoppage will end tomorrow with a march during  which participants will bang on empty pots and pans.    A few minutes ago we were able to verify that the Ibarra  road  is closed; there is no traffic. Cuenca is also completely  isolated. The Army is now controlling the interprovincial  highways, and there is no violence.</p>

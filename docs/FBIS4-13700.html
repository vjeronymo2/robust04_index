			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Mr. Hans Blix, director general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, is currently in Tehran on a visit  for holding talks on cooperation between the agency and Iran's  Atomic Energy Organization. During his visit to Tehran, Mr.  Hans Blix and his team--besides inspecting Iran's nuclear  facilities and holding talks with Dr. Reza Amrollahi, head of  Iran's Atomic Energy Organization--also met with Iran's first  vice president and foreign minister.    Periodic visits of the IAEA experts to nuclear installations  of its member states take place on a regular basis. For this  reason the trip of Mr. Hans Blix to Tehran too has pursued the  same goal. The visit of the IAEA experts to Iran is also  significant because it gives an opportunity to Iran's officials  to express the views and to confer on important regional and  international issues related to nuclear energy. For this  standpoint, during the meeting of the IAEA chief with Iran's  first vice president and foreign minister, the country's views  on the need for the peaceful use of nuclear energy were  reiterated.    The Iranian officials, meanwhile, have not missed mentioning  the point that--notwithstanding the false propaganda of the  West, especially the U.S., about Iran's nuclear program--it is  the Israeli regime's indifference toward observing the principle  of nuclear nonproliferation that is posing a real threat to  peace and security in the Middle East. At any rate, the Islamic  Republic of Iran believes that the peaceful use of nuclear  energy--which in the modern world has various applications in  the fields of medicine, industry, and research--should be  recognized as a natural right of all the world countries and  that nuclear technology should not be allowed to become a  political tool for putting pressure against any country.    Undoubtedly the responsibility that the world bodies,  especially the IAEA, have in this connection demands that the  agency should deal with various countries on equal footings  insofar as nuclear arms control is concerned. This is essential  because only then one can speak with greater certainty about the  various countries' cooperation with the IAEA programs and the  positive reports of the organization experts about countries,  including Iran--those having continuing cooperation with the  agency--can be used in the international community in a  desirable manner.</p>

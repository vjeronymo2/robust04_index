			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Victims of disinflation JOHN MAJOR is in the best possible company. Mr George Bush may have been victor in the Gulf war and presided over the disappearance of the Soviet Union, but neither achievement saved him from a mauling at the hands of Mr Patrick Buchanan in the New Hampshire primary. Meanwhile, the Japanese government sinks ever deeper into the swamps of financial scandal. Mr Francois Mitterrand's Socialist government seems doomed to lose the next parliamentary elections, while only the peculiarities of Italian electoral politics can save Mr Giulio Andreotti's despised coalition. Mr Bob Hawke, Australia's long-serving prime minister, has been defenestrated. Meanwhile, Mr Brian Mulroney's Canadian government may be the most unpopular of all, with less than 20 per cent support in opinion polls. The unpopularity into which so many governments of leading market economies have fallen is no accident. It reflects the current disinflationary stage of the global economic cycle. Canada, for example, has just announced annual inflation down to 1.6 per cent. Who can wonder that its government is so unpopular? The credit-driven economic expansion that has now come to its painful end everywhere began in the US almost 10 years ago. But the weakness of the US dollar, which started in 1985, and especially the intervention aimed at halting the dollar's fall in 1987, loosened monetary policy elsewhere. Japan discovered the delights of the 'bubble economy'; the UK enjoyed 'the Lawson boom'; and even the Bundesbank tolerated interest rates lower than it would have preferred, briefly easing its iron grip on the rest of Europe. Slow growth When economies are good, they are very, very good, but when they are bad, they are dreadful. In the expansionary stage, growth tended to be stronger than expected. As is their wont, policy-makers thought the early stages of an inflationary process proved their brilliance. The greater their self-confidence, the more they allowed domestic policy to reinforce the global expansion. As recently as 1989, every important economy was growing quite rapidly. Now they are all either growing slowly or contracting. But the slowdown in between has been unsynchronised. It started where the expansion had begun, in the Anglo-Saxon economies. A combination of tight money and overindebtedness brought the US and UK economies into recession by late 1990. Japan's economy raced ahead, despite successful, if belated, efforts of the Bank of Japan to prick the bubble, starting in 1989. But all good things come to an end. Japan's economy has been slowing rapidly in 1991, if still to rates that others envy. Bundesbank's vengeance Since the Bundesbank tightened monetary policy as early as 1988, Germany largely escaped the global credit expansion. But the unification of Germany has forced the Bundesbank on to a long inflationary deviation from the path of monetary rectitude. Having now imposed three successive quarters of contraction, the Bundesbank is back on course with a vengeance. The US led the world economy into recession. It is likely to lead it out of it. In his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report, Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, predicted that the US economy would grow modestly this year. Unemployment would soon begin declining and the inflation outlook was the best for a generation. Mr Bush should no longer complain about Mr Greenspan's zeal in his cause. Elsewhere, policy is less expansionary. The Bank of Japan tightened too late and has loosened too slowly. It could well be underestimating the force of debt-deflation. If the British Treasury is still determined to commit that error, it makes little difference, except to the quality of its forecasts. The Bundesbank is unlikely to permit Europe to do much about the recession until it is confident German inflation is well under control, perhaps in the second half of the year. A strong global recovery may take as long to arrive as the slowdown. In the meantime, the world economy will remain on a knife edge. The refusal to resort to inflation as a way of liquidating the excessive lending of the 1980s is praiseworthy, but the risks of not doing so are considerable. Many are taking the wish for the deed and are already hailing the virtual elimination of inflation. Should governments keep their nerve, the achievement is, indeed, within their grasp. Yet the achievement would have its costs. One is unemployment, which may prove transitory in some economies, but will be longer lasting in others. Another could be the disappearance of most of the governments that initiated the disinflation, with Mr Major among the first in the firing line. Disinflation is a fine thing. But politically, it may well be best for oppositions.</p>

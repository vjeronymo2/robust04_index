			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Staff share rules eased - Government acts to boost ownership scheme Law changes announced over the past few weeks will make it much easier for companies to set up and operate employee share ownership trusts (ESOTs). An ESOT is a vehicle through which company shares can be bought and distributed among staff. The scheme is based on a successful US model called the employee stock ownership plan and was introduced by the former chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, in his 1989 Budget. Corporate contributions to an ESOT are tax-deductible and, in certain circumstances, a shareholder who sells to an ESOT can defer capital gains tax by rolling over the sale proceeds into other assets. Despite these attractions, the scheme has flopped, and the grand total of ESOTs is barely in double figures. One reason is a widespread perception by employers that the rules are too strict. They require all staff to be offered similar benefits and the majority of an ESOT's trustees to be chosen by employees. Another criticism has been the requirement that shares acquired by an ESOT must be passed on to employees within seven years. To counter this, Finance Bill clauses accepted recently by the government have increased the period to 20 years. Other Finance Bill changes end the need for a majority of trustees to be employees. Instead, there can now be a 50/50 split between workers and others, with a casting vote held by a lawyer - or another professional - selected by the trustees themselves. (The Inland Revenue refers to this as a 'paritarian' trust - a word which appears until now to have escaped the notice of dictionary writers and trust lawyers alike). In addition, the process of selecting staff representatives is being simplified. Until now, employees could become a trustee only if they were backed by more than 50 per cent of fellow workers. The new regime utilises a first-past-the-post voting system similar to that for UK elections. It means that even if only 200 of 1,000 workers cast ballots, the candidate with the most votes will be elected. A further factor holding back ESOTs has been concern that directors or employees acting as trustees might be committing a criminal offence under the Financial Services Act. But the Treasury has now decided that all ESOTs should be exempted automatically from the 'collective investment scheme' provisions of the Act. These changes are a clear acknowledgement that ESOTs have been a big disappointment. But, with the main deterrents removed, all companies committed to wider employee share ownership should be taking a fresh look at the scheme's potential benefits.

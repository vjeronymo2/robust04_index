			<p>BFN     [Text] Chilean fruit will soon be sold in the PRC. This  was asserted today by Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia who, on 1  June, returned from a tour of Asian countries, including  Malaysia and China.    During his stay in the PRC, Garcia met with Chinese  businessmen and officials who authorized the importation of  Chilean apples and kiwi fruit. They also agreed to study the  possible import of Chilean grapes and pears.    Garcia added that Sino-Chilean business meetings will be  held  with the objective of increasing bilateral trade and the  undertaking of joint ventures. He also stressed that the PRC,  which has 1.2 billion inhabitants, is very important for Chilean  exports, adding that China has become an increasingly attractive  market in view of its strong economic growth over the past three  years.</p>

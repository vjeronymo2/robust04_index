			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Wellcome 25% increase in line with expectations WELLCOME, the UK pharma- ceuticals group, yesterday reported full-year pre-tax profits in line with expectations, up 25 per cent from Pounds 402.9m to Pounds 505m. Mr John Robb, chief executive, said the results were excellent, demonstrating good growth in sales, earnings per share and trading margins. The progress was thanks to the twin strategy of being more focused and market-orientated, he said. Earnings per share increased 23 per cent to 36p. Turnover was up 16.7 per cent to Pounds 1.7bn for continuing operations. Excluding currency effects, underlying growth was up 18 per cent. Price increases accounted for only 3 per cent of growth. Mr John Precious, finance director, said given pressure on world pharmaceuticals prices, volume growth was the key to performance. Trading margins increased 3.1 percentage points to 27.7 per cent. For the second six months, however, they were almost 29 per cent, near the group's target of 30 per cent, said Mr Robb. Margins increased 9 per cent in the past five years. Disposals of low-margin businesses had been completed, said Mr Robb. Future margin improvement would come from a better sales mix rather than further cost control. However, some rationalisation at Wellcome's manufacturing operations in the UK and Belgium would affect about 300 jobs. Spending on research and development increased 10.9 per cent to Pounds 255m, equivalent to about 14.4 per cent of sales. The group had a target of 15 per cent, but Mr Robb said the R&amp;D directors believed this year's figure was sufficient to maintain the required momentum. Capital spending was Pounds 146m, Pounds 39m less than last year. Next year it would be more than Pounds 190m. Sales of Zovirax, Wellcome's best-selling herpes drug, were up 24 per cent to Pounds 586m. Sales for Retrovir, the HIV treatment also known as AZT, increased 22 per cent to Pounds 213m. Revenues from the over-the-counter business increased 17 per cent to Pounds 237m. The group earned Pounds 17m net interest during the year, said Mr Precious. The final proposed dividend was 9p up from 7p. Wellcome's share price fell 15p to 985p. Lex, Page 20</p>

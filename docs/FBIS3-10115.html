			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, Arena [Nationalist Republican  Alliance] presidential candidate, has supported the government's  decision to investigate thoroughly the attack before stating it  was an act of violence with political connotations. Alfredo  Villarreal has filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Villarreal] During a news conference,  Calderon Sol has decried the 24 February machine gunning of  Nidia Diaz's vehicle that left her driver wounded. He has said  these actions are very distressful, especially a few days before  the elections.    [Calderon Sol] We believe that violence is a thing of the  past, that our country has overcome these violent acts, and that  the Salvadoran people are tired of and reject violence. They do  not even want verbal abuse, much less physical violence. We  regret, decry, and reject this action. We want a thorough  investigation.    [Villarreal] Calderon Sol has abstained from saying whether  this new action against an FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] leader has political connotations; instead, he  has called for an investigation, as was done in previous cases  when political leaders were the targets of similar attacks.    [Calderon Sol] I would not like to make assumptions, because  I believe making assumptions regarding delicate matters when one  lacks information is dangerous and irresponsible. What we need  to do is investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.    [Villarreal] The Arena presidential candidate has called on  the joint group that is investigating the illegal armed groups  to include in its reports the attacks against politicians,  regardless of whether they are from the right, left, or any  other ideology.

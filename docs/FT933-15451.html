			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwan's state sugar company in Vietnam refinery plan TAIWAN SUGAR Company, the island's state-owned processed food maker, plans to invest in a Dollars 58m sugar refinery in Vietnam. The project may help Taisugar cope with growing competitive pressure to lower sugar prices just as declining acreage and higher wages are boosting production costs. A new fair trade statute and Taiwan's proposed accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are opening the market to more local and international competitors, thus eroding Taisugar's domination. Farmers are now more reluctant to grow sugar, while local businessmen are calling on Taisugar to turn some of its landholding for use by other industries and housing. The result is a decline in land devoted to sugar cultivation. Vietnam offers Taisugar an opportunity to ease the pain of transition. 'We need to import sugar and need land to grow it. Vietnam needs both investment and sugar,' said Mr Cheng Hung-tsai, deputy general manager. Mr Cheng noted that Vietnam now imported all of its sugar, even though its climate was favourable for sugar cultivation and wages were relatively low. 'If we can proceed with the project, the Vietnamese government will welcome us,' he said. The proposal is now under review by the the ministry of economic affairs' commission of national corporations. If approved, the plan will be included in Taisugar's budget for the 1995 fiscal year, begining July 1 1994) for review by the legislature, Mr Cheng said. The plant would initially produce 99,000 tons of raw granulated sugar annually. Most of the output would be sold in Vietnam but Taisugar aims to export a portion back to Taiwan for refining. According to the present plan, the Vietnamese government would contribute 25 per cent of the required capital, with Taisugar providing 37.5 per cent and other Taiwan-based food companies adding another 37.5 per cent.</p>

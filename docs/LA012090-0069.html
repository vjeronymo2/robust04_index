			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES GET LOCKED IN FOR SPRING  </P> <P> The Padres, partly because of optimism but mostly because they say it's  necessary, decided to ignore the advice of the baseball owners' Player  Relations Committee by finalizing spring-training plans Friday, booking hotel  rooms for their major league roster and staff.  </P> <P> "Right now," said Jack McKeon, Padre manager and vice president/baseball  operations, "we're treating it as business as usual."  </P> <P> Charles O'Connor, interim executive director of the PRC, advised clubs last  week to delay making arrangements until the owners meet Feb. 9 in Chicago. If  there is not an imminent collective bargaining agreement between the Major  League Players Assn. and PRC at the time of the meeting, owners will decide  whether to stage a lockout that could delay the start of spring training.  </P> <P> But the Padres have booked hotel rooms for major league players and other  personnel at the Park Inn International, formerly the Days Inn, for the entire  spring-training schedule. Trucks have been scheduled to deliver the equipment  to their facilities in Yuma, Ariz., on Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Certainly, McKeon and the Padres are well aware of the distinct possibility of  a lockout, but they also know there is potential disaster if they don't make  plans.  </P> <P> The Padres already were scrambling for hotel rooms for their minor league  players and staff because of the closing of the 260-room Stardust Hotel. And if  they had delayed, they could have found themselves homeless.  </P> <P> "We're still hopeful everything will work out," McKeon said, "but because of  the room shortage, we've had to go ahead and make our plans just like usual."  </P> <P> Likewise, although the Players Assn. has sent memos to members warning against  putting deposits down on housing and making plane reservations, Padre player  representative Dennis Rasmussen expects few to listen.  </P> <P> "I think most of us are coming in anyway," said Rasmussen, whose off-season  home is in Omaha, Neb. "Since Yuma is just three hours away from San Diego,  most of the guys are planning to come in and set up their housing for the  season. A lot of guys already live in San Diego, anyway, and for guys like me  who are dying to get to warm weather, we don't want to wait."  </P> <P> The Padres also learned Friday that their payroll will increase by at least  $670,000, and as much as $1.615 million, when salary-arbitration figures were  exchanged between the club and their four eligible players:  </P> <P>  -- Catcher Benito Santiago, as promised, requested the largest arbitration  award in Padre history, $1.25 million. The Padres countered with a $750,000  offer.  </P> <P>  -- Pitcher Calvin Schiraldi is seeking $685,000, a $285,000 raise. The Padres  offered $500,000.  </P> <P>  -- Third baseman Mike Pagliarulo filed for $645,000, a $95,000 raise. The  Padres offered $550,000, a $25,000 cut.  </P> <P> Pitcher Mark Grant filed for $475,000, a $320,000 raise. The Padres offered  $310,000.  </P> <P> "We'll sit down next week and see if we can settle the differences," McKeon  said. "I think we can. If not, it's all a roll of the dice, and we'll see what  happens."  </P> <P> If the Padres and the players are unable to reach agreements, they'll settle  their differences in front of an impartial arbitrator in hearings scheduled  Feb. 1-Feb. 21 in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.  </P> <P> Santiago's case figures to the most difficult to settle. It's the largest  difference the Padres have had with a player.  </P> <P> The Padres filed for $750,000, sources say, primarily because of the recent  signing of catcher Terry Steinbach of Oakland. Steinbach, who like Santiago  also has three years of major league service, this week signed a two-year,  $1.8-million contract that will pay him a $100,000 signing bonus and a $700,000  in 1990 and a $1-million salary in 1991.  </P> <P> The Padres say that Steinbach's contract computes to $750,000 for 1990,  averaging his signing bonus over two seasons. Santiago and his agent, Scott  Boras, compute Steinbach's salary to being an average of $900,000.  </P> <P> And, of course, there also is the difference in Santiago's talents and  Steinbach's:  </P> <P> Steinbach is a two-time All-Star who helped his team to two World Series;  Santiago has superior offensive statistics, hitting 13 more homers and driving  in 40 more runs while winning two Gold Glove and two Silver Slugger awards.  </P> <P> "We feel we can demonstrate that Benito is worthy of the money we're seeking,"  Boras said.  </P></p>

Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier of the State Council; and Fu Quanyou,  member of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and director of  the General Logistics Department; met with representatives to  the conference. Li Lanqing said: The party Central Committee,  the State Council, and the CMC have shown concern for and  attached great importance to the supply of Army provisions,  which is an important basic task guaranteeing the Army's  modernization and regularization. Jiang Zemin, CPC Central  Committee general secretary and CMC chairman, has made important  instructions on Army provisions work many times. All localities  and departments have long conscientiously implemented the  instructions of the party Central Committee and the State  Council. They have coordinated with one another in doing  everything possible to ensure the supply, to improve the  quality, to adjust the variety, and to increase financial  subsidies for Army provisions, thereby raising the standard of  Army provisions supply and winning the appreciation of PLA and  Armed Police officers and men.    Li Lanqing emphasized: Army provisions supply is a serious  political task. Ensuring the supply of Army provisions is of  great significance to stabilizing and developing Army building  and guaranteeing national security. Governments at all levels  and all departments concerned should, as always, do a good job  in ensuring the variety, quality, quantity, and timeliness of  Army provisions supply.    In his speech, Bai Meiqing, vice minister of internal trade  and director of the State Grain Reserve Bureau, emphasized the  necessity of reforming the Army provisions supply system. He  said: Reform of the Army provisions supply system will begin in  April this year. Specific points of the reform are as follows:  The existing method of procuring grains at the state fixed  price shall be replaced by procurement at negotiated prices and  supply to Army units at the fixed price. Subsidies for price  differentials in grains, edible oil, and soybeans supplied to  the Army shall be shared by both central and provincial-level  financial resources. Financial affairs related to Army  provisions shall be managed under special projects, special  accounts, and special bookkeeping; and funds related to Army  provisions shall be delivered collectively to the  provincial-level finance departments for management. After the  introduction of the reform, state-owned grain enterprises shall  continue to be responsible for Army provisions supply. Grain  departments shall be the functioning departments of Army  provisions supply; and, Army grain supply stations (stores or  depots) set up by grain departments in various localities shall  be the special outlets of Army provisions supply. Grain  departments shall be responsible for arranging and ensuring the  supply of grains, edible oil, and other provisions for the Army.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BROAD COALITION FORGED TO FIGHT UTILITY MERGER  </P> <P> In a highly unusual show of cooperation, a wide array of business, labor,  government, environmental and consumer representatives Thursday announced the  formation of a coalition to begin a "siege" of Southern California Edison that  is designed to stop a proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co The  newly formed Coalition for Local Control hopes to raise $200,000 to stage a  two-year fight against the proposed merger, according to Great American First  Savings Bank Chairman Gordon Luce, the coalition's chairman. San Diego's  business community so far has pledged more than $30,000 to combat the proposed  merger, which Luce described as "one of the most significant economic events of  this century" in San Diego.  </P> <P> The coalition includes several well-known business and government leaders, the  Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, the Utility Consumers Action Network,  the Sierra Club's San Diego chapter, the San Diego Economic Development Corp.  and Local 465 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Bedroom Community'  </P> <P> "San Diego would become the only one of the top 10 cities in America serviced  by a utility headquartered outside of the city," Luce said during a  Thursday-morning press conference. "Our energy future is critical to our  economic destiny. . . . We are not a bedroom community to be left at the mercy  of a company whose first loyalty is to Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The proposed merger "means a significant loss of jobs, deterioration of our air  quality, higher energy rates and the 'Los Angelesization' of our utility  company," said Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce President Lee Grissom.  </P> <P> Luce predicted that private sector participation -- and donations -- will grow  as the business community learns "that rates for businesses, commercial  enterprises, (and) industrial plants . . . will be going up if Edison is in  charge of our utility," Luce said.  </P> <P> Besides organizations, the coalition has attracted support from more than 70  "private sector" members. The initial list unveiled on Thursday resembles a  "Who's Who" in San Diego.  </P> <P> The list includes San Diego State University President Thomas Day; General  Atomics owner J. Neal Blue; Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Chairman Kim  Fletcher; Dr. Fred Frye; businessman George Gildred; Chamber of Commerce  Chairwoman Gail Stoorza Gill; developer Tawfiq Khoury, and builders Warner  </P> <P> Lusardi and Mike Madigan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coalition Lacks Money  </P> <P> Luce readily acknowledged that the coalition lacks the money to match the  cash-rich utilities. For example, while the coalition hopes to raise $200,000,  SDG&amp;E recently spent nearly $400,000 to produce and mail  anti-government-takeover brochures to its residential customers.  </P> <P> "We have people resources but we do not have the money resources," Luce  acknowledged. "We'd like to do that kind of mailing, but we can't do it as  broadly or as expensively . . . it's just not in the cards, and I don't think  we should fool ourselves."  </P> <P> Grissom downplayed the significance of the utilities' cash reserves, arguing  that the advertising campaigns run so far by SDG&amp;E and Edison "are an abuse  of money . . . if we had the same amount of money to spend as SDG&amp;E (and  Edison) I don't think I would spend it that way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credibility at Issue  </P> <P> Luce and Grissom also claimed that utility executives at both companies have  lost their credibility among San Diegans, particularly on the sensitive subject  of how many San Diegans would lose jobs because of the merger.  </P> <P> "I can't quote the source, but one person said to me in a high executive office  of (SDG&amp;E) that it could be a thousand or 2,000 jobs," Luce said. "That  worries me."  </P> <P> Spokesmen for SDG&amp;E and Edison on Thursday repeated their previous  statements that only 1,000 jobs would be lost at the two companies.  </P> <P> Grissom and other coalition members complained that Edison and SDG&amp;E are  conducting a "disinformation" campaign that is designed to take the proposed  merger out of the media spotlight and refocus attention on a possible  government takeover of SDG&amp;E.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Merger Targeted  </P> <P> At present, there is little reason for discussion of a municipal takeover,  according to coalition member Michael Shames, who serves as executive director  of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based consumer group. "If the  merger was defeated, then municipalization isn't really an issue," Shames said  Thursday. "I think all (coalition members) agree that we have to beat the  merger."  </P> <P> The newly formed coalition opposes a merger of SDG&amp;E and Edison, but it has  stopped short of embracing a government takeover, according to Luce. "We favor  a privately owned, locally controlled utility," Luce said.  </P> <P> The coalition, which is housed in the Chamber of Commerce's office building,  expects to hire an executive director within the next week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Speaks Out  </P> <P> In a related development, Mayor Maureen O'Connor Thursday urged community  leaders to aid the newly formed Coalition for Local Control with "money" and  "talent."  </P> <P> O'Connor, declaring that "the proposed Edison takeover of SDG&amp;E represents  the single greatest threat to San Diego's autonomy in the 17 years that I have  been in public life," asserted that the two utilities will spend $25 million  between them "to force this takeover on us."  </P> <P> "Collectively, this group can fight the bully boys," O'Connor told a Rotary  Club of San Diego luncheon at the Sheraton Grand Hotel. "You can make your  voices heard" by contacting congressmen, state legislators, the state Public  Utilities Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, she added.  </P> <P> O'Connor spoke of her "fear of monopolization" and the evils it would bring to  San Diego. "The new Los Angeles-area company would not just gobble up one more  corporate headquarters from our city, but in so doing would become the largest  utility in the country, a utility without competition, a monster utility, a  monopoly!," she said.  </P> <P> The mayor hinted that the new utility, unfettered by competition, would be  unaccountable to its customers, particularly after current Chief Executive  Officer Howard Allen is replaced.  </P> <P> "What saint, as CEO of Edison, would not use an earthquake, a flood, a drought,  a strike or an oil spill as an excuse to raise rates beyond honest levels?" she  asked.  </P> <P> Edison spokesman Lewis Phelps responded that "it is unfortunate that Mayor  O'Connor has so little understanding of the regulatory process that she does  not recognize that Edison's rates are regulated today by the Public Utilities  Commission and they will continue to be fully regulated after the merger."  </P></p>

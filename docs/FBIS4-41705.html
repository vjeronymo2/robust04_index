			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Evald Kessarijskiy] </F>   [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod June 28 TASS -- Reformist Governor  of Nizhniy Novgorod Boris Nemtsov filed a lawsuit against  Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who he accused  of breaking into his office in his absence after which several  documents and souvenirs disappeared.    TASS learned from the prosecutor of the region Aleksandr  Fedotov on Tuesday that Zhirinovskiy is accused of violating the  law on the status of lawmakers which fixes inviolability of  their offices. Nemtsov is a member of the Federation Council,  the upper chamber of the Russian parliament.    The incident occurred during a recent visit of Zhirinovskiy  to the city on the Volga where the leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party was met by angry residents shouting "go home"  to him.    Zhirinovskiy qualified the "welcome" as "infringement on  personal prestige" and wanted to clear up the issue with the  local governor.    Nemtsov was out of his office at the moment. However,  Zhirinovskiy used his government telephone to report his  complaints to the presidential administration, the government  and the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. According to the  staff of the governor, Zhirinovskiy resorted to numerous threats  against them.</p>

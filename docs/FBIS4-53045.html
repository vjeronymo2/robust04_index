			<p>CSO     [Text] Suzuki is going at a fast clip. Sales of the  wagon-type light car "Wagon R" are favorable and they are making  a good showing with a contemptuous glance at the sluggishness of  major auto manufacturers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor.  Behind their all-of-a-sudden "small but shining" existence since  the burst of the bubble is the "Suzuki-style" management  strategy which has abandoned haphazard obsession with technology  and promoted thorough cost reductions (Tsuguaki Seki, Hamamatsu  Branch Office).    The representative types of auto for Suzuki are the "Wagon  R," "Alto," and "Cervo." Actually, only the "upper part" of  these three auto types, such as the body shape and interior are  different. The "underparts" such as the drive which controls the  running performance of the car are the same. About 70 percent of  the total parts are shared.    Many of those in the industry say sarcastically that "they  are no more than dress-up dolls." As a result of the thorough  sharing of parts, however, the Wagon R, the lowest-priced auto  type, has a low price on the level of 700,000 yen. For consumers  with tight purse strings, it is a price that fully arouses a  desire to buy. The secret of favorable sales lies here.    The initial monthly sales goal for the Wagon R was 5,000  cars. Currently, it has reached a level of double that with  monthly production of 10,000 cars. Since it went on sale in the  fall of 1993, they have sold about 44,000 cars in a period of  half a year. It is popular, taking two months from order to  delivery in one's hands.    The sharing of parts is also linked to improving the  capacity  utilization rate of their production base, the Kosai No. 1 plant  (Shizuoka Prefecture). That is because the underparts of the  three auto types are built on the same production line. The  number of cars produced has decreased for the Alto and Cervo  where over three years have passed since they went on sale.  However, combined with the favorable Wagon R, the capacity  utilization rate has improved. Naturally, costs can be reduced.  The sales policy also is clear and markdowns for cars that  cannot be sold are quick. An example is the sports type light  car "Cara" that has been OEM [original equipment manufacturer]  supplied from Mazda. Because sales performance has been sluggish  at 10 percent of the goal, they have decided to stop sales this  fall, two years after it went on sale.    The Suzuki-style management strategy does not much emphasize  technology such as performance or improvement in fuel  consumption. It is a method that is difficult to understand in  their highly proud technology office, but Suzuki president Osamu  Suzuki solemnly avers that, "It is no good to be too obsessed  with technology development."    President Suzuki is the son-in-law adopted as an heir in the  Suzuki family who are the founders. Since he was appointed  president in 1978, he has taken the command in the very front  line of management. He has a record of having increased sales  that were about 250 billion yen when he was appointed to four  times that at 1 trillion yen in a 16-year period, and his  influence and the sense of confidence placed in him by employees  is very great. The fact that he has been able to create a  thorough Suzuki style of management strategy is probably because  President Suzuki holds strong leadership within the company.    The cost reduction measure next set forth by Suzuki was the  promotion of mergers of fellow affiliated parts manufacturers.  At the beginning of the year, President Suzuki stated at a  meeting of affiliated parts manufacturers that "I would like  parts manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees to merge." The  aim is to enlarge the scale of the parts manufacturers with whom  they do business and cut part procurement costs. On 1 May, the  first merger following this strategy just was born. If mergers  increase in the future, the Suzuki stance will be strong and  cost reductions will rapidly proceed.    However, there is an uneasy element in this management  strategy. First of all, it is supply capability. The order  balance for the Wagon R with favorable sales is over 20,000  cars. With three hours of overtime a day at the Kosai plant, and  implementation of over three days a month holiday work, monthly  production has been increased to 10,000 cars, but an augment of  facilities will be necessary to raise production capability  further than this, and "makeshift contrivances" gradually are  reaching a limit.    Actually, Suzuki announced in March that they would OEM  supply the Wagon R to Mazda, but the specific period for the  supply and number of cars is considered "undecided." The lack of  surplus supply cannot be denied.    Considering the concept of the "Suzuki style" which holds  costs to a minimum, it cannot help but be negative on new  enlargement of plants. That is because it will be too much of a  risk to bear if they fall into a sales slump after expanding  facilities.    The reorganization of affiliated parts manufacturers also  really is not easy. The persuasion of parts manufacturers who  have a strong sense of being master of their own domain to the  point of attaining a merger probably will be unsuccessful by  ordinary methods. On the contrary, there also is a fear that it  will invite opposition.    The problem of rebuilding Santana Motor, their Spanish  subsidiary which is falling into a business slump, is also a  cause of uneasiness. Suzuki announced in April that it reckons a  bad debt loss of about 8.5 billion yen in the 1994 March  settlement of accounts. It is quickly devising countermeasures,  but it can lose its few production bases in Europe if it errs in  handling it.    The appraisal of Suzuki has increased along with the steady  rise in consumer orientation after the burst of the bubble. It  will be its policy in the future also to proceed with a thorough  reduction of costs with the strong leadership of President  Suzuki. The fast clip of Suzuki is giving momentum to moves for  parts sharing by the auto industry as a whole and supplying each  others' vehicles. Those trends probably will be bathed in more  and more attention in the future.</p>

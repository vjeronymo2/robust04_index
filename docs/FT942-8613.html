			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Lafarge US arm sells cement site Lafarge Corporation, the US arm of Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group, is to sell a cement plant and related assets in Texas to Cemex of Mexico for about Dollars 100m. Mr Michel Rose, chairman of Lafarge Corp, said the sale of the cement plant and four cement storage silos was in line with the group's strategy of withdrawing from non-strategic markets to strengthen its presence elsewhere. The assets, which also include a 52 per cent interest in Parker Lafarge, an asphalt and aggregate group, will be bought by Sunbelt Acquisitions, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cemex. Lafarge Corp is one of the largest building materials groups in North America, with annual sales of about Dollars 1.5bn and more than 7,300 employees. It operates 15 cement plants in the US and Canada.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Tokyo to miss emissions target Japan is unlikely to meet its official target for cutting carbon dioxide emissions, set under a UN treaty which aims to tackle global warming. In a report to be submitted to the UN next month, Japan's environmental agency forecasts that carbon dioxide emissions will rise to an annual 330m tonnes by the year 2000, a 3.1 per cent rise from 1990. Japan had agreed at the UN Earth Summit in Brazil in 1992 to cut greenhouse gas emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Some industrialised countries, including Germany and Denmark, are now calling for stricter targets, requiring governments to reduce emissions rather than simply stabilising them. During the past 20 years, Japan has halved sulphur dioxide emissions and nitrous oxide pollution, by rigorous curbs on air pollution. A recent OECD study praises the country for its achievement in reducing air pollution from industrial plants, cars and power stations. Japanese environmental agency officials say that, because of the already rigid regulations on car exhausts and industrial emissions, there is little room for further controls. The Japanese agency had initially tried to include a carbon dioxide emission tax in its environmental protection bill approved last year, but was forced to remove the clause following pressure from business and the government's own ministry of international trade and industry. The Japanese government says it will, however, meet its other target for stabilisation of carbon dioxide, where emission will be frozen at per capita levels. The environmental agency said that since the country's population will have grown about 3 per cent in the 10 years to the year 2000, carbon dioxide emission per head will be unchanged. Aside from carbon dioxide levels, the report forecasts methane emissions to fall by 16.7 per cent to 1.15m tonnes; nitrous oxide output levels are predicted to rise 8.3 per cent to 52,000 tonnes.</p>

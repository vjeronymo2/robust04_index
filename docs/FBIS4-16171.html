			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "NATO Resolve and Serb Stubbornness </F> Put Russian Diplomacy in Difficult Position"]    [Text] Despite Moscow's resolute objections, NATO aircraft  have followed up their first strike against Bosnian Serb  positions in the Gorazde area with another. In an interview  with news agencies NATO spokesmen did not rule out the  possibility of new bombing raids -- in the event of the Serbs  failing to stop their shelling of the besieged Muslim enclave.    For their part, the Bosnian Serb leaders have also taken a  hard-line stance. Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the  self-proclaimed Serb Republic parliament, threatened retaliatory  "political and military measures," hinting that the Serbs would  continue their offensive against Gorazde.    Russian diplomacy finds itself in an unpleasant position.  Events are taking a most undesirable turn for Moscow. For as  long as stress was laid on peace talks, Russia successfully  played the role of intermediary in the Bosnian settlement,  winning one diplomatic victory after another. But as soon as  hostilities commenced between the Serbs and NATO, the world has  seen for itself that the Kremlin's ability to influence the  development of the situation is very limited.    The Russian protests have had no impact. "Our reaction was  entirely appropriate for the circumstances," U.S. President Bill  Clinton said in a phone call to Boris Yeltsin. New Zealand's  Colin Keating, who is chairing the UN Security Council this  month, rejected a Russian proposal to urgently convene the  Council. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, responding to  criticism from [Russian Federation Foreign Minister] Andrey  Kozyrev, said that the preliminary consultations with Moscow on  which the Russian minister had insisted would have taken too  much time and would not have allowed the main task -- of  protecting the UN personnel threatened by the Serb guns -- to  have been resolved. Our Paris correspondent Yuriy Kovalenko  reports that Woerner warned the Serbs against any retaliatory  strikes, noting that NATO has so far used just two aircraft to  bomb the Serb positions, but that more major operations could be  carried out if necessary.    If this happens, relations between Russia and the West will  be put to a new test. But, if things reach serious crisis  point, President Yeltsin attaches too great an importance to  ties with the United States and West Europe to put them at risk  over the inflexibility of the Bosnian Serbs.    All the more so as the Serbs' actions over the past few days  have caused poorly concealed irritation in Moscow. Despite all  the Kremlin's efforts to persuade the Serbs to compromise and to  make them at least end the shelling of Gorazde, they preferred  to go on playing with fire. The NATO strikes were therefore  inevitable, and Russian mediation was useless. This was  something that was stated with some bitterness in a TV interview  by Yeltsin's special representative Vitaliy Churkin, pinning on  the Serbs a considerable amount of the responsibility for the  deterioration in the situation.    Russian diplomats were also very disappointed at the  behavior  of Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the "Serb Republic." Meeting  with Churkin, he assured him that he had ordered an end to the  bombardment of the Muslim enclave. Despite this, the shelling  continues, which gives NATO an excuse for a new strike --  entirely in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 836,  which declared Gorazde a "safe haven."    This resolution, passed 4 June 1993, was adopted unanimously  by the Security Council members (including Russia and China).  This removes most of the arguments from the Russian diplomats  who are contesting NATO's action.    Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Foreign Ministry's  Information and Press Department, told IZVESTIYA that, for  Russia, protecting the "blue helmets" is no idle question, since  there are Russian peacekeeping forces in Bosnia too. But, as he  put it, Moscow will not put up with the role of a junior partner  who is informed only when people want to hear a "yes." Russia  insists on the complete cessation of hostilities in the Gorazde  area, including air strikes. Kozyrev has set out this position  in a phone call with the U.S. secretary of state.</p>

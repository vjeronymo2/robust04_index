			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nissan Motor names new president MR YOSHIFUME Tsuji has been named president-designate of Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest carmaker. He will take over management of the company in June from Mr Yutaka Kume, who will become Nissan non-executive chairman. The transfer of leadership comes at a time when Nissan's sales and profits are under severe pressure worldwide. Mr Kume said he selected Mr Tsuji to succeed him in part because of his experience in production and purchasing, which would put him in position to pursue a needed cost-cutting programme. Mr Tsuji is currently executive vice-president in charge of Nissan's production operation group and non-automotive operations group. He has held a wide range of positions within Nissan, mainly on the engineering side, since joining the company in 1954. Mr Kume, who as president of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (Jama), has been a powerful advocate for the industry, will not fade from the scene. Although he said he would not interfere with Mr Tsuji's management of the business, he will continue to be influential within the company and will continue as Jama chairman. Mr Kume is also widely expected to be appointed vice-chairman of the Keidanren, the influential association of Japan's leading businesses, and could be in line for eventual promotion to chairman. Mr Kume denied he had any understanding with the Keidanren. However, if Mr Kume is to join the organisation in an executive role, he would need to make himself available by May this year. Mr Kume turns 70 next month and would be ineligible for appointment to the Keidanren next year.</p>

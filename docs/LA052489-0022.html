			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SAUGUS' MASTERS FACES COLLIER IN RING RETURN  </P> <P> A former world heavyweight champion will be making a comeback attempt at the  Hollywood Palace tonight.  </P> <P> OK, so it's only Monte Masters of Saugus, former champion of the little-known  and even less-regarded World Athletic Assn. of Yukon, Okla. But if Masters  (30-2, 26 knockouts) can prevail in tonight's 10-round main event, he will have  taken a small step toward credibility. His opponent will be Dee Collier (12-8,  seven knockouts) of Los Angeles, a former state champion and the man who  retired Tex Cobb and, perhaps, Alex Garcia, who has not fought since a loss to  Collier on Nov. 29.  </P> <P> Masters has been retired for nearly three years, giving up the ring for the  more solid business of construction. But he has laid the foundation for a  comeback scenario that he hopes to start acting out tonight.  </P> <P> The car was ready, but the driver was not.  </P> <P> That was the case for the Two's Company entry in the Indianapolis 500 last  week. After more than a week of mechanical problems, the Sun Valley company's  March 86C was finally ready to go on the track for qualifying last weekend. But  driver and co-owner Dick Ferguson of Glendale was ruled ineligible.  </P> <P> Because Ferguson had not raced at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in two years, he  was required to take a 20-lap refresher course in which he had to maintain a  speed exceeding 190 miles an hour. The deadline was last Wednesday, but because  the car still had problems, Indy officials made an exception and set last  Friday as the deadline.  </P> <P> However, it rained Friday and Ferguson wasn't allowed on the track Saturday.  </P> <P> "Everything looked dynamite," a dejected Jim Harkess, one of the owners, said  by phone from Indy. "There are a lot of disappointed folks out here."  </P> <P> John Wordin of West Hills qualified for the U. S. National Road Cycling  Championships in July by placing third in the U.S. Cycling Federation District  3 time trial championships Sunday in Lancaster.  </P> <P> Wordin, 25, finished the 40-kilometer course in 52 minutes, 41 seconds, 21  seconds behind Kerry Stockwell and Jay Vanderahe, who tied for first.  </P> <P> Wordin was leading the event until the chain fell off his cycle with  approximately seven miles remaining. The nationals are July 11-20 in Park City,  Utah.  </P> <P> Wordin and other area cyclists will next compete in the Redlands Stage Race,  which runs Friday through Sunday. The race is part of the USCF's National  Prestige Classic series.  </P> <P> De Dow, a sophomore right-hander at Moorpark College, was selected to the  all-tournament team at the state junior college softball championships.  </P> <P> Dow (30-7), the winningest pitcher in Moorpark history, won three games in the  state playoffs last weekend at Golden West College in Huntington Beach. She was  selected to the all-tournament team along with teammates Rosa Jimenez  (utility), Paula Allen (outfielder) and Gina Duarte (third base).  </P> <P> Moorpark placed third in the state and set a school record for wins in a season  (38).  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpts] Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said the  drug operation in Popoyo Beach, Rivas was staged by Nicaraguan  authorities. The DEA only supplied information as part of a  cooperation protocol signed with Nicaragua.    Nicaragua maintains a constant battle against drug  trafficking. The last operation that took place in Rivas, where  275 kg of cocaine were seized, is a demonstration of this  effort. Since 1991, Nicaragua maintains relations and exchanges  information with the DEA. Information exchanges are also  maintained with narcotic information centers in Mexico,  Colombia, and Costa Rica. The Popoyo Beach operation was  basically carried out by Nicaraguan authorities. Here is what  Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar said:    [Begin Cesar recording] We spoke with the DEA information  center about the Popoyo operation because it had information on  aircraft overflights too. The information they gave us  contributed to the success of this operation. Nevertheless, I  want to point out the operation was carried out exclusively by  Nicaraguans. More than 50 National Police agents were involved,  although a couple of DEA agents, who we had given prior approval  to, did participate. They have some technical facilities that  allow operations such as these to be a success. [end recording]    In another turn of events, Cesar said the airplane that made  an emergency landing at Puerto Cabezas was because it ran out of  fuel. Two Peruvians were traveling in this aircraft. The police  searched the aircraft but no drugs were found.    [Begin Cesar recording] It is a matter of concern when an  airplane runs out of fuel and makes an emergency landing. We  have photocopies of their passports and the names of the people  who were aboard the aircraft. We have all the necessary  information; however, nothing was found.

According to the Inter/View company, the Christian  Democrats would get 34 seats if parliamentary elections were to  be held now. The CDA now has 54 seats and would therefore lose  20 seats.    The PvdA [Labor Party] would lose a few less seats. The  Social Democrats would drop from 49 to 30 seats, a loss of 19.  This means that for the first time the CDA's losses would be  bigger than those of the PvdA. Last week the CDA experienced a  slight recovery; the party climbed in the opinion polls from 35  to 36 seats. The CDA reacted "with disappointment" to the  opinion poll, because the party has partly modified its  much-criticized pension plans.    The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] would  become the second biggest party with 31 seats. At present the  liberals have 22 seats. In previous opinion polls the VVD had  28 seats. The increase was seen in particular as an effect of  the comments by VVD leader Bolkestein that the flow of  asylum-seekers should be limited. The VVD seems to be the main  winner from the CDA's decline.    D66 [Democrats 66] dropped in the poll from 30 to 27 seats.  At present the Democrats have 12 seats. A week ago Van  Mierlo's party was still the second biggest party, but with 27  seats it would once again be fourth biggest. The party has lost  three seats in less than a week. The fall is explained by the  low profile of the Democrats when it comes to serious  discussions. The small Christian parties, SGP [Political  Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union] and RPF  [Reformational political Federation], together would have eight  seats: the GPV can count on two seats, and the RPF and SGP can  count on three each.    Janmaat's Center-Democrats remain at around six seats, a  gain  of five seats. The Socialist Party, which did strikingly well  during the local elections, could still enter Parliament with  three seats.</p>

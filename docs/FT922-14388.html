			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: Spectre of state interference haunts Israel's banking sector - Gedalia Gal steered legislation through the Knesset enforcing an automatic write-off of 20 per cent of collective farm debts. This made him public enemy number one to the banks It came as no surprise to anyone in Israel when Mr Gedalia Gal, a little-known MP for the opposition Labour party, was voted the top choice as a parliamentary candidate in the coming general election by Labour-affiliated members of Moshavim collective farms. However, to the banks which are owed about Shk2bn (Dollars 828m) by the chronically-indebted Moshavim, Mr Gal is public enemy number one. Mr Gal steered legislation through the Knesset early last month enforcing an automatic write-off of 20 per cent of Moshavim debts. These totalled hundreds of millions of shekels which had gone down the banks' bad debt plug hole over the past five years. Under the 'Gal Law', which also covers 21 Kibbutzim, the collectivist cousins of the Moshavim, and even the private sheep farm of Mr Ariel Sharon, the housing minister, many of the 500 Moshavim will be eligible for much more than a 20 per cent debt write-off. The Bank of Israel quickly instructed the country's five main banks to take in the effect of the new legislation in their 1991 accounts. The initial warning from the central bank that net profits would be all but wiped out proved to be over pessimistic, partly because underlying performance was in most cases an improvement on 1990. But the Gal Law effect was painful. Bank Leumi, the second largest bank by asset value, was pushed into the red, losing Shk78m. Gal provisions of Shk301m were much to blame. The others remained in profit: the smallest of the five, First International Bank of Israel (Fibi), and Israeli Discount Bank (IDB), third in size, are not much exposed in the agricultural sector and ahead of 1990, by 48 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. United Mizrahi Bank raised net profit by more than three times to Shk32.7m. But this came after a poor 1990, and it would have made more without the Shk98m set aside for the agricultural sector, Shk57m directly attributable to the Gal Law. Bank Hapoalim, the biggest group, saw its net profit slip by 26 per cent over 1990 to Shk135.7m after farm sector provisions of almost Shk0.5bn. Overall, Fibi led the field in profitability with net return on capital of 8.4 per cent. At Mizrahi, the figure was 5 per cent, while IDB and Hapoalim managed 4.7 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively. The banks insist that the loans set aside because of the Gal Law were performing debts. They complained that the law does not discriminate between genuine distress and those farms which are capable of meeting their dues. But there is an argument that in the long term, taking a big hit now has merit if it means the banks put behind them the problem of agricultural debt, which has plagued them since the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the Gal Law is an ominous development and its timing is particularly bad for the banking sector. This is the year that the government is finally supposed to begin selling off its majority shareholdings that it has held in all but Fibi since it rescued the system from disaster following a share price collapse in 1983. A preferential share structure left control in the hands of the original owners. But this will change when the government holdings are sold. The government is hoping that the sale process will inject a greater element of competition and attract foreign investment and foreign managerial skills into the local banking scene. There is a clear concern that the spectre of political interference could put off potential bidders. 'The implication (of the Gal Law) is that suddenly the legislature may intervene in the business relationship between two third parties,' admits Mr Gil Leidner, head of the government agency responsible for the bank sale process. He says the law has underscored the need for the government to get out of its albeit arms-length involvement in banking. 'The sooner the government sells its holdings the better. If the banks were not owned by the state, I don't believe this legislation would have happened,' he says. Bids close at the end of this month for a majority stake in Mizrahi, controlled by the World Mizrahi religious organisation. A similar process is under way for Bank Igud, a subsidiary of Bank Leumi, and the same is planned for IDB. A public flotation of stakes in Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim is planned as a step towards disposal. The process is an important element in the government's bid to reform the economy and persuade foreigners to invest in and lend to Israel to help it absorb mass immigration from the former Soviet Union.</p>

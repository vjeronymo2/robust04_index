			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AKEEM KNOCKS OUT MIJARES IN FIRST  </P> <P> Kid Akeem retained his North American Boxing Federation super flyweight title  with a first-round knockout ofRicardo Mijares of Mexico City before 1,200 fans  at the Sports Arena Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Akeem (21-0), ranked third by the World Boxing Council, floored Mijares with an  overhand right at 1:37 of the first round.  </P> <P> Akeem, a native of Nigeria who fights out of Las Vegas, set up the right hand  with a left jab. Mijares finally staggered to his feet at the count of 10, but  he couldn't stand up straight and the referee stopped the bout.  </P> <P> "No one can beat him," said Billy Baxter, Akeem's manager. "We've been having  trouble finding anyone to fight him."  </P> <P> Seventeen of Akeem's victories have come by knockout.  </P> <P> "Early in his career he wasn't knocking anyone out, but now that's all he does.  That's how Sugar Ray Leonard was too," Baxter said of Akeem, 22.  </P> <P> Mijares (29-6), who had never boxed outside Mexico, fought for the Mexican  flyweight championship last year, but lost a decision to Willy Salazar.  </P> <P> Akeem's handspeed edge was evident early and it appeared Mijares never saw  Akeem's right hand coming.  </P> <P> In the first of the two main events, NABF flyweight champion Isaias Zamudio of  Blythe (20-3, eight knockouts) won a unanimous 10-round decision over Jose  Herrera of Mexicali (16-5, 14 knockouts).  </P> <P> The victory was Zamudio's third over Herrera in three fights. All of Zamudio's  victories have come by decisions.  </P> <P> Herrera was the aggressor throughout the fight, but Zamudio's crisp  counterpunching attack gave him nearly every round -- one judge had Zamudio  winning all 10 rounds.  </P> <P> Zamudio seemed to have an answer for everything Herrera threw, and then he  usually came back with a combination of short, quick punches that scored to  Herrera's head.  </P> <P> Herrera landed some solid left hooks to Zamudio's jaw several times, but they  didn't seem faze Zamudio.  </P> <P> In January, Zamudio, ranked 16th by the World Boxing Assn., won a close  10-round decision from Herrera.  </P> <P> On the undercard, Nisael Espino (2-3-1) of Tijuana won a unanimous four-round  decision over Rickey Bynum (2-1-1) of Pensacola, Fla. in a battle of super  lightweights. Super middleweight Ricky Simms (4-3) of Rancho Cucamonga stopped  Jessie Lanton (11-4) of Pensacola at 2:25 of the first round. The referee ended  the bout after a left uppercut dropped Lanton for the third time.  </P> <P> In the first bout, light-heavyweight Billy Lewis of Pensacola raised his record  to 9-0 with a six-round split decision victory over Abel Asinamali (1-2-1) of  Westminster.  </P></p>

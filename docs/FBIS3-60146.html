The officials of Khania Customs Department  believe that shocking things will be found as the ghost yacht is  inspected completely.    The hashish, which was very carefully packed in 1-kg and  2-kg  cakes as well as in the form of tiles, was being taken by stages  this morning by small trucks to safe storage at the Customs  Department.    (Marco Ribic), 50, of Dubrovnik, who was the captain of the  yacht and engineer (Denis Vitmar), 39, of Zagreb in the former  Yugoslavia, who were the only two persons aboard the yacht, have  been arrested and will probably be arraigned before the Khania  prosecutor tomorrow.    According to reports, the yacht sailed from Yemen and  through  the Suez Canal was heading for Slovenia. However, because of  engine trouble, it sailed into Khania port three days ago.</p>

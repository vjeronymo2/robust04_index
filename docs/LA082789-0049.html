			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHAEL'S MESSAGE  </P> <P> James Kiel, please do some research before you go shooting your mouth off about  the alleged meaning of someone's song (Letters, Aug. 13). If you would really  listen to George Michael's songs, you might realize he is trying to promote  monogamous relationships, not portray "explicit sexual imagery" (that borders)  on the pornographic."  </P> <P> JODY E. KNIGHT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

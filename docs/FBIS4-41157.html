			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 June -- Boris Yeltsin described the  forthcoming signing of the agreement between the Russian  Federation and the European Union as a first tactical step by  means of which Russia "comes to Europe." Flying to Greece  today, where a sitting of the European Union will take place,  Boris Yeltsin told journalists with satisfaction that henceforth  discriminatory measures vis-a-vis Russia "when we were not given  quotas for the export of goods have been overcome."    In the Russian President's view, the agreement between the  Russian Federation and the European Union notes the transitional  nature of the Russian Federation's economy. The President added  that in the United States the transitional nature of the Russian  economy has not yet been recognized and therefore for the time  being obstacles for Russian goods have not been abolished. The  President said that the agreement would create a favored  treatment for Russian goods in Europe. It could already be said  now that the new parameters of cooperation and partnership will  make it possible to expand the export of goods from Russia to  Europe.    First of all Boris Yeltsin stressed that the Agreement  specifies "how much uranium and aluminum Russia will be able to  sell on the European market." "Previously we were not allowed  into Europe with these commodities". In this respect the  President regards his visit as extremely useful for the Russian  economy.</p>

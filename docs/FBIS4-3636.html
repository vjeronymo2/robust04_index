			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- The second national  conference to commend collectives and individuals having  distinguished themselves in promoting national unity and  progress will take place in Beijing in September this year.  Speaking at a news briefing today, Ismail Amat, state  councillor and minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission, said the meeting, in addition to commending  the collectives and individuals, will also sum up the brilliant  successes and experiences achieved and gained in promoting  national unity and progress under the new situation, and  earnestly discuss ways and means to promote national unity and  progress under the socialist market economic system.    It has been learned that, compared with the first meeting,  the forthcoming second meeting will have many new features:  First, it will be a sizable meeting in which advanced  collectives and 1,200 advanced individuals will be commended.  Second, the scope it covers will be extensive. Collectives and  individuals to be commended will come from all provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities under the central  government's direct jurisdiction; various departments,  committees and organs affiliated to the party Central Committee  and the State Council; units under the People's Liberation Army  and the Armed Police Corps; people's groups; democratic parties,  and federations of industry and commerce; and people of all  nationalities in all circles and from all trades and  professions. Third, it attaches importance to the broadness of  representation. Those who will be invited to attend not only are  representatives of minority representatives from all regions on  the mainland, but also are representatives from Hong Kong and  Macao. Fourth, it will underscore the spirit of the times. A  large percentage of the representatives will be advanced  collectives and individuals who have assisted and supported  minority people and minority areas in their economic and  cultural development or who have contributed to the development  and prosperity of people of all nationalities. Fifth, it  attaches importance to recommending and selecting advanced  collectives and individuals who have come to the fore in areas  where people of Han and other minorities live together.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dusan Kecman: "The Krajina Economy Is Surviving"] </F>   [Text] Banja Luka, 4 Mar -- The Krajina economy is  surviving, although on the average only one-fifth of the prewar  capacity is in use. Surrounded by war, with a large portion of  the labor force at the front, with sanctions, hyperinflation,  and -- in the last two months, with no payments being made, a  majority of the firms in Srpska republic (formerly Bosanksa  Krajina) have been brought to a point where they are producing  only just the amount of goods necessary to cover the payroll and  maintain equipment, since by working more than that they are  only producing losses.    Nevertheless, under these conditions, when all production  has  not been put on a war footing, and when a state of war has not  been officially declared, the people of Srpska republic, like  the Serbs in the West, accustomed as they are to troubles and  various shocks, are not inert. On the contrary, businessmen are  displaying awesome energy and resourcefulness. Raw materials are  being procured in almost all parts of the world. The extent of  their success in trade with the world is indicated by how well  stores and open-air markets are stocked here, not just by the  assortment of products in the economy.  <H5>  Food Industry the Leader </H5>   You can find everything in the stores here, from kiwis,  bananas, oranges, and cherries to Italian furniture and Japanese  television sets in all makes and sizes. Twice the output  heretofore is expected in the first half of the year, when  payments with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resume. This  was explained by Sveto Mudrenovic, president of the chamber of  commerce.    "Our own hyperinflation and the explosion of inflation in  the  FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and the absence of payments  for the last two months have been an obstacle to survival of the  economy here. We expect that the resumption of payments with the  FRY and the restraint of inflation will increase production by  at least half of what it is at present and then an even larger  growth," Mudrenovic says, explaining that the economy has  survived in spite of the wartime conditions.    "So far the food processing industry has recorded the  greatest success under these wartime conditions, since in this  area it has sufficient raw materials coming in, and there is  also a large market here. The largest processor here is the  Banja Luka Dairy, which has an output of between 30,000 and  35,000 liters of milk per day, in addition to well-known  processed products like the famous Trappist cheese and other  products. Then come Vitaminka, which also is utilizing capacity  at slightly more than thirty percent, and Fruktona," Mudrenovic  said.    Businessmen there do not want to talk in detail about all  the  places their exports are going to, ranging from Greece to  England. Although a surplus of livestock has been recorded at  the moment in Srpska republic, and prices are falling, the food  manufacturing industry, represented by Levita in Gradiska, does  not mind at all processing the famous purebred meat hog from  Nova Topola, the "Topola Landrace," which is raised on the farm  there.  <H5>  Exports in Spite of the Sanctions </H5>   The red-streaked bacon from Levita and other products meet  world standards. Rich Lijevce, with its exemplary farmers, is  feeding an entire region, about 60 percent of the Srpska  republic, which is the size of Krajina territory.    As a matter of fact, in now the fourth year of war on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia, the main support for  survival in these parts has been food production from Lijevce.  Although capacity has been cut back, the economy gets by in  various ways; the textile industry, for example, has been  operating rather successfully. The firm 22. decembar has been  maintaining 100 percent of its output, since it is making  uniforms, but also other things in demand on the market. Blik of  Banja Luka, Svila of Celinak and Medjugorje of Glamoc, which  makes sweaters and T-shirts, are adjusting well. The leather  industry is operating at one-third capacity, exporting even to  Switzerland, and the wood manufacturers are supplying their  customers in Europe. Thus the forest products firm Kljuc is  unable to make Cherry dining room sets for the domestic market,  since they are exported to England, with difficulty at the  moment it is true, but the demand for this dining room furniture  is still keen, although its price ranges between 3,000 and 5,000  German marks. This is well-designed furniture made from the  highest-quality wood, taken from Srpska republic forests. The  forest products firm Sapa in Sanksi Most, Borja in Teslic and  Radnik in Gradiska also have quality products, and there is an  extremely high demand for products of the furniture factory in  Gornji Podgradci, which is on the slopes of Kozara, not far from  Gradiska. "Next year we celebrate the 140th anniversary of  woodworking and furniture manufacturing in this region," says  Lazo Sinik, director of the woodworking factory in Gornji  Podgradci. "The first water-driven sawmill in these parts was  set up back in 1855, and soon there was one driven by steam. We  are woodworkers and furniture makers with a long tradition."  <H5>  Payments to the Rescue </H5>   In Gornji Podgradci they make solid wood furniture and  dining  room sets (tables and chairs in various shapes and designs),  mainly from oak [Q. sessiliflora] from the slopes of Kozara and  some English oak from the plains, as well as beech from the  slopes of Kozara and Grmec, whose quality ranks very high in  Europe.    "While the war was going on, we won the Gold Plane, which is  the first prize at the International Furniture and Equipment  Fair in Leskovac, in May of last year for the Petronija solid  oak set of table and chairs," Sipik said, explaining why there  is such a demand for the products from Gornji Podgradci. This  factory also makes oak parquet flooring and saws lumber for the  market. Within proximity of the Kozara forests and the Slavonian  plains, it makes furniture of interest to customers abroad,  where now it is difficult to export because of the sanctions.    Incel of Banja Luka, according to Milorad Serval, marketing  director, is at present making toilet paper and other products  and selling them from Benkovac to Vrsac and Leskovac, but only  as much as is ordered, they are not operating at full capacity,  since they lack imported sulfur and other ingredients, as well  as domestic pulp wood. Serval says that hyperinflation and the  suspension of payments have cut production to the minimum, but a  shortage of the new dinars was felt on the very first day  payments were resumed with the FRY. There are not many Avrams,  and merchants here are raising prices of their products, as  though their intention is to have marks "circulate" from hand to  hand in gray payments, in order to purchase goods abroad for  foreign exchange, while the dinar is being held back for use to  meet minimum needs and obligations. The situation here is the  reverse of that in Serbia, where prices dropped when the Avram  appeared, while in Srpska republic they have risen.    "The main thing is that payments are possible. This is  salvation for business people here," says Vukasin Basic,  director of Veleprehrana in Banja Luka. "Now our economy also  has a chance to do business normally."    One other piece of good news is coming in from the Srpska  republic economy. On Saturday Elektrobosna in Jajce went into  operation; it makes ferrosilicon, a strategic material used in  the raw state in Smederevo and Niksic, that is, in the steel  mills there, to make special steel alloys. Incidentally, before  the war silicon processed from ferrosilicon was imported at $55  per kilogram, while a kilogram of ferrosilicon was being  exported for a dollar.    One gets the impression that wartime conditions have  altogether 'purged' the Srpska republic economy of its inert  bureaucracy, that the situation has now brought new people into  the economy who are nimble and persistent, who do not have the  feeling that "some things just cannot be done," people who know  what they want and, most importantly, who can make on-the-spot  decisions.    This kind of economy, one gets the impression, will be very  important and successful on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia when the war is over and the sanctions are removed.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: German banks win modification to capital rules GERMAN banks have won a partial victory in their long-running battle over new capital adequacy rules which are to be introduced into German law at the beginning of next year. The financial services committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany's parliament, has decided to modify the government's proposals for capital adequacy rules to the benefit of banks. The rules will still go further than the letter of the European Community directives which the new law will implement, but they will go some way to appeasing German bankers' worries about being put at a competitive disadvantage to other European banks. At issue is the treatment of unrealised hidden reserves, which consist of extensive portfolios of shares, industrial participations and property, often acquired decades ago and standing at a much lower book value than market value. The German banks want to be able to unlock this value. Under the letter of the EC directives, unrealised hidden reserves can count towards so-called 'Tier 2' capital once a bank has accumulated 'Tier 1' capital of 4 per cent. Banks' lending power is determined by the total amount of capital, which under the EC directives must be 8 per cent. The German government, with the support of the Bundesbank, proposed that German banks should be obliged to accumulate Tier 1 capital - equity, retained earnings and profit-participating certificates - of 5 per cent before being able to count hidden reserves to a maximum of 1 per cent. Under the compromise proposal, banks will be able to count their unrealised hidden reserves up to a new maximum of 1.4 per cent, once they have built up Tier 1 capital of 4.4 per cent. Under the new rules, banks will not be allowed to take advantage of the full market value of hidden assets: for prudential reasons banks will only be able to count a certain percentage of the asset value. In general, the new capital regime will be harder for German banks: at present they are obliged to have core capital of 5.6 per cent. Under the Brussels-inspired rules, the total required will increase to 8 per cent but for the first time German banks will be able to include not only unrealised hidden reserves but also classes of capital such as subordinated debt.</p>

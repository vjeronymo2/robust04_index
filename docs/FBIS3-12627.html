He said Iran as the great neighbour of the two republics is  concerned about problems of the region and feels its  responsibility to help settle the crisis.    Tehran puts emphasis against escalation of the almost  six-year-old conflict and calls for peaceful steps to put an end  to the fighting, he said.    "The Islamic Republic of Iran denounces occupation of  Azerbaijani territory," said Va'ezi, adding "we believe the  Armenians should withdraw from all occupied areas and obstacles  should be removed through political talks." He said Iran held  consultations with Russian officials to hold a quadruple meeting  involving Tehran, Moscow, Baku and Yerevan, to help end the  crisis.    Asked about his talks with his Armenian counterpart,  Lypartian who visited Tehran earlier this week, Va'ezi said that  issues related to the region and Karabakh and ways to end the  crisis as well as issues of mutual interests were the topics of  the talks.    "We informed the Armenian side about the problems possible  escalation of the fighting could pose for Iranian interests," he  added. He said that he believes the Armenian side has  seriously taken into account Tehran's position.</p>

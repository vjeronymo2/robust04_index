			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. TEACHERS PACT COMPLICATES TALKS IN OTHER DISTRICTS  </P> <P> In the shadow of the mammoth settlement reached last month by Los Angeles  teachers, officials with the Beverly Hills, Culver City and Santa Monica-Malibu  school districts are predicting slow going in contract and salary talks that  will continue through the summer.  </P> <P> While the latest round of negotiations offers no startling developments from  either side, expectations raised by the 24% salary increase over three years  won by Los Angeles teachers have solidified local teachers' demands. District  administrators say such a reaction is to be expected, but repeat that fiscal  realities are grim.  </P> <P> "The (Los Angeles) settlement is way, way above what this district can afford  to offer our teachers, and that of course puts us in a difficult position,"  said Culver City schools Supt. Kurt Rethmeyer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time for Talks  </P> <P> Between now and mid-August, Culver City and Beverly Hills unified school  districts will reopen discussions on annual salary and benefit provisions, as  guaranteed in the districts' existing contracts. The Santa Monica-Malibu  Unified School District is negotiating a new contract to replace a two-year  pact that expires Friday.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles settlement was made possible in part by a projected state  budget surplus, caused by an unexpected surge in tax revenue, of $2.5 billion.  The smaller districts also will receive a share of this, although the precise  amount each district receives won't be known for several weeks.  </P> <P> Even with the state windfall, however, local administrators doubt that they  will have enough money to satisfy their teachers.  </P> <P> "There's going to be a reluctance (by teachers) to accept the fact of our  financial situation," Rethmeyer said.  </P> <P> Culver City, the smallest of the three Westside districts, may face the  tightest financial crunch. Saddled with a declining enrollment and the  subsequent reduction in state aid, the district has had to cut or reduce  numerous programs. The Culver City Teachers Assn. (CCTA) says that its  teachers' pay ranking has fallen from second among Los Angeles County's 45  school districts to 38th over the past 12 years.  </P> <P> "Our teachers are angry, too. We want to work . . . we want to be appreciated,  we want to be paid," said Bess Doerr, CCTA president. Doerr says, although the  union won a 6% raise last year, that boost only began to counteract years of  much lower increases or periods when teachers were given bonuses instead of  base-rate increases.  </P> <P> This year, second in a three-year contract, teachers opened talks two weeks ago  asking for an 8% raise. The district, which has 4,600 students and an annual  budget of around $20 million, has responded with a 2% offer.  </P> <P> "We're willing to cooperate, but we also want to be paid and respected," Doerr  said. Referring to the state funds made available by the state's surge in tax  revenue and the landmark public school funding measure approved last November,  she said: "Proposition 98 passed, and there is a surplus."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Communications  </P> <P> Doerr also praised the district's open lines for communication. In an  interview, she took pains to avoid threatening a job action, such as the work  stoppage and picketing by Culver City teachers three years ago.  </P> <P> "The Los Angeles settlement really perked us up. The teachers were up jumping  in the hall," she said, "We've been inspired by Los Angeles, and we do expect  (the district) to work with us."  </P> <P> Rethmeyer said, however, that the Los Angeles settlement was partly a product  of rapid enrollment growth, which brought an increase in state funding. He said  that because of the enrollment drop in Culver City, the district's increase in  state aid might be as little as 1.4%.  </P> <P> "I think all the parties are going to be disappointed, I guess that's what it  boils down to," Rethmeyer said. He said that higher pay was the key to  attracting good teachers, and that the alternative would be a "continuing  deterioration" of the education system.  </P> <P> In the Beverly Hills Unified School District, hopes are that teachers and  administrators' shared frustration at state funding uncertainties will help  settle their dispute. In June, 1987, the district barely avoided a strike  through last-minute negotiations after 92% of teachers with the Beverly Hills  Education Assn. (BHEA) voted to authorize a walkout. A year earlier, teachers  picketed at the threat of job cuts.  </P> <P> "We are not blaming one another, accusing one another," said Robert French,  Beverly Hills Unified School District superintendent. "It's the frustration  that the funding of our schools is out of our control, it's with the state  Legislature. I think we both understand that."  </P> <P> He added that, in any event, the district could not match the Los Angeles  offer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Terms in Beverly Hills  </P> <P> "I have a problem understanding the idea of an 8 plus 8 plus 8 (percent,  three-year salary increase) in the cold world of a 4.6," French said, referring  to a percentage by which many local observers were speculating that state  funding would rise.  </P> <P> But the BHEA has proposed a 12% boost in salary reopener talks in the third  year of a three-year contract that so far has provided two raises of 3% each.  </P> <P> "I think we have a considerably large core of teachers right now that are  feeling quite strongly" about the 12% raise, said BHEA President Judy McIntyre.  </P> <P> French, whose district has 4,800 students and a proposed $26-million annual  budget, said that a counter-offer will not be announced until the district  knows how much money it will get from the state.  </P> <P> In the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District, where negotiations have  been in progress for weeks over a new contract, the superintendent also says  that Los Angeles' increase is out of reach.  </P> <P> "The dilemma for us is we are not a growing district like Los Angeles is, and  our actual income this coming year will be just about what it was this current  year because of some decline in enrollment," said Eugene Tucker. "There's very  little we can cut out any more," to free money for wages, he said.  </P> <P> Automatic pay increases alone, for instance, which reward both teacher service  and increases in their university credits, would outstrip new state outlays, he  said.  </P> <P> Progress is being made in the first half of the district's negotiating process,  which involves non-monetary issues, Tucker said. These may include discussion  similar to the ground-breaking Los Angeles arrangement where teachers gained a  role in "power committees" in the schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Various Issues  </P> <P> Although Tucker would not speak in detail, he said that "working conditions,  planning time (and) grievance procedures" were all part of talks for the  district, which includes 9,300 students and a budget of about $40 million.  </P> <P> Salary negotiations are not expected to be completed before Aug. 17, again  pending state action.  </P> <P> June Lucas, Santa Monica-Malibu Classroom Teachers' Assn. president, would not  comment on the state of negotiations.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's any question that the settlement in Los Angeles raised  or established an expectation level on the part of employees," said Tucker.  </P> <P> "We will do everything we can to provide as fair a raise as we can," he said,  "(but) there are still too many unknowns to the state budget, and that's the  bottom line."  </P></p>

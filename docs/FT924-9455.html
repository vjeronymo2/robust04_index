			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (Changing of the guard): Wealth of talent ready for Clinton - No party power bloc will force his hand GOVERNOR Bill Clinton is not going to be short of talent or choice as he contemplates putting together a new government. He will also be able to select from an experienced crew of Democrats who have been waiting for the chance for 20 of the last 24 years and a new younger generation who have come to the fore with him over the last 10 years. Most to the point, he seems beholden to no particular power bloc in the party. Probably the most important single job in the portfolio sounds the most mundane, that of White House chief of staff. Yet Mr Bush's failure to find a good one proved a fatal weakness in his administration, while Mr James Baker's ability to direct traffic, policies and people in the Reagan first term was an essential key to its success. One member of the transition team believes the choice will come down to somebody most versed either in politics or government. Mr Mickey Kantor, the campaign chairman, and Mr Ron Brown, the party chairman, belong mostly in the first category, though Mr Kantor has government experience. Mr Warren Christopher, the former deputy secretary of state under President Carter, is the quintessential government man. Younger hopefuls could include Mr George Stephanopoulos, the smart young campaign communications chief. Rated almost as important is the White House position of congressional liaison, again a weakness in Mr Bush's government. Any of the above could be chosen, with Mr Brown, in particular, having displayed his political skills in abundance during the year. Though he says he does not want a job in the new government, Mr James Carville, the street-smart political director of the Clinton campaign, might have earned the right of refusal. Mr Christopher is also considered a prime candidate for at least two other senior Cabinet positions - secretary of state and attorney-general (Mr Kantor might be interested in the latter, too, as could be Mr Vernon Jordan, the black lawyer and civil rights activist). Other contenders for the foreign, defence and security portfolios include at least three congressmen  -Lee Hamilton of Indiana, Les Aspin of Wisconsin and Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma - Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and retired Admiral William Crowe, one of Mr Clinton's most active supporters in the military hierarchy. Mr Clinton has been careful to offer few hints about the composition of his own economic team, or about the distribution of power between different groups of advisers. Financial markets would be unhappy if old Oxford friends, such as Mr Robert Reich of Harvard and Mr Ira Magaziner, an economic consultant, gained excessive leverage since both are seen to favour activist government policies that postpone measures to cut the budget deficit. But their influence has so far been balanced by Wall Street advisers such as the investment bankers, Mr Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs and Mr Roger Altman of the Blackstone Group, and by Mr Robert Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute, all of whom prefer free-market policies with tight budgetary controls. The troika of Treasury secretary, chairman of the council of economic advisers and budget director forms the economic backbone of any administration. Mr Clinton may want to supplement them with an economic security adviser and may give higher profile to the commerce secretary and US trade representative. Mr Rubin is probably the leading contender for the Treasury, with Mr Altman, Mr Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker at Lazard Freres, and former Congressman Jim Jones, chairman of the American Stock Exchange, also in the frame. Not to be excluded, though clearly a long shot, is the prospect of Mr Clinton calling on Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and still the ultimate pillar of financial rectitude. Mr Larry Summers, now on leave from Harvard and chief economist at the World Bank, is a likely chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, not least because he has policy-making experience in a large bureaucracy. But there are other strong claimants, such as Mr Alan Blinder of Princeton, Mr Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Ms Laura Tyson of the University of California. Mr Shapiro, long close to Mr Clinton and a fountain of ideas on budgetary reform, must be a contender for the budget office, as may be Mr Jones or a current congressional heavyweight, like Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, though his current hegemony over the finance committee is a powerful competing attraction. Mr Reich can certainly be expected to get a senior position in the White House mechanism, conceivably as a new economic security adviser. Mr Robert Hormats, once a Washington veteran and now with Goldman Sachs, also brings a wealth of experience to bear on the international front. Mr Fred Bergsten, another Washington Democratic veteran of both government and institutional life, can hardly be ignored. If Mr Rohatyn does not get the Treasury, then he could be offered Commerce, as might Mr John Young of Hewlett Packard, or indeed Mr Magaziner. The hot inside tip for trade representative, succeeding Mrs Carla Hills, is another woman, Ms Paula Stern, an expert in her own right whose husband happens to be the present head of the Clinton transition team. There are, of course, in excess of 3,000 political jobs going in Washington. There will be at least twice that many applicants for them, which is why the city's real estate agents, long in the doldrums, were looking positively perky yesterday.</p>

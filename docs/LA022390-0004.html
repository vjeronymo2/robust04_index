			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S LOOKING FOR LIGHT AT THE END OF TUNNEL  </P> <P> Defenseman Rich Pilon of the New York Islanders was struck in the right eye by  a shot from Detroit Red Wing Brent Fedyk on Nov. 4. The injury caused a scar to  form over Pilon's retina and he is unable to focus on objects.  </P> <P> NHL rules require that players have at least 20-70 vision in each eye and  Pilon, from a medical perspective, has no vision in his right eye.  </P> <P> Said Pilon, 21: "Sometimes I think to myself that I can get in awesome shape  and be like Paul Coffey, be a star, and they'll have to let me play," he told  the New York Post. "They're just stupid thoughts.  </P> <P> "But if I get mad, I pump iron. You can't drown in your sorrows. When you do  that, life's done and there are too many things in life, no matter how negative  this is."  </P> <P> Add NHL: Mike Smith, general manager of the Winnipeg Jets, on preseason tours  of the Soviet Union by NHL teams: "I don't think, if you're trying to rebuild a  hockey club, you should be doing it on the plains of the Ukraine."  </P> <P> Last add NHL: Pat Burns, coach of the Adams Division's Montreal Canadiens, on  the weakness of the Patrick Division: "Whoever comes out of our division has a  ticket to the Stanley Cup finals."  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Feb. 23, 1906, who won a 20-round decision over Marvin Hart in  Los Angeles for the heavyweight boxing title?  </P> <P> The real deal: Wally Backman, signed as a free agent by the Pittsburgh Pirates,  says he won't miss playing for the Minnesota Twins.  </P> <P> "After I was in the American League for a month, I knew that I only wanted to  play in the National League," Backman said.  </P> <P> "It wasn't because of the caliber of ball. It was just the way the game is  played (in the American League). It's just sitting around, waiting for the big  home run."  </P> <P> Add real deal: Heavyweight champion Buster Douglas, visiting Las Vegas, said he  favored that city as a fight site over Atlantic City, N.J. "I feel very  comfortable here. Vegas is real; Atlantic City is just a carbon copy."  </P> <P> Quiet . . . too quiet: Abe Lemons, Oklahoma City basketball coach, on the best  way to distract a free-throw shooter: "What gets you is total quiet. Kids love  to play with noise and a full house. That's the reason we didn't play well at  Rice. There was never anyone there.  </P> <P> "Try total quiet a few times. After having the noise reverberating in your ears  all game, all of a sudden, it's quiet. That's tough."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Tommy Burns.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Jimmy Connors, on recent criticism of John McEnroe's on-court  behavior: "What's happened in the past has been far worse, not only from  McEnroe, but from Connors and a lot of others. So why the fuss now?" GARR  KLUENDER  </P></p>

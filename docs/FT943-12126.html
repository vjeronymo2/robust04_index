			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Tecs criticised as skills shortage is forecast Widespread criticism of work-related education and of emerging skills shortages is contained in two surveys published today. A number of businesses also criticised Training and Enterprise Councils, which are responsible for improving skills, and Local Enterprise Companies, their Scottish equivalents. A survey of engineering companies with fewer than 500 employees, published by the Engineering Council, shows a shortage of engineers at all levels - managerial, professional, technical and craft. Nearly half of respondents felt that staff had insufficient engineering skills and nearly 60 per cent were experiencing problems in finding appropriately skilled staff, particularly at the technical level. Moreover, 72 per cent said they expected to need more engineers in the future. The council said: 'The unfilled demand for engineers by small and medium-sized companies will be a problem for many years to come unless the perceived mismatch between the skills required by small and medium-sized companies and the education, training and experience available is addressed. 'Companies ideally would like to see more vocational education courses which include engineering, business skills and practical experience.' A second survey, the latest quarterly research by the UK 200 group of practising chartered accountants, showed three out of four of their clients forecast a skills shortage. They urged the government to establish further forms of both vocational and skills training. Some 40 per cent of respondents, said to be a representative sample of 1,000 businesses including manufacturers, engineering companies, retailers and service businesses, said they did not believe Tecs and Lecs were effective.

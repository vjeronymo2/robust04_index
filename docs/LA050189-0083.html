			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> THE VIENNA ENSEMBLE PLAYS AT CENTER  </P> <P> The Vienna Chamber Ensemble, nine members of the Vienna Philharmonic directed  by the orchestra's concertmaster Gerhart Hetzel, is the kind of ensemble that  sets musical standards. At the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Friday,  the 19-year-old group quickly established mastery of the ideal of chamber music  -- civilized conversation among intimate, long-mutually supportive and  forbearing friends.  </P> <P> Mozart's Divertimento No. 15 and Schubert's Octet in F were played. The program  was sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society.  </P> <P> The group's heritage is "authentic Viennese style," and in trying to define  that elusive concept, one observes that the playing was strong and muscular  without being insistent or aggressive. There was sentiment without  sentimentality, sweetness without cloying excess, yielding without  capitulation.  </P> <P> Individual voices emerged from the ensemble; they did not erupt or jostle for  attention. And they continued the sense of musical line without unseemly breaks  in dynamics or shape of phrasing.  </P> <P> Similarly, paired lines and ensemble playing were exquisitely judged in terms  of reinforcing dynamics, color and expression.  </P> <P> For all the polish, the seamless starts and unisons, the overall, shared  nuances of color and interpretation, the music-making never lacked a sense of  discovery or spontaneity. Clearly, such unanimity of approach and expression  only can be achieved by a group that has played together for a long time.  </P> <P> Individual players commanded attention nonetheless. Founder Hetzel, first  violin, played with unpressured evenness and was able to carry sweetness into  the heights, skating up long, arching lines without stumbling.  </P> <P> Clarinetist Norbert Taeubl was a wonder, apparently needing no pauses for  breath in steadily supported lines played without burrs or bites, and offering  delicate dabs of color, dramatic lines of dialogue or responsive musical  thoughts, as required. Horn players Franz Sollner and Volker Altman elicited  ethereal pianissimos.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, there were some members of the audience in Segerstrom Hall who  persisted in mood-shattering applause after every movement.  </P></p>

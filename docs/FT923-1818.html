			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / European Bonds: French voters do little to close divisions in Europe The lukewarm support delivered by French voters yesterday for the EC's proposed economic and monetary union is likely to do little to reverse the forces that had already opened up sharp divisions within the European exchange rate mechanism. The foreign exchange market decided last week to exercise its own vote before the French got round to theirs, and its verdict seems unlikely to be reversed now. 'An event that doesn't have broad European significance,' was the view of Mr Richard Grey, a bond market analyst with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, ahead of the vote. However, the result is still likely to have some important ramifications: for instance, in deciding the fate of the French franc, and the future direction of the French bond market. If the franc survives the current ERM crisis without a forced devaluation - an outcome that appeared more likely as the currency strengthened last night  -then 'it will virtually have become a Deutsche mark,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Montagu. The foreign exchange markets, which were developing a taste for bashing the franc at the end of last week, are likely to back off somewhat after the referendum result - though the narrowness of the victory means the currency is not out of the woods yet. The second result of a Yes vote could be an attempt by European politicians to patch up at least some of their differences of the last few days, and perhaps even to try to keep the Maastricht timetable for Emu on the road. That could merely serve to delay the inevitable. Ratification of the Maastricht Treaty in other member states will not be easy, given the narrowness of the French support, the messages from the currency markets in recent days and the ill-will generated between some European leaders during the course of last week. As a result, Europe's bond markets at the end of last week were already reflecting a lack of belief in the future of EMU, preferring instead to take a fresh look at the economic fundamentals of individual member states. A clear indicator of this was the speed with which the gilt market's inverted yield curve fell flat on its back. The market's mood did a smart about-turn during the course of the week, at least at the short end of the yield curve. As sterling slid, the market began to look for a two point cut in base rates, from the current 10 per cent. Meanwhile, longer-dated gilt yields had begun to creep up, to around 200 basis points above German levels, as the spectre of renewed inflation threatened to return. However, most analysts discounted the likelihood of a renewed burst of inflation given the depth of the UK's current recession - even allowing for the effects of the falling pound  - and the relative firmness in the gilt market reflected this view. The beliefs which have shaped both ends of the yield curve in recent days could turn out to be over-optimistic. It seems unlikely, for instance, that the UK government is about to abandon its anti-inflation strategy quite so quickly. With a general election won less than six months ago, Mr John Major's government is under no immediate pressure to engineer an economic boom to appease voters. Also, a sharp drop in rates could cause sterling to plunge, further undermining attempts to restrain inflation. Even if the UK does not opt to tie its currency into the ERM in the near term, it can hardly ignore the power of German interest rates, which will continue to dictate monetary conditions in Europe. 'If we are still in the same anti-inflationary world, you have to look at Germany,' said Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg. At the longer end of the market, meanwhile, yields could be set to rise sharply from their current levels. Even leaving aside the danger of renewed inflation, there remains the question of how the UK will finance its fiscal deficit. Analysts doubt that any economic upturn resulting from devaluation will show through in an increased tax yield or lower social securities payments until the second half of next year. In the meantime, international investors will demand an extra risk premium for holding sterling. It will be difficult to persuade UK investors to take up the slack. The renewed appetite among UK insurers and pension funds for gilts in recent months was based on the assumption that the UK was facing a low-growth, low-inflation decade, making fixed-income investments more attractive than equities. If those assumptions are reversed, gilt yields will have to rise to persuade investors to keep funding the UK's deficit. The precipitate decision to float sterling last week has made an immediate impact on investors. 'I've got to say that it does look as though it has shifted the pattern in favour of equities,' said Mr Mike Sandland, chief investment manager of Norwich Union, the UK insurer. Norwich Union had done more than any other investor over the previous months to lead the move away from equities and into gilts. The clear winner from the dislocation of the ERM so far has been the bund market - with other 'core' government bonds markets, like that of the Dutch, closely in tow. However, over time, the events of the last few days could prove to have contradictory effects on the German market. On the positive side, bunds will benefit from disarray in other currencies - though to a large extent, investors from outside Europe had already looked to the D-Mark block when investing in the EC. The result will be to buoy the currency further, helping to slow its decline against the US dollar. A high D-Mark will make German exports less competitive, adding to the slowing in the German economy and so making bunds more attractive. On the negative side, any further slowdown in Germany could exacerbate the fiscal deficit, adding to the weight of supply in the bond market (and with much of this year's deficit still to be financed). Also, the sharp spike in money supply from all the ill-starred intervention on the foreign exchanges in recent days could hold back the speed of interest rate reductions. If the politicians decide to call it a day on Maastricht, the pressure on Germany to cut its interest rates will also diminish. Against this background, the French bond market could yet turn out to be one of the major gainers from the events of last week and yesterday's narrow vote. The country's strong economic fundamentals have long been recognised by international bond investors, though their appetite for OATs has been slight during the uncertain summer months. With uncertainty finally out of the way - at least for the French market - the market's fundamental attractions could return to the fore.</p>

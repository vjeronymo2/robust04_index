			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Pentos forces Athena into receivership Pentos, the specialist retail group, yesterday forced one of its subsidiaries, Athena Holdings, into administrative receivership. Mr Bill McGrath, chief executive of Pentos, decided it was impossible to stem the losses at Athena, which sells greeting cards and posters in 157 UK stores, and took the rare step of withholding further funds. Directors of Athena Holdings, which lost an estimated Pounds 5m before exceptional items on sales of Pounds 16.2m in the six months to July 2, then called in accountants Grant Thornton as receivers. 'We couldn't give it (Athena) away,' said Mr McGrath, who was given the task of restructuring Pentos after the removal of its founding chairman, Mr Terry Maher. Mr McGrath said the decision to force Athena into receivership was not taken lightly. He believed it would have taken a further Pounds 9m-Pounds 12m to take Athena to break-even and that the money would be better invested in Pentos's other businesses. These operations - the booksellers Dillons, the Ryman stationery shops, Athena North America and Pentos Office Furniture - will continue to trade normally. Mr Maher last night described the decision as 'devastating news' for Pentos. 'I don't believe it is possible for a public company to ring-fence its subsidiaries in this way,' he said, warning that there was a danger of relationships between suppliers and other subsidiaries being affected. The main creditors are likely to be the shop landlords and Cartel, the new name for Athena International, which left Pentos through a management buy-out and was its main supplier. Mr Scott Barnes of Grant Thornton said he hoped to discover over the next few days which stores would be viable in the medium to long term. Until then, all stores would trade normally. Twenty-seven stores are operated under franchises. A total of 600 people are employed by Athena, mainly in the shops. Many of the shops will not be viable because the rents are much higher than could be supported by likely revenues, although in the last week before Christmas, Athena's sales were up 22 per cent on the same period last year. Mr McGrath said he asked all of Athena's landlords earlier this year to re-negotiate rents, but few responded. Together, the landlords are owed Pounds 3.5m and Cartel is owed about Pounds 1.2m. In October, Pentos reported a Pounds 36m pre-tax loss for the half-year to July 2 after exceptional costs of Pounds 10.5m, and a number of former managers accused Mr McGrath of making things worse rather than better. Mr Maher said yesterday that on recent visits to Dillons stores he had found the stock situation better and staff morale improved but said: 'Dillons is still understaffed and understocked.' Pentos said its bank borrowings in the second half had peaked at Pounds 67m and were expected to be about Pounds 50m at December 31. After discussions with its banks, credit lines 'to cover increased requirements' would be available on demand until the end of February. Mr McGrath said he could not rule out going back to shareholders to ask for more cash but had no current plans to do so. The February review will be part of the annual budgeting process as Pentos moves its year-end from December 31 to March 31. Results for the period to December 31 are expected to include write-offs of between Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 8m arising from the Athena receivership. Pentos shares yesterday closed 2p lower at 14 1/2 p, less than one-tenth of their peak level.</p>

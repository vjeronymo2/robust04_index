			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (11): European fruit in the heart of England - Birmingham is near the top of investors' shopping lists / The Midlands THE MIDLANDS property market was far from immune to the recession. But it was not hit by the same degree of overbuilding - and rental spiral followed by free fall - as the south. Some Midlands cities, with the benefit of European cash, began initiatives during the recession, which are now bearing fruit. Birmingham city council, for example, has made significant improvements. Pedestrian areas have been opened, linking the traditional city core area with the west end, where the National Convention Centre - again built with the help of European grants - is located. The canal network is being rejuvenated as a feature. Birmingham (along with Manchester and Leeds) now features strongly near the top of property investors' shopping lists, according to Ed Luker of Richard Ellis. There is an evident shortage of prime new office space in the city centre. So much so, says Geoff Thomas, of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, that there is 'every indication of an imminent new phase of speculative development'. One of the most high-profile current developments is Temple Court, in Bull Street, a major refurbishment of the former Lewis's department store by Richardson Barberry Properties. Coopers &amp; Lybrand has taken 100,000 sq ft on a pre-let at over Pounds 20 a sq ft, while the Lord Chancellor's department has bought a long lease on a further 130,000 sq ft. There is also a retail element. Temple Court has now been bought by John Ritblat's British Land for Pounds 32m - a price which reflects an estimated yield in respect of the offices of around 8.5 per cent, according to Simon Robinson, of Richard Ellis, Birmingham. Altogether, development completions over the past 18 months have totalled 651,000 sq ft (net), estimates surveyor Chestertons. Most were built speculatively, and include: Balfour Beatty/Church Commissioners' 136,000 sq ft 55 Colmore Row, which was pre-let to solicitor Wragge &amp; Co at Pounds 23.50 a sq ft; the Church Commissioners' Colmore Gate, 2-8 Colmore Row, where there have been lettings to Royal Insurance (75,000 sq ft) and Touche Ross (42,000 sq ft) and the remaining 30,000 sq ft is under offer; and the Chateau in Victoria Square, taken by TSB as its new headquarters. TSB has subsequently bought the 152,000 sq ft building. There is growing pressure on investment yields, partly because of Birmingham's under-supplied status, and partly because of conditions in the current investment market itself - large amounts of money available and relatively few properties on offer. Mr Robinson reckons that the next big Birmingham office transaction will be struck at 'well below 8 per cent'. The new convention centre, along with the council's improvement of access and rejuvenation, have led to a flurry of activity in the surrounding West End area. One of several developments is Helmwell's 100,000 sq ft canalside Tindal Bridge office project, where one third has already been let to Property Holdings and the Vehicle Registration office. The strategic location of Birmingham and other Midlands areas makes them logical choices for distribution facilities. Severn Trent Property's 90-acre Midpoint Park, on the north-east edge of Birmingham, is home to Cadbury's new 400,000 sq ft warehouse. And garden equipment manufacturer Hozelock has agreed terms for a 175,000 sq ft facility, which will open in autumn next year. In Coventry there is also a new initiative to revitalise the city centre. The council is seeking to raise Pounds 22m this year, mainly by the sale of property assets - land and leasehold interests with marriage value. With additional cash from Europe and the private sector, it will aim to undertake joint ventures with private sector companies, says David Holt, of Richard Ellis. Among the key areas identified is the Lower Precinct, part of the main shopping centre, where there are hopes of a new department store. Out-of-town business parks around Coventry have enjoyed considerable success. The City of Coventry's Westwood Business Park is almost complete, now that PowerGen has taken a 126,000 sq ft headquarters. P&amp;O Properties' 110-acre Middlemarch park houses companies that include Digital Microwave, Peugot Talbot and Tangram Computers. And there is now only one building, the 36,000 sq ft Stone Court left available, according to Mr Holt. A new phase will be launched next year. In Nottingham, the office market is extremely tight, with no new or refurbished space over 10,000 sq ft available. The main reason is the delay caused by the design competition for the new Inland Revenue headquarters. This has led to the Revenue taking some 115,000 sq ft of offices in various buildings on three- to 15-year leases, mopping up most of the excess offices in the city. Most of the government's short lettings were concluded at around Pounds 10 a sq ft. With at least five major unfilled requirements in the market - mostly other government departments looking to relocate to more modern offices - pre-lets are being negotiated at about Pounds 12 a sq ft. The new 409,000 sq ft Inland Revenue building is now going up in Castle Meadow with completion scheduled for 1994-95. Chesterton points out that the market could well be flooded with second-hand space over the next few years  -as the Revenue comes out of its temporary offices and leases on many 1960s office developments fall in and the tenants move out. Much of the poorer stock is likely to be unlettable. Further south, Milton Keynes has suffered the same problems as locations such as Watford - rocketing rents and overbuilding in the spill over from the London market. Rents at the peak were as high as Pounds 17 to Pounds 18 a sq ft. Now, with around 600,000 sq ft of empty space - out of a total stock in the central area of 1.3m sq ft - latest lettings have achieved Pounds 8 a sq ft plus 'small giveaways', according to Roger Saper, of Jones Lang Wootton. Some have been as low as Pounds 5 a sq ft. The largest available building is Norwich Union's' 143,000 sq ft Witan Gate House, which, it is understood, was considered and rejected by both BT and Nissan. Quoting rent is Pounds 15 a sq ft. During the boom of the 1980s, take-up of office space was up to 300,000 a year. Agents are looking at several years before the vacant space overhanging the market is absorbed. Until most of it is, the Milton Keynes office market is effectively stalled. Swindon's office market has been spared the worst of the development spree which plagued most of the M4 corridor. But, though there is a limited amount of good, new space, there is a massive amount of second-hand accommodation, says Alistair Elliot, of surveyor Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Quoting rents for second-hand space ranges from Pounds 6 to Pounds 12 a sq ft. However, at St Martins' successful Windmill Hill business park, a new 305,000 sq ft phase is under construction. Rents achieved at Windmill Hill so far are Pounds 15 a sq ft.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Observer: Bear necessity It was with the best of intentions that the FT this week re-ran an ad for the Peacekeeper Bear, a fund-raising toy launched by John Major in May and dreamt up by the United Nations Association. Unfortunately, the 0891 number now hands out racing tips for the 2 o'clock at Huntingdon. The UNA, which has already sold 3,000 furry items, says it hopes the tips enrich potential donors. They and others should now place their order on 071 402-9029.</p>

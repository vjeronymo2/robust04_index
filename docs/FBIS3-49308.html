I initiated this meeting as  early as last Tuesday, when it seemed that the talks between  Deputy Prime Minister Granic and [Bosnian Prime Minister]  Silajdzic would not amount to [word indistinct]. However, Mr.  Izetbegovic delayed the meeting. You are aware of the  situation that led to this delay; you know who shelled the  runway in Sarajevo. You also know that Izetbegovic is now  airborne and that he is on his way to Bonn.    I wanted this meeting so that I could tell the  Bosnian-Muslim  side that it is high time to stop their offensive against the  Croatian population of central Bosnia; it is time for peace,  because if the war should continue this will have catastrophic  consequences, not only for the Muslim and the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, but for everyone in the region.    Keeping in mind that, not only Germany but international  diplomats--France, Germany, and Europe--have all offered their  good services to make the meeting possible, they all want to see  some kind of result. We will go and see. [end recording]    Asked if this was the right moment for negotiations in the  light of a major Muslim offensive on the Croats in central  Bosnia, President Tudjman said:    [Begin Tudjman recording] It is obvious that the climate is  not positive. Muslim forces have been launching strong attacks  in the Lasva River valley over the last few days, from Busovaca  to Kiseljak. That is why I am going, in order to save the  people, the civilian population, and to prevent the expulsion of  100,000 more Croats. Our intention from the beginning of the  clashes in Bosnia was to enable Croats to live in the  Bosnian-Muslim republic and the Muslims to live in the Croat  republic. That is why I have proposed this meeting and why I am  going there where we will do everything we can. I believe that,  for once, the Muslim leadership will have to realize that they  should accept the hand of reconciliation in order to improve  horrible relations caused by the conflict after the Serbian  aggression. Like Croatia, the Muslims are still facing the  Serbian aggression. Therefore, this is an unreasonable policy  that should be put to an end. [end recording]</p>

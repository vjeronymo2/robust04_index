			<p>BFN     [Text] Police have enough evidence to issue warrants for  the arrest of two men believed responsible for the truck-bomb  discovered in Bangkok last month, city police chief Chaisit  Kanchanakit said yesterday.    Chaisit said police had photographs of the two suspects, but  he did not identify them as Thais or foreigners. He said  information gathered by police was the same as that received by  the National Intelligence Agency.    Police discovered a truck wired with explosives in Bangkok  last month. They speculated it was destined for the Israeli  Embassy in Soi Langsuan before it was involved in a minor  traffic accident. Witnesses said the truck driver, who later  fled, was of Middle Eastern appearance.    Chaisit said he could not say whether the bomb had anything  to do with international politics.    "I can say only that police already know who the culprits  are  and their intention. The suspects may still be in Bangkok," he  said. Police would discuss with the Interior Ministry whether  arrest warrants should be issued.</p>

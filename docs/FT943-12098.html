			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / People: Minchin takes over as SFA deputy chairman Peter Minchin, 62, has been appointed deputy chairman of the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), taking over from Andrew Winckler, 45. Minchin is also chairman of the SFA's enforcement committee, and a board member of Lloyds Bank Stockbrokers. He has been a board member of the SFA, and its predecessor, the Securities Association, since 1988. Until recently he was also a board member of the London Stock Exchange, having first joined its council in 1976. Minchin started his working life as a high-flier - by joining the Fleet Air Arm, part of the Royal Navy. He spent eight years in the navy, including a period as naval attache in Paris, but an eye injury put paid to his flying career, and galvanised his entry into stockbroking. He commenced his new life with Kitcat and Aitken in 1958. He joined another stock exchange firm, Pidgeon de Smitt, leaving there in 1982 to help set up market making in the Kuwait stock exchange, where he was appointed adviser on securities regulation to the Kuwaiti government. He joined Lloyds Merchant Bank in 1986, directing its newly created broking subsidiary, of which he ultimately was chairman. He is also chairman of the German Smaller Companies Investment Trust, and governor of Sir John Cass's Foundation, the educational charity. The SFA regulates members of all the organised City investment markets, with more than 1,300 member firms which in turn employ some 38,000 staff. Winckler earlier this year left the SFA to become head of supervision at the Securities and Investment Board, the body responsible to the Treasury for regulation of the UK's financial services industry.</p>

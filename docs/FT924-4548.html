			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Ukraine on radical road THE Ukrainian government, which last month announced its conversion to market reform, has kicked off its programme this week with a flurry of decrees on price liberalisation, privatisation and trade. Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, the Ukrainian economist who is drafting the reform programme, said decrees expected today will liberalise prices for most of its goods, including energy, and require local officials to privatise 25 per cent of small businesses within the next four months. Parliament last month granted Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new prime minister, wide-ranging authority to govern the economy by edict. 'For the first time I believe that reforms can take place in Ukraine,' Mr Savchenko said. 'It is clear that Mr Kuchma wants to make a start although, frankly, I do not know if he will have the strength to succeed.' Price liberalisation will not please Ukrainian consumers whose purchasing power has fallen sharply over the past year. Mr Savchenko anticipates that prices in state stores will leap by 300 per cent for bread, 200 per cent for milk and 500 per cent for butter. However, a sign of the new reforming mood came last week in the western Ukrainian city of Lvov when the city council bowed to government pressure and endorsed an International Finance Corporation pilot programme for small-scale privatisation. The central government says its new and ambitious 25 per cent privatisation target will force reluctant regional governments to turn state property into private hands, and specifies that all small-scale privatisation will be done by auction. Officials who block privatisation will be sacked. In a separate decree, published yesterday, the government forbade enterprises from exporting without bank proof of pre-payment from their foreign companies, or letters of credit. The idea is to curb Ukrainian enterprises' habit of exporting to other republics with no guarantee of payment. A group of Ukrainian economists, working closely with World Bank officials, is meanwhile drafting a programme to reduce Ukraine's inflation from its current monthly rate of 30 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEALED INDICTMENTS REPORTEDLY NAME KEATING, 3 OTHERS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: SOURCES SAY CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE MADE ABOUT THE ALLEGEDLY FRAUDULENT  SALE OF NEARLY $200 MILLION IN AMERICAN CONTINENTAL CORP. BONDS THROUGH LINCOLN  S&amp;L BRANCHES.  </P> <P> A state grand jury investigating the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan has  issued sealed indictments of Phoenix developer Charles H. Keating Jr. and three  others, and the charges are expected to be made public today, sources said  Monday.  </P> <P> The indictments will be the first criminal charges brought relating to  Irvine-based Lincoln, which collapsed 17 months ago. The failure is expected to  cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, making it one of the costliest ever.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who in December  was appointed a special state prosecutor to investigate Lincoln, confirmed that  his office "has concluded its presentation of evidence to the grand jury." The  spokeswoman would not say whether indictments had been issued.  </P> <P> However, sources close to the probe said the state grand jury, which has been  meeting in Van Nuys since mid-April, has issued sealed indictments that are  expected to be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court this morning.  </P> <P> The grand jury focused on the allegedly fraudulent sale of nearly $200 million  in American Continental Corp. bonds through Lincoln branches. American  Continental in Phoenix was the parent of Lincoln, and most of its bonds -- now  nearly worthless -- were sold to Lincoln depositors and elderly investors.  </P> <P> Sources the grand jury had issued indictments against Keating, American  Continental's former chairman; Judy Wischer, American Continental's former  president, and Ray Fidel and Robin Symes, both former presidents of Lincoln.  </P> <P> Keating's lawyers would not comment on the investigation. Representatives for  the others either declined comment or could not be reached.  </P> <P> KCBS-TV in Los Angeles reported Monday night that Keating would be arraigned in  Superior Court today on charges of criminal fraud.  </P> <P> Keating and other Lincoln and American Continental officers and directors, as  well as the lawyers and accountant who advised them, are also under scrutiny in  a wide-ranging federal grand jury probe centered in Los Angeles, Phoenix and  Washington.  </P> <P> Also pending is a civil racketeering lawsuit filed by federal regulators  against Keating and other former American Continental executives.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgardo Barbena S.] </F>   [Text] Five percent of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation  Front] militants nationwide have participated in prior "ad hoc"  congressses or assemblies to discuss the documents of May's  congress, thus reflecting the disenchantment of the  card-carrying members, according to FSLN Deputy Sergio Ramirez.    Speaking on the Radio Sandino talk show "Face to Face"  ["Frente a Frente"], Ramirez discussed the hot topics of the  Sandinist debate and cited specific examples of what happened  during the last FSLN Congress.    Approximately 3,000 FSLN members participated in the  discussion of the documents at the 1991 Congress in Masaya, but  at the most recent congress the number of participants did not  even reach 400, a situation that was similar nationwide,  "meaning the militants do not feel attracted to the party  positions."    "As long as those positions are not made accessible, all the  people, mostly the young, and not just its militants will move  away from Sandinism," the FSLN bloc chief told the radio  station. He also cited the scarce participation of young people  in party meetings.    More than 300,000 young people will vote in the 1996  elections, so Ramirez used Radio Sandino's microphones to send a  message of hope and dreams to adolescents who were born not  knowing of the Somoza period and who will vote for the first  time that year.    Sergio supported consolidating the unity of the FSLN and  said  the existence of currents within the FSLN "are mere indications  of trends of thought, AND WHENEVER SOMEONE TALKS OF DIVISION  AMONG THE CURRENTS, THIS IS A TIMID ATTEMPT TO HIDE THE SUN WITH  ONE'S FINGER." [upper case as published]    The currents are not going to cause nor are they causing any  division. "Division is caused by the unfit leadership of a  party that has to win the elections," the Sandinist bloc chief  said in fielding questions by station listeners, including by  those who said they were "anti-Sandinists to the death."    During his appearance, Sergio Ramirez made an extensive  analysis of what the concept of "vanguard" (call it National  Directorate) was during the past decades, chiefly during the  Somozist dictatorship, when the militants were totally hemmed  in. "But now we do not have an armed party but, rather, a  political party that needs to open up to society to win over the  support of the thousands of people who will have to vote."    It is contradictory, therefore, that a party that wants to  win should be closed, given that in order to win it has to do so  in terms of the number of votes, not the quality of the votes,  Ramirez said, explaining this entails an opening in the FSLN and  the end of categories, "because nobody likes to be discriminated  against, to be second- or third-rate militants, or to see some  on the first or second floor while others are out on the street."    The view that the FSLN should continue to be ruled by a  historic National Directorate that used military means to fight  the dictatorship is inappropriate, "and that is why we need to  create a new party based on massive affiliation that needs to  have a national council of directors and not a historic National  Directorate, because that structure corresponds to a phase  superseded within the FSLN."    "Face to Face" host Orlando Gomez mentioned that 10 hours  earlier Rene Vivas had said in the same radio station during the  program "Eco News" that the proposal of a Sandinism ruled by the  majority "is a trend that tends to make the FSLN shift to the  right."    Commenting on Vivas' remarks, Ramirez said "I do not believe  this is an ideological problem but, rather, a political  problem," and if one is proposing democracy within a party and  the proposal is regarded as a shift to the right, it seems to me  this creates unnecessary confusion."    Talking about those who use insult and slander as weapons to  disqualify others within the Sandinist debate, Ramirez said that  was a mistake, because whenever there are insults, slanders, and  disqualifications," that means someone ran out of arguments, and  that is serious in a political discussion."    "I believe the party members are interested in hearing a  discussion of ideas, although they may be contradictory, because  we can reach through ideas new elements "that give us new unity  within the party." "If I get called a rightist for expressing  an idea, then the person on the other side already lost the  discussion," Ramirez said, citing something Unan [National  Autonomous University of Nicaragua] President Mariano Fiallos  had said some years ago about two people who were holding a  discussion. When one of them lost the argument, he said: "The  truth is I will not continue to argue with you, because you are  really ugly, and that is how the discussion ended."    The easy thing to do to downplay the political debate  pertaining to the FSLN's future "is to simplify it by saying it  is a struggle among individuals, and a struggle among  individuals is not valid when dealing with matters as important  as the ones we are experiencing within the FSLN."    This is a matter of positions "such as mine in favor of the  overall renewal of the FSLN so that it will become a viable  party in the face of society, attract voters, and cease to be a  minority party, which is what it is following the 1990  elections, so it can allow us to gather the different social  groups of the many people who did not vote for the FSLN in 1990.  [no closing quotation mark as published]    Sergio said the FSLN must proselytize, and "we must not be  afraid of the world electoral proselytism, because we cannot  return to a government through any means other than an election.  To win the elections we need votes, and we will not win votes  if we continue to isolate ourselves from society."    Topics such as relations were broached during the program.  Ramirez said "this offends some within the FSLN ranks who claim  to be anti-imperialists and yet have 10-year visas to enter the  United States, whereas "some of us have trouble getting a visa  for just one occasion."    Those irked by this topic, including people who have been  born in, lived, and studied in the United States, "are the ones  who do not accept the humble anti-imperialism that some of us  Sandinists have shown during our work for national sovereignty."  The FSLN deputy affirmed he is neither morbidly anti-imperialist  nor a royalist [principista]. In conclusion, the Sandinist  leader called on the members of his party to gain stature in the  debates and not fall for provocations. To those who side with  any line of thought, he said "the only advice I can give you is  not to stop thinking. Never imagine others can think for you;  do not mull over what others have mulled over before."    "What a person must not do is allow someone else to tell him  what he should think. Do not allow someone to play cassettes in  your head, because human beings are not tape players," Ramirez  said.</p>

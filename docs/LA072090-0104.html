			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COYOTES TRAVELING FARTHER FROM HABITAT TO FIND FOOD  </P> <P> Linda Nicholson's cat was used to having the run of the neighborhood. The big  tomcat feared little and was well respected by other cats in the neighborhood.  But last month, after 15 years of eluding dogs and cars, the cat fell victim to  a foe Nicholson never thought to worry about -- coyotes.  </P> <P> As a resident of Brea's Old Town section, well to the south of the hills and  canyons that rim the city's northern border, Nicholson figured she would never  see a coyote slinking down her street. But on June 8, she witnessed two of them  in her front yard.  </P> <P> About 2:30 a.m. Nicholson went out on her front porch to see what her dog was  barking at. The two animals, about the size of German shepherds, took off when  she appeared, Nicholson said, but not before one of them dropped what was left  of her cat.  </P> <P> "They were beige and brown, definitely coyotes," she said.  </P> <P> Coyotes have also been blamed by Lora Bramberg for the death of her cat earlier  this month. Bramberg found her cat's remains, including its collar, at a nearby  Alpha Beta.  </P> <P> What frightens both Nicholson and Bramberg, who live off Brea Boulevard just  south of Imperial Highway, is that the coyotes have traveled far from their  normal habitat in the canyons, and have been bold enough to come right up to  the house.  </P> <P> Bramberg said her cat "never left my front porch. In fact I think there is  blood on my porch."  </P> <P> Coyotes are no strangers in many parts of Orange County with hilly terrain and  open space. But after four years of drought, the animal's natural habitat has  become depleted of the small animals and birds that coyotes normally feed upon,  authorities say, and the coyotes have been spotted farther and farther from  their homes.  </P> <P> Residents of the hilly areas of north Tustin have had frequent encounters with  coyotes for years, and now the animals have been spotted farther to the south  in more populated neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "As the food chain dies out, coyotes will be seen in areas where there are  people," said Patrick Moore, an information officer with the Department of Fish  and Game. "They are scavengers and will eat lots of things, including fruit and  vegetables."  </P> <P> For the most part, coyotes are not threats to humans, Moore said, but he has  heard of instances where coyotes attacked small children.  </P> <P> "Coyotes aren't prone to becoming aggressive unless they are trapped or  cornered," he said.  </P> <P> According to a spokesman in Brea's maintainance department, there is little the  city can do about the coyotes. Callers who complain about the animals are told  to keep garbage cans covered and to keep pets and their food in the house at  night.  </P> <P> Moore echoed that advice, saying that uncovered garbage was a great attraction  to coyotes. He also suggested harvesting ripe fruits and vegetables  immediately.  </P> <P> But even if residents are diligent in keeping their trash covered and their  pets and pet food inside, once a coyote has found food, it will continue to  return.  </P> <P> "Even when you remove the stimulant, they will continue to travel to an area  where they have had success," Moore said. "They form a pattern and it can take  a while for that pattern to break."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA) -- President Husni Mubarak has  said that all his efforts on the Arab and international scenes  aim to promote Egyptian interests. Unless the world senses that  Egypt is prepared to assume a key role in the region no one will  assist us. The result would be negative both in terms of the  Egyptian domestic scene and the life of ordinary Egyptians.  Many nations have fallen behind, retreating into backwardness  and poverty that Egypt is not eager to join, he stated.    Speaking to chief editors of Egyptian newspapers during the  plane trip from Harare to Cairo, Mubarak said that the daunting  efforts in which he is engaged, his exchanges with various world  leaders, and his bid to achieve stability in the region have  demonstrated to the entire world, particularly the big powers,  the vitality of Egypt's role in this part of the world. Egypt's  policy during the Gulf war proved to the whole world that Egypt  is a reliable force, he said.    President Mubarak said that the consultations he held with  leaders of major countries and his friendship with them led  these countries to adopt policies that helped Egypt in its talks  with the IMF.    The world does not appreciate reclusive nations and that  major powers only support those countries that have stature and  influence and get involved in world events, Mubarak pointed out.    President Mubarak said that he is in constant touch with  U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat,  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, and Jordan's King Husayn in an  effort to stimulate the peace process and resume the  Arab-Israeli talks in Washington. He pointed out that even  during his stay in Harare he talked on the telephone with King  Husayn.    President Mubarak added that the contacts he had with  President Clinton and all the other parties produced results,  particularly following the UN Security Council resolution  concerning the massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. An Israeli  delegation will meet in Tunisia with Palestinian officials to  review current proposals and prepare for high-level  Palestinian-Israeli talks, he remarked.    'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are likely  to meet in Cairo to sign an agreement detailing the practical  measures for the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles, Mubarak said. The agreement will set  a timetable for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return  of 'Arafat to Palestinian land. The president pointed out that  an Israeli- Palestinian agreement was already reached before the  Hebron massacre occurred.    Jerusalem's status will be determined through negotiations,  Mubarak said. A statement in which U.S. President Clinton  declared otherwise [a'lana ghayr dhalik] has been cited by a  U.S. television network, but this statement was denied by an  adviser at the U.S. Department of State who was speaking to  journalists in Cairo last Thursday, Mubarak remarked. President  Mubarak reemphasized the position of the U.S. Administration  vis-a-vis Jerusalem, whose status will be determined through  negotiations [al-quds allati sayatahaddadu mawqifaha min khilal  al-mufawadat].    Concerning the possibility that U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher might visit the region in the near future,  President Mubarak said: Such a visit is likely.    To a question about the attitude of some Arab rulers toward  Egypt, President Mubarak said: I don't care about persons, but  I do care about the Arab nations. My principal concern is the  interest of these nations. We are against the partitioning of  Iraq and Sudan.    To another question about the recent visit to Cairo by  Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, and the possibilities of arranging a meeting between  them in Cairo soon to achieve national reconciliation, President  Mubarak said that Egypt is making the necessary contacts in this  regard to achieve progress. However, the arrangements for such  a meeting in Cairo must be preceded by an agreement between the  two sides, President Mubarak added.    Alluding to the issue of national dialogue in Egypt,  President Mubarak said that he will call for the start of this  dialogue next April and that he will deliver a speech when the  dialogue starts. He pointed out that working groups and a  committee representing all concerned groups will be formed. He  affirmed that the government is currently carrying out tangible  and concrete efforts, adding that Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif  Sidqi's tours of various governorates have helped to solve many  problems. President Mubarak said that some 200 projects were  recently set up in Suhaj Governorate, noting that this will help  solve the problem of unemployment.    Continuing, President Mubarak said that the government will  make strenuous efforts in the various fields by the end of this  year and the beginning of next year.    Commenting on current intensive activity by the political  parties to prepare for next year's People's Assembly and  Consultative Council elections, President Mubarak said that  everybody is encouraged to join such activity and he is sure  that the makeup of future parliaments will reflect this popular  participation.    He asserted that the government is doing its best to solve  all problems, particularly important ones like unemployment. He  urged further efforts to solve this problem gradually.    President Mubarak said that in the past Egypt had no  currency  reserves in the banks and that current reserves must not be  squandered but kept for appropriate uses, noting that the money  belongs both to the public and the banks.    Discussing the reduced revenue from tourism and the demands  made by some people working in the tourist business, he said  that the government has exempted owners of tourist businesses in  Aswan from taxes for 10 years. He noted, however, that some  unreasonable requests are being made. He said many citizens  have suffered as a result of lower tourism profits.    Mubarak said although some people are disturbed by the  evident wealth of some Egyptians, one must remember that wealthy  people who invest their money in projects or spend it at hotels  and other places are actually helping to create jobs for others.  He explained that this issue must be viewed from a practical  angle, taking into account the benefit to society and Egyptian  families.    On the South African Committee meeting that President  Mubarak chaired in Harare yesterday, the president said that the  committee had met to discuss measures by which the OAU could  contribute to backing the democratic process in South Africa.  President Mubarak noted that the KwaZulu announced their  independence yesterday and that they want to set up a state  independent of South Africa, but the South African Committee in  its meeting yesterday rejected the question of KwaZulu's  independence. He noted that the final statement issued by the  committee had reaffirmed the territorial integrity of South  Africa. President Mubarak added: We will hold urgent and  extensive talks with all parties, the major states, and the  United States to assist the democratic process in South Africa  and facilitate the elections that will be held on 27 April.    President Mubarak noted that the white right-wing party  [al-hizb al-abyad al-yamini] in South Africa is pressing the  KwaZulu to create these problems, adding that urgent messages  will be sent in the next two days to resolve these problems.  President Mubarak described the results of the South African  Committee meetings as good. He noted that there was a proposal  to hold an international conference on the elections in South  Africa, but the proposal was not accepted. Besides, he added,  the people of South Africa must approve of such a conference  first. He pointed out that the elections will be held on 27  April and the South Africans do not want to postpone them,  because such a postponement would be a disaster for them and  would lead to serious consequences.    Asked if he would go to South Africa on 10 May following the  elections in his capacity as OAU chairman, the president said  that nothing has been decided yet, adding that this could be  determined after the elections. The president expressed concern  over the current events in South Africa, where some people are  sneaking their money out of the country. He noted that this  will have a very negative effect on development in South Africa  after the elections. He hoped that there would be stability in  South Africa in the coming stage and that the national forces  would avoid potential conflicts.    On the status of the KwaZulu in South Africa, President  Mubarak said that the KwaZulu have no resources, oil, or  minerals, but they are closely linked to the apartheid regime.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / BA strikes may have prolonged Virgin dispute THE PRESENT wave of industrial relations friction at British Airways seems to have played a role in the company's refusal to pay Virgin Atlantic Airways Pounds 9m in compensation to settle the dispute between the two. Mr Robert Ayling, BA group managing director, said yesterday that the airline would have had to justify such a large settlement to its staff at a time when they were being asked to make sacri-fices. 'The board of the company also has a duty to its shareholders to justify such an amount and the staff is increasingly conscious of every penny the company spends,' he added, after addressing a Financial Times aerospace conference in Paris. Mr Ayling conceded that 'people are becoming frustrated' that the dispute had not been resolved in spite of the Civil Aviation Authority's initiative to bring the two parties together. The CAA mediation attempt collapsed when Virgin insisted on a Pounds 9m cash settlement while BA wanted the dispute to go to arbitration. 'In assessing how we might settle the claims, we took account of all the potential lawsuits we might face, but we did not think that threat could begin to justify payment of Pounds 9m,' Mr Ayling said. BA had originally proposed a Pounds 9m settlement in March but subsequently withdrew the offer when Virgin decided to take further legal action against BA. BA was seeking a quick resolution to the dispute to avoid further hostile media attacks. It also sought a 'gagging clause', which was rejected by Virgin. Mr Ayling again said BA was willing to try to resolve the dispute out of court but not at any price. The threat of strike action this week at London's Gatwick airport was lifted yesterday as British Airways management reached agreement with the GMB general union over pay and conditions for white-collar workers, including flight controllers and computer staff. The agreement guarantees that no employees will be forced to transfer to a BA subsidiary and accept poorer pay or conditions. A similar dispute between the TGWU general union and BA was recently resolved.</p>

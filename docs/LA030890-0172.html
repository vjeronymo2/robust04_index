			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUFTHANSA TO BUY 26% OF EAST GERMAN CARRIER;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: SOME SAY WEST GERMANY'S INTERNATIONAL GIANT WANTS ONE DAY TO TAKE  OVER ITS COUNTERPART ACROSS THE BORDER.  </P> <P> In another move toward the reunification of Germany, the West German airline  Lufthansa said Wednesday that it plans to buy 26% of Interflug, its East German  counterpart.  </P> <P> Lufthansa Airlines spokesman Stefan Herscher said in a telephone interview from  Frankfurt that a letter of intent has been signed by the two carriers but that  a final agreement has not been reached.  </P> <P> The preliminary agreement was signed last week, he said, but details have not  been made final. Therefore, he said, such matters as the sales price could not  be disclosed.  </P> <P> The fact that the letter of intent had been signed was disclosed by Frank  Beckmann, a member of Lufthansa's executive board, at a news conference during  an international travel conference in Berlin.  </P> <P> Among other things, the agreement must be approved by a vote of the employees  of state-owned Interflug. They have been assured that none of them would lose  their jobs if Lufthansa buys a stake in their airline.  </P> <P> Herscher said many companies in both East and West Germany have wanted to  acquire partners on the other side of the border since the East German  Communist government was ousted last October. A Western-style general election  will be held in East Germany on March 18 and many contacts have been placed on  hold until after the results are known.  </P> <P> Herscher stressed that "both airlines will maintain their independence." And he  insisted that Lufthansa wants "a minority in Interflug and nothing more." The  letter of intent specifically allows Interflug to continue to develop its own  routes.  </P> <P> Some airline observers, however, maintained that Lufthansa's long-term goal is  total integration of the two carriers, which already have some marketing  agreements.  </P> <P> "This means that Lufthansa -- which has much bigger worldwide operations --  over time will absorb Interflug," said Paul Turk, an official of Avmark, an  aviation management service in Arlington, Va. "Interflug would become a  domestic German airline and Lufthansa would be the international carrier."  </P> <P> Turk reasoned that if Germany were reunited, "the country's economy would  probably not be able to support two international airlines. Lufthansa is far  stronger and has a much stronger international network and would be likely to  serve the major international routes, including those now served by Interflug."  </P> <P> Lufthansa, recognized by the crane emblazoned on the blue tail of its aircraft,  serves 178 airports in 84 countries and employs about 50,000 people. It is 51%  state-owned, with the remainder owned by shareholders and other companies. It  is Western Europe's second-largest carrier, after British Airways, and operates  160 planes. Last year, it carried 20 million passengers. It serves 12 U.S.  destinations, including Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Interflug owns 58 Soviet-made aircraft and leases three A-310 Airbuses, which  are manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a Western European consortium. Of its  Soviet-made planes, three are cargo planes and 14 are VIP craft for government  officials and thus are not used in commercial service.  </P> <P> Interflug has not operated German domestic flights since 1980.  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / The Big Lie - Inside Maxwell's Empire: Arise, King of Bulgaria - Maxwell craved international recognition. He conned presidents and bankers alike, pouring money into some of the newest, shakiest and nastiest governments. It was a fantasy world that led him to fraud ON MAY 19 1983, the Moscow streets were clear of snow after the long winter. Inside the Kremlin some of the most powerful men in the Soviet Union sat signing a document marked 'secret'. One by one, the general secretaries of the Central Committee - second in rank only to Soviet leader Yuri Andropov - solemnly scrawled their names on the closely-typed sheet of paper. They included Mikhail Gorbachev, then responsible for the party's agriculture policy, Konstantin Chernenko, who later succeeded Andropov as leader, and Nikolai Ryzhkov, later prime minister of the Soviet Union. The paper declared that the Communist party had granted an honorary doctorate from Moscow State University to Robert Maxwell for his distinction as a 'well-known specialist in the field of economics who actively campaigns for the strengthening of friendship and mutual understanding between the Soviet and English peoples'. Maxwell conned the world's presidents as well as the world's bankers. He tricked them all into believing his delusion: that he had created an empire controlling billions of dollars, entitling him to meet heads of state on equal terms. His global network of television stations, newspapers, books and electronic databases linked by the latest telecommunications was his calling card to the world's leaders. Prestige not profit appears to have been the driving force behind a lot of Maxwell's business deals. Many that he made with huge enthusiasm gave him the front page headlines he craved, but yielded little financial return. His attempt to conquer the US, the richest country in the world - spending Dollars 3bn in 1988 taking over publishing houses  - was the step that eventually brought his empire crashing. His wooing of world statesmen also intensified that year. The host of tiny exotic projects that followed drained away time and money when his empire needed it most. For the next three years his Gulfstream aircraft, restocked each day with champagne and caviar, scarcely spent a week in the same city. In his search for attention he courted some of the newest, shakiest and nastiest governments with promises of investment. Even though he delivered on only a fraction of these, he still poured tens of millions of pounds into these governments' favourite projects. The closeness of his links with some foreign ministers has led to suggestions that Maxwell was a spy. He died amid a flurry of allegations that he was an agent for Mossad, the Israeli secret service. This followed older rumours of links with the KGB. These claims remain to be proven. What is certain is that the services he performed for some governments, notably the old, hardline communist regimes, were highly questionable. Previously secret Communist party archives, declassified specially for the Financial Times, say that Maxwell regularly briefed Kremlin leaders on events in the west - including Andropov when he was head of the KGB before he became Soviet leader in 1982. Our investigations have also uncovered a pattern of favours he performed for Israeli and Bulgarian ministers. The picture that emerges from Maxwell's ceaseless foreign travel supports overwhelmingly the view of Maxwell company directors that he lost his judgment up to three years before he died. Near the end of his life, leaning out from the window of his penthouse overlooking the Old City of Jerusalem, he said: 'This is the only place I really feel at home.' Israel returned that sentiment: more than other countries it was willing to believe in him. Understanding the fraud means understanding Maxwell's fantasy. The part of Czechoslovakia in which he was born was annexed by the Soviet Union in the Second World War. His family had been annihilated, so he set about creating his own country, one that would reach every corner of the world. Maxwell could find something he enjoyed - and wanted to own - in any culture. His aides say he would also visit anywhere which promised a state reception. 'He loved the aura of the great man flying in, everyone running around,' says a former Daily Mirror executive. Maxwell hired some of the most distinguished products of the Foreign Office to act as his empire's ambassadors. These included Peter Jay, former ambassador to the US and Sir John Morgan, former ambassador to Mexico. One of the Mirror's former editors says: 'Peter Jay or Sir John Morgan would lay everything on at diplomatic level and we would take off: we'd have chauffeur-driven cars all the way; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the British ambassador would usually come to meet us.' One of Maxwell's greatest pleasures was being able to boast that he could telephone direct the president of the Soviet Union. The secret files made available to the FT portray him going to great lengths to display his sympathy for Soviet concerns: a westerner who could be trusted by the Soviet leadership. Maxwell's involvement probably Brezhnev, when he began publishing the stodgy works and hagiographies of hardline Soviet and eastern European leaders. Maxwell - who to the day of his death described himself as a socialist - warmed to the new-world rhetoric and authoritarianism of these leaders. One Kremlin file notes a conversation between Maxwell and the Soviet ambassador in London in 1985 when Maxwell had pronounced that Thatcher and the Conservatives 'could hardly' retain power after the next general election. Anxious to impress the Kremlin with his left-wing bona fides, Maxwell also told the ambassador: 'Many leading articles in the Mirror group newspapers are agreed with the leader of the Labour party, Neil Kinnock.' Victims of Maxwell's broken promises in the Soviet Union speak of him as an opportunist who used the lure of potential business projects to win Soviet attention. According to the Kremlin documents, on March 22, 1988, Maxwell was received by Alexander Yakovlev - Gorbachev's key aide and the godfather of perestroika - to discuss the publication of Moscow News in English. The project was given the green light. On October 19 1990, Maxwell finally met Gorbachev - a high point of pleasure. The very next day Maxwell executives announced they were cutting off money from the joint Maxwell-Soviet publication. The reason given was the Persian Gulf crisis - but more likely, Maxwell's ambition had been the presidential meeting, not the newspaper, and he then wanted to flex his muscles in front of Gorbachev. The Soviets found his word was not his bond - as did many others. Visiting Carlos Menem, Argentina's president, in Buenos Aires on October 20 1989, Maxwell was received like a foreign dignitary with a reception in the Gold Salon of the Foreign Ministry. No British subject had been treated that way by Argentina since the end of the Falklands War. But Argentina was emerging from a debt and inflation crisis and was desperate to bring in foreign capital. Maxwell said he wanted to buy all the papermaking plants in Argentina, rescue the near-bankrupt evening newspaper La Razon, and buy a stake in Canal 2, one of the TV stations. The president's office issued a statement several weeks later saying that the Mirror Group had invested Dollars 300,000 in La Razon and claiming that more investments would follow. However, La Razon closed within months, and Maxwell put no more money into Argentina because of his anger at its regulations against foreign control of its television companies. Just weeks before his death, in a vitriolic letter to Julio Mera Figueroa, former interior minister, Maxwell declared he would never return to Argentina. Some estimates suggest he spent up to Dollars 6m in the whole Argentine adventure. Above all else, Maxwell hated being left out. Some time after Nelson Mandela, the black South African leader, was released from jail he came to the UK and was invited to a black tie dinner at the Commonwealth Institute. Robert Maxwell was not invited. He phoned the organisers and demanded to be among the guests. When he heard nothing he turned up on the doorstep in a dinner jacket and demanded to be admitted. Once in, he barged his way to the top table and sat down next to Mandela, from where he dominated the conversation all evening. The smaller the country, the more desperate for investment, the fewer the regulations and the more naive the government, the warmer the welcome he received - at least initially. In tiny, near-bankrupt Bulgaria he found a country small enough to let him act like a king. His first 'investment' was in 1982: Pounds 5,000 in the Lyudmila Zhivkova Foundation, a charity set up to promote principles of 'truth, beauty and education'. It was named after the daughter of the communist dictator Todor Zhivkov, whose government has been widely accused of killing dissident Georgi Markov with a poisoned-tipped umbrella in 1978. Michael Tachev, since 1987 the secretary general of the foundation, which has been renamed St Cyril &amp; Methodius, shrugs when asked about Maxwell's original motives. 'Even the Mafia invest in charity to safeguard their souls,' he says. When Zhivkov was deposed in November 1989 by a 'socialist' government - the communists under a new name - Maxwell 'seemed like Santa Claus and was accepted by everyone', says Tachev. The new prime minister, Andrei Lukanov, gave Maxwell the use of two villas in a compound of luxurious diplomatic chalets near Sofia. When Maxwell and his entourage left he would often leave the phone bill to be paid by the British embassy. He scattered nearly half a million pounds on impulsive projects: a school to teach Bulgarian businessmen western methods; a few thousand invested in Balkan Films, producers of the cartoons Cuddles &amp; Orvill; and more to help the charity diversify into book printing. He gave Slavia, Bulgaria's oldest football team, Dollars 100,000 and a set of shirts emblazoned MAXWELL. He arranged it all through the Politburo. The team manager remembers: 'I suddenly got a call one day from the Politburo saying: 'Come and get these shirts - they're cluttering up our corridors.'' Most of his plans came to nothing, neither his hopes for a new Bulgarian bank, nor the scheme in April 1990 for a joint venture with Colgate Palmolive to revolutionise the Bulgarian toothpaste industry. 'The toothpaste we would have appreciated,' says a spokesman for the British embassy. In April 1990, Maxwell took Bulgarian government officials and Richard Thomas, the British ambassador, in his Gulfstream jet to survey former Communist mansions he was considering buying. He wanted to found Hollywood-on-the-Black-Sea, a film set and a resort where stars would sit drinking cocktails. 'He was thinking of people like Rod Stewart,' says one Maxwell aide. The party measured the depth of the harbour near Perla to see if the Lady Ghislaine, Maxwell's yacht, could moor there. When the medieval city Velikaturnova was pointed out to him Maxwell said: 'I'll have that one too.' At one point on the jet Thomas became concerned because Maxwell was threatening to fly to another country. The worried envoy pointed out that protocol forbade him from leaving the country without state permission. Maxwell refused to promise that the aircraft would stay in Bulgarian airspace. Nor did he promise that it would return to Sofia, so the ambassadorial Jaguar had to trace the Gulfstream's path, eventually rescuing the hapless envoy by the Black Sea. Maxwell performed at least one service that Bulgaria needed: supplying hard currency after March 1990 when Lukanov suspended payments on the country's Dollars 11bn debt and foreign capital was cut off. In mid-1990 Maxwell lent Pounds 2.1m worth of Swiss francs - a significant sum at that point in Bulgaria - to the Economic Bank, one of Bulgaria's first private banks. He also proposed to manage overseas currency reserves of around Pounds 50m for the Bulgarian central bank. Peter Jay, who negotiated the deal, denies any discomfort at dealing with the hard-line Bulgarian government. 'This, not being the Foreign Office, one wasn't provided with briefs of who these men were,' he says. Jay did not think they were doing anything that the Foreign Office would not do. 'Ambassadors have meetings with perfectly dreadful people. One might have a private desire to punch them on the nose, but etiquette prevents it.' Did Maxwell's favours go further than that? Prominent members of the United Democratic Front, the coalition which threw out the communists in October 1990, are convinced that former ministers smuggled hard currency out to western bank accounts in the months before their government fell; and some think Maxwell helped them. But the present government, in spite of its interest, has not so far identified instances of these payments, let alone proof of Maxwell's aid. Lukanov, who made frequent, discreet visits to Headington Hill Hall, Maxwell's Oxfordshire mansion - the last in August 1991 - dismisses the claims. 'For me he was an outstanding character.' Indeed, two weeks before the country's first free elections in June 1990, Maxwell jointly sponsored a Sofia pop concert for 30,000 people with the Communist party. It was taken as his endorsement of them. He wanted to get Samantha Fox, the topless model turned pop singer who was performing in a rival concert, to appear. But the plan came to nothing. At a party to celebrate his 67th birthday a few days later in Oxford, he was given a T-shirt reading King of Bulgaria and a paste crown, and was crowned King of Bulgaria. One of his executives remembers: 'His smile was ear to ear.' But even Bulgaria eventually turned against Maxwell - and he later found other doors closing on him. In France in 1987 he spent FFr750m on buying 12 per cent of TF1, the leading French TV channel, and some Pounds 10m on a stake in the Grande Arche of La Defense, the prestigious office development outside Paris. He contributed Pounds 100,000 to the Champs Elysees bicentennial July 14 parade, which gave him entry to the ministerial reception, where he spoke to President Francois Mitterand for five minutes. But he never received the recognition he felt he deserved. When, in early 1991, he was again blocked by restrictions on foreign ownership of media, he started selling his TF1 stake at a loss. Administrators of his empire, now trying to salvage money for its creditors, have found that most of his eastern European investments have been worth little more than souvenirs - the corporate equivalent of a glass paperweight with a miniature Kremlin inside. Maxwell turned finally to Israel. 'Israel was like an island, where he knew he would be loved, admired, and taken care of,' says Tommy Lapid, editorial writer on Ma'ariv - the Hebrew-language newspaper - and one of Maxwell's closest Israeli friends. Israel was Maxwell's greatest foreign success, both financially and politically - but also the country to which he felt closest. However, the country now has to explain why it gave him a funeral on the Mount of Olives, with orations by cabinet ministers. Lapid says: 'Israel has the same choice as everyone else involved in this. Either we knew, and so we were crooks, or we didn't know, and we were fools.' Maxwell's courtship with Israel was sudden. A cousin by marriage, Dov Yudkovsky, led him to Ya'acov Ne'eman, a prominent Tel Aviv lawyer. Ne'eman's firm, Herzog, Fox, Ne'eman, is chaired by Israel's president Chaim Herzog. Ne'eman led Maxwell to his first Israeli deal: paying Dollars 6.5m in August 1988 for a 26 per cent stake in Ma'ariv which was in acute need of cash. From then on Maxwell visited Israel three or four times a year, staying in Room 522 of the King David Hotel, a two-floored penthouse with gold-tapped jacuzzi. The hotel built a pad for his helicopter on the roof. He bought a string of businesses. Tel Aviv cars in 1989 carried bumper stickers reading 'Robert Maxwell - Buy Me.' Ma'ariv launched him to political as well as commercial prominence in Israel. 'We - and Ne'eman - introduced him to everyone,' says Ido Dissentchik, Ma'ariv's editor until Maxwell sacked him in 1991. Maxwell rapidly became friends with three politicians spanning the Israeli political spectrum: the liberal Shimon Peres, then finance minister of the Labour party-led government; Ehud Olmert, one of the right-wing Likud party's rising stars and currently minister of health; and the extreme right-winger Arik Sharon, then minister of industry and trade. He was particularly close to the hawkish Sharon. The two huge men would meet every time Maxwell came to Tel Aviv. Maxwell would often make the short flight south to Sharon's farm. Our investigations have also revealed that, in early 1990, at Sharon's request, Maxwell secretly loaned Dollars 1m to a group of extremist Jewish settlers to help them take over a large building in the heart of the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City. 'The money was transferred within two hours after a call from Arik Sharon,' recalls Ehud Olmert, another cabinet minister. 'It was all paid back later.' Teddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem with whom Maxwell also frequently met, denounced the action as a threat to peace, saying the damage done to fragile communal relations 'will take years to repair'. Does this depth of influence throughout Israeli society point to connections with Mossad? Olmert is vehement it does not, and a senior adviser to the Ministry of Defence, who asked not to be quoted, is strongly of the same opinion. They, and Ma'ariv directors, point out that Maxwell's unreliability and love of publicity made him an improbable spy. Maxwell entirely failed to win over the prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, himself a former Mossad agent. The two met several times - but the cautious and secretive Shamir loathed Maxwell's boasting and indiscretion. The extent of Maxwell's influence can be explained instead by his promises of money at a time when Israel was anxious for outside investment, and partly by Israeli naivety. A former aide to Peres says: 'When someone of his status in the world mentions Ronald Reagan, Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, it affects people. The size of his presence in a room, the way he spoke, created the impression that you should take notice of this guy because he could really do something for the economy.' However, he repeatedly misunderstood Israeli sensitivities. At a Ma'ariv board meeting Maxwell picked up the phone to clinch a deal with the German supplier of printing equipment. Showing off to his executives, he concluded 'and give them a discount for the Holocaust'. Dissentchik says: 'I told him: 'I am going to kill you if you don't take that back.' And he said 'Did I really say that?' He hadn't noticed.' Yet many still feel warmly about him. Lapid argues: 'He epitomised a great deal of what we admire: a Jew who survived the Holocaust, who made it.' Three months before Maxwell died, Lapid went with him to Jerusalem's Holocaust museum. 'I held him when he was shaking, crying. It is an automatic bond'. The funeral remains an embarrassment. Dissentchik argues: 'This was not the state funeral it seemed. There isn't such a thing in Israel, it's too new and too informal. The president, Herzog, went because he was president of Ne'eman's law firm, and he didn't go to the graveside, just to the memorial service in the centre of town. Sharon, Olmert and Peres went as friends. Shamir went, reluctantly.' Lapid adds: 'It came out of the drama of the situation. He wouldn't have got it if he had died after a long illness.' Peres will not discuss it, saying he finds the episode too painful. But a former aides says: 'Peres now feels he was made a fool of, that his judgment of character is dented. The funeral was clearly a terrible mistake. It is part of the price Israel pays for an absence of tradition. It will never happen again.' WHAT THEY SAID WHEN HE DIED 'Mr and Mrs Maxwell were great supporters of charity and were often present at receptions to raise money for purposes from hospitals, to children and the arts. Mr Maxwell had wide contacts throughout eastern Europe and kept me informed about what was happening in those countries and what their leaders were thinking.' Margaret Thatcher 'He was a charismatic figure who supported the European cause. In this he was a tower of strength.' Edward Heath 'Robert Maxwell brought the most tremendous flair, zest, and enthusiasm to everything he did.' Lord Callaghan 'Mr Maxwell's ebullient character was a unique part of our national scene.' Paddy Ashdown 'His tragic disappearance robs Britain of one of our most colourful and energetic figures. He was a man of action. He was truly larger than life and the world will be poorer for his absence.' Douglas Hurd 'He was a steadfast supporter of the Labour party and a man with genuine committment to the advancement of the British people. I valued his personal friendship and the fact that, even when our judgement diverged, he was always willing to sustain his enthusiasm for the Labour cause.' Neil Kinnock 'I can't believe that even the sea could overcome him. It is impossible to compare him with anybody. He was so above comparison.' Shimon Peres 'He was a great character who will be missed. I am sure he would not want us to grieve at his loss but marvel at a quite extraordinary life, lived to the full. No-one should doubt his interest in peace and his loyalty to friends.' John Major 'I knew him, especially in recent times, as a person who invested money in Israel and who put his wide contacts on the international arena at Israel's service.' Yitzhak Shamir 'The world famous publisher and personal friend. . .contributed greatly to the improvement of relations between nations in the important business of mass media management and publishing.' Mikhail Gorbachev The FT's team of journalists has interviewed more than 150 people in 13 countries. The team led by Browen Maddox included: In London: Jimmy Burns, Raymond Snoody, Robert Preston, Andrew Jack, Norma Cohen, Richard Gourlay, Daniel Green. In Jerusalem: Hugh Carnegy.

Even though the Republikaner improved their  results in their bastion Luebeck from 3.1 to 4.1 percent, only  0.5 percent of voters voted for them across the land. Thus,  Schoenhuber's party lost almost half of its voters in  Schleswig-Holstein (1990: 0.9 percent). At the Landtag  election in 1992 1.2 percent of the votes cast their votes for  the Republikaner. In general, the right-wing extremist parties  were of such little importance at these local elections because  they ran only in a few towns and districts.    Just as four years ago, the National Democratic Party of  Germany (NPD) did not play any role. The German People's Union  (DVU), which entered the Kiel Landtag with six deputies at the  previous Landtag elections, did not run for the local elections  in the first place.    The Republikaner ran only in Luebeck and in the  Rendburgs-Eckernfoerde district. The NPD ran in 23  constituencies in the Lauenburg Duchy district and received 2.8  percent of the votes there. At the communal elections in the  towns that belong to a kreis [district], the two parties did not  run at all.    In Moelln, too, where in 1992 two young men from the  skinhead  scene had killed three Turks in an arson attack, none of the  right-wing extremist parties stood for election. In 1990 the  Republikaner received 3 percent of the votes there.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Minister raps council over Tupe Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, yesterday ruled that Langbaurgh-on-Tees Borough Council, Cleveland, acted anti-competitively when it refused to disclose details of its workforce's pay and conditions to a private company bidding for a contract. The council believed the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations (Tupe) covered the contract, which meant the bidder would be obliged to accept the workforce on existing terms and conditions. But it refused to say what these were because its own workforce was bidding for the contract. It will now have to offer the contract again.</p>

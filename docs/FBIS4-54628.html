			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["G.V."-signed commentary: "Arben Xhaferi and Mendu Baci </F> Are in Tirana. Is it a Party in Exile or..."]    [Text] A PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] delegation  has been visiting Tirana for the past few days. This is the  party of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], namely one half of the  so-called radical wing based in Tetovo and led by Arben Xhaferi  and Mendu Taci.    Over these past few days, the delegation has had intensive  meetings with [Albanian Democratic Party, DP, leaders] Eduard  Selami and Tritan Shehu, with DP deputies, and perhaps with the  Albanian head of state himself, Mr. Sali Berisha, who also  received the credentials of the ambassador of the Republic of  Macedonia in Tirana during the same period.    The newspapers have written nothing at all about this  delegation. Neither the radio nor the television mentioned it.  Why? How can one explain this silence when, in the past, every  one of their visits was received with fanfares and given  detailed television coverage.    The delegation stayed in villa no. 30. Today it may have  left. Or perhaps it is still there. Who knows? The villa is  guarded by soldiers who are members of the SHiK [National  Security Service]. Or perhaps, on the way to Tetova, they are  taking a break in Durres or Pogradec, resting in the government  residential villas, as the former nomenklatura villas are called  today. In a few days' time perhaps, the newspaper of the ruling  party and the television will announce, "A friendly visit has  been paid to our country..." -- as the practice once was with  the Marxist-Leninist party groups that we nannied in secrecy so  that they could put on weight and get fat in the nomenklatura  villas in Durres, Vlore, Pogradec, and so on.    There is nothing wrong with receiving and seeing off a PDP  group. The evil lies in the silence and secrecy. It is worse if  such a thing is done at someone else's expense.</p>

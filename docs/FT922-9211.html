			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / New ferry is largest in Channel BRITTANY Ferries, the French cross-Channel ferry operator, has taken possession of the largest vessel yet to ply between the UK and France - the Normandie, weighing in at 27,000 gross tonnes (above), Richard Tomkins writes. The Pounds 80m vessel, which will make its maiden voyage on the Portsmouth-Caen route on May 18, can carry a total of 2,200 passengers and 630 cars. Built by the Kvaerner Masa shipbuilding company at its Turku yard in Finland, the ferry incorporates restaurants, bars, a children's playroom, two cinemas and a fully equipped hospital. The vessel forms part of a Pounds 350m investment programme being undertaken by Brittany Ferries on its fast-growing western Channel routes, which are less vulnerable to the threat of the Channel tunnel than the shorter routes to the east. Last month the company took possession of the 20,500 grt Barfleur, which has just gone into service between Poole and Cherbourg. This will shortly be followed by the introduction of the 31,400 grt Nils Holgersson  - one of the world's 20 largest ferries  - to the routes between Plymouth and Roscoff in Brittany and Plymouth to Santander in Spain.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Serb police break up farmers' protest SERB police have broken up a three-day road blockade by farmers demanding higher grain prices in the rump Yugoslavia, a Serbian newspaper said yesterday, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Tens of thousands of farmers in the northern Vojvodina province had blocked main roads with tractors and combine harvesters in their biggest protest in Serbia since President Slobodan Milosevic came to power in 1987. The farmers were demanding that the government peg grain prices to the D-Mark to protect them from the country's inflation, currently running at 20 per cent a day. Belgrade newspaper Borba said they were forced to lift the blockade 'under pressure by the police' late on Tuesday. But the blockade's organiser, Djordje Garabandic, said: 'This has only increased our determination. We have only temporarily suspended the blockade.' Among the roads blocked was the highway from Belgrade to Subotica on the Hungarian border, now the main route to western and northern Europe. There were no reports of violence as police broke up the protest. It was the latest in a series of actions, also involving car, metal and construction workers protesting against declining living standards due to inflation. Unions have called a general strike for August 5.</p>

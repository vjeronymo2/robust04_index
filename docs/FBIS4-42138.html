			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat  Ataman has said that the allegations to the effect that Turkey  is a party to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia "are  legally and logically invalid as well as completely unfounded."    Karen Baburyan, the acting speaker of the Armenian  parliament  [name and title as received] unilaterally declared in  Nagorno-Karabakh, told the latest issue of the weekly ROSSIYA  published in Russia that "Turkey is directly involved in the  conflict, and therefore, as a party to the conflict, must cosign  any peace agreement."    Replying to a question on the issue by an ANATOLIA  correspondent, Ataman pointed out that the UN Security Council  and the CSCE resolutions clearly cite the parties to the  conflict.    Commenting on Baburyan's allegation that "the fact that  certain Turks participate in the fighting in Azerbaijani ranks  as proof that Turkey is a party to the conflict," Ataman said:  "It is impossible to find any proof that any officers or  noncommissioned officers of the Turkish Armed Forces -- be they  on active duty or retired -- are serving at the front because  such a thing never happened. On the other hand, it has been  proven that the Armenian Republic is actively involved in the  fighting, not only through documents found on prisoners of war  but by other findings as well."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League Blames Berlusconi"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 6 -- Antonio Tajani, spokesman  for Forza Italia, in a statement reiterated that Berlusconi will  not take part in any more negotiations with "those who have  shown they do not respect alliances and agreements made before  the elections and sanctioned by voters," referring to the  Northern League.    Tajani also stressed that Berlusconi's decision to suspend  all government-formation talks with his allies of the Northern  League and the National Front was "irrevocable" and that the  ball is now in the president's court.    According to the Constitution, President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro  must name the prime minister, who in turn names his cabinet  members, but Berlusconi until yesterday was conferring with  potential government allies without waiting for a mandate from  the head of state.    Berlusconi apparently gave up trying to pave some common  ground between Bossi and National Alliance leader Gianfranco  Fini and lost his patience with Bossi's radical and  unpredictable changes in position.    Tajani in his statement conceded that "it is up to the  president to interpret the election results and issue a mandate"  to form a new government. "This is not a banana republic," said  Tajani, adding that Bossi's "unlikely and useless" negotiations  with his former arch-rivals of the Pact for Italy "only add  confusion to confusion."    But Pact leader Mario Segni denied having been contacted by  any officials of the Northern League. "I have not yet received  any phone call from Bossi, nor from any other League official,  so I cannot say when we will meet."    Segni did confirm however that he will be meeting with  League  officials but declined to reveal the agenda of the talks.</p>

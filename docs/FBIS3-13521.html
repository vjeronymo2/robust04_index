The Council of Guardians had found faults with the bill  concerning articles 52th and 53 of the Constitution. It had  also referred to some of the notes in the bill as ambiguous and  against Islamic law. According to the 53th article of the  Constitution the whole money the government gains is  concentrated in the state treasury and all payments are  performed on the basis of the approved credits and according to  the law.    Article 52 says that the country's annual budget should be  proposed by the government as stipulated by the law and should  be submitted to the Majlis for deliberations and approval. Any  change in the figures should be according to the law as well.    After the Majlis completed debates over the next year budget  bill in its open session Wednesday, the bill was sent to the  Council of Guardians for final approval. The Council, after  some study, returned the bill to the Majlis to correct the  faults.    The Majlis did some amendments to the bill in its Saturday  session but the council regarded the amendments as insufficient  and retured the bill to the Majlis for the second time.</p>

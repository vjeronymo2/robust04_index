			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Motoring: Three days of luxury and power IT WAS the motoring equivalent of dining in three-star Michelin restaurants two days running. Come to France, Chrysler-Jeep UK had said. Helicopter from Nice to Monaco, drive a four-litre Jeep Wrangler to the Carlton at Cannes for tea. Switch to a Viper for a cruise along the Promenade des Anglais and out into the Alpes Maritimes for the night. Drive the Viper to Monaco next morning for coffee then Jeep to Nice for the flight home. That was Wednesday and Thursday. Join us at Goodwood on Friday, Aston Martin had said. Try some of our latest cars on the old motor racing circuit. Stay as long as you like. Have a spot of lunch. What could one say but yes? I will come to the Jeep Wrangler in a moment. But first, the Chrysler Viper and the Aston Martin Virage, Volante and Vantage. Do not let the 'V' names confuse you. The only things they have in common are buckets of horsepower and vastly more potential performance than can possibly be used on the road. Both cars make personal statements about their owners. Aston Martin V8s are as quintessentially English and hand built as a Savile Row suit or a pair of Lobb shoes. They are for seriously rich people with a library of motor cars. People who may decide to drive the Aston Martin up to Scotland for the Glorious Twelfth because it is sportier than the Rolls-Royce and, I mean, we can always send on the luggage in the Range Rover, can't we? One feels that if Rolls-Royce had ever made a sports two-plus-two, it would have been rather like an Aston Martin Virage, Volante or Vantage. A Chrysler Viper is not like that at all. It is an outrageous car; an eight-litre, 400 horsepower, V-10 engined monster with two seats and tyres so wide they look like rubber rollers. It has the finesse of a battle tank. Even before you turn the key and set the 10 cylinders bellowing, it exudes excitement. I loved it. Traffic on the Promenade des Anglais was as free flowing as a tailback on the M25. But the Viper's clutch is miraculously light when you think of the muscle it has to transmit. The steering is generously power assisted. As an attention getter, it is unmatched. When I stopped at the lights, motor-cyclists drew alongside, workmen leaned out of vans to ask what it was, how fast it went (more than 165mph/265kph) and how much it cost (around Pounds 55,000 when it reaches Britain). The great lump of an engine is based on a truck diesel. Lamborghini (owned by Chrysler) lent a hand developing it into a petrol engine for the Viper. It has so much torque (pulling power) that for low-speed town driving, the six-speed gearbox skips second and third and goes directly from first to fourth. At 80mph (130kph) on the autoroute in sixth gear, the engine is hardly more than idling. It is not a high-tech engine; and so low stressed it should run untemperamentally for years. Driving a Viper on the road is a great experience, even though one can only scratch its potential. Having tried one a year ago on a Detroit proving ground's handling circuit, I know it sticks to the road like glue and accelerates like a rocket. But only drivers with quick reactions should give those 400 horses their heads through curves. Aston Martins, like Ferraris, are different animals when driven on circuits, not public roads full of lesser cars. A Virage, Volante or Vantage (or for that matter a Ferrari 512) feels as wide as a bus in a country lane. But it shrinks in the privacy and unlimited elbow room of a race track on which a handful of cars are all going the same way. In Park Lane or Piccadilly the rich furnishings of an Aston Martin impress. On Goodwood's short straights, fast bends and tight corners, you learn that inside all this extravagantly expensive (from Pounds 133,574 to Pounds 177,600) luxury package there is an athletic car itching to get out. All Aston Martins have 5,340 cc V8 engines with twin camshafts operating four valves per cylinder. The standard Virage hardtop coupe or Volante cabriolet do 155mph (250kph) the Vantage 170mph (274kph). I did not drive the 550 horsepower Vantage, which sounded like a low-flying aircraft as it accelerated out of the chicane. But former Grand Prix driver Peter Gethin, who gives all Vantage buyers a course of instruction at Goodwood, took me round for a few quick laps. It was not a white knuckle experience; just enjoyable, with the same tinge of apprehension one feels when putting a horse at a fence. And the leather-seated Jeep Wrangler Limited? I nearly forgot. On a hot sunny day, hood and doors off, it was great transport in the south of France. It would be, too, for extroverts in Britain, drawn by its promise of a wild blue yonder lifestyle, even if they only drive it in London SW3. It will see-off most cars up to 60mph (100kph) and felt fine, if a mite draughty, at 80mph (130kph) on the autoroute, at which there was a lot of power in hand. All this, with more off-road capability than 99 per cent of owners will ever need, for Pounds 14,995.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Treaty delay threatens jobs, says PM: Maastricht bill setback irks EC diplomats; Major to press ahead on ratification MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday warned Labour and Euro-sceptic Tory MPs that delays to ratification of the Maastricht treaty would cost British jobs as the government's defeat on Monday provoked angry recriminations within Conservative ranks. The prime minister launched his attack as the government sought to reassure its European partners that Britain would press ahead with ratification as swiftly as possible. Mr Major said: 'The treaty is in the national interest and we will pursue it.' Downing Street shrugged off as 'trivial' the 22-vote defeat on a Labour amendment but indicated government hopes of completing Maastricht's parliamentary stages this summer are receding. Ratification is expected before the parliamentary session ends in the autumn, officials said. This provoked a mixture of frustration and resignation in Brussels, with some European Community diplomats speculating about Mr Major's ability to deliver ratification. European MPs also expressed dismay over the latest delay and suggested it signalled a loss of authority on Mr Major's part. Labour's victory on Monday means a Commons 'report' stage will follow the current committee stage - injecting a delay of as much as a month. The government hopes the shock of the defeat will lead to strong pressure from local constituency associations on the rebels to force them into line. But initial soundings suggested that most of the hard-line Euro-sceptics had the tacit support of their associations. At Westminster, conflict between Conservative rebels and loyalists intensified, in spite of attempts by senior Tories to concentrate attacks on opposition parties. Tensions were exacerbated by the deals offered by the government to Welsh and Scottish nationalists in an unsuccessful attempt to buy enough votes to head off defeat. The fevered atmosphere was fuelled by confirmation that Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, had lunched recently with Mr Bryan Gould, a prominent Labour Euro-sceptic. Colleagues of Mr Portillo, seen as Thatcherite on Europe, played down the significance of the meeting, saying the two were old friends. The next twists on Maastricht are likely to centre on amendments introduced by Labour on economic and monetary union, due for debate next week, and then on Maastricht's social chapter, described by Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the Tory's backbench 1922 committee, as the 'crunch' point. In angry Commons exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major again said the social chapter would 'choke off foreign investment and destroy jobs'. But he said 'delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty would do exactly the same thing'. Tory Euro-sceptic MPs, who voted with Labour on Monday, were meeting last night to discuss tactics. Ministers and officials are not ruling out the possibility of further defeats. Labour is pledged not to back 'wrecking amendments' that could stop ratification - and its MPs are expected to reaffirm that stance at a meeting today. But there is a grey area over its social chapter amendments which are aimed at requiring the government to insert the chapter into British legislation before the treaty is ratified. In Brussels, one diplomat described Mr Major's latest setback as creating 'frustration bordering on exasperation', adding: 'This is throwing a spanner in the workings of the whole Community; we're in limbo.' But, at the same time, diplomats from large member states played down the significance of what one described as 'a procedural hiccup'. Some EC states' officials criticised Mr Major for allowing uncertainty to develop last year after Danish voters' rejection of the treaty, thereby allowing his opponents to gather strength. 'We have all had difficult political problems to resolve, but they are there to be confronted,' one diplomat said. In the European Parliament, Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, Socialist group chairman, said he was worried about Mr Major's mismanagement of the ratification process. 'I don't know whether he has control to get Maastricht through.' Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, said: 'I look forward to ratification of the treaty from the UK side, in the interest of Denmark and the rest of Europe.'

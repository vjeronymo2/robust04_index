			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Clarke lowers hopes of pre-election tax cuts Mr Kenneth Clarke has told cabinet colleagues that the government may find it impossible to make significant tax cuts before the next election. In a move to reduce expectations further after his decision this week to rule out income tax cuts in the November Budget, the chancellor of the exchequer has made clear that fiscal prudence will also take precedence in 1995 and 1996. For this year, the chancellor is preparing a broadly neutral tax package and has indicated that there is no question of a reversal of the tax increases already pending. He plans to reject the expected calls at next month's Conservative party conference to scrap the second stage of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. He is pressing also for substantial cuts in the government's spending targets to ensure that the benefits of faster growth and lower inflation are converted into a lower borrowing requirement. Mr Clarke has acknowledged that his stance will be unpopular in the short term. It will alarm the many ministers and backbench Tory MPs who believe the government cannot leave it later than next year's Budget to demonstrate its tax-cutting credentials. But the chancellor is preparing to launch an autumn campaign to persuade Tory MPs that the government's hopes of political recovery rest on delivering steady economic growth and low inflation rather than on unsustainable tax cuts. After delivering tax increases rather than the promised tax cuts after the 1992 election, Mr Clarke has made clear that the priority must be to rebuild the government's credibility with the electorate. Unless borrowing falls well below present projections, the opposition parties would find it easy to persuade the voters that any pre-election tax cuts would quickly be reversed. Colleagues believe that the chancellor still hopes that faster than expected reductions in borrowing will allow him to combine fiscal austerity with reductions in income tax before the general election, due by spring 1997. He has made clear that his decision this week to raise interest rates to pre-empt any rise in inflation will be mirrored in an equally tough fiscal stance.

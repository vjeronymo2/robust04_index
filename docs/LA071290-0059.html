			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE HOME COOK;  </P> <P> DISHES TO COOK AHEAD  </P> <P> Sometimes you need to cook ahead. Here are two great dishes for just such  times.  </P> <P> Abby's Strawberry Sherbet can be made days, even a week, ahead and then be kept  securely in the freezer. The Italian Custard Sandwich can be made the day  before and then needs only to be baked and browned before serving.  </P> <P> In its prior life, the Italian Custard Sandwich was known as strada or cheese  pudding. It was wildly popular during the '40s because it was easy and  inexpensive to make, besides lending itself to many variations. This is a sort  of spinoff from the casserole days, when I ate some surprising mixtures that  are best forgotten. In any case, mushrooms, onions and cheese would work well  for this dish, as would bacon crumbled with peppers and cheese. Cheese does  seem to be a basic to the sandwich, but I'm sure even that could be changed.  </P> <P> To appreciate Abby's sherbet, you will have to make it. It is outstanding. It  can also be made with other fruits -- pears, peaches, apricots and mango. The  key to this sherbet is to freeze pieces about the size of half a strawberry  until rock hard. It is best to let the fruit stay overnight in the freezer. The  other critical step is to process the mixture until it tastes creamy.  </P> <P> ITALIAN CUSTARD SANDWICH  </P> <P> 8 slices white bread, crusts removed  </P> <P> 2 cups shredded Fontina cheese  </P> <P> 6 eggs  </P> <P> l 1/2 cups milk  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter  </P> <P> Place 4 slices bread in bottom of buttered shallow (about 2 inches deep) baking  dish. Sprinkle Fontina cheese evenly over bread. Place remaining 4 bread slices  on top.  </P> <P> Beat eggs lightly in large bowl. Stir in milk, salt and pepper until well  blended. Pour milk mixture over sandwiches. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over top.  Refrigerate 1/2 hour before baking or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate  overnight.  </P> <P> Bake custard sandwiches at 350 degrees 20 to 25 minutes, or until center is  barely set. Remove from oven.  </P> <P> Melt butter in large skillet over medium-low heat. Using spatula, remove each  sandwich and place in skillet.  </P> <P> Heat until lightly browned, about 2 minutes on each side. Cut in half  diagonally. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Serve with prosciutto, olives, sliced tomatoes and Italian parsley, or  melon slices and fresh fruit.  </P> <P> ABBY'S FRESH STRAWBERRY SHERBET  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups strawberries, hulled and halved  </P> <P> 2 to 6 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon egg white or 2 tablespoons plain yogurt  </P> <P> Spread strawberries in single layer on baking sheet. Freeze until solid or rock  hard, preferably overnight.  </P> <P> Place berries in food processor with sugar to taste. Pulse machine on and off  until berries are minced into tiny pieces. Scrape down sides of processor with  spatula once or twice.  </P> <P> Add egg white or yogurt and process at least 2 minutes or longer, until sherbet  is completely smooth, creamy in texture and lighter in color. Serve  immediately, or freeze well-covered until needed. Makes 1 pint.  </P> <P> Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S. Department of  Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of food-borne illness and  recommends that diners avoid eating raw eggs. Commercial egg substitutes may be  used in place of raw eggs in certain circumstances. Check egg substitute  package for applications.  </P></p>

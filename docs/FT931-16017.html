			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Gas power plants 'may be barred' INDEPENDENT power generators fear the government will try to widen the market for coal by blocking plans to proceed with gas-fired power station projects as part of its energy review. Mr David Lewis, vice-president of business operations at Enron Europe, the UK arm of the US utility company, said: 'We were given some assurances . . . that the government would leave gas alone, but what we're now hearing suggests it could take some radical steps with gas.' Mr Lewis is concerned that Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will block power stations that have not yet received government approval. He also fears the government might call a halt to stations that have been approved but where construction has not yet begun. This could affect about six planned gas-fired power stations, including one at Connah's Quay, Clywd. The Department of Trade and Industry said: 'Technically it is possible to reverse consents given to power projects but it would be very difficult.' Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive of Monument Oil and Gas, a partner in the project to supply the Connah's Quay station, said: 'We've already spent about Pounds 75m to Pounds 100m on the project, but because of the uncertainty surrounding Connah's Quay we're looking at cancelling orders we've placed.' Hamilton Oil and Gas, the US company involved in Connah's Quay, has laid off about 400 people among its contracting teams because of doubt over whether the scheme will be approved. Mr Lewis said: 'It will be a serious blow to the independent power sector if the government blocks these gas stations. We don't invest in other parts of the world because this sort of thing happens and we'd have to ask questions about future investment in the UK.' Enron's 1,875MW gas-fired station on Teesside will be the second independent generating project to become operational when it starts production in April. The company is also involved in negotiations about becoming a partner in at least three other gas-fired stations. However, Mr Lewis said there is a stand-off between developers in the power projects and power customers as they await the outcome of the energy review.</p>

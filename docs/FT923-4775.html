			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Magnesium bicycle peddles in from sea Norsk Hydro - the world's largest producer of magnesium - has branched out into the bicycle business. Kirk Precision, part of Norsk Hydro and the brainchild of engineer Frank Kirk, has spent 10 years pioneering high-pressure, high-temperature die-casting of magnesium alloys. The process allows a lightweight bicycle frame to be made in just four seconds from the biggest die-casting machine in the world. Magnesium alloys for bicycle frames offer several advantages over other metals: they are one-third lighter, corrosion free, strong and environmentally friendly. The 2.5kg of magnesium required for each frame can be extracted from 1.5 cubic metres of sea water, and if the frame was returned to the sea it would eventually dissolve back to its original state. The company's mountain bike was voted 'Off Road Bicycle of the Year' in Japan. Racing and city bikes are to be launched early next year. Kirk Precision: UK, 071 222 7541.</p>

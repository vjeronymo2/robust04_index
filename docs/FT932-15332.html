			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Letter: Technically superior economic model - but of little benefit Sir, According to Jeremy Bray (Letters, April 7), 'Despite ill-informed press criticism, economic modelling practices in the UK are in most respects technically well ahead of those in the US' - the result, apparently, of the 'econometric methods developed by Prof David Hendry'. Ahead of the US or not, Prof Hendry's technical advances have not resulted in any detectable improvement in the ability of the large-scale models developed under this influence to make accurate forecasts. Nor has there been any increase, flowing from best practice econometrics, in the understanding of how modern industrial economies function as systems. So what, usefully, can it mean to say we are 'technically well ahead' of the US? In my view, adverse press comment on the performance of the relevant models (not only the Treasury's model, but those of the London Business School and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research) has not been 'ill-informed' at all. It has been fully justified by the deplorable, and extremely damaging, way in which public discussion, not to mention governments, have been misled by these monsters.

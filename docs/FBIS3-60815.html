			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dieter Rulff report: "Murder Under the Eyes of the </F> Intelligence Service"; spelling of all Iranian names as  published]    [Text] Berlin -- It goes to the lasting credit of Heinz  Annussek, head of the Berlin Land Office for the Protection of  the Constitution, that the debate about security policy in  Germany has been supplemented with the "practicing terrorist."  Speaking to the "Mykonos" Investigation Committee of the  Chamber of Deputies, he used this description to make a fine  differentiation regarding the dangerousness of Iranian Kazem  Darabi. Darabi is currently on trial at the Berlin Higher Court  for having been, as an agent of the Iranian intelligence service  VEVAK, the wire puller of the attack which killed four leading  Kurdish-Iranian opposition politicians on 17 September 1992.  According to Annussek's assessment after the deed, his office  considered Darabi worth being watched before the attack, but he  had not been assessed as a "practicing terrorist" -- that is why  his observation was ignored for months. Eckart Werthebach, head  of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution  [BfV], also did not have "such an assessment of Darabi as a  dangerous terrorist" until the day of the attack.    In the meantime, doubts about this assessment of the  situation by the security organs are mounting. The security  organs might have come to different results and could have  protected Sadegh Sharafkandi, chairman of the Democratic Party  of Kurdistan in Iran, and his three associates better if they  had better coordinated and exploited their own sources. Thus,  as early as on 16 April 1992 Kazem Darabi's foreigner's file was  "urgently" requested by the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations [BKA]. According to a BKA letter, which has been  obtained by DIE TAGESZEITUNG, at that time the officials were  investigating, upon request by the chief federal prosecutor,  several persons "on the suspicion of attempting to bring about a  dynamite explosion and of attempted murder." The chief federal  prosecutor's office did not want to tell DIE TAGESZEITUNG about  the background of the investigations, but the fact that Darabi's  foreigner's file was requested leads to the conclusion that he  was considered a suspect by the investigators. At this time his  foreigner's file was checked in the Senat's internal  administration, but none of the officials involved suspected  anything as a result of the request.    In the Committee Greens Deputy Renate Kuenast is trying to  clarify the background of a BfV report, according to which at  the beginning of 1992 several persons, including a Kazem D., in  a Hamburg mosque prepared attacks on Israeli institutions in the  FRG.    The curiosity of Kuenast's colleague from the Free  Democratic  Party of Germany, Rolf-Peter Lange, is also directed at a list  with about a dozen names of persons who were classified by the  BKA as dangerous in the field of foreigners' extremism in  Germany at the same time; this list once again included Darabi.  Even though the BfV told their colleagues in Berlin already in  January 1992 that they had suspended the monitoring of Darabi's  telephone and had recommended that the Land Office initiate  operative measures, these measures were not initiated.  Allegedly, it was impossible to find an interpreter who spoke  Persian. Telephone monitoring was approved only two weeks after  the attack.    However, even during this "security gap" in the months  before  the attack, the scene did not remain unobserved, as it has  turned out now. In an internal note to the chief federal  prosecutor (Az.: VC 11-247-S-350 070/93), the BfV reports: "In  addition to Darabi and his Berlin scene, members of the Iranian  intelligence services were also directly involved in the  preparations for the attack. Thus, members of the Iranian  intelligence services were in Germany before the attack and  spied out the site of the attack as well as escape routes."    The eight-page document by the BfV also reports on the  intensive contacts that Darabi cultivated with Iranian diplomats  in Germany. Thus, he had ties to Hassan Djavady, who worked at  the Iranian Embassy in Bonn until October 1989. According to  the note, he is "an employee of the Iranian intelligence service  MOIS, who was responsible in the FRG for, among other things,  the observation and spying out of the Iranian opposition."  According to BfV findings, this task was "taken over by MOIS  employee Morteza Gholami, who works at the Iranian Embassy in  Bonn." In addition, Darabi also has contact with members of the  Iranian intelligence service in Berlin. As the BfV noted, on 24  April 1991 Darabi received "the order by Consul Mahmud  Amani-Farani, who works at the Iranian Consulate General in  Berlin, to collect information about a member of the  `Association of Kurdish Students Abroad.'" Because of this  spying order, the BfV think that "one has to assume" that  Aman-Farani "is also working for an intelligence service."  "Apart from the consul general," Aman-Farani is Darabi's most  important contact in the Iranian Consulate General.    According to findings by the Iranian opposition alliance  "National Resistance Council," the Iranian intelligence service  has meanwhile found ways to keep in regular contact with Darabi  in prison. This week Javad Dabiran, the spokesman of the  Resistance Council, voiced a number of accusations against  individual diplomats. According to Dabiran, he wants to give  the missing evidence for these accusations to the German  security authorities. As Dabiran said, the wire pullers are  sitting on the third floor of the Iranian Embassy in Bonn, where  there is the department of the VEVAK intelligence service.  Until two weeks ago, this department was headed by Alireza  Haghighian, who, camouflaged as an Embassy attache, is the  highest-ranking VEVAK agent in Germany. In the meantime, he has  returned to the intelligence service headquarters in Tehran. In  addition, Dabiran accuses two Embassy second secretaries, Ali  Dschafari Meschki and Hamidreza Ghalibaf, of having "dealt  intensively," as VEVAK agents, "with the case (of the Mykonos  murder -- the editor)" over the past weeks.    The opposition politician claims that one of the agents who  are responsible for keeping contact with Darabi is a certain  Farhad D. Already in 1982 D. was involved, together with  Darabi, in an attack on opposition students in Mainz; according  to BfV findings, he has "ties with the Iranian intelligence  service." Together with Bahman B., the two are "among the  leading functionaries of the `Union of Islamic Students in  Europe [USIA].'" The USIA is a "collection pond of the  followers of the Iranian regime in the European countries."  According to the BfV report, B. has worked "for the Iranian  intelligence service MOIS" since about 1989. His wife  reportedly works at the Iranian Consulate in Berlin.    These intensive activities of the Iranian diplomats were  probably not unknown to State Minister in the Chancellor's  Office Bernd Schmidbauer, the supreme head of the German  intelligence services. According to Dabiran's assessment, the  "Mykonos" case played a decisive role in Schmidbauer's  contentious talk with his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Fallahian.  Actually, on Thursday Schmidbauer should have answered  questions of the Investigation Committee about the role that the  "Mykonos" case played in his contacts with Iran. However, the  appointment was canceled, since he had allegedly not yet  received permission by the Cabinet to make a statement. Another  appointment for questioning him has now been made for January.</p>

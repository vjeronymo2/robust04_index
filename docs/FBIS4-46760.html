			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. Ryazhentsev, under the rubric "Looking to </F> the Upcoming Session of the Republic Supreme Soviet":  "Guarantees for Investors Are Guarantees of Success in  Attracting Foreign Capital to Priority Sectors of the Uzbekistan  Economy"]    [Text] The draft Law on Foreign Investment and  Guarantees for the Activity of Foreign Investors is being  broadly discussed in Uzbekistan business circles. There is great  interest in it.    There is, of course, a Law on Foreign Investment in  effect in our republic. What is new and different in the  proposed draft law? This was the subject of our conversation  with S. Kh. Abdurakhimov, chief of the Administration of  Analysis and Expert Examination of Investment Plans of the  National Bank of Foreign Economic Activity, and Sh. A.  Ishankhodzhayeva, chief of the financial-economic analysis  department of this institution.    "If we provide reliable guarantees for the activities of  foreign investors," says Saidakbar Khodzhiakbarovich, "then you  can say that we will open up a broad way into our republic for  foreign capital. There is a distinction here between the  already-mentioned draft law and the present one. The draft law  put the very important point about guarantees for the activity  of foreign investors in a special heading.    "To understand the essential features of the proposed draft  law better it has to be viewed together with the other laws,  draft laws, and governmental directives concerning questions of  foreign investment in the economy. Above all I would like to  recall the recent decree of the Cabinet of Ministers entitled  'Measures To Ensure Insurance Protection for Investments in the  Republic of Uzbekistan,' under which the Uzbekinvest National  Insurance Company is formed. Its assets will be placed in  first-class foreign banks. This will provide a reliable  guarantee of insurance coverage for foreign and domestic  investments.    "In the present state of the reforms it is especially  important for this insurance company to cover political risks.  Incidentally, it is precisely political stability that attracts  foreign investors to our republic. The investor must be  absolutely confident that he will be able to recover the capital  invested in the matter with profit under any conditions,  independent of the current political situation. For our  partners, therefore, the formation of Uzbekinvest opens great  prospects. A business can be promoted confidently, in complete  safety. After all, although Uzbekinvest is a state company, its  insurance fund can be used at the stipulated moment for  insurance payments to investors at the decision of the  supervisory council, formed of the managers of first-class banks  in various countries.    "In this way a reliable protective mechanism is created, a  system to insure property against expropriation and also against  any kind of administrative measures that harm the interests of  investors."    "It must be said," Shakhnoz Agzamovna Ishankhodzhayeva  continues the conversation, "that the draft Law on Foreign  Investment and Guarantees of the Activities of Foreign Investors  gives clear definitions of the meaning of foreign borrowing and  investment and a classification of foreign debts, government  guarantees, and the like. And here is what I would like to note.  During discussion of the most recent version of this draft law  there were significantly fewer criticisms, which indicates good  cooperation between the authors of the law and the consultants  from interested departments.    "For example, questions related to foreign investment are  today regulated by a whole set of legislative acts. But there  was no bankruptcy law. The investor, though, must know exactly  the conditions under which an economic unit or natural person  can be judged bankrupt on a legal basis. And here the draft Law  on Bankruptcy proposed to the session has a definition of the  elements of bankruptcy. Civil liability is stipulated for  persons whose improper actions lead to bankruptcy. Thus, the  draft laws submitted for the session are one more practical step  by us on the path to creating a market economy. After all, the  set of laws and draft laws that are already in effect are  directed to creating favorable conditions for the production of  export products that meet the highest world standards and to  creating a protective mechanism for investors."    Because the National Bank of Foreign Economic Activity  specialists took an active part in preparing the draft laws on  foreign investment, I asked them to talk about some of the  specific details which, if it can be put this way, have created  obstacles in practical affairs. And I learned that it was in  fact the bank specialists who proposed creating conditions to  increase the flow of cash for investment projects during the  period of credit repayment. They consistently defend the need to  create conditions for investors so that the profit norm in our  country is better not only for foreign entrepreneurs but also  for domestic ones.</p>

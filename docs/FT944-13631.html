			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK traffic growth curb urged by commission A radical overhaul of Britain's transport policies to curb ever-growing road traffic was called for yesterday by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. In a long-awaited, 300-page report, the commission said Britain's present approach to transport was unsustainable, and urgent action - including a doubling of petrol tax and a halving of spending on new main roads - was needed to avoid unacceptable levels of environmental damage in the early decades of the next century. The report contains 110 recommendations, the main thrust being to load costs on to road transport and encourage a shift to public transport and 'green' modes such as cycling and walking. It also calls for more effective planning to reduce the need for transport, tougher controls on vehicle pollution and greater regard for the environment in the design of transport schemes. However, it emphasises that policies should provide for the car. The report received a guarded welcome from the government, whose policies are challenged by most of the main conclusions. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said: 'I welcome this report as an important contribution to the broader debate which I want to encourage on how we are going to balance the economic benefits and personal freedom that roads can bring with the need for environmental protection.' Among the main proposals are: Halve spending on motorways and other main roads to allow a near doubling of public transport investment. Double the price of motor fuel in real terms by 2005. That would raise industry's costs by 1 per cent over the next 10 years. Agree tighter European Union emission limits for all new vehicles. Increase excise duty on heavy vehicles according to the level of emissions they produce. Ban super unleaded petrol. Reduce petrol's permitted benzene content because of fears about its cancer-causing effects. The report, by 16 scientists and environmental experts, takes as its basis the government's commitment to environmentally sustainable economic growth. The overall aim is to limit traffic growth to 10 per cent a decade and to reduce the environmental impact of journeys. With 20m vehicles already on Britain's roads and traffic levels forecast to double by 2025, current high levels of road building will not stop congestion worsening, the commission says. It urges total spending on public transport of Pounds 4.5bn a year but says higher fuel duties would raise Pounds 6.5bn while cuts in the roads programme would yield a further Pounds 1.5bn. It recommends 'demanding but achievable' targets for improving air quality, reducing road deaths and noise and switching travel from roads to other means. The Environment Department is pleased with the main thrust of the report. The commission - unusually - is a permanent body which has produced a series of weighty reports since being set up in 1969. Its studies of nuclear power and diesel emissions influenced government policy. Yesterday's recommendations were criticised by business and motoring organisations, while environmental and pro-rail groups welcomed its the findings. Greenpeace said it was 'a watershed in the battle against subsidised pollution'.</p>

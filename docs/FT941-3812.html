			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Israel-PLO talks likely to resume soon: Intensive US diplomatic efforts near to bearing fruit Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday edged towards resuming peace talks amid intensive US diplomatic efforts, as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, prepared to fly to Washington. 'Negotiations are about to be resumed,' said Mr Yossi Sarid, Israel's environment minister. Mr Sarid said he hoped official talks would begin at the end of this week and urged the PLO not to set pre-conditions but to bring their demands to the negotiations. However, a PLO official in Tunis described the Israeli remarks on early resumption of talks as 'very optimistic'. The PLO suspended talks two weeks ago after the massacre of some 30 Palestinians by a Jewish settler in Hebron. Mr Sarid's comments came after an Israeli delegation led by Mr Uri Savir, Foreign Ministry director general, met Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in Tunis to detail Israel's response to PLO demands on security for Palestinians in the occupied territories. Officials said Mr Arafat demanded the deployment of an international force in the territories to safeguard Palestinian security, and the swift conclusion of negotiations on Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Mr Arafat also asked Israel to name a date when he and his senior colleagues could return to take up residence in Jericho. Mr Dennis Ross, US Middle East envoy, and Mr Terje Roed Larsen, a Norwegian mediator, also met Mr Arafat and senior PLO officials in Tunis yesterday to try to save the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. PLO officials in Tunis described the meeting as 'crucial', and said they expected Mr Ross to hold a second meeting with Mr Arafat later last night. The PLO has said it will not return to formal peace talks until the US and Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, guarantee implementation of a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre and calling for measures to protect Palestinian lives. The vote on the UN resolution, due last night, was yesterday postponed for the fourth time by the Security Council, without explanation. Before departing for Washington, Mr Rabin said: 'I believe we will put the peace negotiations back on track. Those who want peace have to know how to overcome painful events.' His government also stepped up the crackdown on extremist Jewish groups banned and branded terrorists by the cabinet on Sunday. Israeli police raided the homes of settlers in the heart of Hebron, confiscating weapons and issuing arrest orders. Police officials said 23 movement restriction warrants would be served on followers of the two anti-Arab groups - Kach and Kehane Lives - which advocate violence against Palestinians. Observers said Mr Rabin was determined to have the crackdown under way before arriving in Washington, where he may face pressure from US officials to do more to rein in militant Jewish settlers. Mr Rabin is also likely to come in for criticism for the continuing aggressive settlements policy of Jews in what the government calls 'Greater Jerusalem' but which is actually part of the occupied West Bank. More than 206,000 Jews have now settled in Arab East Jerusalem and the settlements considered part of 'Greater Jerusalem', outstripping the Palestinian population.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POST OFFICE BRACES AS STRIKE AT UNITED PARCEL IS FEARED;  </P> <P> MAIL: OFFICIALS SAY THE SYSTEM CANNOT ASSUME THE WHOLE UPS LOAD. A CONTINGENCY  PLAN WOULD LIMIT PACKAGES SHIPPED.  </P> <P> The U.S. Postal Service, bracing for a potential strike at United Parcel  Service, Tuesday announced contingency plans that officials hope will avoid  disruption of first class mail if a truckers' union walks out after expiration  of its contracts next week.  </P> <P> The plan assumes disruption for large shippers and is designed to limit the  number of parcels individual mailers can drop off each time they visit a post  office. In addition, the Postal Service said that it will deliver some packages  only if they are first somehow shipped to a post office within the recipient's  city.  </P> <P> Moreover, the service said, there could be delays in its second-day mail  delivery service, perhaps by a day or more.  </P> <P> The Postal Service announcement followed the release of a letter from UPS  officials to more than 1 million of its regular customers, warning them of  possible service disruptions after July 31 should the International Brotherhood  of Teamsters reject the UPS contract offer.  </P> <P> Voting on the contract is under way and a count is expected next week, said a  Teamster official, who added that the union leadership opposes the contract  offer.  </P> <P> UPS said that packages scheduled for delivery after July 31 "could, in the  event of a work stoppage, be subject to a considerable delay."  </P> <P> Michael Coughlin, deputy postmaster general, said that the Postal Service is  worried that its regular mail service could become paralyzed if a Teamsters'  strike dumps UPS' daily packages on the nation's post offices. Even with the  advance plans, "there's no way the Post Office can absorb UPS' operations," he  said.  </P> <P> UPS currently handles 10 million packages daily -- 20 times more than the  500,000 packages delivered daily by the Postal Service. UPS also delivers  300,000 overnight packages, a third more than the government service.  </P> <P> The Postal Service, however, continues to hold a 3-1 lead in two-day delivery  parcels.  </P> <P> Under the Post Office's contingency plan, shippers with five or more packages  would have to call a toll-free, 800 number to find the post office within the  ZIP code area where the deliveries are to be made. For example, if a mail-order  company wanted to send a dozen packages from its warehouse in Maine to  customers in Southern California, the company is likely to be told that it must  arrange to leave the packages at a designated post office within the Los  Angeles area.  </P> <P> "The responsibility of getting the parcel to the (designated post office)  location is the shipper's responsibility," Coughlin said, adding that postal  officials will meet today with trucking companies and other freight forwarding  firms to coordinate their plan with their operations.  </P> <P> Postal officials, who are monitoring the volume of packages coming from large  shippers, said that they would decide by Friday whether to institute the plan.  </P> <P> Parcels in groups of four or less would continue to be accepted, as usual, at  any post office. Similarly, there would be no restriction placed on paid  overnight or first-class mail delivery.  </P> <P> "These rules will not affect the American consumer or small businesses which  mail two or three packages a day," said Azeezaly S. Jaffer, a Postal Service  spokesman. "The real focus is on the big shipper."  </P> <P> Teamsters struck UPS operations in 15 states in 1977, a company official said,  noting that the shipping firm's national operations have never been curtailed  by labor problems.  </P></p>

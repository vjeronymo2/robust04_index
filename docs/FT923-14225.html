			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Private surge in Indonesian power sector - Jakarta opens to foreign capital, but experts warn contracts taking too long INDONESIA has taken the first steps towards private participation in its power sector. But industry experts say negotiations on new projects will need to be speeded up if the country is to avert an electricity crisis. The state utility PLN has more than doubled installed capacity in the past decade to more than 9,000MW. Demand, however, is growing at 10 per cent a year, and the government plans to double capacity again within eight years. To meet the target, about Dollars 30bn of investment is required by the year 2000. Neither the government nor donors such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank can fully fund the programme. The government is looking for up to a third of the investment to come from the private sector and, under advice from the donors, is set to break PLN's monopoly over power generation for the national grid. The government this year ended a protracted period of negotiations with foreign companies by asking Mission Energy of the US to lead a consortium to build, own and operate a 2,400MW coal-fired Paiton project in East Java. In 1990, as the first step toward private participation, the government offered four 600MW units at the Paiton complex. Companies owning the units would get a return on their investment under a tariff structure agreed with PLN for the supply of electricity. At first the government invited private proposals for two of the units, and a short-lived consortium of Hopewell Group of Hong Kong and the Bimantara Group, led by President Suharto's second son, first studied the project in 1990. Hopewell pulled out and Bimantara switched allegiance to Intercontinental Electric Inc (IEI) of the US which, Indonesian government officials say, received a Dollars 500,000 grant from the US government towards a feasibility study. A second consortium was formed, led by Mission Energy and including Mitsui of Japan, General Electric of the US and Batu Hitam Perkasa, an Indonesian coal mining company led by Mr Hashim Djojohadikusomo. The consortia made preliminary proposals last September for construction of the two units at a cost of up to Dollars 2.5bn. Then, in mid-October, the government unexpectedly awarded IEI an exclusive right to continue negotiations. The decision triggered alarm among some donors who said that the government had failed to evaluate fully the two proposals. In a recent report on Indonesia, the World Bank said that the key issues raised by the project have been 'allowing adequate competition in bidding; putting in place transparent procedures for bid evaluation; applying sound principles in bid selection.' By December, the government, under pressure from the donors, had compromised and informed Mission Energy that it should prepare a proposal for the remaining two 600MW units. Industry officials, however, said that the prospect of the complex having different designs, suppliers and operators threatened to undermine its viability. 'The project is too large, and, with all the politics, everyone wants a piece,' complained an executive of one company involved in the project. The government changed its mind again in May. In a meeting with IEI and Mission Energy, it said that it wanted just one consortium to build all four units and expressed a clear preference for Mission Energy. While both consortia were hopeful of raising the required finance, the government said that Mission Energy had a superior technical proposal and that the consortium members were better able to provide equity. The cost of Mission Energy's proposal per pair of units is estimated at about Dollars 1.8bn. The government has suggested that Mission Energy might take on board some members of the rival consortium, including suppliers such as Westinghouse and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. Government officials say that Bimantara is negotiating with Batu Hitam Perkasa and is asking for up to a 10 per cent equity stake in the project. Finalising the consortium might entail vexed negotiations and additional suppliers will require a new design for the plant. As one government official noted, the project 'cannot accommodate all these firms. It's just too crowded.' The complex is still to be built in two stages - the consortium will have a first option on the second stage - and detailed discussions are expected to begin in August, with the contract to be signed by April. Much depends on the government finalising conditions such as the tax regime under which the plant will operate. While the length and manner of negotiations have shaken the confidence of the private sector, this could be restored if the deal is quickly concluded and the first stage is completed as planned by 1997.</p>

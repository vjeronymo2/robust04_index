			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker deeper in loss at Pounds 387m MR KEN Scobie, chief exec-utive of Brent Walker, said that yesterday's results were not as bad in cash terms as they looked. Although there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 387.2m (Pounds 122.7m), Pounds 157.8m of the Pounds 235.8m interest charge was converted into term debt. The interest charge reflected the impact of higher interest rates imposed by the banks and a full year of borrowings taken on in 1990. Also the profits were struck after provisions for the fall in value of properties and other assets of Pounds 142.5m (Pounds 97.7m). However, the group has not written down the value of Pounds 1.1bn of property assets which are being retained for the long term. These would be worth 'significantly' less if they were revalued now but the directors do not expect the fall in value to be permanent. Group sales were 10 per cent lower at Pounds 1.58bn and operating profits were down 55 per cent to Pounds 48.4m. After tax of Pounds 7.26m (Pounds 19.8m) there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 216m) relating to businesses being sold. The William Hill betting division suffered a fall in sales from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.4bn, which Mr Scobie said was a remarkably good performance given the chain's bias towards the south east of England. However, a fall in turnover has a geared effect onoperating profits, he said, which fell from Pounds 57.1m to Pounds 45.4m. William Hill had had a better start to the current year, he said. Sales by the public houses division fell from Pounds 139.8m to Pounds 124.2m and profits from Pounds 20m to Pounds 13.4m. Within that the Pubmaster chain of pubs held its profits but other businesses weakened. Mr Scobie said he expected the chain to total 3,000 pubs by the end of this year, and he had a longer-term aim to reach 4,000 or 4,500. Rapid improvements in trade were being seen in pubs which had been refurbished. Profits from other activities, such as property development, were Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 34.9m). The group said its claim for a substantial cut in the price of William Hill, which it bought from Grand Metropolitan in 1989 for Pounds 685m, had now gone to an independent expert. Brent Walker has still not paid the final Pounds 50m of the purchase price which is accruing interest. The group is preparing its accounts on a going concern basis. This depends on Grand Metropolitan not demanding payment in full of the Pounds 50m and interest, and on the group operating within the terms set by its banks in the restructuring.</p>

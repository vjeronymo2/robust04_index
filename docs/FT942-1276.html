			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (1): Looking beyond Suharto's era - Indonesia is a stable country with a steadily-growing economy. Uncertainty, however, now surrounds the succession With President Suharto at the helm of power over the past 27 years, stability has been the predominant characteristic of Indonesian politics and economics. Now in his sixth term as president, however, Mr Suharto is giving increasingly frequent hints that he plans to make this term his last as head of state - although he remains as reluctant as ever to name a successor. Like the traditional wayang, a theatrical performance where shadow images are held in front of back-lit screens, Indonesian politics is not transparent and nothing is clear-cut. It is difficult to gauge Mr Suharto's intentions, as it is certainly not the first time since he took power that he has hinted that he may step down. And yet Indonesians are attaching more significance now to suggestions that he is planning an exit than they have done in the past. Mr Suharto will be 77 when his term ends in 1998 and there are signs that the jockeying for power has already begun. The uncertainty is making some investors jittery. Perhaps in recognition of this, during the last year Mr Suharto has opened the doors just a little to demands for increased political openness, although direct criticism of his family's wide-ranging business interests and monopolies remains off limits in the domestic press. It will require some skill to balance stability with openness. Indonesia is a huge country. Its 13,000 islands extend 5,000 km from one end to the other and its 187 million inhabitants include hundreds of different ethnic groupings and make it the fourth most heavily populated country in the world. The labour riots in the northern Sumatran town of Medan earlier this year, where demonstrators ran amok, protesting against their ethnic Chinese employers' unwillingness to adhere to a 46 per cent increase in the minimum wage, reminded many people of how things can go wrong. The ethnic Chinese are estimated to control some three quarters of Indonesian private capital - although they make up only a tiny 2 per cent of the country's population - and they are resented on this account. Indonesia's ethnic Chinese, after years of being criticised for dominating local businesses, are now being scorned for investing in China instead of Indonesia, although much of the money channelled to projects in China is already held offshore in Hong Kong or Singapore. That criticism comes after domestic and foreign investment declined last year amid stiff competition for foreign funds in neighbouring Asian countries. According to Mr Hartarto, the co-ordinating minister for trade and industry, deregulation of the economy has taken on a sense of urgency. 'We have to change,' he says. Change is taking place. In June this year a radical deregulation package for foreign investment was introduced and a trade deregulation package will follow. The government has said it needs Dollars 300bn to meet its investment requirements, both domestic and foreign, for its new five-year development plan - the sixth of its kind. More than two-thirds of that total will have to come from the private sector. An increase in investment is also needed to maintain the momentum of growth in the economy - growth which has averaged 6 per cent a year over the past 25 years. The latest deregulation package comes on the heels of one of the biggest corruption scandals in Indonesia's history since independence, as the drive for political openness prompted Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the minister of finance in President Suharto's cabinet, to expose the extent of bad loans at state banks. The Bapindo banking scandal, which involved an ethnic Chinese businessman defaulting on loans received on recommendations made by former cabinet ministers, did little to help investors' confidence in the country - although the revelations have highlighted Mr Muhammad's commitment to cleaning up the state banking sector. None the less, this corruption case is symbolic of the problems that beset the Indonesian economy. Foreign investors say they must struggle against a stubborn bureaucracy and against corruption. These handicaps have earned Indonesia a reputation for having some of the highest hidden business costs in Asia. Government officials do not deny that there is a problem, but they promise that deregulation packages, scheduled to appear in the near future, will deal with it. Another economic policy issue is the debate hotting up in the Indonesian government between 'technocrats' and 'technologists'. Technocrats, who have steered Indonesia's economy down a path of export-led growth, are constantly battling with technologists, who are led by the country's enthusiastic minister for research and technology, Mr B J Habibie. Technocrats want to maintain austere budgetary policies after the budget deficit widened significantly last year. Technologists want the state to pump billions of dollars into heavy industry projects - such as, for example, aircraft manufacturing - which critics say are not making adequate commercial returns. At the same time, there is growing concern that the benefits of export-led economic growth are not filtering down to the country's poor, an argument sometimes used to thwart attempts at deregulating the economy. President Suharto, the self-proclaimed 'father of development', is credited with greatly reducing levels of poverty since he came to power. Yet discrepancies in wealth in the cities, and the gap in average income between the more prosperous islands of Java and Bali and the out-lying islands, is of growing importance to many government ministers. This concern, together with nationalists' fears that an open economy will lead to too much foreign domination, could be forceful enough to limit further deregulation measures. The latest foreign investment deregulation package was well-received in the business community, but an attempt to deregulate the media sector was immediately squashed after outcries from nationalist quarters. The non-oil export sector, however, needs the deregulation in order to diversify and become less sensitive to swings in world demand and prices. Last year the non-oil export sector showed a slowdown in growth. There is a sense of urgency about this, because Indonesia's economy is burdened with growing private and public foreign debt. Exacerbated by the recent weakness of the US dollar, the country's foreign debt is now estimated to be between Dollars 90bn and Dollars 100bn. In the meantime, economists question whether the borrowed money is being used productively to generate the exports needed to pay it off. It is against this background that ministers are positioning themselves in case President Suharto does decide to make this term in office his last. There are many who aspire to his position, but few who are likely to meet the stringent requirements. First, if Mr Suharto's successor is to survive, he must be accepted and approved by the military. Second, it is impossible to imagine the world's largest Moslem country under the leadership of anyone but a Moslem. Third, he must be someone accepted in the international community, especially in the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in which Indonesia is a very active member. Because President Suharto is unwilling to prompt any premature power struggles, he is unlikely to hand out any clues.</p>

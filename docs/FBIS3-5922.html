			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yozo Matsuda] </F>   [Text] A concept for expanding the "basic plan on public  investment" as a way of finding a breakthrough in the deadlocked  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks is emerging. There are now  growing calls for adding about 100 trillion yen -- for the  purpose of expanding domestic demand -- to the existing plan to  invest 430 trillion yen in public works projects in the 10-year  period to 2000. The Ministry of Finance [MOF] at present is wary  about this idea of revising the plan at a time when a conclusion  is yet to be reached on the question of taxation system reform,  and insists "it would be irresponsible to make a pledge on  expanded investments when there is no hope of securing financial  resources." But still there is a growing possibility that this  will become a key point in the market liberalization plans to be  finalized by the government soon.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii in a news conference on 9  March showed he was cool toward an early revision of the plan,  by declaring, "discussions on the expansion of the basic plan,  including those on financial resources, are only beginning now,  and there is no need to change our pace."    But demands for discussing the basic plan are growing now  that the possibility of the United States applying the Super 301  provision (definition of unfair trade practices and nations  engaged in such practices, and sanctions against them) of the  Omnibus Trade Act is closer to reality after the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks broke down over the question of setting  numerical targets.    The minister of transport and the director-general of the  Economic Planning Agency have demanded the revision of the plan  in informal cabinet meetings, and the Japan Federation of  Economic Organizations [Keidanren] and the Japan Association of  Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai] separately on 7 March  submitted emergency proposals [to the government] on adding more  than 100 trillion yen to the plan.    Despite these voices, the MOF is not about to agree to a  revision of the plan at the present time. An official of the  ministry Budget Bureau said: "Even the final report of the  Hiraiwa Commission said public investment should not be expanded  without finding means of financial resources to back it up."    The Hiraiwa Commission's final report said, "a revision of  the basic plan on allocation of funds as well as expansion  should be considered only on condition that appropriate  financial resources are secured so that no burdens are left into  the next generation." As such, the MOF's view is that expansion  should be possible only on the premise that taxes will be raised  in the future. The ministry also insists that if, for instance,  a choice of issuing large amounts of construction bonds is made,  it will result not only in increasing government burdens in  paying for principal and interest therefrom, but also in raising  the overall bank interest rates as issuance of the bonds will  suck in funds from the private sector. As such, it will in fact  only impede recovery of the economy, the ministry argues.    But within the government there are also those who want to  find a breakthrough in the economic framework talks by  presenting to the United States the concept for expanding public  investment. Apparently there is "internal strife" among the  government offices.    The MOF argues vehemently against the demands for expansion,  contending, "The United States has not once asked for expansion  of the public investment in the framework talks. Some people  are misreading the interests of that country."</p>

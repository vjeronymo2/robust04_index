			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Louis Ng and David Wallen in London] </F>   [Text] Governor Chris Patten should consider disbanding  the Legislative Council [Legco] if it amended his political  reform package in a way which represented a backward step in  democratisation, leading liberal Martin Lee Chu-ming said  yesterday. He said Mr Patten was constitutionally entitled to  veto a law and dissolve the legislature.    Mr Lee, chairman of the United Democrats, claimed most of  the  appointed members in Legco had consistently acted against the  wishes of the public. "After disbanding the council, he can  appoint a new group of legislators who truly represent public  views," he said. Mr Patten could then table the bill again and  seek its approval.    Later, Mr Lee said that if Prime Minister John Major and the  British Government "had any respect for the people of Hong Kong  at all, they should introduce the bill containing Mr Patten's  original reforms immediately". He said it would "wholly  irresponsible and unacceptable" to delay any longer.    Replying to Mr Lee's suggestion, Mr Patten said: "We have to  legislate with the Legco we've got, and I don't think I could  very well say if this or that was amended in that case I would  have to send for a new Legco.    "I don't think that would be regarded by the community as  very fair."    The British Cabinet last night failed to take any decision  on  the tabling of the second section of Mr Patten's package but  again urged China to return to the negotiating table and make  concessions. Officials had earlier stressed that the meeting of  the Hong Kong committee of the Cabinet chaired by Mr Major was  aimed at taking stock of the impasse with China.    "No dramatic decisions have been considered or taken," said  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd as he emerged from the one-hour  meeting in Downing Street.    "The first part of the legislation, what we hope would be  the  non-controversial part, is going through the Legislative  Council," he said.    "No decisions have been taken yet on the timing or content  of  the second part." But he stressed: "That legislation needs to  be in place by July this year in order that the preparations for  the elections in 1994 and 1995 can be made in an orderly way.    "We are entirely ready to resume discussions with the  Chinese  on the points that remain in disagreement, but obviously there  is a limit to the time which could be spent before legislation  has to be tabled on the second part."    Mr Patten insisted that the Hong Kong Government had  proceeded in an orderly way. "We have taken one legislative  step after another, and obviously we will want to have the first  bill on the statute book before moving on unless of course by  that stage we have managed to resume discussions with Chinese  officials," he said.    He refused to be drawn on whether the second tranche of  legislation would be based on his original October 1992 proposal  or the compromise cutting the functional constituency electorate  put forward in the later rounds of talks. "We will obviously be  deciding on what is the best way forward in the light of our  success in getting the first bill through and other factors at  the time," he said. This was not the appropriate occasion to  make an announcement on the content of the bill.    He said he would want to take account of the views expressed  in the community and by political groups in recent weeks. "We  want to make sure that there is as broad a base of support as  possible." He hinted that Britain had asked the US to raise the  Hong Kong democracy issue in its current talks with the Chinese  Government. "It would not be surprising if other countries  expressed their concern over Hong Kong's system and the survival  of rule of law," he said. The Governor added: "When approached  by our friends, we tell them."    Mr Patten firmly denied any suggestion of division between  himself and the Foreign Office on how to proceed. "I have never  ever in my life been to a meeting at which views were more  unanimously expressed," he said.    The United Democrats' own amendments on the coming partial  electoral bill was ruled out of order by Legco President John  Swaine. The amendments intended to increase the number of  directly- elected seats to 30; to introduce the nine new  functional constituency seats as mentioned in the original  package proposed by Mr Patten and to create three new functional  constituencies to give the retired and housewives a second vote.</p>

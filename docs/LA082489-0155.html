			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE 55: KING OF DIAMOND LANES;  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEADS CAR-POOL HIT PARADE FOR NOW  </P> <P> Love them or hate them, the much-debated car-pool lanes that run on the Costa  Mesa Freeway down the middle of Orange County are the busiest in the state. But  just wait.  </P> <P> That distinction may not last long. Car-pool lanes are expected to open in two  weeks along much of the southbound San Diego Freeway, north of the Costa Mesa  Freeway. And by next spring, when the diamond lanes are completed along the  entire length of the San Diego Freeway in Orange County, it may well assume the  top spot soon after the ribbon is cut, state Department of Transportation  officials say.  </P> <P> For the time being, however, the diamond lanes stretching along the Costa Mesa  Freeway (California 55) have the record, carrying about 22,000 people a day in  each direction. The highway quietly took the top spot in mid-1987 from the El  Monte transitway on the San Bernardino Freeway, but the record drew little  notice outside Caltrans, officials said.  </P> <P> Today, about 22,000 people use the car-pool lanes in each direction every 24  hours on the Costa Mesa Freeway, followed by nearly 14,000 on the El Monte  transitway and about 7,000 on the commuter lane that runs eastbound along  California 91.  </P> <P> "We look at it as a successful operation," said Joe El Harake, Orange County  commuter-lanes coordinator for Caltrans. "When we opened the car-pool lanes on  the 55, we never thought we'd have so much utilization of them. This is a  positive thing."  </P> <P> There is, however, a bit of bad news. With the popularity of the car-pool lanes  soaring, the average time saved by commuters who use the lanes has dropped.  When the lanes were introduced in November, 1985, a motorist could save 17  minutes compared to someone sitting in traffic, El Harake said. Today, the  car-pool lane shaves off 10 minutes, he said.  </P> <P> "It's still a very nice incentive," El Harake said. "To the average motorist,  that is a tremendous savings, and there is a definite psychological advantage  to be in a lane that keeps moving."  </P> <P> Initially opened as a one-year experiment to test the car-pool concept in  Orange County, the restricted lanes on the Costa Mesa Freeway have survived a  rash of criticism from groups opposed to the notion of setting aside a strip of  asphalt for cars with two or more occupants.  </P> <P> Opponents have gone to great lengths to get their point across, doing  everything from handing out leaflets to motorists at freeway on-ramps to  picketing the Caltrans offices.  </P> <P> In particular, the grass-roots group Drivers for Highway Safety has targeted  the freeway's diamond lanes for ridicule, saying they pose a danger by sending  commuters zooming within inches of cars poking along in unrestricted lanes  congested by traffic.  </P> <P> Joe Catron, president of the group, questioned whether the Costa Mesa Freeway's  car-pool lanes truly are the most heavily used, suggesting that Caltrans  officials have skewed the statistics to affect the public's opinion of the  lanes.  </P> <P> "I don't buy that at all," Catron said. "I definitely would question their  numbers. As we have in the past, I would question their counting methods.  There's been lots of inaccuracies."  </P> <P> El Harake of Caltrans, however, said the proof is right there on the freeway.  The Costa Mesa freeway has been the busiest since mid-1987.  </P> <P> While the El Monte transit-way, which is heavily traveled by commuter-laden  buses, features greater flows during peak commuting hours, the Costa Mesa  Freeway's commuter lanes have more extended use at other times of the day and  night, he said.  </P> <P> Though they flow freely most hours of the day, the Costa Mesa Freeway's  car-pool lanes actually carry twice as many people during rush hour as the  freeway's other lanes.  </P> <P> The car-pool lane also accommodates more cars than the freeway's other lanes  during peak hours. One recent afternoon, for example, the car-pool lane was  used by more than 1,500 cars between 5 and 6 p.m. The three other lanes ranged  between about 1,400 and 1,100 cars during the hour, El Harake said.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials are eager to open additional car-pool lanes in the county,  in particular along the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> The San Diego Freeway, the second most heavily traveled highway in the world,  just behind the busy Santa Monica Freeway in Los Angeles, is used by as many as  300,000 cars a day along some stretches in Orange County.  </P> <P> A 10-mile section of the northbound car-pool lane was finished between  Brookhurst Street and the San Gabriel River Freeway in late spring. In early  September, the southbound car-pool lane will be opened from the San Gabriel  River Freeway to Fairview Road.  </P> <P> Construction of car-pool lanes along the freeway between Fairview and  Interstate 5 is expected to be completed by spring.  </P> <P> Car-pool lanes are also featured in construction plans along Interstate 5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Car-Pool Lanes  </P> <P> Existing northbound car-pool lane from Brookhurst St. to the San Gabriel River  Freeway  </P> <P> </P> <P> Southbound car-pool lane from the San Gabriel River Freeway to the Corona del  Mar Freeway will be opened next week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Existing northbound and southbound car-pool lanes form the San Diego to the  Riverside freeways  </P></p>

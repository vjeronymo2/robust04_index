			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Cardiff wins Pounds 200m TV component plant A Japanese-German joint venture to make television components, involving a planned investment of nearly Pounds 200m, is to be set up at Cardiff Bay. Up to 750 jobs are expected to be created in what is potentially one of the biggest inward investments yet in Wales. The venture, between Nippon Electric Glass and Schott Glaswerke, will make glass for cathode ray tubes. The first customer will be the Sony television plant at Bridgend in south Wales, which at present imports these components. The factory is the most important manufacturing investment yet won by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, which is responsible for regenerating 2,700 acres of old docklands. Site preparation for the factory will begin next month and production is due to start next year. Initially, Pounds 30m will be invested and 70 people employed in grinding and polishing panels. But the joint venture intends to develop a fully integrated manufacturing facility for cathode ray glass over five years. Depending on the market, the companies forecast an investment of Pounds 193m and a workforce of up to 750 people over that period. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, described it as 'an immense vote of confidence in Wales by two world leaders in their field. For them to choose south Wales over competing sites throughout Europe is further proof of our attraction to international companies'. NEG and Schott will receive an undisclosed amount of regional selective assistance from the Welsh Office. The development corporation will provide financial help, which is still being negotiated, in the construction costs of the factory. Sir Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the corporation, said the announcement was 'a major industrial milestone in the regeneration of Cardiff Bay'. Mr Michael Boyce, chief executive, said: 'I can't think of a more important inward investment for us to attract - we have shared everyone's concern about the weakening of Cardiff's manufacturing base.' It is the first large deal struck by the development corporation since work started in May, after protracted opposition, to construct a barrage across Cardiff Bay to create a freshwater lake.</p>

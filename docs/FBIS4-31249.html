			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Muhamed Filipovic, </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to Switzerland and deputy chairman  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Academy of Sciences, by Luisa Ballin  and Nefail Maliqi; place and date of interview not given: "The  World Must Not Allow the Formation of Greater Serbia"]    [Excerpts] [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] We talked to Professor  Dr. Muhamed Filipovic, author of 15 scientific and political  works, deputy chairman of the Academy of Sciences of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and currently Bosnian ambassador in Bern,  Switzerland, about the current situation in the former Yugoslav  lands, especially about the two-year war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  the factor and role of the Albanian people in the Balkans,  Yugoslav crimes and criminals, about Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and about many other  problems related to the former Yugoslavia. First of all,  Ambassador, what is your view of the two-year interethnic  conflict, or rather, what is your view of the current situation  in the former Yugoslav lands, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Filipovic] I was actively involved in political life in the  former Yugoslavia. I was also in the dissident opposition.  During recent years, since 1967, I carefully monitored Bosnian  life and life in the former Yugoslavia in general. I said in  1978 in Cavtat that Yugoslavia, such as it was, would have to  collapse. I said this because I beleived that the communist  system, which Yugoslavia had at that time, had completed its  role in history. It was a system which put society into a  dictatorial and totalitarian social system. So because of this,  in my opinion, Yugoslavia no longer exists. The 1974  Constitution represented some views, but some peoples were  unhappy with it; first of all the Albanians, who, although they  enjoyed a certain autonomy, were discriminated against in all  spheres of life. The pressure continues now and it is direct  pressure.    When I talk to Albanians, I emphasize that I believe that  the  Bosnian Muslims are subject to the same situation, since, as you  can see, they are permitted neither national nor religious  emancipation. The aims of Serbia in regard to Bosnia are clearly  seen here.    The situation with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  is another case. It takes the form of a controversy in regard to  the autocephalous church of Macedonia but, in essence, it is a  question of the nonrecognition of the people and the recognition  of Macedonia as a some kind of state subject so that even today  Macedonia is considered in actuality to be part of Serbia, a  territory of southern Serbia.    Let us return to Bosnia. We know well from history that  Bosnia-Herzegovina has existed for some time, like Albanians and  Macedonians who have carried out a broad national emancipation,  and that it once had its own state. But with the formation of  Tito's Yugoslavia, the rise of nationalism began. The Serbs were  the most aggressive in their nationalism, which the current  situation proves. [passage omitted]    Much has been said about the fact that the Serbian aggressor  appeared most fierce in Bosnia. People ask why. We know that  Bosnia is the key to the existence or the nonexistence of  "greater Serbia". Therefore, when the Serbs achieve victory in  Bosnia, they will realize their age-old dreams. I think that  they are very far away from this but that this is utopia for the  Serbs.    Since the Serbs hate us as a people, they circulate  propaganda inside and outside the area, saying that we are a  primitive people, without culture and tradition and without a  strong army. We should know the clear truth that the Bosnians  and not the Turks controlled Bosnia for 300 years. No one can  deceive us by saying that the Bosnian people have a weak army  and do not have a combat tradition. The Serbs are victims of the  propaganda line that says that the Turks defended Bosnia.    It is true that, during recent days of the war, the Serbs  caused us great losses, more civilians than soldiers. As for our  losses during the war, some 90 percent of those killed were  civilians.    According to accurate information, about 56,000 Serbian  soldiers have died in the Serbian-Muslim war while we Muslims  have lost 12,800 soldiers. It is true that they have caused  great losses, not only in lives but also in material goods. But  this also means that this is the first time that the Serbian  army is on the losing side. [passage omitted]    The war in Bosnia will last until the international  community  approves of and decides to create a "greater Serbia", a  totalitarian state in which all non-Serbs or non-Slavs are  subjected to such terror.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Peace talks began a long time ago,  along with the war in B-H, but who knows when this  incomprehensible war will end.    [Filipovic] We can say that this peace process is one of the  strangest processes in the world up to now. [passage omitted]    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] In the European media and in  international circles, there is talk about dividing Bosnia into  three cantons. In your opinion, will Bosnia continue to be  Bosnia-Herzegovina or will it be cantonized?    [Filipovic] Bosnia will continue to be the community of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. But as of now, we still do not know what  form this state will take. Bosnia will remain a state which did  not begin its existence just now, but which has existed since  the eighth century; it was the first Slavic state in this  region. It had and has its own scientific continuity. It has  more stable borders than any other state in the Balkans.  [passage omitted]    I welcome the agreement with the Croats for the union of the  two states. I think that this action by the two parties is very  positive and that from now on all the Serbian teritories taken  by force in Croatia and Bosnia will be considered to be  terrotories occupied by Serbia. Then we will ask the Serbs if  they want to keep fighting or if they want another solution.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] During an interview with S.  [Suleyman]  Uglanini [chairman of the Mulsim National Council of Sandzak] we  were told, in response to a question, that if Bosnia is divided  we would demand Sandjak [Sandzak] and unite it with our mother  country. What is your comment on this?    [Filipovic] We consider that, historically, Sandjak is a  territorial part of Bosnia. Certainly, earlier in its history  Sandjak belonged to the vilayet of Bosnia and the Bosnian state  of King Cerka. We are not in favor of changing the boundaries  with the former Yugoslavia but I would like to say that the  Bosnians should demand in Serbia everything that the Serbs are  demanding in Bosnia.    Therefore, since the Serbs are demanding some kind of  autonomy, a republic or whatever we call it, in Bosnia and  Croatia, Sandjak should also receive full political autonomy  with the right to unite with Bosnia. Thus, we are demanding  reciprocity with Serbia. Thus, residents of Sandjak will have  the same status in Serbia as Serbs will have in Bosnia. This is  our policy.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Recently some media organs and some  circles have been saying that when the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina  is over, the Serbian aggressor will continue the conflict in  Kosova [Kosovo] and Macedonia. Mr. Ambassador, what do you think  about this?    [Filipovic] I do not think that there will be a war in  Kosova. I say this because the Serbs will not be able to achieve  their aims in Bosnia. But, if the war in Bosnia concludes in  accordance with the Serbs' plans, then the torch of this war  will extend not only to Kosova but also to Macedonia. Serbian  plans against the Albanian people in Kosova did not begin in  1981, but earlier than that, with Cubrilovic, Andric, and  Garashanin, and continued with the present-day new chetniks,  such as Milosevic, Arkan, Seselj, and others who have always  kept their eyes on Kosova for the purpose of plundering it and  cleansing it of Albanians. What is happening now with the  Bosnians, with more than 1 million Bosnians outside the country,  immigrations which are the result of ethnic cleansing by Serbs  in Bosnia so that they can integrate Bosnia with Serbia, as a  part of Serbia -- I am afraid will also happen with the  Albanians in Kosova, where the Serbian regime has begun, by  means of repression and provocations, to expel some of the  Albanian population from their ethnic lands.    Thus, let me say once again that Bosnia-Herzegovina is the  key to the existence or nonexistence of "Greater Serbia".  Therefore, with the division of Bosnia, the chauvinistic Greater  Serbian aims will be achieved and the conflict will be extended  to other areas of the former Yugoslavia which are not involved  in the war. However, I think that the Serbs are very far from  achieving the age-old idea of a Greater Serbia and that such an  idea is utopian.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] You have said that there are many war  criminals in Switzerland. On what do you base your opinion?    [Filipovic] We have a list of 70 persons who are suspected  of  having committed war crimes and having taken part in criminal  acts of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Some of them have directly  participated in massacres, ethnic cleansing, murders, rapes,  looting, and the demolition and destruction of housing units.  Another person served as a concentration camp guard. These  people, who are suspected of being war criminals in the former  Yugoslavia, many of whom have taken refuge in Switzerland, must  be brought to justice. We have informed the appropriate organs  of the Swiss Government about these cases. But that is not all.  These people are being trained, recruited, and mobilized here in  Switzerland, voluntarily or against their will, to prepare for  combat in Bosnia.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] How many dossiers have you compiled  so  far, what will you be doing about this in the future, and where  are these individuals located?    [Filipovic] On our initiative, we have exposed persons who  are currently living in different parts of Europe, such as  Germany and Switzerland, especially in the German part of  Switzerland, in places like Zug, Saint Gall, Basel, and Zurich.  So far we have compiled 10 dossiers and, when the information is  verified, we will hand them over to the federal organs in  Switzerland. A number of Swiss lawyers have offered us  assistance in pursuing these criminals because these suspects  might leave Switzerland before they can be arrested.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] So far the United Nations secretary  general has not named the prosecutor of the International Court  who will be responsible for sentencing the war criminals of the  former Yugoslavia. Do you think that the United Nations has the  sentencing of war criminals in mind?    [Filipovic] In this direction, there is a lack of political  will to fulfill the obligations resulting from United Nations  conventions since 1948 and the resolutions approved by the  Security Council in regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We have confidence that the organs of the countries in which  the war criminals reside will pursue them and will react  immediately because these states have all the legal elements for  such a mission. However, it is disturbing that the International  Court, at the initiative of the United Nations, is confronted  with another serious problem: Will it be satisfied with the  sentencing of small or low-level criminals, or should it also  bring to justice those who truly deserve to be sentenced for  ethnic cleansing, which is also considered to be a crime.    Slobodan Milosevic, Dobrica Cosic, Ratko Mladic, and Radovan  Karadzic must be sentenced. They have the main responsibility  for a policy which has used ethnic criteria to divide peoples  who have always lived together.    [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Does this mean that you are ready to  demand than the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic,  be arrested and sentenced, where he lives or in Switzerland?    [Filopovic] I am presenting the example of Radovan Karadzic  to you because he launched the idea of ethnic cleansing so that  they could create a state on ethnic bases, an ethnically pure  state, using an aggressive logic against a state which is  recognized by the United Nations and other international  circles. At the same time, this case is also an example to  convince individuals and public opinion, in general, to use  violence and to put ethnic cleansing into practice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (MENA)-- Cypriot Foreign Minister  Alexandros Mikhailidhis has stated that the report submitted  today by UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the  Cyprus issue reflects the efforts the secretary general is  making to work out a suitable formula for the  confidence-building measures between the parties concerned.    The Cypriot minister told MENA that his country will study  that report. He noted the importance of the secretary general's  proposal to hold an international conference on the Cyprus  issue, to adopt intensified measures to implement the UN  resolutions, and to hold a meeting of the peace guarantors:  Turkey, Britain, and Greece.    He added that the confidence-building measures will yield  economic benefits for Turkish Cypriots, particularly if the  Turkish Cypriot city of Famagusta is opened to both sides for  the sake of touristic and trade development.    The Cypriot minister noted that the secretary general's  report demands the opening of Nicosia airport to both sides.  This will enable Turkish Cypriots to travel without any  difficulties.</p>

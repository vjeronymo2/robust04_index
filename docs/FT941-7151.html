			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (4): The strange tale of Souk al-Manakh - Robin Allen describes the disastrous legacy of six years of gambling on an unlicensed stock exchange The government's credibility is at stake over settling the debts incurred by investors in an unregulated spree from 1976 to 1982. The next real test in what is known as the Difficult Debts Settlement Programme will come after March 31. The 'difficult debts' were incurred by 'investors' on the unofficial - and officially illegal - stock exchange which was housed on two floors at the bottom of a multi-storey car park called the Souk al-Manakh. There, for six years from 1976, the temptation to gamble through a system of post-dated cheques in Kuwaiti and Gulf off-shore companies which could not get a listing on the official market, proved too strong for thousands of Kuwaitis. Other Gulf nationals, particularly in Bahrain and the UAE, were also ensnared by the evergreen market: until it all burst, in August 1982, when a few sceptics unsportingly cashed in their cheques and caused the whole paper structure to crumble overnight. The gross debts amounted to KD27bn (Dollars 92bn). In the anguished tally that followed, many of the cheques cancelled each other out, leaving a net indebtedness of some KD7bn (Dollars 23.5bn). But the underlying credibility problem for the government reverts to 1976 after the government of the day had dissolved the national assembly. In the aftermath of dissolution, and in an attempt to divert public indignation, the government turned a blind eye to the early beginnings of the Souk al-Manakh. It then created an unfortunate precedent when, a year later, it paid out KD155m (more than Dollars 500m) to people who had lost money in the mini-depression of that year. This single act instilled in a generation of Kuwaitis the notion that if they got into financial difficulties, the government would help them. Over the years this notion developed into a conviction that, in times of private sector difficulties, the government had a duty to step in and bail them out. Among the thousands of Kuwaitis who suffered were several members of the ruling Al-Sabah family from the prime minister downwards. This factor too, now has serious implications for the government's credibility. A few debtors from the 1982 crash started to settle their debts in 1986. The previous year the national assembly had been dissolved again, not least because it had forced the resignation of the then justice minster, a member of the Al-Sabah family, for his role in the Souk al-Manakh disaster. After dissolution the government stepped in, through the Central Bank, to initiate what is now known as Difficult Debts Settlement Programme 1 (DDSP1). Under this scheme, debtors were offered a 15-year pay-off period. If, as some say, this is largely a red-herring now, it is still a fact that big debtors today are using the terms of DDSP1 as a rationale for dragging their feet. In July 1992, three months before the October elections by which today's national assembly came into being, the government issued Law 32, by which it bought out KD5.9bn (Dollars 19.7bn) of personal and corporate debt from the private sector in return for debt bonds issued to the commercial banks. The law took effect from August 1992. The banks took advantage of this to unload all their unwanted loan assets, most of which was money lent to clients for the Souk al-Manakh. Some of the indebtedness, for example a KD400m real estate portfolio on the books of Kuwait Finance House which the KFH has to repurchase within 10 years, were depreciated investments; and some were personal borrowings incurred during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. But according to the central bank governor Sheikh Salem al-Sabah, some KD5.1bn (Dollars 17bn) reverted to the Souk al-Manakh. There are now, according to Sheikh Salem, a total of 9,549 debtors under the present settlement programme. Of these 1,146 are liable for more than 90 per cent, or Dollars 15.3bn, of the total Dollars 17bn. Many bought property or liquid investments outside the country, on credit, at the height of the Souk al-Manakh boom, and are now reluctant to disclose these assets. They are even more unwilling to repatriate them to pay their debts. The other 88 per cent of the debtors, who number just over 8,400, are the so-called 'small debtors', most of whom owe KD500,000 (Dollars 1.7m) or less. Not all debtors are individuals. Some are companies and some of these are owned by the state. The full list of individuals and the amounts each owes has never been published. The settlement programme now operating is based on Law 41 of 1993, passed by the national assembly on August 31. It took effect one week later, on September 6. Debtors are given two options by which they can repay: cash payments or a rescheduling over a 12-year period at equal annual installments. It is still generally hoped that the vast proportion of small debtors will choose the first option. This would greatly simplify collection of the other 90 per cent of the total outstanding from the major debtors. The deadline for debtors to decide on their preferred option and to complete the necessary documentation is March 31, 1994. The country's six commercial banks have been put in charge of managing the programme under the overall supervision of the Industrial Bank of Kuwait. The banks will also be held responsible if there are deficiencies in the mechanics of debt-collection. By March 31 each debtor should have collected all the necessary documentation from the bank of his choice; have had the documents authenticated and notarised by the ministry of justice or a notary public; and have returned these to the bank. The penalty for not complying is exclusion from the settlement programme, and the debtor would then be told - by the court in theory - to pay in full plus interest, as from August 1, 1990, the day before the Iraqi invasion. According to Sheikh Salem, the banks in their capacity as collecting agents are by law obliged to send the names of delinquent debtors to the justice ministry. It is left to the courts, with the executive authority of the cabinet, to implement the law, which, according to Sheikh Salem, will be enforced regardless of the position or the identity of the individual. 'If the banks do not implement their part, they will be punished,' he said. There is, however, no clearly defined legal entity to oversee the application of the law. The national assembly which passed the law, is not an administrative body, and in any case, as one Kuwaiti remarked, 'is hardly a disinterested group'. The Central bank is barred from administering the law, so by default the banks have to do it. The arithmetic of the settlement programme is easy enough - and generous in the extreme to those who choose the cash option. Under this first option, debtors get a partial write-off followed by repayment of the balance over two years starting, according to Sheikh Salem, from September 7, 1993 - one day after the law came into effect. The initial write-off depends on the size of the debt. As the size of the debt increases the scale of the write-off goes down. The balance must be paid within two years from September 6, 1993, when the law came into effect. Those who pay their debt in full by the end of the second quarter of this year will receive an extra 4 per cent discount. This bonus rate decreases by 0.5 per cent for each successive quarter. To get the full 4 per cent a debtor needs to have been paid in full by December 6, 1993; the second quarter ends on March 6, 1994, and so on. Under the second option - to repay on equal annual instalments over 12 years  -an 8 per cent discount on the total amount is allowed for early repayment. The annual installments are fixed by the Central Bank on the basis of the outstanding amount with no interest charged. Sheikh Salem said the total amount to have been repaid up to January 20 this year by some 2,000 debtors was KD117m, which allowing for the applicable discounts, accounted for KD337m, or 6.6 per cent, of the total debt outstanding. Accountants say there are still some uncertainties in the financial analysis of the choices, but these only concern the exact timing of the instalments under the 12-year option. More serious is the sentiment among many businessmen. They have reservations which reflect the general low esteem in which the government is held. Some debtors, the larger ones or their representatives, are pressing for easier terms. They say that large assets sales to refund their debts will trigger a collapse in values, on the stock exchange for example. They insist that although the government claims to be offering two options, in reality there is only one. The second option, they claim, is punitive, because the repayment period is too short. It should be 20 years, not 12. They are supported by those who maintain the first settlement programme, initiated in 1986 with a proposed 15-year pay-back period, is still valid; and that was before the trauma of Iraqi occupation and the extra indebtedness incurred as a result. Many of those now objecting probably do not intend to pay or do not believe the government can force them to pay - or simply reckon that the government will buckle under pressure and ask the national assembly to change the law. The official position is that the government will neither revise nor review the bad debts law. In reality, the government is holding its breath. If the biggest debtors set an example and climb on to the settlement bandwagon, much of the government's credibility will be restored. If not, then the fall-out will be damaging politically as well as financially.</p>

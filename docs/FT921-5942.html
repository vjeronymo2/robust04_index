			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Stock exchange chief calls for end to 'soft commissions' MR Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, yesterday urged stockbrokers to end voluntarily the controversial practice of charging 'soft commissions' through which charges on share deals are partially rebated to fund managers in the form of services. 'If people want a service, they should be prepared to pay for it visibly in a currency everyone understands,' Mr Rawlins said. 'Why do we need some indirect form of remuneration?' He told the NAPF conference that practitioner-regulators had to counter the perception that they were 'tied up in their own vested interests'. He said the present array of financial regulators should be replaced by three, in 'a rigorous and rapid rationalisation of regulatory bodies'. The Securities and Investments Board should continue as before. There should also be two self-regulating organisations, one covering professional practitioners in the wholesale markets, the other covering those selling products to the public.</p>

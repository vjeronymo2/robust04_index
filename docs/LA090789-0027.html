			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO MEDDLE IN MANAGUA?;  </P> <P> BIPARTISANSHIP IS TESTED OVER U.S. ROLE IN FEBRUARY ELECTION  </P> <P> Before Congress left for summer vacation, the Democratic majority on the House  Intelligence Committee was poised to ban CIA involvement in Nicaragua's  election next February. The committee intended to add the ban to the  legislation that authorizes funding for the intelligence community starting on  Oct. 1. But at the eleventh hour, Secretary of State James A. Baker III  successfully appealed to committee chairman Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los  Angeles) to delay the vote until after the recess. The Administration, Baker  said, was eager to avoid a confrontation.  </P> <P> Now Congress is back, and Baker and his aides will be meeting behind the scenes  with Beilenson and other intelligence committee Democrats to see whether this  latest pitfall on the path to bipartisanship can be avoided. It will be a tough  negotiation.  </P> <P> Democrats had enough votes to pass the ban in July, and events in the interim  have stiffened their resolve. The five Central American presidents, meeting in  Tela, Honduras, in August, called on outside powers not to interfere covertly  in the Nicaraguan campaign. Moreover, all 20 opposition parties in Nicaragua --  the potential recipients of the CIA's largess -- repudiated covert assistance  in a landmark agreement on electoral procedures that they signed with the  Sandinistas that same month.  </P> <P> Baker also must bear the burden of distrust that Ronald Reagan and the late  William Casey, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, left as their  legacy. Casey lied to the intelligence committees so frequently and so  audaciously that skeptical Democrats will want a prohibition on covert action  written in black and white, and preferably written into the law.  </P> <P> Baker will try to talk them out of that, both to preserve the principle of  presidential discretion in intelligence matters and to give Bush the  flexibility to respond to unforeseen circumstances.  </P> <P> Democrats, however, worry that unless the ban is in the law, there is nothing  to prevent President Bush from later launching a covert operation targeted at  the election and paying for it out of the CIA's contingency fund. Although Bush  would have to sign a presidential "finding" justifying such action and inform  the intelligence committees "in a timely fashion" (though not, perhaps, before  the election), the committees have no power to approve or disapprove. Once the  intelligence bill for next year is completed, Congress will have lost its  leverage.  </P> <P> To be sure, Baker's word is far better currency on Capitol Hill than Casey's  ever was. If Baker gives a solemn promise that the CIA will not try to  influence Nicaragua's election, many members will be inclined to trust him. The  Democrats are no more eager than the White House to begin fighting over  Nicaragua again. Unless Baker is willing to promise at least that much, there  won't be much ground for compromise. If no agreement is reached, the stage will  be set for another bruising public debate over Nicaragua, shattering the spirit  if not the letter of the bipartisan agreement reached in March.  </P> <P> The Republican right is already berating Bush and Baker for selling out the  Contras because they chose not to fight Congress to the death over military aid  last winter. As Baker meets with Beilenson, he will have to be watching his  right flank. To make a prohibition on CIA involvement in the Nicaraguan  election palatable to the right, Baker will probably want to trade it for a  sizable increase in overt aid to the Nicaraguan opposition.  </P> <P> Congress has already allocated $3.5 million in overt aid through the National  Endowment for Democracy. Unlike covert aid, such assistance is legal under  Nicaragua's election law. But even overt aid can be manipulative if there is  too much of it. In Nicaragua's moribund economy, a few dollars go a long way.  On a per-capita basis, the $3.5 million is 12 times more than Washington  provided the Chilean opposition in last year's plebiscite on the Pinochet  regime.  </P> <P> Although most Democrats are not opposed in principle to overt aid in foreign  elections, many would resist sending much more to Nicaragua than has already  been approved. We do the Nicaraguan opposition no favor by making it appear to  be bought and paid for by the U.S.A.  </P> <P> The negotiation between the Administration and the House Intelligence Committee  will be the first real test of whether President Bush's professed desire for a  bipartisan policy on Nicaragua is sincere. It will also be a trial run for the  much more complicated consultations that must occur in November when Contra aid  comes up for congressional review. For the moment, both Congress and the  Executive are observing the truce in their war over Nicaragua. We will soon  know if that truce can be translated into a permanent peace or is merely the  prelude to new hostilities.  </P></p>

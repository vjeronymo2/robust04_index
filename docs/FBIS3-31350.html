			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 16 Feb (TANJUG) -- Vojislav Kostunica,  chairman of the Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS], said at a news  conference today that NATO's threat to the Bosnian Serbs was  aimed at demonstrating NATO's unity and resolve.    Kostunica recalled that everyone had succumbed to Germany's  ultimatum in 1992 and had wished to preserve the unity of the  European Community and the spirit of Maastricht, which resulted  in the dismemberment of the sovereign Yugoslav state.    According to him, the fact is being overlooked that the  absence of resolve sometimes does not have to be such a bad  thing in politics. Apart from resolve for war, he added, people  should display resolve for peace, and this was lacking.    The DSS leader believes that NATO's threat was based on the  naive assumption that air strikes could be carried out without a  response.    Kostunica pointed to the dilemma faced by the Bosnian Serb  leadership. On the one hand, he said, the Serbs are determined  to do everything to avoid the attacks, but on the other they  cannot leave their own people unprotected.    In his opinion, the NATO decision was linked with the  Sarajevo market place event, no matter how much this was being  covered up. This, Kostunica said, is a familiar three-act  performance, where it all starts with a provocation -- coming  mostly from the Muslim side -- followed by threats to the Serbs,  and in the final act the Bosnian Serbs are expected to make  further concessions.    Answering a reporter's question, the DSS leader stressed  there was nothing that could justify Serbia's and Yugoslavia's  silence over the ultimatum. Commenting on the frequent visits  by foreign diplomats to Belgrade, Kostunica said that according  to the [federal] Constitution, decisions on war and peace were  within the jurisdiction of the assembly, that the Serbian  president was not authorized to conduct such talks and that he  ought to explain to the people what he was doing. Speaking  about certain inconsistencies in statements by [Bosnian Serb  commander] General Ratko Mladic and [Bosnian Serb president]  Radovan Karadzic on the withdrawal of the artillery and its  placing under UN supervision, Kostunica said he could not judge  this from here [Belgrade], that he was certain there was more  unanimity than discord, and stressed that politicians and  soldiers spoke different languages.</p>

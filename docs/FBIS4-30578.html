			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 28 (YONHAP) -- A senior North Korean  official admitted that his country possesses plutonium for  research purposes at a radiochemical laboratory in the Yongbyon  nuclear complex, ITAR-TASS News Agency reported from Pyongyang  on Monday.    In an interview with the Russian news agency, the North  Korean director general of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry  overseas affairs bureau, Choe Chong-sun, acknowledged that some  plutonium was at the complex but did not elaborate on the total  amount.    Choe is the first top North Korean official to admit to his  country's possession of plutonium. He reportedly said that  despite Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency's monitoring equipment at  Yongbyon is operating normally and stressed that North Korea  will inform the IAEA if the equipment needs replacement.    As to cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Choe said  North Korea has no specific expectations "at present as well as  in the past," disclosing that only 500,000 U.S. dollars was  provided by the agency last year for agricultural and medical  purposes.    The basic purpose of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor,  constructed through close cooperation with Russia, is to secure  the nuclear power generation necessary to develop the country's  economy, he asserted. The existing 5-megawatt reactor is  insufficient to meet domestic demand.    Although the former Soviet Union provided key assistance in  building the reactor, he continued, North Korea does not hold  out much hope that its successor Russia will do the same. He  maintained that "there is almost no cooperation with Russia  presently in the nuclear field."</p>

He  noted in his interview to INTERFAX that Yuriy Luzhkov has never  made such statements about his intention to become the president  of Russia. Sergey Tsoy underlined that the main task of the  mayor is to work in order to improve the life of Muscovites and  not to receive any political advantages from his post. He  believes that rumors that have been spreading around that the  capital's head of administration allegedly has some political  ambitions are not only politically irrelevant but also immoral.</p>

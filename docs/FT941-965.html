			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / S Korea leader treads carefully in China: Kim Young-sam's plea for Beijing pressure on Pyongyang South Korean President Kim Young-sam will today become the second regional leader in a week to urge China to exert pressure on North Korea to open its nuclear sites to international inspection. But Mr Kim, who arrived in Beijing yesterday, is likely to advocate a more patient approach than did Japan's prime minister, who last week told Chinese leaders of Tokyo's 'grave concern' at Korean developments and warned of UN Security Council action. Even so, South Korea's president will seek to impress on Chinese officials the gravity of the situation after decisions by Pyongyang and Seoul to put their armies on high alert. The US is also taking steps to bolster its military presence in the region. Mr Kim is due to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin today and Premier Li Peng tomorrow to discuss North Korea. This will be the South Korean leader's first visit to Beijing as president. Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea's foreign minister, said yesterday, before leaving Seoul for Beijing, that the Security Council should allow more time for North Korea to live up to its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He said a statement from the Security Council president would be desirable rather than a formal resolution urging Pyongyang to open its sites to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection: 'It could be better that a statement be issued to induce the North Koreans to come forward for a dialogue. If North Korea continues not to allow nuclear inspections, even after the statement is issued, then China cannot but go along with UN resolutions.' South Korea's approach matches that of Beijing. China, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, is anxious to avoid, at this stage, a vote on a formal resolution about its ally, North Korea. The US has been circulating a draft resolution warning of further unspecified action if North Korea fails to adhere to its NPT obligations. It recommends that Pyongyang be given a month in which to co-operate with the IAEA. The US is reported to have said that it might go along with the approach advocated by China provided it was clear that economic sanctions would be considered if North Korea failed to comply. China has made no secret of its concern that it might face unpalatable diplomatic choices over the Korean issue. Chinese officials have ruled out support at this stage for economic sanctions and have criticised a decision by the US and South Korea to resume joint military exercises. Mr Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, said last week China was 'not in favour of any action detrimental to stability (on the Korean peninsula) such as military exercises'. He also made clear at a news briefing that China believed it would be dangerous to push North Korea into a corner. Chinese officials have been suggesting that the US consider moves towards diplomatic relations with Pyongyang as a way to defuse the crisis. China wants to try to forestall punitive economic sanctions under which it might be obliged to cut off petroleum and food supplies to North Korea. That would be almost certain to cause a deep rupture in relations. The South Korean foreign minister will fly to Washington from Beijing this week for talks with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and Mr William Perry, US defence secretary. Mr Perry said at the weekend that he had ordered the US Air Force to add to its stockpiles of munitions and spare parts in South Korea. He was also deploying new Apache attack helicopters - used devastatingly against Iraqi tanks in the Gulf war. The secretary told reporters in Washington that his department planned 'to take every step we can' so that US tactical air capability could be applied in a day or two rather than a week or two. The US, which has 36,000 troops based in South Korea, has been enhancing that country's defences, including the deployment of Patriot missiles against any Scud missile attacks. North Korea, which has some 1m men and women under arms, has stepped up military drills and issued bellicose threats. It has also intensified propaganda broadcasts calling for the overthrow of the Seoul government.</p>

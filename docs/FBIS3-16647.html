He is convinced that the positive aspects of this program  and  NATO's potential should be used for creating a European  collective security system, for strengthening the CSCE and for  broadening cooperation in peacemaking and military conversion.    Nazarkin was supported by head of the Russian Foreign  Ministry's Department for European Cooperation Yuriy Ushakov,  who said that Russia's isolation from NATO's initiative will  deprive it of the opportunity to influence the implementation of  the Partnership or Peace program, and NATO's cooperation with  Eastern European and CIS countries.    Ushakov believes that Russia will also sustain considerable  financial losses, because it will lose its Eastern European arms  markets which will "completely pass over to NATO after the  Eastern European countries join this program." As we reported  earlier, this program envisages a standardization of armaments.    To quote Ushakov, Russia's participation in the NATO program  does not exclude protection of its national interests.    Chairman of the State Duma's Committee for International  Affairs, Russia's former ambassador to the U.S. Vladimir Lukin  thinks, however, that Moscow should not join this program  hastily because, he said, "we have already missed the most  appropriate moment for doing so."    In his opinion, since the U.S. is ready to broaden relations  with Russia, instead of "pushing its way to the head of the  line" Russia should analyze what should be done for a more  active rapprochement with this organization and closely follow  its reorganization.</p>

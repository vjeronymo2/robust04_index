			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 27 Feb (SANA)--The Political Bureau of  the Palestinian People's Party [PPP] has demanded a halt to the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations until international protection  is provided for Palestinian citizens in reply to the heinous  massacre perpetrated at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque where innocent  worshipers from the Palestinian people's sons fell as victims.    In a statement issued here today, the PPP held the Israeli  Government responsible for the massacre. This government  facilitated the building of settlements for these criminals,  armed them, and was lenient toward their previous crimes, such  as what happened with the perpetrators of the al-Aqsa Mosque and  the Hebron university massacres.    The PPP added that the Israeli Government cannot guarantee  the Palestinian citizens' security. In fact, it joins in  inflicting more Palestinian casualties and punishes their  kinsfolk by firing at them and imposing collective punishments  on them.    The PPP pointed out that such a situation cannot help  achieve  peace. It demanded that negotiations should be suspended until  fair conditions conforming to the resolutions of international  legitimacy are in place.</p>

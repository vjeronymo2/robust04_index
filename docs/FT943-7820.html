			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Markets: Calor finds rumours a gas - Bottom Line Calor Group, the bottled gas supplier, has stumbled across an unusual way to draw in new investors. Wait for a few adverse rumours and, after an initial fall, the shares might end higher than before. This was the case early this week when Calor found itself the victim of Sunday press reports that a vicious price war had broken out in the bottled gas market. Esso, it was claimed, was moving in on Calor's patch by selling bottled gas for less than half price. This would inevitably destroy Calor's margins, and almost certainly erode its more than 50 per cent market share. The reports puzzled Calor's executives, who had spent the weekend hosting their so-called arch rivals at the Gatcombe Park Horse Trials. The reports also puzzled the financial community, which could not understand Esso's allegedly aggressive attempts to take share in a mature market firmly dominated by a single player. Nevertheless, the immediate reaction was to sell the shares and ask questions later. It now appears that the 'price war' was little more than retailers' normal summer discounting of cylinders traditionally used for winter heating. There is also a huge price difference between cylinders sold to stockists and those sold to individual consumers. Fierce competition has been a fact of life for almost 10 years in the UK liquid petroleum gas (LPG) market. Prices have been squeezed by the arrival of aggressive new entrants in the mid-1980s and by declining demand as central heating replaced mobile heaters and more homes were connected to the British Gas network. LPG is also a very local market, with producers, in general, serving specific regions. Esso, for example, operates largely in the south of England. This allows national suppliers such as Calor to price according to local competition. Calor has met the pricing problem by tackling costs. Over the last two years, the group estimates it has reduced these by some 20 per cent. Last year, Calor reported to its shareholders that, in spite of lower prices, margins and market share had been maintained as a result of the on-going rationalisation. To add to that success, industry sources say prices of LPG are beginning to stabilise at last. This year, says Esso, prices have stayed at well above the lows of the last two years. For example, the average industry wholesale price for a 47kg cylinder is about Pounds 17-Pounds 18, compared with the lows of Pounds 13. Analysts say Calor is well placed after the ravages of recent years. With a low-cost base and strong balance sheet, the group is able to focus on developing other businesses in growing markets. For example, the natural gas joint venture with Alliance could open substantial opportunities when British Gas loses its monopoly after 1996. Calor also has a growing operation supplying bottled gas to the eastern European markets, and is applying its gas expertise to dispensing beer and soft drinks. While these operations are estimated to be breaking even at the moment, they are expected to start making real returns in the next two to three years. This, say analysts, is at least how long it would take anyone to affect seriously Calor's position in the UK bottled gas market. In the end, the adverse publicity may have done little more than wake investors up to Calor's strengths, says one analyst. The most compelling attraction was probably the dividend, which returns a yield of 6 per cent, against a market average of less than 4 per cent. 'The story got people to look at the company and decide it was cheap,' the analyst says. The revived interest in this closely held stock inevitably led to a jump in the share price on Tuesday. But, by Friday, Calor had drifted back to below its pre-rumour price. Calor is unperturbed. Indeed, it may have learned a useful lesson from the events of the past week. 'We are even thinking of adopting this as a tactic if ever we need new investors,' said one employee, jokingly.</p>

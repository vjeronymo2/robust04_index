			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Tory backs call to return shipyard to public sector Local leaders on Merseyside of the three main political parties are to press the government to take the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead into public ownership. They want Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, to use a compulsory purchase order. The move follows the failure of CSN, the ship repairer trying to buy part of the yard, to conclude a deal by last Thursday. That deadline was imposed by VSEL, the Barrow submarine builder which owns Cammell Laird. Contributory factors were concerns about immunity from future compulsory purchase and availability of a Pounds 2m government grant to help clean the site. However, Mr John Hale, Tory group leader on Wirral Borough Council, puts most blame on VSEL. Mr Hale, who is also a member of Merseyside Development Corporation's board, said VSEL had insisted that CSN also buy Cammell Laird's construction hall when it wanted only its three dry docks and wet basin. VSEL's asking price has not been disclosed, but he said it was a 'grossly exaggerated price'. What has incensed Mr Hale - and Mr David Jackson and Mr Philip Gilchrist, Wirral's Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders respectively - is that the government sold Cammell Laird to VSEL in 1987 for Pounds 1 provided it took over environmental liabilities. The leaders say at least Pounds 2m of environmental work is needed. It includes repairing river defences, clearing dereliction, digging out contaminated ground and demolishing old buildings. Mr Jackson said: 'We want Cammell Laird out of VSEL's hands. We do not believe they really want anyone to buy it.' Successful development of ship repair there might challenge VSEL as it tries to diversify from defence markets. VSEL refused to comment, but said meetings with interested parties were being arranged for the week beginning April 11. The development corporation will meet the following week to consider making a compulsory purchase order.</p>

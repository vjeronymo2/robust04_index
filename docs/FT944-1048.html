			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Observer: In the dark Nice idea. Eurotunnel yesterday took to the UK press to advertise today's opening of Le Shuttle. While the Guardian had to be different, publishing a page from that day's Le Figaro, the other newspapers carried a page of specially commissioned articles by an ex-Figaro journalist. If readers felt the French was a bit beyond them, they were in good company. 'Nobody was meant to understand the French itself,' said commercial director Christopher Garnett. The point was to catch people's attention - with a nice simple, English message on the opposite page. Eurotunnel was initially adamant, though, that the articles were entirely serious. Ah, so the company knows all about the Association of Investigative Journalists that is campaigning for public figures to disclose their wealth at the beginning and end of their terms of office? And the Committee for the Preservation of Parisian Brasseries which is quoted opining on the subject of the soaring price of espresso coffee? Eurotunnel's promotion people should look again at the article about Asterix's 35th birthday, signed by one Bertrand Pigeon - which translates not only as pigeon, but also mug or sucker.</p>

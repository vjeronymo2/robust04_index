			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady as the new account opens - Market Report Share prices put on an encouraging performance yesterday in the first session of the extended three-week Christmas trading account in the UK equity market. Some profits were taken but the final reading of minus 6.7 points on the FT-SE 100 Index was less than the technical downward adjustments required by dividend payments on stocks in the Footsie 100-share list. Earlier in the session, the Footsie had bounced from the 3,248 area to end the day at 3,254.6. Ex-dividend adjustments bedev-illed the market in early dealings, when some traders claimed that the Seaq screens were slow to disclose the technical fall in the market. After edging ahead by nearly 7 Footsie points at first, the market drifted lower until taking a body blow from Fisons. The drug and scientific equipment group announced a dividend cut, along with restructuring moves and the departure of the chief executive. Other factors subduing equities included the looming deadline for a solution of the Gatt world trade dispute and the prospect of expiry on Friday of the December contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which has played such a significant role in leading the stock market recently. The premium on the December future contract, which has to be in line with the stock market on Friday morning, was reduced yesterday, but the March contract, which will take over from December as the futures leader, remained at a good premium against cash. London was also cautiously in line with continental European bourses, which were awaiting the meeting on Thursday morning of the Bundesbank policy council in the hope of a cut in German interest rates. However, London's confidence that UK base rates will be reduced early in the new year appeared undisturbed. Buyers continued to push the second line stocks ahead and, in spite of the heavy fall in Fisons shares, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 6.3 up at a new peak of 3,607.6. Traders reported a programme deal, worth around Pounds 100m, across the range of equities. Seaq volume dipped to 653.8m shares from the 862.5m on Friday, when retail business was worth Pounds 1.8bn, well to the top end of this year's daily ranges. Retail business topped Pounds 6bn last week, confirming the highly profitable levels of activity in UK equities. The stock market was helped by a recovery in major oil stocks behind a rally in crude oil prices. Buyers appeared from London early in the session and were joined later by US investors. Pharmaceutical stocks were also in good form. The strongest features at first came in utilities, where electricity generating groups scored further advances after London Electricity announced a significant increase in the dividend payout. However, initial gains were reduced. Uncertainty over the outlook for interest rates in Germany weakened several construction issues. Among the sectors closely linked to domestic interest rates, however, stores did little more than shade easier in unimpressive trade. Brewery and consumer sectors, too, gave up no more than a few pence. Traders commented that the Christmas mood had begun to show itself on the stock market. Although confirmation of a satisfactory outcome to the GATT talks in Geneva will help sentiment, trading volumes are expected to slacken once Friday's futures expiry is out of the way.</p>

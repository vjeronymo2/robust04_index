			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Electrolux Electrolux's empire-building has yet to produce the right result for shareholders. Group sales have almost trebled since the acquisition of Zanussi in 1984. But operating profits last year were barely higher. The 30 per cent rise in the shares this year only makes up ground lost to the Swedish market over the decade. Even allowing for the deeply cyclical nature of its white goods and aluminium businesses, that must be counted as a disappointment. The question is whether yesterday's impressive first-half results mark the moment when the strategy starts to pay off. The operational gearing implied by yesterday's figures is certainly a reason for optimism. Sales increased by an underlying 8 per cent yet operating profits rose by 71 per cent. The manufacturing rationalisation and cost-cutting which depressed profits over the years seem to be bearing fruit. Operating margins of over 6 per cent - last achieved in 1989, against 4.5 per cent in the first half - should be within reach. Competition from the likes of Whirlpool and General Electric could yet upset such calculations. The white goods market has so far been spared the ferocious discounting of consumer electronics. In Europe, though, Electrolux now looks fully capable of defending itself. By adding AEG's appliances business to its portfolio earlier in the year, Electrolux denied its rivals market share and another valuable brand. There is still work to be done; returns in the US remain too low and it is difficult to see what the group brings to aluminium smelting. But these are minor problems compared to those it would be facing if it had sat back and watched the industry restructure.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold dips below Dollars 370 an ounce GOLD TRADED below Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the London bullion market yesterday after an early bout of selling from the Middle East. Gold futures were also knocked back sharply by speculative Middle East sales in early trading on New York's Comex. London's morning fix of Dollars 370.65 a troy ounce marked a fall of Dollars 4.60 on the previous afternoon fix. But the market recovered some of the lost ground, fixing at Dollars 371.45 in the afternoon and closing at Dollars 372.50, a fall of Dollars 2.85 on the day. Trading volume was light. 'The rally has clearly stalled,' said Mr Michael Spriggs, analyst with SG Warburg. At the end of last month gold touched Dollars 380 a troy ounce in London, the highest level for nearly two and a half years. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst with Williams de Broe, said the market needed to consolidate and blow off some of the speculative froth. There had not been much sign of producers coming into the market with forward sales. Mr Spriggs said even those who were bullish about the rally should not be surprised to see some consolidation. There was still no reason in the charts why the price should not go on to Dollars 400 an ounce. However, he was a bear of the market, and argued that the recent rise would prove to be a spike driven by speculative money in the futures and options markets.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Zurich After the excitement generated last week by UBS's news of improved trading income in July and August, and the better than expected six-month figures from Roche, the health products group, on Friday, the Swiss market starts the week in confident mood. All three of the big Swiss banks were out of favour in the aftermath of their first-half results, although there have been signs of renewed interest in recent sessions. Mr Bryan Crossley at Hoare Govett said that while it may not be realistic to expect the Swiss banks to recover the relative standing in the market that they enjoyed back in the mid-1980s, it is much more debatable whether they really deserve to be as much as 30 per cent below their early-1987 peak relative rating. 'In the short term, continuing doubts about trading prospects are likely to remain a drag on share prices,' he said. 'However, we are more optimistic about the earnings outlook for 1995 and it should be borne in mind that 1994 profits will probably end up not too far short of the record levels of 1993, which were widely considered as quite exceptional.' There was still some scope for further easing of loan provisioning requirements as the economic upturn continued, he said, which would have the effect of encouraging a renewed growth of business volumes. Mr Crossley also argued that in a longer-term prospective, the growth in the relative importance of trading income, because of the link with interest rates, has actually reduced the overall volatility of earnings. In the meantime, Ascom, the troubled telecommunications equipment maker, is due to outline the group's new strategy and prospects at a press conference on its first-half results on Thursday. Results for the first quarter gave rise to some encouragement when the company announced that it had avoided an operating loss in the first quarter and that it continued to expect to break even in 1994 and expected to return to profit in 1995.

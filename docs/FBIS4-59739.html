			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani by </F> unidentified correspondent in Rasht, Gilan, on 15 May--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Since you visited all of Gilan  Province during your four-day tour, I would like your assessment  of the current situation in the province.    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] [passage omitted] In the cities we  visited, we saw the people at the highest point of Islamic and  revolutionary zeal. This makes me happy and I pray for these  people who are showing their presence on the scene in this way;  it gladdens the friends of the revolution and disappoints its  enemies.    Of course this presence is something the mass media should  show for everyone to see. I cannot describe it. Satellites  should carry reports on this so that those who think there is a  distance between the people and the officials in Iran can see  the real situation and review their assessments. [passage  omitted on meetings with the disabled, the 'ulema, academicians,  teachers, and other provincial officials, and on some of the  projects inspected]    We inspected the reconstructed areas in Rudbar and Manjil.  It is a great source of pride that in four years this extensive  area in Qazvin and Gilan, where around 240,000 units, including  factories, plants, big bridges, dams, and so on, were destroyed  or badly damaged by quake, have been reconstructed. Some 85 to  90 percent have been reconstructed. Some say 30 percent of the  area has not been reconstructed. But that is not what we saw.  The two cities of Rudbar and Manjil have become two modern  cities with modern boulevards, streets, and strong antiquake  buildings. The people there were extremely happy and satisfied.  [passage omitted]    We visited an exhibition in Rasht organized for our visit.  Over 200 agricultural, animal breeding, fishing, industrial,  handicraft, and other units participated in the exhibition.  [passage omitted] Many of the participants said they are  exporting and cited big export figures. Interesting is that  during the past two years-- since we declared our new foreign  exchange policies--most of these units have stopped meeting  their needs abroad and are supplying their needs from domestic  sources. Some of them still depend on iron smelting and so on  but are waiting for these plants to become operational at home.  Some also complained of a shortage of foreign exchange and raw  materials. But I think that this year they will have no  problems with these. I was extremely impressed with the  industrial face of Rasht. [passage omitted]    In Astara we inaugurated the new building of the Free  Islamic  University. We inspected the cargo-unloading project for trains  arriving in Astara from Azerbaijan. We also inspected the  railway that will link Azerbaijan with Astara and provide a link  with a multipurpose port being built by the Reconstruction  Jihad. This port will be used both for fishing and trade.  Astara is a border city to which we should grant significance.  These projects are necessary there. We are also constructing a  large bridge over the Astara River. [passage omitted]    In Anzali we saw the Mirza Kuchek Khan ship, now forging a  strong passenger route between Iran and the other northern  countries. This ship raises the Islamic Republic's prestige in  the Caspian Sea. I advise our compatriots to seize the tourist  opportunity being offered there.    We also named a protected area at Anzali, next to the sea  and near the existing port. Earlier we approved the plan for  this region at the Supreme Council for Free Trade Zones. The  designation of this area as a protected area needs no Majles  approval. This area can be like one created in Sirjan. But  this one may be stronger because seven or eight countries in the  north can also use it and complement it, since a trade link  between the north and the south needs such an area in the north.  Our second center will be around the gulf of Gorgan and between  Bandar-e Gaz and Bandar-e Torkaman. This plan has been  approved. The only thing that should be done is to designate  the area. [passage omitted]    I said that the devotion and the national and Islamic  sentiment I saw in Gilan was at its peak and could not have been  better. And our nation can see the presence on the scene of the  people in Gilan. This made me think about why these people's  revolutionary zeal is so strong 15 years after the revolution.  I was truly surprised. There is great negative propaganda  against the government, especially because of the high prices  and other problems, which are being raised in newspapers and by  speakers and exaggerated by foreigners, so I thought the people  would be disappointed. But they were so zealous, happy, and  affectionate; this is something I would like to comment on.    The people there are alert and literate. They are among the  most literate people in our country as far as higher education  is concerned. They are very cultured and they can analyze the  situation. They also feel the realities. The coordination  among the clergymen, the deputies, and the management is also  among the effective elements creating this situation. And the  security in the province is truly awe-inspiring. The  law-enforcement forces, the [Islamic Revolution Guards] Corps,  the Basijis, and all those dealing with information and security  have truly done a good job there.    I would like to cite a professor at Gilan University. The  people in Gilan feel that something is being done and that  infrastructural activities are being carried out. They also  hear that activities are being carried out in the fields of  steel, mining, shipping, ports, power plants, and  telecommunications. They see what is going on in their own  province. The people see that many things are being done. They  understand the infrastructural activities and they are hopeful  for the future. This university professor told me that a survey  has shown that not since the Achamaenids and Medes has so much  been done for the country's development. Part of this is  natural, since times have changed and more means for progress  and development are available. But during the past 30-40 years  these same means were not used. The people feel this. Wherever  they go they see a development project being implemented and  capital being invested for the country's development. And they  see this as good will. [passage omitted]    The people see that there is no reason for them to believe  what the enemies say and to be fooled by what the defeatists  say. These are all felt by the people. They understand that  there are high prices in the country too. But they themselves  produce rice and tea. Before the revolution they used to sell  their tea for 35 rials but now we buy tea from them at 570  rials. The same applies to their rice, honey, cattle, and so  on. They understand that when something is bought at a high  price it is sold at a high price. We are not satisfied with  these high prices and we want to stop the profiteers. God  willing, we will start our efforts to end this situation this  year. But the people understand that the prevailing prices are  the solution to the problem. If the price of tea was 30 to 40  rials no one would plant tea. And if rice was 70 to 80 rials no  one would cultivate it. The people understand this. The entire  nation understands this.    At the end of my visit, I thank everyone--the 'ulema, the  deputies, the managers, the law-enforcement forces, the Corps,  the Basijis, the families of the martyrs, and everyone. I hope  we can fulfill the promises we have made during this visit and  tend to the people's affairs better.    God's peace be upon you.</p>

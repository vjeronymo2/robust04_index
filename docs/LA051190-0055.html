			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30-YEAR TREASURY BILLS SELL WELL AT FINALE OF AUCTION  </P> <P> Heavy buying by institutional investors helped bring the final and most  sensitive stage of the government's $30.5-billion Treasury auction to a  successful conclusion Thursday at lower-than-expected interest rates.  </P> <P> The Treasury Department auctioned off $10 billion in 30-year bonds at an  average yield of 8.84% -- 0.04 percentage point less than the average yield on  10-year Treasury bonds auctioned off the day before.  </P> <P> The relatively low yield and warm reception to the sale was a surprise to many  bond traders, who had feared that there would be slack demand for the long-term  securities. Small investors and the Japanese, who bought a substantial portion  of the three- and 10-year Treasury notes sold earlier in the week, were not big  participants in Thursday's auction.  </P> <P> Smaller investors bought a full 23% of the three-year notes on Tuesday but less  than 5% of Thursday's issue. No precise figures are available for Japanese  purchases, but bond traders estimated that they bought about 20% of the  offering, compared to 25% to 30% of the shorter-term securities.  </P> <P> Big institutional investors that apparently had been sitting on substantial  cash reserves stepped in with heavy purchases during and after the auction,  said Anthony Vignola, managing director of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New  York.  </P> <P> "We saw tremendous buying by institutions," added Alan McClymonds, co-manager  of government trading at First Boston Corp. in New York.  </P> <P> Hours after the auction, in fact, buying was so strong in the secondary market  that prices were bid up and yields fell to 8.81%, said Michael Ingraham, senior  vice president and manager of the investment division at Mitsui Manufacturers  Bank in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> That may seem like a tiny change, but these bonds typically sell in large  blocks. The 0.03 percentage point difference amounted to a $3,050 profit for  someone buying $1 million in bonds at the average auction price and selling  only a few hours later, Ingraham added.  </P> <P> The success of the auction helped bolster the government securities market,  which had been languishing for three weeks, bond traders said.  </P> <P> "There was a lot of fear that the market couldn't handle this much new debt,"  McClymonds said. But it is stronger than it usually is after a quarterly  Treasury auction -- a bullish signal, he said.  </P> <P> "If trading keeps up like this tomorrow, I think we are going to see this  market take off," McClymonds said.  </P></p>

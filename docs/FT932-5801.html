			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television It is Derby Day and Channel 4 will show us the race live at 3.45, and all the main events from Epsom in Derby Highlights at 11.05. But it is also the 40th anniversary of the coronation, and it is going to be difficult to avoid. BBC1 begins at 2.20 with extracts from the BBC's original live coverage including the procession from the palace to the abbey, the service and crowning, and the procession through London, in Coronation Day. At 7.00, still on BBC1, comes The Coronation - As If It Were Yesterday, introduced by Sylvia Peters who hosted the BBC output on the day. This is a new documentary recalling the occasion, as is ITV's two-hour Days Of Majesty (8.00) probably the most enticing coronation item since its producers include the excellent Peter Spry-Leverton. Finally, at midnight, comes The Question Of Sovereignty (BBC2) in which a panel including Tony Benn and Enoch Powell discuss how much sovereignty is left to the UK within the EC. Timewatch (8.10 BBC2) talks to Britain's last living hangman and promises 'footage of the last working gallows in Britain'. How nice.</p>

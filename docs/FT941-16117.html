			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Company gains land use reprieve An award-winning company which faced enforcement action to prevent it using former Ministry of Defence buildings on green belt land for storage was yesterday given a reprieve. Mayflower Glass, a manufacturer of decorative glassware which won the Queen's Award for Export in 1992 and 1993, had been threatened with enforcement action by South Tyneside council but now has another six months to resolve its planning problems. Last Friday the company laid off 50 employees, half its workforce, because the planning dispute forced it to reduce stocks. The MoD did not need planning consent because its depot buildings were Crown property. The company bought them in 1985 from the Property Services Agency but has been unable to obtain planning permission. Mr Harry Phipps, chairman and founder, said Mayflower had to have storage space near its factory, which was located just outside the green belt, because it had to transport very delicate, part-manufactured products to and from its warehouse. He said the planning issue had not been considered a problem when the company bought the buildings. After three six-month extensions, the last of which expired on December 31, the council threatened an enforcement notice. But, after a three-hour meeting with the company yesterday, it said it would work to help resolve the problem. Mr Phipps said the 50 laid-off employees would be asked to return to work today.</p>

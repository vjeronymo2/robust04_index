			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. M. Basova, Voronezh Oblast Epidemiological </F> Station]    [Text] Air sampling requires laboratory technicians to  spend a long time in an atmosphere of toxic substances and to  endure a significant physical load. This device is intended to  hold absorbers and filter holders. It can be used by an operator  to take samples while he is located outside the atmosphere of  toxic substances. There is a pin 3 threaded into a hole in cover  2 of an electric-powered aspirator 1 (see figure). A rod 4 made  from Duralumin tubing with an inside diameter equal to the  diameter of the pin is mounted on the pin. The length of the  tubes is varied in height from 60 to 80 cm depending on the air  sampling requirements. A comb 5 made from an angle (50x50x250  mm) is mounted on the free end of the rod. It is secured to the  rod by means of a threaded connection 6, for which purpose the  corresponding hole is drilled into the horizontal part of the  comb. There are holes 7 with a diameter of 20-30 mm in the  horizontal part of the comb for the absorption instruments, and  slots 8 and 9 of different widths in the vertical part to hold  the corresponding types of adapters.    The device can be used to sample air at heights of 160-170  and 95-100 cm--that is, when working in standing and seated  position. The device has enjoyed wide use in public health and  chemical laboratories of Voronezh Oblast.    Izdatelstvo ``Meditsina,'' 1993</p>

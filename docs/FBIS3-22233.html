He was speaking after Jacques Delors, president of the EC's  executive European Commission, told environmentalists earlier  this week that he would continue fighting for the tax to the end  of his presidency on December 31. [passage omitted]    But the EC official said Delors was prepared to concede  exemptions ``to one or two countries'' if necessary to push the  proposal through.    The energy tax aims primarily at reducing vehicle emissions  of carbon dioxide. It was originally supposed to start at the  equivalent of three dollars a barrel of oil and rise to $10 by  the turn of the century. [passage omitted]</p>

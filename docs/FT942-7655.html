			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Chinese newspaper calls for free courts China's top legal newspaper yesterday called for judicial independence, saying Communist party officials still tipped the scales of justice, Reuter reports from Beijing. The Legal Daily's front-page editorial said free courts were essential to developing a market economy. 'The courts have become administrative tools of the government,' the editorial quoted one unnamed court official as saying. 'Judicial rights and administrative rights are combined into one and used against those under government supervision. What kind of appeal can they make?' The newspaper's editorial contradicted usual Communist rhetoric that China's courts and judicial organs operate completely independently from the party and government. While Beijing has sought to strengthen its legal system by issuing new laws, approving law offices and improving education, it has not addressed the question of whether or not the courts are impartial. Many Chinese assume they are not and are run instead on a system of favours rigged to benefit those in power.</p>

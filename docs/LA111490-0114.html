			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NOW WHAT? Overcrowding of the county's jail system is so critical that "I don't  know where we can go from here," says Assistant Sheriff Rocky Hewitt. . . . A  federal court banned additional prisoners in the central jail, forcing inmates  to other facilities. At the honor farm, inmates sleep in tents.  </P> <P> Many are released without bail, some go free before their sentences are up, and  700 are furloughed to jobs. . . . What's next? "Eventually we'll have to  release more serious people," Hewitt says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OVERCROWDED O.C. JAILS  </P> <P> Every county facility has more inmates than authorized by the state. Each  exceeds the state's limit by the following number of prisoners.  </P> <P> Central Woman's Jail: 88  </P> <P> Theo Lacy Jail: 186  </P> <P> Intake Release Center: 216  </P> <P> Central Men's Jail: 222  </P> <P> James Musick Jail: 543  </P> <P> Source: Orange County Sheriff Janet Eastman and Dean Takahashi  </P></p>

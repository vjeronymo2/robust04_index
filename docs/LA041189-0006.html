			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STIEB'S 1-HITTER LEAVES YANKEES FEELING WORSE  </P> <P> After the New York Yankees lost to the Cleveland Indians Saturday, Manager  Dallas Green said, "We stink."  </P> <P> He knows what he is talking about. After losing to the Indians again Sunday,  Green probably thought things couldn't get worse, but they did.  </P> <P> Dave Stieb pitched a one-hitter Monday night and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the  Yankees, 8-0, dropping New York to 1-6, its worst start since 1975.  </P> <P> The crowd at Yankee Stadium was announced as 17,192. Fewer than 5,000 were left  when the game ended. And most of those people were yelling at the home team.  </P> <P> "If I were a fan, I'd be booing, too," Green said. "In fact, I'm booing from  the dugout, but they can't hear me."  </P> <P> Stieb, who closed last year with consecutive one-hitters, has three in his last  four starts.  </P> <P> "There's no secret to it," said Stieb, hit only by Jamie Quirk's solid single  with one out in the fifth inning. "I'm getting all of my pitches over and they  got me a lot of runs, and that usually means a victory."  </P> <P> Jesse Barfield, Fred McGriff and Lloyd Moseby hit home runs for Toronto.  </P> <P> Boston 5, Cleveland 2 -- Nick Esasky hit a home run in his Fenway Park debut  and Wade Boggs keyed rallies with two singles in the Red Sox's home opener.  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker (1-0) allowed no runs and two hits in five innings. Mike  Smithson relieved after a two-run homer by Joe Carter in the sixth and finished  for his second save.  </P> <P> Texas 6, Milwaukee 4 -- Ruben Sierra doubled home the go-ahead run in the 10th  inning as the Rangers spoiled the Brewers' home opener.  </P> <P> Sierra's hit off Chuck Crim (0-1) came after a walk to Rafael Palmeiro. Cecil  Espy hit a single to drive in the final run for the Rangers, who won for the  fifth time in six games.  </P> <P> The victory went to Jeff Russell (1-0), who struck out Robin Yount with two on  and two out in the bottom of the ninth and then retired the Brewers in order in  the 10th.  </P> <P> Pete Incaviglia tied the score for the Rangers with a two-run home run off  Chris Bosio in the sixth.  </P> <P> After Scott Fletcher hit a single in the first, Palmeiro hit his first American  League homer to give Texas a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> But the Brewers rallied with four runs in the second off Charlie Hough, who  allowed three hits and three walks in the inning before being replaced by Brad  Arnsberg.  </P> <P> Rob Deer led off with his second homer to cut the deficit to 2-1. After Hough  walked Glenn Braggs and Bill Spiers, Jim Gantner drove in the tying run with a  single.  </P> <P> Hough, who has lost nine consecutive decisions to the Brewers, walked Mike  Felder to load the bases. B.J. Surhoff hit a single to right, scoring Spiers  and Gantner to make it 4-2.  </P> <P> Arnsberg came in and got Yount to fly out to end the inning.  </P> <P> Kansas City 3, Baltimore 0 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched a three-hitter at Kansas  City, leading the Royals to their 14th consecutive victory over the Orioles.  </P> <P> Kansas City hasn't lost to Baltimore since July 26, 1987, when the Orioles beat  the Royals and Saberhagen, 4-3.  </P> <P> Saberhagen became the first Royal starter to get a victory this season. He  struck out six.  </P> <P> Baltimore rookie Pete Harnisch allowed seven hits and walked five in 7 2/3  innings.  </P> <P> Willie Wilson, who missed two games with with a strained Achilles' tendon,  scored the Royals' first run after he singled leading off the first and took  third on Kevin Seitzer's single.  </P> <P> Danny Tartabull, who sat out a game with a bruised heel suffered in a collision  Saturday, drove in Wilson with a sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Seattle 6, Chicago 5 -- Dave Valle tripled off an overhead speaker in the  Kingdome to drive in the go-ahead run in a three-run seventh inning and the  Mariners held on to beat the White Sox in their home opener.  </P> <P> Valle's pinch-hit off Ken Patterson was headed for the left-center field stands  when it hit one of the six speakers suspended from the ceiling, 132 feet above  the field. Valle, trying for an inside-the-park homer, was thrown out.  </P> <P> Omar Vizquel then walked, stole second and scored when Harold Reynolds singled  for a 5-3 lead. Ken Griffey Jr. walked and Alvin Davis singled to score  Reynolds.  </P></p>

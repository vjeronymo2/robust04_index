			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Car output to be cut as sales fall CAR MARKET leader Ford is to cut production at its Halewood plant on Merseyside for a month because of the continuing slump in new-car sales. Peugeot Talbot is also to cut production by 7 per cent, with the loss of about 100 jobs, after its 3,000 employees return from their summer break. It says this is because of changes at its Ryton manufacturing plant near Coventry in preparation for building a second model and not because of economic factors. Main rivals Vauxhall and Rover Group said yesterday they had no plans for cutbacks. While Vauxhall forecast that it could achieve record production this year, Rover warned that if August sales were significantly below the 400,000 for which the manufacturers hope, the industry could have no choice but to cut output later in the year to prevent stocks building up. The cutbacks were disclosed as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and the Central Statistical Office jointly released statistics showing that, in spite of the severe slump in new-car sales this year and weakening exports, car production in the first six months, at 686,763, was only 1.1 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago. Total car production for June, at 129,219, was 3.31 per cent higher than in June last year. The statistics also show a sharp rise in commercial vehicle production for the first half, up 24.72 per cent to 138,384 from 111,440, and up 49.3 per cent in June, to 27,493 from 18,414. Unlike cars, the expansion in commercial vehicle production was export driven, and largely because of the start of production on Ford's new light-van ranges. Ford is to abandon the night shift at Halewood for four weeks after the end of the three-week summer shutdown. By doing so, it will lose output of around 500 Escort and Orion models a day. When two-shift working resumes, it will be on a four-day-week for a further two weeks before production returns to normal five-day working. Peugeot Talbot, denied its cutbacks were market linked. It had sold 5,000 more Peugeot 405s this year and seems to be heading for a record market share. The relatively high production figures for the first half reflect preparations for an August sales bulge - expected to be 30,000 units higher than last year's 370,000 - and predictions of an overall recovery for the market in the second half. Both hopes now appear to be fading.</p>

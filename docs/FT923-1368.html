			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: Michelin's return to profit fails to satisfy the bourse MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre-maker, yesterday announced a turnround approaching FFr2bn to report a net profit of FFr820m (Dollars 162m) in the first half of the year against a FFr1.06bn loss a year earlier. The improvement came mainly from savings following 11,400 job losses and a reduction in stocks to 23 per cent of annual sales by the end of June (from 26 per cent of turnover a year earlier). Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, said Michelin will have lost 16,000 jobs by the end of this year, when the lay-offs will be complete. The turnround was 'more than satisfying', he said, though all Michelin's main competitors had also improved their performance this year. However, the stock market had expected a bigger recovery, and Michelin's share price price fell by FFr4.7 to FFr199.8 as analysts revised down their full-year profit forecasts. Michelin's improvement came on a sluggish tyre market, with volume sales up by a mere 3 per cent. It managed to increase prices for replacement tyres in the second quarter by between 3 per cent and 7 per cent in Europe and slightly less in North America. Michelin does not divulge prices of new tyres supplied to car-makers. Group turnover rose by 5.6 per cent to FFr34.8bn from the first half of 1991, or by 8 per cent adjusting for currency changes, on which operating costs were steady at FFr32.88bn. Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere said: 'For the coming months, we continue to expect small growth in the world tyre market.' The group had held its 20 per cent share of the world tyre market but lost unspecified market share in North America because of the closure of two out-dated factories belonging to Uniroyal Goodrich, the US tyre-maker which Michelin bought two years ago. However, Michelin planned to increase production capacity there to compensate, added Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere. A capital increase this year could not be ruled out, but Mr Bourdais de Charbonniere noted the stock market 'recently has not been encouraging'. Michelin has in the past hinted that it would make a rights issue as soon as its performance had recovered.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Shipper forces lower port tariff ATLANTIC Container Line yesterday forced lower charges on Mersey Docks and Harbour Company in exchange for an agreement to keep using the Port of Liverpool for four years. Bilspedition, ACL's Swedish owner, wants to sell the loss-making shipping line. The deal includes Hapag Lloyd, with which ACL has a five-year cargo sharing agreement. Other shipping companies have been making similar agreements to try to counter the downturn in transatlantic trade. ACL hopes more shippers will take space on its vessels to take advantage of the lower charges. It says this should bring more volume to Liverpool to help compensate for lower unit revenue. Neither ACL or Mersey Docks would say how much Liverpool has had to drop prices to keep its position as ACL's sole UK port for its weekly service to the north American ports of Halifax, Nova Scotia; Portsmouth, Virginia; Baltimore, Maryland and New York. Mr Wieger Koornstra, ACL's executive vice-president, has negotiated lower prices with Gothenburg in Sweden and is in talks with Le Havre in France. He said there was an imbalance in cost-sharing between shippers and carriers which could not go on. Liverpool hopes partially to offset its tighter deal with ACL by exploiting the port's developing role as a transatlantic hub redistributing cargoes to and from the Iberian peninsula, the eastern Mediterranean and West Africa. Mr Trevor Furlong, Mersey Docks managing director, said securing an ACL deal, in the light of the recession and uncertainty, was critical to the UK manufacturing industry - 45 per cent of which is within half a day's drive of the port. The port has reduced turnround time for trucks to 40 minutes to ensure companies as far south as Coventry minimised transport costs. ACL's five 57,000-tonne container ships are each turned round within a single tide. Mr Koornstra said the seaborne transatlantic trade balance favoured the US with 20 per cent more eastbound cargoes.</p>

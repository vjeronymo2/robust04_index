			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 28 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Managua's Radio  Catolica executives reported today that unidentified persons  stole station transmitter equipment and spares, "leaving it off  the air" for an undetermined amount of time. The station is  owned by the Managua Archbishopric.    The thiefs "took several spares and an FM link used for  normal broadcasts," the source added, after reporting that the  theft took place at the transmitter site in the southeast  outskirts of Managua.    The police have already been notified of the incident and  have initiated the pertinent investigations, said one of  "Catolica's" board members, but he did not disclose the value of  the stolen equipment.    Radio Catolica is owned by the Nicaraguan Episcopal  Conference, whose president is Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.</p>

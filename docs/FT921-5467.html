			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Polly Peck creditors to meet with administrators next week Creditors of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit, electronics, and leisure group, are to meet the company's administrators on Thursday next week for an informal discussion about how different categories of creditor should be paid. No shareholders are being invited to the meeting and only creditors who have claims of more than Pounds 10,000 may attend. There are thought to be about 300 of these. Mr Michael Jordan of Cork Gully, one of the group's three administrators, is expected to explain that the administrators have had to take legal advice about whether Dollars 400m raised at the time of the rights issue early in 1990 for the purchase of Sansui, the Japanese consumer electronics group, was routed through PPI Holdings, a holding company in the Dutch Antilles. 'The implications of which company the funds were routed through are quite considerable for creditors,' the administrators said yesterday. He declined to comment on how much of a pay-out creditors can expect to receive, but it appears that any payment for creditors owed less than Pounds 10,000 will probably be very small. He said that Polly Peck creditors 'might have to take their own decisions' as a result of the information that will be provided. A decision on which course of action should be taken may emerge from the next Polly Peck creditors' meeting, due on March 31.</p>

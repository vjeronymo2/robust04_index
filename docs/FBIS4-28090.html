			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai said Wednesday [8 Jun] he thinks the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was  not making specific demands on Japan in its statement released  the previous day.    The OECD, which on Tuesday began a two-day ministerial  conference in Paris, suggested in the statement that countries  whose economies are not recovering from recession should adopt  further financial easing and fiscal measures.    "There certainly are such phrases (urging the measures) here  and there. However, I don't think the wording means that they  want Japan to specifically make additional efforts in its  policies," Kumagai said.</p>

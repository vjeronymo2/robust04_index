			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Attempts To Buy Time and  Prospects for Peace Process," AL-BA'TH writes: With the peace  process deadlocked and continually coming up against Israeli  intransigence, it is legitimate to ask about the lengths to  which Yitzhaq Rabin will go in his procrastinating and  temporizing tactics.    As the personal envoy of the Russian president continues his  talks in the region about the peace process, there is talk that  the American secretary of state will make a new Middle East tour  by mid- June to break the logjam in the peace process and  possibly to work out a date to restart the bilateral talks.    Israel's posture on the peace process is as negative and  rejectionist as ever, and it continues to pursue separate and  incomplete deals, thus locking Washington's and Moscow's efforts  into a vicious circle.    Syria has made it clear over and over that it is committed  to  the principles and bases of the peace process as laid out by UN  resolutions. Israel's recognition of its failure to promote a  separate settlement with Lebanon, Syria, or Jordan is evidence  that the peace process needs to proceed along the principles and  bases on which it was launched.    It is vital that the way to deal with the equivocating and  temporizing Rabin government be rethought. This is because  neither the peace process nor the general state of affairs in  the Middle East is advanced by Israel's tactics of buying time,  AL-BA'TH concludes.</p>

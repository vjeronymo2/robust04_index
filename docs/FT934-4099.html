			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Project to support sales to Continent The British Chambers of Commerce in Continental Europe has launched a support service to help small and medium-sized UK companies win business on the Continent. The organisation, which operates in 11 European countries and has more than 6,000 members, has agreed to provide information and assistance to companies which want to start selling in Continental markets. Companies will be able to enlist the help of staff nominated in each local chamber to analyse local market opportunities and to identify potential customers. Mr John Major, the prime minister, has endorsed the move, which will be supported by several government departments. Mr Michael Ingham, president of the council of the British chambers, said: 'It is of the utmost importance, especially to small and medium-sized companies, that there is a group of people throughout Europe ready to assist them penetrate those markets.' He said the level of support for British exporters in Europe had generally compared unfavourably with that provided to their European competitors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] China's trade quota will be cut when the European  Community replaces national trade restrictions with  Community-wide measures next week; but Britain is arguing  against trade barriers not only in Europe, but in the United  States as well. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Chief Secretary Anson  Chan will lobby for unconditional renewal of China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status when she visits  Washington. Jenny Lam reports:    [Begin recording] [Lam] The chief secretary will set out to  the Americans the importance to Hong Kong of unconditional  renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status, in  Washington and New York.    [Chan] We don't think that in principle it is right to use  trade as a tool to achieve other objectives.    [Lam] The U.S. wants China to show improvements in human  rights before deciding whether MFN can be renewed in June. But  for Hong Kong no MFN means up to 75,000 jobs here may be lost.  The blow will be even more devastating if Chinese trade is in  jeopardy not only with the U.S. but with the European Union as  well. Trade restrictions which apply to all 12 member states of  the Union will replace national ones next week. China will have  her quota cut on seven types of products, including 20 percent  in the toy industry.    [Etienne Reuter of European Union Office in Hong Kong,  identified by screen caption] Given that out of a total of more  than 7,000 national restrictions in the world, 4,700 concerned  China, I would say that the trade with China is probably the  most, you know, concerned with this issue.    [Lam] Britain was the only country in the Union which voted  against slapping trade restrictions on China. The British  ambassador to China [Sir Robin McLaren] made clear his country  is keen to maintain a cordial relationship with Beijing despite  political differences:    [McLaren] The British Government attaches enormous  importance to this area as a whole and is devoting, and I'm sure  will continue to devote, a great deal of diplomatic effort to  it, and I'm sure that that will continue after 1997, just as the  British government will continue to attach enormous importance  to Hong Kong after 1997.    [Lam] Sir Robin added that so far, Sino-British trade is  business as usual, with no sign of Britain being singled out for  discrimination. Jenny Lam, TVB News. [end recording]</p>

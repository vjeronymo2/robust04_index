			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peteris Zvidrins, Academician of the Latvian </F> Academy of Sciences: "Demographic Situation Worsening: Almost  One Quarter of a Million of Latvia's Inhabitants Have No Family  Members -- They Are the So-Called Singles."]    [Text] Four years ago the former Supreme Soviet adopted the  declaration of independence. The half-Latvian Latvia is still  not completely free today, but it will be soon. The last  thousands of Russian army soldiers and officers, and some of  their family members, will leave Latvia soon.    The statistical data have been summarized for the results of  the natural movements and migration in the past year. As was  expected, the outcome is not too appealing. In addition, this  year has started with an even bleaker picture.    There were 14,595 marriages registered last year, which was  over 400 marriages less than in 1992. As a comparison, there  were over 25,000 marriages concluded in the years 1986 - 1988.  In the first quarter of this year, there were almost two-fold  less marriages registered in comparison with the previous year.  Thus, at the end of this year, a new record with  long-term negative results is expected.    Of course, this attitude taken by young people towards  marriage and the formation of a family is not accidental. It is  a reaction to today's difficult socio-economic situation in the  nation. We can also agree with the viewpoint of the famous  Toronto psychotherapist, Voldemars Gulens, that an important  role in demographic apathy is played by the relationship between  the government and society. These days, more and more young  people do not wish to formalize marriages, and the so-called  consensual marriages, where the partners do not register, are  becoming increasing more popular in Latvia. These are  encountered quite often in Scandinavia and various other Western  countries. Still, they do not have a firm basis in our country  and, as we will see later, they cannot compensate for the lack  of births in registered marriages.    Furthermore, there is a rather high rate of marital  instability in our country. It is true that the number and  frequency of divorces were at a lower level last year than in  1992, when of every 100 marriages, 77 ended in divorce. Last  year, this indicator fell to 70, but was still the highest in  the world. It is characteristic that every fourth person  divorces repeatedly. Apparently our present-day society is  thoroughly tainted by egotism.    More than 5 years have elapsed since the last population  census. Until the next one, which will most likely take place in  1999, there are almost 5 years remaining. Data on the  composition of the population are not as precise as they were  right after the census. Nevertheless, we have been able to make  certain calculations, acquiring additional data on family  numbers and composition, as well as a distribution of the  population according to family status.    At present, there are slightly more than 700 thousand  families in Latvia. There is a trend towards a decrease in this  number, especially with respect to large families.    Almost one quarter of a million of Latvia's inhabitants have  no family members, and they are the so-called singles. Almost  2/3 of these are women, and in addition, there are quite a few  of the latter (about 90 thousand) who are 60 years of age and  older. But a good proportion of the singles are capable of  marriage and are of reproductive age.    Of those who are 16 years of age and older, 67 percent of  men  and 55 percent of women are married, while 21 percent of men and  15 percent of women have never been married. Among women, there  is a high proportion of widows (18 percent) and also divorcees  (11 percent). The respective figures for men are 3.8 percent and  8 percent.    The majority of our families are very small. In two out of  three of our families, there are 2 (this is the majority) or 3  family members. Nevertheless, 78 thousand families have 5 and  more members. Due to the high rate of divorce, as well as the  large discrepancy between the lifespans (mortality) of men and  women, there is a relatively high number of so-called incomplete  families, i.e., a family with only one spouse. And the  demographic situation is predominantly determined by the welfare  of the family.    Particular interest is paid by demographers and society to  generational changes over time, especially the dynamics of  births. Unfortunately, the past year was the bleakest in  our century, with the exception of some of the war years. Only  26,759 children were born in Latvia in 1993, which is almost 5  thousand children less than in 1992. Not very long ago --in  1986 and 1987 -- the number of births was 42 thousand. In the  first quarter of this year, there have been one-fourth less  births registered than at the same time of last year. Thus, the  decline in births is continuing on a very severe course. For  1986 - 1988, births per 100 women in their lifetime equalled 210  to 215 children, in 1990, the birth rate was characterized by  202 births, in 1991 -- by 186, in 1992 -- by 173, but in 1993 --  by about 150. We can almost certainly say that the indicator for  this year will be perceptibly lower than in the prior year.  Therefore, at the present time, there are less children coming  into this world than ever before. It is possible that nowhere is  the birth rate as low as it is in Latvia. In any case, the  present birth rate is lower by one third than what is necessary  the maintain a level changeover to the next generation.  According to evaluations, the determining factor for this  decline is the previously mentioned basic decrease in the number  of marriages, and well as in marital fertility, both in urban  and rural families. The positive effect of the increase in the  proportion of rural inhabitants is not able to compensate for  the basic losses occurring in young families as a result of  present-day instability in welfare and the rather uncertain  future.    Unfortunately, an even more unappealing picture is revealed  in the analysis of the people's health and longevity. The  total number of deaths for last year (39,197 persons) was the  highest ever in Latvia's existence as a state. During 1993,  it increased by almost 4 thousand people. And this occurred  despite the fact that the number of inhabitants in our country  decreased by 40 thousand people.    The severity of the situation is also evidenced by the fact  that last year the number of deaths outweighed the number of  births by 12,438 persons. Relatively speaking, this situation of  depopulation can be characterized by these simple figures: last  year, for every two births there were three deaths. This year  has started in an even more tragic manner: deaths exceed births  by 76 percent. This author, who was working on the preparation  of United Nations conference documents in New York just one  month ago, was able to confirm that nowhere else in the world is  the situation any worse. In one graphic illustration, which was  prepared for the Cairo Conference on Inhabitants and  Developments (which will take place in the beginning of  September), Latvia is specially shown as the nation with the  highest mortality rate. It is true that not too far behind us  are our neighboring countries of Lithuania and Estonia, as well  as Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, and a few others with negative  natural population changes. Still, the number of these countries  in the world can be counted on the fingers of both hands.    The common mortality indicator -- the national average  lifespan has fallen for the sixth year in a row, and it has been  below 70 years since 1990. Last year, it quite honestly did not  even reach 68 years ( 68.7 years in 1992), while in the rural  areas, it declined to 60 years for men. Thirty years ago, the  incidence of mortality was quite a bit lower, and the average  lifespan for a newborn was calculated to be 71 years, while  girls could hope to surpass a threshold of 75 years. We have now  been thrown back to the level that existed in the mid 1950s...    In the past few years, there has been a perceptible increase  in the incidence of unnatural deaths, indicating an  unsatisfactory situation in society. In 1992, 4,485 persons died  in accidents, from poisoning and trauma, and there were even  more last year. Since 1989, the suicide rate has increased  regularly, and it exceeded 1,000 for the first time last year.  The number of deaths due to traffic accidents is also very high,  as is the number of murders.    Society is being affected by the new boom in widespread  alcoholism. Negative trends are also being noted with respect to  drug addiction. Medical treatment centers report to have about  40 thousand patients who are alcoholics and drug addicts, and  report even more psychiatric patients. Unfortunately, a good  proportion of our officials, whose direct duty is to help  promote moral values by preventing the degradation of the  nation's intellectual capacity are taking the easy route out.    With an increase in emigration by noncitizens and also, in  part, by the assimilation of other nationalities, the proportion  of Latvians in Latvia is increasing. Until now, the migration  balance of inhabitants of Latvian nationality has been positive,  overall, although the numerical increase has been small. In the  year 1992, the number of deaths among Latvians was higher by  several hundred than the number of Latvian newborns. Last year,  this negative number increased almost eight-fold. For 1993, it  has been estimated at minus 4,429. Thus, again the numerical  representation of the Latvian people has started to decline, and  at present it is slightly less than 1,400,000. It is true that  the number of non-Latvians is decreasing even more rapidly,  which is why the Latvian proportion of the total population has  reached 54.5 percent (at the beginning of 1989, it was 52  percent). It is most likely that this unique phenomenon, whereby  the Latvian population is declining in number while its  proportion in relation to the total population is increasing,  should continue for a few more years. For the end of the  century, we can hope that the birth rate will rise and that we  will overcome the depopulation situation. First for Latvians  (whose birth rate is slightly above the national average, and  whose mortality rate --slightly lower) and then for the  population of various other nationalities. But with the  provision that the national demographic policies are  sufficiently active.    Already in my earlier popular science articles, I had  expressed my dissatisfaction with the passive position held by  the state on solving demographic problems. Little has been done  in the past few years to improve the situation. Just very  recently, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia  issued an order on the creation of the Demographic Commission.  It is regrettable that the resolutions on the Demographic  Commission and the National Program were not made much earlier.  We should remember that similar resolutions were adopted even  during the Soviet period, and they had a positive impact,  overall. Demographic processes have an inert character, and  every month of delay creates major losses in the living force,  depleting the potential of a small people.    The present situation of our national economy does not  provide hope for any type of perceptible demographic improvement  in the next few years, but it is within the power of society to  arrest the further disintegration of the demographic situation  and to initiate a program of action for the improvement of  people's health and family welfare, insuring a level changeover  to the next generation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government  welcomed the conclusion of free elections in South Africa [RSA]  Tuesday and looked forward to stronger bilateral relations after  the end of apartheid.    South Korea "commends the firm determination and efforts of  South African leaders, both black and white, who have wisely  overcome the long disharmony between the races and have made  this election a reality," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang  Ki-ho.    "Furthermore, the Government of the Republic of Korea is of  the view that the present elections provide historic momentum  for bringing about an end to the 342-year legacy of minority  white rule over the majority black population, and the regime of  apartheid," he said.    South Korea "looks forward to further strengthening the  already existing friendly relations between our two countries  through the momentum created by the free elections in South  Africa," Chang said.    Seoul and Pretoria established diplomatic ties in December  1992.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKWELL REVAMPS DEFENSE ELECTRONICS UNIT FOR 3RD TIME  </P> <P> Rockwell International Corp. said Thursday that it has reorganized its defense  electronics operation again in a move aimed at further streamlining the  business and boosting weapons sales in the United States and abroad.  </P> <P> The move marks the third time since July that Rockwell has announced a  reshuffling of its Anaheim-based Defense Electronics unit, which is headed by  John A. McLuckey, group president.  </P> <P> The changes will not result in any layoffs or relocations, and the company will  not take a charge against earnings as a result of the restructuring, said Ron  Duncan, an executive vice president of the group, which employs 7,000 people in  Anaheim.  </P> <P> The reorganization is designed to help the defense electronics group handle  several major contract programs the company has won in the past several years  more efficiently, Duncan said. For instance, two divisions that make navigation  systems for missiles and submarines will be combined into a single division.  </P> <P> The group's largest programs include contracts for the Hellfire missile, F-111  aircraft avionics gear, a combat system for a Royal Australian Navy submarine  program and guidance devices for the MX and Midgetman missiles.  </P> <P> "The new organization will focus our core competencies on the global markets we  now serve, as well as emerging business opportunities," McLuckey said. "This  streamlining effectively restructures 17 former business segments into 14  more-focused market thrusts."  </P> <P> George Podrasky Jr., an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago, said it  was unclear whether the restructuring would leave the company better prepared  to deal with the defense downturn. He said Rockwell's defense unit, which  accounted for about $1.7 billion of the corporation's $12 billion in revenue  last year, still has a healthy mix of programs.  </P> <P> "They've been disappointed with the profits of the defense electronics area,  but I don't know how this will change things," he said.  </P> <P> Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los  Angeles, said the restructuring makes sense because the company had several  units, such as its missile and submarine navigation businesses, reporting to  different groups.  </P> <P> Harris said the defense electronics unit will have about $2 billion in sales  under the new organization. He said he expected the group to report flat sales  and profits for the next several years.  </P> <P> The company's defense group has been growing since last July, when the missile  systems groups were combined under the Autonetics Electronics Systems unit in  Anaheim. In March, the defense electronics group was created by combining the  former Autonetics Electronics Systems and Collins Defense Communications  businesses.  </P> <P> Last week, the company added Collins Government Avionics Division in Cedar  Rapids, Iowa, to the electronics group. The Collins unit makes avionics and  radio systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RESTRUCTURING AT ROCKWELL  </P> <P> International Defense Electronics  </P> <P> Top Executive: John McLuckey, president  </P> <P> Headquarters: Anaheim  </P> <P> Employees: 26,000  </P> <P> Autonetics Marine &amp; Aircraft Systems  </P> <P> Headquarters: Anaheim  </P> <P> Top Executive: Ken McQuade, vice president and general manager  </P> <P> * Military aircraft avionics and systems  </P> <P> * Shipboard information networking and combat systems  </P> <P> * Antisubmarine warfare systems, including unmanned underwater vehicles  </P> <P> Autonetics Strategic Systems  </P> <P> Top Executive: Tom Gunckel Jr., vice president and general manager  </P> <P> Headquarters: Anaheim  </P> <P> Intercontinental ballistic missile guidance and control  </P> <P> Shipboard navigation and control, for both submarines and surface ships  </P> <P> Strategic command and control, and security systems  </P> <P> Tactical Systems  </P> <P> Top Executive: Paul Smith, vice president and general manager  </P> <P> Headquarters: Duluth, Ga.  </P> <P> Battlefield weapons  </P> <P> Long-range guided weapons  </P> <P> Tactical sensors  </P> <P> Collins Defense Communications  </P> <P> Top Executive: Jack Cosgrove, president  </P> <P> Headquarters: Cedar Rapids, Iowa  </P> <P> Advanced ground, sea, airborne and  </P> <P> John A.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olga Koroleva: "Rutskoy Has Not Left Politics"] </F>   [Text] Former Russian Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy,  released from Lefortovo prison in late February, is still  avoiding public statements and meetings with journalists.  Nonetheless, he recently delivered a speech at a closed session  of the Free Russia People's Party [FRPP], of which he is the  chairman. He introduced a number of comments and suggestions to  the drafts of the party's policy statement and statute, which  are to be adopted at the second FRPP congress in late May this  year:    "We must determine more precisely our party's aims and ways  of achieving them in order to attract as many supporters as  possible to our side -- for victory at the forthcoming  presidential and parliamentary elections. Our party must be  mass-based. Achieving this will be hard but feasible: After  all, in all corners of Russia there are people in sympathy with  us...."    A. Rutskoy announced that he is now working on the books  Collapse of Power [Krusheniye derzhavy] and  Acquiring Faith [Obreteniye very] which he began  writing in his cell in Lefortovo prison. In the next few months  the book Collapse of Power will be completed.</p>

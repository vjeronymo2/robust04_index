			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Murdoch faces up to mortality: Likely successors at News Corporation Media tycoons are dangerously prone to imagine themselves immortal. But when they cannot banish thoughts of mortality the next best thing is to establish a dynasty and try to maintain control beyond the grave. Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of The News Corporation, one of the world's largest media organisation is 62. Although he is fit and active, he is being pressed to spell out the succession - what happens when the company can no longer be described as Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Where, some ask is, the executive of vision within the organisation, if not Rupert Murdoch. Mr Murdoch has been spelling out his hopes in interviews with his Australian papers and at the company's recent annual meeting. 'I don't feel old. I feel very well. I certainly hope that I can keep going at the present pace for another 10 years. I have at least two of my children coming into the business - how well they'll do will have to be judged later. It's no longer a private business,' Mr Murdoch said. His daughter Elizabeth, 25, is a manager in charge of programme acquisition at Fox Television, News Corp's US television network. Lachlan Murdoch, 22 in September, is at Princetown University, but, much more important, spent the summer as a sub-editor on The Sun newspapers in the UK. 'He loved them and they loved him,' said one News International executive. Rupert Murdoch has a soft spot for the The Sun, the UK paper that more than any other was the foundation of his fortune. James Murdoch, 21, is at Harvard University and has worked on the set of the recent Twentieth Century Fox release The Rising Sun. Rupert Murdoch is clear about the advantages his children will hold. They will have the opportunity to show what they can do but their real proving time is probably still a decade away. What if the unthinkable happens and Rupert Murdoch were to fall under a bus? In February 1990, much to the surprise of his senior executives Rupert Murdoch anointed Mr Andrew Knight as his successor. 'People say there is no number two or successor in News Corporation. This is he,' said Mr Murdoch gesturing to Mr Knight, chairman of News International. 'If I should turn out to be mortal,' grinned Mr Murdoch. Asked the same question In August 1992, Mr Murdoch replied: 'I have nothing to add to that or to alter it in any way, except that the children are older.' It seems Mr Murdoch has something to add. He has been suggesting his wife Anna, who would probably have been involved in any succession to represent the family interests, would probably become non-executive chairman. Something else has changed over the past three years. Partly in response to the growing size of the business and in response to the debt crisis which nearly brought the company down three years ago a tier of accomplished managers has been put in place. Under any non-executive chairmanship of Anna Murdoch, a novelist, there would be: Mr Gus Fischer, managing director of News International and chief operating officer of News Corp. He is a German-Swiss businessman who ran a printing industry company in California before coming to Rupert Murdoch's attention Mr Dave DeVoe, New York-based vice-president finance and chief financial officer has established his financial credentials as News Corp pulled back from the brink and is again expanding Mr Arthur Siskind, executive vice-president and general counsel is seen as a weighty lawyer involved in all the important deals. The Australian part of the Murdoch empire operates semi-autonomously under the charge of Mr Ken Cowley. But without Rupert Murdoch where would be the chief executive of vision? Mr Terry Povey, Murdoch-watcher for stockbrokers ANZ McCaughan has no doubt of the answer. 'Mr Sam Chisholm (managing director of British Sky Broadcasting) or Mr Barry Diller. And they can't have Mr Diller because he's gone off to be a Rupert Murdoch in his own right,' said Mr Povey. Mr Diller, former head of Twentieth Century Fox, is running the QVC shopping channels bidding to take over Paramount Studios. 'I would place a small bet that Rupert Murdoch will outlive us all professionally,' Mr Povey adds.</p>

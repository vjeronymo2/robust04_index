			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA does not believe that it would be appropriate to prohibit stand-alone labels from being affixed to vehicle windows. Section 210 expressly provides that the agency must permit manufacturers to use, among other options, a readily visible separate label. A window location is the most practicable location for consumer information labels since a label installed on the inside of the glass can be read from outside the vehicle, yet is also protected from the elements. In addition, affixing labels to exterior painted surfaces could damage the paint. While NHTSA recognizes the importance of driver visibility, it observes that since a stand-alone label would be very small, such a label could be placed in an area where it would have little or no impact on visibility. The agency notes, in response to Toyota's comment, that stand-alone labels are not required to be on the same window as the Monroney label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is adopting format requirements that are similar to those in the NPRM, but with some minor changes. The agency is requiring the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' for all labels. The agency notes that the NPRM preamble suggested that the heading would only be required for content labels included as part of other labels. However, the agency believes that a heading is useful for all labels, since it draws attention to the information and identifies its purpose. The agency believes the word ``parts'' is appropriate for reasons discussed earlier in this preamble. NHTSA also notes that the wording of the explanatory note has also been changed and the word ``parts'' has been added after ``engine'' and ``transmission,'' for reasons discussed earlier in the preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA agrees that manufacturers should be permitted to include the content label as part of any larger labels meeting the specified location requirements, since this increases manufacturer flexibility without lessening the usefulness or visibility of the content information. The agency disagrees, however, that it should drop all of the proposed format and size requirements. Without such requirements, manufacturers might use fine print that is not easily read. Similarly, the agency believes that the label would be harder to read if multiple items of information were placed on the same line. NHTSA is not adopting the proposed requirement that certain information be underlined, since it agrees that the use of capital letters and bold type provides sufficient emphasis. The agency is adopting minimum type size requirements. The agency is not adopting any overall size requirement for a separate label, since it believes that the minimum type size requirements are sufficient to ensure that the content label will be visible and easily read. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Attachment of Label <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to affix the content label to each new vehicle before the vehicle is shipped from the final assembly point to the dealer, shipping agent, or importer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virtually all of the vehicle manufacturers requested more flexibility as to when the label must be affixed to the vehicle, and relied on the same basic arguments. They noted that section 210(b) does not expressly require manufacturers to attach the label but instead specifies that each manufacturer shall ``cause to be affixed'' the required label. The manufacturers also noted that section 210(c) specifies that manufacturers must be permitted the option of including the content information as part of the Monroney or fuel economy label, and indicated that, for imported vehicles, these labels are ordinarily affixed at the port of entry, a distribution center or the dealership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the manufacturers requested that the label be required to be affixed prior to the delivery of a vehicle to the dealership. AAMA requested that the label be required to be affixed prior to a motor vehicle being ``offered for sale to an ultimate purchaser.'' Ford commented that some vehicles which are shipped to dealers prior to introduction dates are only consigned to the dealer, and the dealer does not take possession until the vehicle is invoiced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to an inquiry from NHTSA concerning when Monroney labels are affixed, the Justice Department noted that manufacturers are required by statute, ``prior to the delivery of any new automobile to any dealer, or at or prior to the introduction date of new models delivered to a dealer prior to such introduction date'' to affix the Monroney label. That Department noted that the language requiring the Monroney label be affixed ``prior to the delivery'' is straightforward and places the responsibility squarely on the manufacturer. With respect to the ``introduction date'' exception, however, the Justice Department indicated that models are introduced at varying times and vehicles may sometimes arrive at a dealership several months ahead of the ``introduction date'' minus the Monroney labels. The Department stated that this makes compliance problematic at times and raises enforcement issues that NHTSA may wish to consider. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to generally require labels to be affixed prior to the delivery of a vehicle to the dealer, but to provide an exception for vehicles delivered to dealerships prior to introduction dates. The agency believes it is desirable for labels to be present on vehicles when they are delivered to the dealership, since consumers may see such vehicles at any time after such delivery. There is no reason to require the labels to be affixed any earlier, such as at the final assembly plant, since consumers will not see the vehicles prior to their arrival at the dealership. Since the Labeling Act provides that manufacturers may include the content information as part of the Monroney label, the agency believes it is appropriate to provide the same ``introduction date'' exception as is provided for Monroney labels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Requirements for Suppliers and Related Ones for Manufacturers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, much of the information that manufacturers need to calculate the required items for the label must come from suppliers. Section 210(d) specifies that the agency must issue regulations which include provisions applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether equipment provided by such suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign and to provide such other information as may be necessary to enable the manufacturer to reasonably comply with the provisions of section 210 and to rely on such certification and information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA proposed specific requirements for suppliers. In order to enable manufacturers to calculate the information required for items one and two of the label, i.e., the percentage U.S./Canadian content and major foreign sources of equipment, NHTSA proposed (&sect;583.10) to require outside suppliers to provide the following information for any equipment they supply to a vehicle manufacturer or to an allied supplier: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer or allied supplier; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Whether the equipment has, or does not have, at least 70 percent of its value added in the U.S. and Canada; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

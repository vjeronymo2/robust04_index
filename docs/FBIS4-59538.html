			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with dismissed Prime Minister Haydar </F> Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, in Washington, by unidentified  correspondent; date not given; from the "Weekly File"  program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-'Attas] What is taking place in Yemen is a  tragedy. The war raging there does not serve any of the Yemeni  people's interests. Political differences should not have led  to such a fierce war. This is hurting our people in Yemen and  all their interests. We warned against this. And, refraining  from violence or the use of force to deal with disputes was  consecrated as a principle at the beginning of the political  dialogue during the crisis. Therefore, the situation is  difficult and tragic, and against the Yemeni people's interests,  against their unity, against all the bonds of brotherhood, and  against their economy. Therefore, we are trying by all means to  stop this war and return to the voice of logic and to a dialogue  of reason and conscience.    [correspondent] What about the pledge and accord document  signed in Amman?    [Al-'Attas] One of the aims of the war, in my opinion, is to  contain, circumvent, and renounce this document. It is very  obvious that any military action to deal with the crisis will be  intended to stop dialogue and sound treatment of the crisis, as  stated in the pledge and accord document.    [correspondent] What, Mr. Prime Minister, do you think of  current Arab mediation efforts?    [Al-'Attas] I think the Arab nation has a very large  pan-Arab  responsibility to adopt responsible positions to stop the  bleeding in Yemen and to push all the parties toward responsible  dialogue in order to address the current political problems in  the country, which coincided with the establishment of Yemeni  unity in May 1990. We pinned hopes, and we continue to pin  hopes, on Arab efforts, particularly the Syrian and Egyptian  efforts, as well as those of other Arab countries represented by  the Arab League.    [correspondent] What about the decisions taken by the  leadership in the north to depose several officials?    [Al-'Attas] These are illegitimate unconstitutional, and  secessionist decisions. They cannot resolve the problem  correctly and peacefully. All the decisions by the House of  Representatives and other bodies mean nothing. They only  underscore the desire of the warmongers and the continuation of  this war in Yemen. Once again, I stress that war is against  Yemeni interests and against the interests of the Yemeni  homeland. Therefore, such decisions are meant to sever all ties  and all economic channels. I would like to reiterate that they  are illegitimate and meaningless.    [correspondent] There is also a question abouit the future  of  Yemeni unity. What can you say about this unity?    [Al-'Attas] No doubt, it is in danger. War means work  against unity. We have repeatedly drawn attention to this. We  said resorting to war would mean acting against unity and  against the wishes of the Yemeni people. Unity cannot be  achieved by war or by military victory. I hope the leadership  of the Yemeni people will stop this bloodshed and return to the  language of dialogue and logic and to the language of reason,  not emotions and desires. This is the path that can guide all  Yemenis to the best method to address the problem and the  current political situation in Yemen and find practical  solutions to them.</p>

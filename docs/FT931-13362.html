			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): My aunt's estate When my aunt died many years ago she left her estate in trust to pay the income to a friend for the remainder of her life and, on her death, equally between her nephews and nieces. The will did not include a non-apportionment clause. The life tenant died on June 2 1992 and the trust investments were sold soon after, including useful holdings in Guinness and Shell. Both these companies had then just paid their 1991 final dividends, which were properly paid to the life-tenant. However, the trust solicitors inform us that her estate is entitled to a proportion of the future dividends for the year to December 31 1992, although the finals will not be declared or paid until nearly a year after her death and will not actually be received because the holdings have been sold. We are told strict apportionment must be applied and that we could have delayed the sales until after the dividends had been received, although this would have meant waiting a year for any benefit to be received and taking a chance on the state of the market 12 months hence. Is this right? The trust's solicitors are correct. Section 2 of the Apportionment Act 1870 provides for apportionment on a daily basis of dividends. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

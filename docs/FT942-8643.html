			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Reckitt &amp; Colman shares fall on warning Shares in Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and toiletries group, fell 40p to 634p yesterday after Sir Michael Colman, chairman, gave a blunt trading statement at the annual meeting. A warning of no benefit to the group from economic recovery in 1994 led to analysts cutting profit forecasts. Mr David Saltmarsh, company secretary, said later that the group thought the market had become too optimistic about current year trading and it had decided to use the annual meeting to correct that view. The statement was all the more surprising to the City as Reckitt is usually regarded as a dull and reliable company, not known for causing shocks. At the meeting Sir Michael said that the year had started slowly and 'trading in 1994 is turning out to be as difficult as in 1993'. He added that there was no easing of the 'very tough and competitive conditions' in Europe and North America and it was unlikely that economic recovery in those markets would benefit the company in 1994. He reminded shareholders that Reckitt's products hold up well in the early stages of recession but are slow to pick up as recovery comes through. Last year profits were boosted by the strength of the dollar against sterling, and underlying pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 231.8m to Pounds 260.1m. Analysts had been looking for profits to reach about Pounds 290m in 1994, after stripping out Pounds 19m of interest on the group's convertible bonds. Yesterday, forecasts were cut back by between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m. Kleinwort Benson, for example, cut their forecast by Pounds 12m to Pounds 265m excluding the convertible bond interest. They said the particular surprise in the statement was the caution on North America where profit margins had risen sharply in 1993.</p>

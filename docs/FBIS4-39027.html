			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the Russian </F> Federation Council in Moscow on 2 June -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Esteemed chairman and council members: I am  very happy to have this opportunity to speak at the Federation  Council, which was formed through the first free elections in  the history of Russia, about my views on the future of the ROK  and Russia. I have been deeply interested in the Russian  parliament's giant steps toward creating a new history and  visited in 1989 and 1990 during the period of the former Soviet  Union. [passage omitted]    This time, I have again come to Moscow, a city of beautiful  culture and long history, in order to build ROK-Russian  relations. [passage omitted]    I recognize the potential power of Russia in the fact that  it  repelled invasions by Napoleon and Hitler to be the last  fortress of world peace. Russia was twice the focus of changes  in the world history of the 20th century. Its advanced science  and technology, which launched the world's first space rocket,  were precious assets for mankind. I firmly believe in the great  spirit and potential power of the Russian people who created the  culture and arts that shine today in the history of mankind.    Council members: This morning I exchanged frank  conversations with President Yeltsin. I firmly believe that the  ROK and Russia can become reliable partners for mutual  prosperity in the upcoming 21st century. We can cooperate with  each other for success in each other's ongoing reforms. We can  closely cooperate for the reunification of the Korean peninsula  and for our common prosperity.    The ROK and Russia are today enveloped in the surging waves  of great change and reform. With the collapse of the Cold-War  structure and the settlement of the Uruguay Round negotiations,  the world order is undergoing rapid reorganization. Some people  refer to this as the beginning of an era of globalization, and  others say that the post-industrial era has come to an end.  However they may all be called changes of the times, and  history will make stragglers of not only all countries, but also  all individuals, who remain idle in the existing system.    The ROK and Russia are carrying out reforms, while  surmounting many sacrifices and pains, in order not to become  stragglers in the new era and, furthermore, in order to pioneer  a more stable and affluent era. The ROK is stepping up its  reforms in order to strengthen its competitive power based on  the democratization and economic development it has achieved so  far. With the success of these reforms, the ROK will see a  decisive opportunity for another leap. I firmly believe that  the ROK's reforms will create a new prosperous ROK and achieve a  peaceful, reunified ROK [pyonghwaroun tongil hanguk] without  fail. I pay my respects to the patience and passion [innaesim  kwa yolchong] of the Russian people who are participating in  democratic reforms and new economic construction.    I firmly believe that the sweat and tears shed today by you  council members and Russian people for reform will eventually  bear the fruits of joy and hope. A new, stable, and prosperous  Russia will be a sign to the Russian people, Asian people, and  all the people of the world that a new, mutually prosperous era  has emerged.    Next, I would like to stress the need for the ROK and Russia  to make greater efforts for greater mutual understanding between  them. The ROK and Russia established modern diplomatic relations  in the 1880's. For one hundred years since then there was a  period of friendship and cooperation during which Russia  assisted our independence movement. On the other hand, our  history is also marked by bitter discord and severance.    While Stalin's rule imposed blood and sufferings on the  Russian people, it brought the miserable tragedy of war to the  ROK people. Until ROK-Soviet diplomatic relations were  established in 1990, the ROK and Russia had to suffer a period  of dispute characterized by mutual distrust and hostility, as  evidenced in the shooting down of the Korean Airline plane. We  should rid ourselves of this unhappy past to open a new era of  mutual understanding. Any form of mutual cooperation will be  impossible if we fail to understand one another. I foresee an  era of mutual understanding and cooperation between the two  countries bearing its fruit.    The documents related to the 25 June Korean war that we have  received from the Russian Government this time means the  liquidation of the dark past that existed between the ROK and  the Soviet Union.    The volume of trade, which was $900 million in 1990,  increased to $1.6 billion last year. The ROK people's investment  in Russia amounts to $24 million in 15 cases.    As of March 1994, 29 prominent ROK business firms  established  their branch offices in Russia.    With my current visit to Russia as an occasion, practical  and  substantive cooperative relations will be further expanded  rapidly.    Supplementary economic cooperation and technological  cooperation based on mutual needs will make the ROK and Russia  even closer neighbors. [passage omitted]    The change in the position of Koreans living in Russia is an  important example symbolically showing the change in relations  between the ROK and Russia.    Council members, another task that we should jointly pursue  is to make Asia a zone of peace free from oppression and war.  Peace is a long-aspired desire of mankind. However, mankind  suffered various wars for the past 100 years. In particular,  east Asia has suffered from the imperialists' war of aggression  [cheguk chuui ui chimyak chonjaeng] and from the harsh trial of  the Cold War system during the past century.    The Korean peninsula had to confront such a historical trial  right in the front. The Korean peninsula still remained in the  state of division. The ROK people and I are making consistent  efforts to achieve peace and peaceful reunification of the  Korean peninsula.    Among other things, dispelling [haesosikinuniri] the  international community's suspicion over North Korea's nuclear  weapons development as quickly as possible is important.    This is because peace on the Korean peninsula and, moreover,  peace in Asia can never be ensured without clearly resolving the  nuclear issue. In addition, world peace cannot be ensured either.    The ROK people and I are fully prepared to give economic  assistance to North Korea, which is facing a difficult economic  situation, for its rehabilitation and reforms [chaegongwa  kaehyogul wihae], only if the nuclear issue is resolved.    I sincerely call on Russian parliamentary leaders to  positively cooperate to resolve this issue.    Since I came to office, I planned to visit Russia, the  United  States, Japan, and China, the countries that are exerting the  most important influence over east Asia, and have completed the  visit to three countries except Russia. I asked the government  leaders and people of these nations to actively cooperate for  peace in east Asia, and acquired their support.    Now, I am visiting Russia and sincerely discussing the  measures for peace in east Asia with Russian leaders, including  President Yeltsin. Without Russia's cooperation, peace in east  Asia cannot be ensured. This will be the starting point for  opening a new history of mutual prosperity between the ROK and  Russia.    Cooperation of the Russian Government and parliamentary  leaders for opening the history of peace will expand peace of  the entire world. Let us all unite our strength and become the  main force for opening the era of peace.    I have experience in leading my life as a parliamentarian  for  over 30 years. Therefore, I have special affection and  friendship toward you all. [passage omitted]    I believe that the Russian people will exert more important  influence upon mankind's civilization in the 21st Century than  any other people of the world. This is because the Russian  people have great cultural assets and capabilities of leading  the world's civilization in the 21st Century. One of the central  pillars of new civilization is being formed in the Asian-Pacific  region.    I believe that Russia, together with the ROK, will become  one  of the important main forces of the Asian-Pacific era, because  Russia has the great people with unlimited natural resources and  boundless potential. The ROK people and I, together with all  other people of the world, expect for the Russian people's  creative activities.    I believe that politics is a process of realizing justice  and  at the same time, a work of linking the people with the future  hope. I hope that the Russian parliament and your Council, be a  plaza of consensus of the people toward change and reform, and  be a beaconfire illuminating dream and hope of the future to the  Russian people who are going through transitional difficulties.    I sincerely hope that the Russian parliament will play the  key role in creating a new stabilized and prosperous Russia, and  that the proud days when Russia again takes a great leap for the  world and for mankind will come at an early date.    Let us all unite our strength and make efforts for the new  long history of mutual prosperity between the ROK and Russia and  for creation of new civilization of the world in the 21st  Century.    Thank you all. [applause]</p>

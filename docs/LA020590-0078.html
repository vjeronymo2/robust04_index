			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL ARTS COUNCIL DIVIDED ON POLITICAL BATTLE PLANS  </P> <P> The National Council on the Arts ended its first meeting of 1990 -- a year  likely to become the most pivotal in its 25-year history -- on Saturday unable  to agree on the dimensions of the political threats it faces and how to respond  to them.  </P> <P> In fact, discussions throughout the council's two-day session here returned  repeatedly to fundamental questions of how the body, which is the advisory  board to the National Endowment for the Arts, sees its role in determining  public policy in the arts in the United States.  </P> <P> And while these questions -- over such issues as what role the endowment's  council may properly take in persuading members of Congress to extend the  endowment's legislative life and what strings on artistic and creative policy  Congress may attach, if any -- were raised repeatedly, none of them was  answered.  </P> <P> The year is widely perceived as crucial to the arts endowment and the arts  council because Congress must act to renew the legal mandate of the endowment,  which is due to expire later in 1990, in an election year climate of intense  scrutiny over the appropriateness -- in terms of subject matter -- of artworks  the endowment funds. Conservatives are expected to attempt to impose rigid  statutory limits to the kind of artworks the federal government can support.  </P> <P> Last year, the controversy resulted in the first legal controls over the  content of NEA-funded artworks since the agency was founded in 1965. The  endowment's current appropriations bill bans support of obscene art unless it  meets high standards of artistic excellence.  </P> <P> Yet as the arts endowment prepares to face the political challenges of the  legislative process called reauthorization, its 24-member governing body has  this additional political baggage:  </P> <P> * It will see during 1990 the expirations of the terms of 10 of its members.  Endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer told council members over the weekend  that no list of nominees to President Bush for new positions has been drawn up  and that, in fact, criteria for selecting new council members remain undefined.  </P> <P> * Simultaneously, Frohnmayer and some members of the council -- which must vote  on every grant the endowment makes but whose recommendations on grants and  other policy can legally be overridden by Frohnmayer -- have expressed concern  that the arts council has lost a balance it once had between members who are  prominent, established artists and those who represent the viewpoints of arts  policy-makers, arts executives and arts patrons.  </P> <P> Since 1965, the council has included such prominent artists as actors Gregory  Peck and Charlton Heston, conductor Leonard Bernstein, painter Richard  Diebenkorn, jazz musician Duke Ellington and violinist Isaac Stern.  </P> <P> Today, however, only about a quarter of the council membership includes people  whose principal background is in the creative arts. Only two -- painter Helen  Frankenthaler and dancer/dance artistic director Arthur Mitchell -- are  practicing artists of broad public note. In discussions throughout the weekend,  it was clear that the existing membership of the arts council is deeply divided  over how to respond to the endowment's political challenges this year -- and  even over whether facing the political crisis head-on is appropriate. Robert  Garfias, an ethnomusicologist on the faculty of UC Irvine, noted that Rep. Dana  Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) raised questions on the House floor just last week over  the endowment's twice-removed, indirect role in supporting a risque performance  by a New York artist named Annie Sprinkle at the Kitchen, a New York arts  center.  </P> <P> "We are going to have some surprises," said Garfias of the Rohrabacher attack.  "I'm very uncomfortable (about things like the implied co-mingling of funds  that supported) Annie Sprinkle. I'm worried about things we don't know about."  </P> <P> But council members like author/editor Joseph Epstein resisted confronting the  discomfiting merger of practicing art and practicing politics -- despite the  ferocity of the controversy that gripped the endowment last year. "Panic has  set in" because of the political pressure, Epstein argued. But he argued that  the arts council lacks the political sophistication or legislative mandate to  enter political combat with experienced congressional foes. Epstein and several  council members expressed bewilderment about how to meet the political  challenge -- and resisted proposals by other members that the arts council cast  itself in a quasi-lobbying role, carrying its battle directly to congressional  leaders.  </P> <P> In the end, the arts council reached no decisions on political strategy,  despite warningsfrom members like Garfias that "the next battle is around the  corner. It's going tocome."  </P></p>

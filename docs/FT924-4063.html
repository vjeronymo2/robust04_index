			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Unita rebels attack city UNITA rebels attacked Sumbe, another Angolan provincial capital, yesterday after Angola's ruling MPLA announced a new government to confront the threat of renewed civil war, Reuter reports from Luanda. Police maintained control after more than two hours of fighting at Sumbe, capital of central Cuanza Sul province, the new armed forces commander, General Joao de Matos, told Reuters. Diplomats said the conflict appeared to be part of Unita's drive to seize provincial capitals and isolate Luanda. There was no immediate response from Unita on the MPLA's offer of minor posts in the new administration which is headed by Mr Marcolino Moco, prime minister, who is a former secretary general of the MPLA.</p>

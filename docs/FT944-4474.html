			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Accountancy: Hard times give way to great expectations - Jim Kelly on why proposals in the Audit Agenda may restore the profession's credibility The Audit Agenda, published yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board, provides a framework for reform which promises, in the eyes of the authors at least, to restore the reputation of auditors after the bruising corporate failures of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Something of the expectations it will excite can be judged by the report's own definition of audit. The authors note that the word comes from the Latin for 'hear': the auditor they envisage is the shareholder's sentry. 'Audit is about governance,' says the report: 'It is about upholding integrity of financial reporting and business conduct, it is about seeking the truth.' This image of the auditor was wounded by company collapses which followed swiftly on from the signing of unqualified accounts. In response, the Auditing Practices Board was founded in 1991, and in 1992 the McFarlane Report was published - the 'green paper' to yesterday's 'white paper'. Other factors than perceived failure have crowded round the auditor in the last decade. Aggressive competition since the mid 1980s and the introduction of advertising have pressed down on fees and threatened quality. Firms have grown beyond the limits of the old threshold of 20 partners. The threat of facing legal actions for damages has led to caution and a reliance on the rule book to support audit opinion. The Audit Agenda seeks to restore the role of personal judgment to the auditor and to alter corporate governance to support the auditor's objectivity. 'Audit is about judgment which in the final analysis is personal: an expert view with personal accountability,' says the report. Many of the proposals in the Audit Agenda take up the ideas in the Cadbury Report on corporate governance. Indeed one of its authors has described it as an early instalment of Cadbury II - the promised development of the original report which is due to get under way next year. It is worth looking briefly at the main proposals. Audits at listed companies would be more extensive than those at owner-managed companies. The scope of the statutory audit would stay the same, but these extended duties will be backed up by standards which have the power of law. The extended audit duties would be covered by contracts limiting liability. Auditors would have to make sure that the text sections of accounts, such as the chairman's report, match the accounts they have audited. The audit would be signed by a partner. At present the accounts carry only the name of the firm from which the auditor comes. The authors of the report think this will emphasise personal responsibility. The audit partner should not have overall control of non-audit services for the company. Audit committees would have responsibility for appointing the auditors and setting their fees. The chairman of the audit committee would report on the auditor to the AGM - possibly in writing and orally. Separate reports would be made to the board and the audit committee by the auditor on standards of governance - and to the shareholders on whether the so-called Cadbury Code is being followed properly. Auditors would comment on internal audit controls. The board would order periodic forensic audits in which teams of specialists look for fraud. The penalties for deceiving auditors would be toughened up and staff would face penalties as well. At present, they cannot be punished for misleading an auditor. The professional bodies would teach auditors about fraud. APB and the Accounting Standards Board would work on how to assure secondary and tertiary stakeholders in the company. While the primary duty is to the shareholders, as confirmed by the Caparo test case, other stakeholders should be able to rely on assurances given by auditors. The authors suggest that some groups, such as employees, should be able to contract the auditors to provide assurance. These proposals contain several fundamental ideas. Principally, the report identifies the role of the auditor as being different in quality to other services offered to a company. It is often forgotten 'that the audit service is different in that the auditor's opinion is of benefit to the users of financial information and confidence in the capital markets, as well as for the benefit of the company itself'. Proposals in the report to ensure the audit partner is not in control of trying to market other services to the company he audits will help dispel the widespread mistrust of the practice of selling management consultancy services, or information technology advice, to audit customers. The report makes it clear that the auditor must be seen not to face a conflict of interest. The proposal to limit liability for the extended audit on listed companies will excite those looking for a way forward in the current morass over litigation. UK auditors face increasing claims against them and the Big Six firms are still lobbying the government to change the law and allow them to limit their liability in such cases. The campaign on limiting liability has run into the sand in the short term. The report's suggestion holds the promise of allowing audit services beyond those on the statute book to be limited in liability through contract. If this is successful, and becomes an established practice, would not the campaign to limit liability completely be that much more attractive to the government? The Audit Agenda also recognises for the first time in the UK the different audit needs of large listed companies and smaller owner-managed ones. The APB is to work on special guidance for smaller companies on audit. This work will mirror the current debate on how Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAP) should differ between large and small companies. Whatever the outcome, the owners of non-listed businesses will be looking for a decrease in the burdens of compliance. The training of auditors forms a strong thread throughout the report. The authors are keen for the profession to be seen to discuss fraud openly - no longer protected by the curious argument that examining fraudulent methods in public provides criminals with the means to commit new crimes. Behavioural and forensic training is seen as vital along with regular seminars on how to spot fraud and fraudsters. One of the authors even sees the chance of producing a list of tell-tale signs of fraud to help the less experienced. The role of the audit committee is pivotal in the proposals. The authors see its members as the direct representatives of the shareholders who are, after all, the ones to whom the auditor has a responsibility to report. The enhanced role envisaged for the audit committee adds to the power of the non-executive directors who sit on it and who must, in future, take responsibility for monitoring the auditor. The APB may well have come of age with the publication of the Audit Agenda. It has prepared the ground well before publication and it has left behind the contentious ideas thrown up by the earlier McFarlane Report. The proposals look practical and the strong emphasis on the public interest may well serve the profession well in the battles ahead on self-regulation.</p>

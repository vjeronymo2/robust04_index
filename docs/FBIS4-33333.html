			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from "The RPC Television News"] </F>   [Text] The Legislative Assembly cannot be the guarantor of  any agreement between the government and the International  Financial Institutions [IFI], according to Legislative Assembly  President Arturo Vallarino.    Vallarino pointed out that it is not the Legislative  Assembly's fault that the IFI's are not making disbursements  because of laws that have not been approved. The Legislative  Assembly will not give urgent treatment to the bills that are  necessary for reaching agreements between the national  government and the IFI's. Arturo Vallarino emphatically said  that the Legislative Assembly is never consulted about the  alleged priorities.    [Begin recording] [Vallarino] If there is time, if the bills  are considered necessary for the improvement of the  administration of justice or for the social improvement of  Panamanians, then we are going to approve them, but if we  believe the bills do not have the importance or the priority for  the country, then they will have to wait until the Legislative  Assembly considers them, approves them, or rejects them.    [Ortega] Has the government failed to coordinate with the  Legislative Assembly in view of such an important economic  situation?    [Vallarino] We believe it is a flaw. That is why the  Legislative Assembly approved a bill requiring that all  commitments above $10 million be approved by the Legislative  Assembly; the Executive has systematically been refusing to  follow that procedure. The Legislative Assembly cannot be  responsible for commitments made by the Executive simply because  of the money it will receive. As long as the Executive refuses  to allow the Legislative Assembly to intervene in the processing  of the credits, we are going to find these types of conflicts.    [Ortega] Is there a solution to this problem on this  occasion?    [Vallarino] The president has not yet approached us to try  to  convince us to pay special attention to the bills. He has  simply said: Approve these bills because the disbursement of  money depends on it. We believe that we are not going to reach  an agreement within this system. [end recording]    Vallarino pointed out that it is never too late to correct  flaws in coordination, especially in the political and economic  arena.</p>

The Dalai Lama has repeatedly expressed a desire to visit  Taiwan, and earlier reports said he would visit this month.    The official said the commission welcomes the Dalai Lama to  preach on the island, noting that the number of Buddhists in the  Dalai Lama's sect has been on the rise here.    The Dalai Lama has on several occasions given credit to  Taiwan for its political democratization, prosperity, and  freedom of press and religion, the official indicated. "He  should come here to learn for himself the situation about  Taiwan."    The Dalai Lama has been in exile in India since he fled  Tibet  in 1959 after mainland Chinese troops crushed an uprising there.</p>

The United States may be liable for partial payment of such claims if they arise incident to the official duties of the sending state's soldier or employee. Article VIII of the NATO SOFA is the most commonly invoked agreement of this sort. It applies to torts committed within the North Atlantic Treaty Area, which includes the continental United States and island possessions north of the Tropic of Cancer (i.e. excludes Puerto Rico, Hawaii and American Samoa). It also applies to claims arising out of acts by military or civilian personnel, regardless of nationality, who are assigned, attached to, or employed by an international headquarters established under the provisions of the Protocol on the Status of International Military Headquarters Set Up Pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty dated August 28, 1952 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Supreme Allied Command, Atlantic). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Single service responsibility for the processing and settlement of claims cognizable under this section is assigned to DA by DODD 5515.8.

Any installation that learns of an incident involving a member of a foreign military force or civilian component which results in personal injury, death, or property damage will notify immediately by the most expeditious means the installation to which such person is assigned or attached. An information copy of such notification will be furnished to the Commander, USARCS. In the event the member is not assigned or attached to any installation within the United States, the Commander, USARCS will be notified. The notification (exempt report, AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 720) will contain so much of the following information as is readily available: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Budget '92: Men in raincoats ready to stop Treasury leaks - Elaborate measures to safeguard secrets ON A cold blustery day in March 1984 a young Treasury economist travelling to work on the Tube found a seat, sat down and unfolded that day's copy of The Guardian. His heart stopped. Splashed across the front page was the headline 'Lawson plans tax shake-up for Budget'. As one of the three working closest to that year's Budget proposals in the Treasury he knew he would be under suspicion for leaking the information to the press. Sure enough, on arrival at Whitehall his boss closed and locked the office door behind him. 'The chancellor has blown a gasket,' he said. The Special Branch was downstairs. The 1984 Budget leak was a blatant breach of Budget purdah - a blanket ban on Treasury officials and MPs talking to the press in the three months before the Budget. Journalists, economists, lobbyists and non-Treasury MPs hate purdah, but the Treasury's defence is that it safeguards the right of parliament to hear new policies first and prevents sensitive financial material reaching unscrupulous ears. The material leaked in 1984 included a forecast of the ending of tax relief on life assurance. There was a run on policies to beat the Budget. No one was ever caught for the 1984 leak, and the matter was dropped, but only after the officials involved had been interrogated at length. The young economist, who left the Treasury several years ago, was positively vetted all over again - a long process, particularly in 1984 when it apparently took some effort to prove his Liverpudlian aunt was not involved with the Militant hard left. To many, this zealous approach to guarding the Budget's secrets looks antiquated and undemocratic. Some economists, including ex-Treasury officials, argue that purdah shields Budget decisions from open debate. One former Treasury official said: 'The Budget has become more like the Paul Daniels magic show than the rational debate it should be. An open debate on the policy options would lead to some better decisions being made.' In the 1988 Budget Mr Nigel Lawson decided to restrict mortgage tax relief to Pounds 30,000 per property regardless of the number of borrowers, and to delay its implementation for six months. The effect was to trigger a rush by individuals clubbing together to buy houses and a rapid increase in prices. The former official said: 'It would have been absolutely obvious at the time, had he spoken to some of the practitioners, that this would create an enormous bubble in the market for a six month period.' The promise exacted from Treasury MPs and officials to lock papers up and not reveal details to journalists is no longer considered sufficient. In its strictest form purdah dictates that those in the know avoid lunches or even casual encounters with reporters. As the Treasury says: 'Simple experience shows that the only way to avoid getting drawn into territory where you are revealing Budget information is by not talking about it.' Anyone suspected of talking about it - or worse, slipping copies of Budget proposals into an unmarked brown envelope - can expect a visit by a man in a raincoat from the Ministry of Defence across the road. In the past few years spectacular leaks have been rare, but the Treasury's unyielding stance is the product of a long tradition of Budget leaks. In 1936 Mr Jimmy Thomas, the colonial secretary, resigned when he was blamed for leaking details of an increase in the import duty on tea before the Budget. A number of his friends had made a killing at Lloyd's by placing insurance with Lloyd's against the increase. Hugh Dalton, who was chancellor in 1947, was another purdah casualty. As he was entering the chamber on Budget day he told the lobby correspondent of the Star what the rise in cigarette duty was to be. The Star was on the stands with the news by 3.45, before the chancellor had even risen to make his speech. Dalton resigned soon after. Today, the two dozen or so on the 'Budget list' - those privy to the entire Budget process - enter purdah with a locking box and a safe in which to store the crucial papers. Only secretaries that are 'Budget-cleared' can look at the papers with Budget List Only scrawled diagonally in large red letters across the page. Documents are sealed in two envelopes to ensure that holding the paper up to the light would be a waste of time. The paper on which the proposals are printed is designed to photocopy badly. Telephone calls and chance encounters at the bus stop are also logged. Officials even have to contend with unannounced 'raids' by security guards carrying out spot checks to make sure a paper is where is is supposed to be at any given time. 'If you can't produce it that instant you are in trouble,' said a Treasury adviser. Those in purdah also have to produce a list of all the people with whom they have had contact at weekends and evenings. One official had to report daily contact with his wife, who happened to be a journalist. All this makes one wonder when the chancellor and his team find time, in between logging, filing, recording, locking and unlocking safes, to do any work. One who experienced purdah for several years said: 'It is a great inconvenience and serves no purpose.'</p>

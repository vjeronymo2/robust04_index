			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated November 6, 1992, the Auditor describes the procedures that are used in the annual audit of the Credit Program. The Auditor obtains: (i) A calculation of the daily actual balances for all the Funds and for the total Client Plan shareholders of such Funds; (ii) a detailed list of the expenses charged to the Funds' shareholders by type of expense; and (iii) calculations of the total expenses charged by M&amp;I to each Fund which are reimbursable to the Client Plans. On the basis of such information, the Auditor: (i) Reviews and tests compliance with the Credit Program's operational controls and procedures established by M&amp;I; (ii) verifies the daily credit factors transmitted to M&amp;I from the Funds, including the proper assignment of identification numbers to all Client Plan shareholders; and (iii) verifies the credits paid in total to the sum of all credits paid to each Client Plan. The Auditor recomputes, in total, the cash received in connection with the credit of each Client Plan's expenses to ensure that the proper amount of cash was issued to the Client Plan. Finally, the Auditor recomputes on a test basis the amount of credits received by selected Client Plan shareholders of the Funds to verify that such credits were properly made. In this regard, the Auditor obtains a listing of the credits paid to each Client Plan regarding its shares in each of the Funds to determine that the total credit paid to the Client Plan by M&amp;I equals the total amount that was required to be credited. At such time as M&amp;I offers Client Plans the option to have the fees credited as additional Fund shares, the Auditor will also recompute the number of Fund shares issued to the Client Plans to ensure that each Client Plan received the proper number of shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the event either the internal audit by M&amp;I or the independent audit by the Auditor identifies that an error has been made in the crediting of fees to the Client Plans, M&amp;I will correct the error. With respect to any shortfall in credited fees to a Client Plan involving cash credits, M&amp;I will make a cash payment to the Client Plan equal to the amount of the error plus interest paid at money market rates offered by M&amp;I for the period involved. With respect to a shortfall in credited fees involving a Client Plan where the Second Fiduciary's election is to have credited fees invested in shares of a particular Fund, M&amp;I will make a cash payment equal to at least the amount of the error plus interest based on the greater of either: (i) The money market rates offered by M&amp;I for the period involved, or (ii) the total rate of return for shares of the Fund that would have been acquired during such period. Any excess credits made to a Client Plan will be corrected by an appropriate deduction and reallocation of cash during the next payment period to reflect accurately the amount of total credits due to the Client Plan for the period involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. With respect to any transfer of a Client Plan's CIF assets to a Fund, M&amp;I states that a Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan receives advance written notice of the in-kind transfer of assets of the CIFs and full written disclosure of information concerning the Fund. On the basis of such information, the Second Fiduciary authorizes in writing the in-kind transfer of the Client Plan's CIF assets to a Fund in exchange for shares of the Fund. With respect to the receipt of fees by M&amp;I from a Fund in connection with any Client Plan's investment in the Fund, M&amp;I states that a Second Fiduciary receives full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning the Fund in advance of any investment by the Client Plan in the Fund. On the basis of such information, the Second Fiduciary authorizes in writing the investment of assets of the Client Plan in the Fund and the fees to be paid by the Fund to M&amp;I. Such authorization will include in the future an election for the Second Fiduciary to purchase additional shares of the Fund with the fees credited to the Client Plan by M&amp;I. In addition, M&amp;I represents that the Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan invested in a particular Fund will receive full written disclosure, in a statement separate from the Fund prospectus, of any proposed increases in the rates of fees charged by M&amp;I to the Funds for secondary services which are above the rate reflected in the prospectus for the Fund, at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such increase. The Second Fiduciary will also receive full written disclosure in a Fund prospectus or otherwise of any increases in the rate of fees charged by M&amp;I to the Funds for investment advisory services even though such fees will be credited, as required by Section II(d) above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any authorizations by a Second Fiduciary regarding the investment of a Client Plan's assets in a Fund and the fees to be paid to M&amp;I, including any future increases in rates of fees for secondary services, are or will be terminable at will by the Second Fiduciary, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&amp;I of written notice of termination. A Termination Form expressly providing an election to terminate the authorization with instructions on the use of the form is supplied to the Second Fiduciary no less than annually. The instructions for the Termination Form include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The authorization is terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&amp;I of written notice from the Second Fiduciary; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Failure to return the form will result in continued authorization of M&amp;I to engage in the subject transactions on behalf of the Client Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> M&amp;I states that the Termination Form may be used at will by the Second Fiduciary to terminate an authorization without penalty to the Client Plan and to notify M&amp;I in writing to effect a termination by selling the shares of the Funds held by the Client Plan requesting such termination within one business day following receipt by M&amp;I of the form; provided that if, due to circumstances beyond the control of M&amp;I, the sale cannot be executed within one business day, M&amp;I shall have one additional business day to complete such sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

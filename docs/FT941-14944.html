			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / People: HSBC invests in Paul Guidone HSBC Asset Management, the fund management arm of Britain's biggest banking group, has had to cross the Atlantic to find a new chief investment officer. Paul Guidone, 36, joins HSBC next month from the Prudential, the US insurance giant. For the past three years Guidone (right) has been managing director of Prudential Diversified Investment Strategies in New Jersey and before that had worked on the fund management side of the Union Planters banking group in Tennessee and New York's Equitable Life. During his time at PDI he doubled the assets under management to Dollars 17bn. Guidone's post at HSBC is a new one and his arrival marks the completion of the recruitment of a new management team which began with the arrival of Tim Ferguson, a former chief executive of County NatWest Securities. Kevin Gregory, a former finance director of Mountleigh, was recruited to be finance director and John Bradell was brought in from Storehouse to be group marketing director. HSBC Asset Management manages Dollars 28bn of funds and is an amalgamation of Marinvest, in the US, James Capel Asset Management Group, in the UK and Europe, and the Wardley Investment Services companies in the Asia Pacific region.</p>

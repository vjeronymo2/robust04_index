			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections: Currie blames 'thumping' tax increases She was chirpy enough when she arrived in bright sunshine yesterday morning at the count for the Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes seat. Mrs Edwina Currie looked immaculate in a pink summer suit with perfectly coiffured hair and two rows of pearls around her neck. It was smiles all around from her entourage - husband, teenage daughter and agent. After half an hour talking to Conservative party officials in Luton sports centre, however, she looked rather more solemn. No, she would not be coming out to talk to journalists, who had been banned from the hall and were crammed cheek-by-jowl on a small balcony overlooking it. She would talk to the press after the count. When she emerged briefly for a cup of coffee in the cafeteria, she was decidedly ratty. Asked how things were looking she replied: 'Can't tell. Go away.' By this time it must have been obvious that not only was she going to lose a seat held for the Conservatives in 1984 and 1989 by Mr Peter Beazley - but that she was going to lose quite badly. And so it turned out. Labour candidate Ms Eryl McNally, a schoolteacher from Watford, scored a thumping 94,837 votes, 33,000 more than Mrs Currie and 48 per cent of the vote. Mrs Currie took 61,628 or 30.2 per cent of the vote. The swing is difficult to estimate because the boundaries had been changed since the last European election in 1989. Mrs Currie's agent estimated, however, that on the basis of the last general election there had been a 9 per cent swing against her. After the vote Mrs Currie blamed the low turnout of 38 per cent. 'We have been victims of the militant abstainer,' she said. 'My team has been magnificent, but getting the voters out has been like drawing teeth.' She also said, in an apparent swipe at the government: 'It does not help if on the day you start campaigning, the government imposes thumping great tax increases. I hope the message has gone home in the right quarters. The Labour party should not take the next general election for granted.' By the time Mrs Currie agreed to interviews she was in better humour. She signally failed to endorse Mr Major, saying only: 'There has to be a next prime minister, but speculation just detracts from the job in hand.' Ms McNally ascribed her victory to dissatisfaction with the government and the Labour party's marked preference for a positive agenda in Europe. She admitted, however, that she had been the beneficiary of tactical voting by potential Liberal Democrat voters, saying she had 'definitely been lent' some votes by possible Lib Dem supporters. Mrs Currie refused to be drawn on her future. Asked what her relationship will be with her Commons constit-uency in Derbyshire, she said: 'I certainly do not regard Derbyshire as second best. I had lots of support for my stance on Europe from my constituency.'</p>

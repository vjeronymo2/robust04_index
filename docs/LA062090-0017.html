			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Mathis Doesn't Get 'Misty': Johnny Mathis may sing about getting misty, but  don't expect him to come out in the rain. That's what officials of the new  Anderson Civic Center in Anderson, S.C., said Tuesday, referring to a Monday  ceremony to name a street after the singer.  </P> <P> Civic Center Director Martin Durham said Mathis was to have entered the parking  lot in a convertible Rolls-Royce to cut the ribbon for the dedication of Johnny  Mathis Boulevard. Two live television broadcasts were scheduled. But when the  ceremony started, rain started pouring down on the crowd. Mathis didn't want to  get wet, and the owner of the Rolls-Royce did not want his car driven with the  top down. "What are you going to do?" Durham said. "The rain ruined it." Mathis  stayed in his dressing room during the ceremony to prepare for Monday night's  concert, the first at the 4,500-seat civic center. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

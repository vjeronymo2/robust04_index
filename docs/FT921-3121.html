			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Mortgage lenders are criticised by valuers SOME mortgage lenders are requiring valuers to pass them mortgage business as a condition of being placed on the lender's valuation panel, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says today. In its response to criticisms from the Office of Fair Trading about the way the valuation market is working, the institution warns that the quality of valuation advice could be at risk. It says a voluntary code of practice will not work as it is often impossible to prove claims that a lender has asked for mortgage business and it would be difficult to enforce the code. The panels of valuers used by lenders, however, are falling dramatically in size and some lenders will not accept a valuation unless it comes from a valuer on their panel. The institution says new legislation is the only solution. It is seeking backing from the Office of Fair Trading to get a change in the law. Up to Pounds 5m is to be raised by the London Repossessions Fund, a Business Expansion Scheme company, to increase the number of student beds in London while taking advantage of the changes to BES regulations in the Budget. Until now BES companies have not been allowed to buy houses where the tenant is known in advance, making it impossible for them to participate in mortgage rescue schemes. The BES will buy some homes from their owners and operate a tenancy agreement with them, allowing the owner to buy back the house after five years.</p>

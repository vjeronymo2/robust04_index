New guidelines on the procedures  for transferring the shares of government corporations and  companies, setting their prices, and selling them for  installment payments were approved by the Economic Council.    RESALAT's economics correspondent reports that yesterday  afternoon Mas'ud Rowghani-Zanjani, vice president of the  republic and chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, gave a  press conference in which he discussed the new guidelines on the  procedures for transferring the shares of transferable  corporations and companies belonging to the government and  government organizations and companies, and for setting their  prices and selling them for installment payments.    He discussed Article 4 of the measure enacted by the Council  of Ministers concerning the transfer of the shares of government  companies, whose priority has been given to the stock market. He  said: According to this article, other methods may also be used  for the transfer of the shares.    The vice president of the republic said: In the last four  years basic and important steps have been taken with regard to  the transfer of the shares of government companies, but we have  not yet reached the desired point. Various steps must be taken  concerning the stock market to increase its efficiency.    Rowghani-Zanjani emphasized the need to expedite the process  of privatization. He said: In this area the government has  required the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs to  prepare guidelines for the transfer of shares outside the stock  market.    RESALAT's economics correspondent reports that the measure  enacted by the Economic Council concerning the transfer of  shares, setting their prices, and the procedure for selling them  for installment payments, which will go into effect on 1  Farvardin next year [21 March 1994], reads as follows:    The base price of profitable producing companies (with the  exception of agricultural and industrial and service companies  and companies that have shown losses in the three years prior to  transfer) is determined by dividing the net pretax profit by the  rate of capital return, taking into account the factors  affecting the company's adjusted profits, as well as the effects  of the secondary factors that adjust the base price of the  company's shares.    It is necessary to note that the rate of capital return is  equal to the effective rate of profits on long-term capital  five-year bank deposits (15 percent) in addition to 5 percent.    Likewise, the finished cost of development projects and the  cost for the completion of semicomplete or operable projects  that went into operation less than a year ago will be  recalculated, adjusted by the foreign exchange cost at the  current price of foreign exchange and also adjusted by the rial  costs using the wholesale price indicator announced by the  Central Bank or an expert, and after confirmation by the  company's general assembly, the difference obtained in the  recalculation will be added to the base price of the shares.    The transferring organization is required, prior to  transferring the shares, to repay the debts having to do with  the funds collected from the Treasury for development projects,  or it must reach an agreement with the treasury on the procedure  for that repayment.    Likewise, in cases designated by the official in charge of  the organization making the transfer, to facilitate the transfer  of the shares where a cash transfer is not convenient, the  transfer may be done via installment payments.    It is necessary to note that installment sales are possible  only when the buyer or buyers are seeking to buy all the  transferring organization's shares at one time.    Installment sales for general purchase applicants, other  than  the workers and managers of each company, will be conducted as  follows:    If 30 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in  cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a three-year  period. If 40 percent of the price of the transaction is paid in  cash, the balance will be paid in installments over a three and  one-half years. Likewise, if 50 percent of the price of the  transaction is paid in cash, the balance will be paid in  installments over a four-year period.    Likewise, to create means for the transfer of the shares of  government companies to the managers and employees of these  units, this measure says: If the employees and managers of the  company wish to purchase the shares and if they are on an equal  footing with other buyers, may pay 20 percent of the price of  the transaction in cash and pay the balance in installments over  a four-year period.    In the case of an installment sale, the price of the  transaction consists of the cash price of the sale of the shares  in addition to the banking system's profit on an installment  sale in the industrial sector.    The guidelines on the procedure for the transfer of the  shares of government organizations and companies state:    The base price for the sale of the shares must be confirmed  by the minister in charge of the organization transferring the  shares, and then it must be printed in an advertisement.    The advertisement of the transfer of the shares must be  published in at least two high-circulation domestic newspapers.  In addition to that, if necessary, as determined by the  transferring organization, the announcement will also be made by  the Voice and Vision organization or other information delivery  methods.    The transferring organizations are also required to make the  appropriate arrangements for the transfer of the shares.    The decision on whether to transfer the shares by auction,  negotiations or sale on the stock market will be made by the  minister in charge of the transferring organization. Of course,  with regard to companies that have been accepted on the stock  market, priority in the transfer of the shares will be given to  the stock market.    These guidelines emphasize the publication of information  concerning the shares sold on the stock market, via negotiations  or through competitive bidding, so that at the time of the  transfer information must be given by the transferring  organization to those wishing to buy shares, such as the name  and subject of the company's activities, the number of  transferable shares and their percentage of the company's total  shares, an announcement of the status of the remainder of the  company's shares including the percentage of shares owned by  other shareholders, specification of the place to obtain forms  and related information, an announcement of the date the shares  will be offered in the stock-market hall, the base price, the  method of selling the shares in small lots or all at one time,  any other kind of information or conditions the transferring  organization deems it necessary for buyers to know, and an  announcement of readiness for visits to the factory by  applicants wishing to visit.    Based on this report, at the end of this press conference  the  chief of the Plan and Budget Organization excused himself from  answering questions. To the question from RESALAT's  correspondent concerning the sharp rise in the price of foreign  exchange, he replied: I do not give interviews.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Business Travel: Peace dividend Royal Jordanian Airline says it hopes peace with Israel will produce a surge of traffic next year to restore its financial health. The airline is expecting to record a loss this year, says Nader Dahabi, its president, though he hopes that Middle East peace-making will help boost revenues after years of decline. He said that Royal Jordanian was co-operating with Israel's El Al to 'share a new market on commercial lines which will be beneficial for the two sides'. The peace process held out hopes of more traffic, especially from north America and Europe, Dahabi said. A draft Jordanian-Israeli civil aviation treaty will be signed soon.</p>

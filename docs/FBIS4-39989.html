			<p>BFN     [Text] Friday [10 June] evening the Crimean parliament's  delegation from the joint working group submitted to the  Ukrainian side a draft agreement between Ukraine and the Crimea.    The draft consists of three parts: powers the Crimea  delegates to Kiev; powers Ukraine can delegate to the Crimea;  and common powers, the leader of the Crimean delegation, Sergey  Nikulin, told Interfax-Ukraina on Saturday [11 June].    Nikulin gave no details as to the content of the three  parts.  According to him, during their round of talks which was  concluded in Simferopol on Friday "the two sides did not even  try to consider those articles of the Crimean Constitution that  do not suit Ukraine."    "The Crimean delegation declared that the Crimean  Constitution will not be revised," he noted.    The final protocol signed by the leaders of the Ukrainian  and  Crimean delegations reflects the outlook of the Crimean side  which believes that it's essential to work out constitutional  foundations for dividing powers between the highest government  bodies of Ukraine and the Crimea."    According to the document, solution to the "constitutional  and legislative collisions" between Kiev and Simferopol should  be reached in three stages: "work out an appropriate legal base,  devise a legal mechanism for eliminating contradictions between  the Crimea and Ukraine, and prepare recommendations for the  Crimean and Ukrainian parliaments."    The working group believes that only the first stage has  been  completed so far, and insists that the work should be continued.  Members of the group also think that representatives of the  Crimean parliament should take part in drafting Ukraine's new  constitution.    Saturday morning the Ukrainian delegation left for Kiev. The  joint group may resume its work in Kiev next week.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (5): Living in a short-term world - Banking WITHIN a month, Kuwait's banks hope to be reborn. By then, the government expects to have finalised a bold scheme to clear billions of dinars worth of bad debts from their books by purchasing them itself in return for an extraordinary sale of bonds. The scheme - which is awaiting approval by the National Council, Kuwait's interim political assembly, as this survey goes to print - would be one of the biggest single write-offs of bank debt in history. It would also put Kuwait's banks soundly on their own feet, with wholly clean balance sheets, for the first time in a decade. Since the informal Souq al Manakh stock market soared, only to crash, on a spree of speculative share-buying based on post-dated cheques, residual debts from the 1982 crisis have rendered all but one of Kuwait's banks technically insolvent, propped up only by considerable central bank support. Only the National Bank of Kuwait, Kuwait's biggest bank, has in the past few years declared soundly-based trading profits. The new plan would thus be the final chapter in the long and tangled tale of the Souq al Manakh. It would also clear the banks of all their pre-war debts, on the grounds that with many borrowers ill-equipped to repay them due to post-war hardship, these debts too might turn bad. The plan has a neat, once-and-for-all ring to it. Although the Kuwait government already had in place the cumbersomely-titled Difficult Credit Facilities Resettlement Programme to address the Souq al Manakh bad debts, this had dragged on with mixed success throughout the 1980s. Now the government has sought to take the extraordinary circumstances offered by the war finally to grasp and uproot this troublesome nettle. In February, the entire banking system was effectively on hold pending the scheme's final approval. But for a variety of reasons, Kuwaiti banks are awaiting their rebirth with trepidation. For one thing, although they universally applaud such a sweeping solution to their long-standing debt problems, they worry that the plan may falter badly on its details. For another, few bankers are convinced that post-war Kuwait will offer them a particularly prosperous second childhood, for the first few years at least. Although the details of the buy-out plan are still being debated by the National Council, its outline is clear. The government is proposing to buy a total of KD5.8bn of debt, 81 per cent of it owed to Kuwait's six main commercial banks and the remainder to several finance houses, through a one-off sale of government bonds. These bonds will pay interest at a rate to be agreed, but which is to reflect the banks' average cost of funds - expected to be 5-7 per cent, roughly the cost of banks' deposits. The government will then formally take over the bad debts, KD1.9bn of which reflects the legacy of Souq al Manakh and KD3.8bn pre-war bank lending - embracing 6,258 debtors in all. But while the banks will have the debts off their books, they will still be expected to administer the rescheduling of these debts. Individual debtors and companies will have 20 years to repay and a three-year grace-period. At present, it seems likely that debtors will be expected to pay rates of interest relative to their ability to pay. These rates will be set after an evaluation of their assets or cashflow. But this is where bankers start feeling queasy. Although it makes sense that the banks' credit departments, which by now have a 10-year-old relationship with some of the Souq al Manakh debtors, should administer the debts, this solution also means that the banks will have to maintain the costly and labour-intensive debt management departments dedicated to these bad debts. Moreover, since the debts would formally be off their books, the banks have less incentive to chase up the debts as vigorously as before. 'It's like asking the banks to collect taxes on the government's behalf,' says one banker. 'Where's the incentive in that? It only hurts our relationship with our customers.' In addition, many bankers argue that the new plan shares a flaw in the original settlement programme by seeking to tailor interest rates on the rescheduled debts to the debtor's revealed ability to pay. This, they say, is an incentive for debtors to hide the full extent of their assets and, in the case of many of the bigger debtors, to keep their wealth out of the country altogether. For these reasons, many bankers and economists would prefer a blanket rescheduling package whereby all repayed debts remained interest free. However, there is a widespread conviction among many Kuwaitis that the biggest part of the outstanding Souq al Manakh debt lies in a small number of rich and influential hands and that any interest-free rescheduling would let such debtors off. With the government intent on courting favour before the October elections, it is likely to approve, despite the bankers, a plan which would expect interest payments from the biggest debtors. In the end, however, any plan may make little actual difference to the amount of money retrieved. Debtors under the old debt settlement scheme had little difficulty in creatively accounting their way out of paying interest on their debts. Moreover, debtors who slithered clear of the old scheme apparently fear little from the new one. 'The general feeling in the market is that they won't have to pay anything anyway at the end of the day,' says one leading Kuwait accountant. In the end, the scale of debt recovery will be the worry of the government, the new creditor under the scheme, rather than the banks. But the debt plan will have further knock-on effects on their ability to resume business as usual. For one thing, banks will find it difficult to assess the creditworthiness of any of their clients who are also engaged in the separate process of having their old debts assessed under the rescheduling scheme. Since the rescheduling scheme theoretically has priority on any debtor's assets, banks will not be able to judge their ability to repay fresh loans until a scheme for repayment of their old ones is assessed and under way. Since the rescheduling scheme embraces more than 6,000 debtors, this means many of the banks' best clients are likely to be included. 'For 1992, most banks are not going to be able to lend much, if anything, to the private sector,' concludes one bank analyst. The effect on most banks' return on equity is therefore likely to be sharp and depressing. Not only will fresh lending be constrained, but the loans which are to be replaced by government bonds also represent in most cases 40-50 per cent of banks' assets. These will, after the buy-out, give a return only of the banks' average cost of funds. But if this will have the effect of crimping banks' earnings, so too, in the view of most bankers, will the likely economic prospects in Kuwait itself. Two aspects of post-war Kuwait are particular concerns: the diminution of Kuwait's population, and its demographic mix. Bankers point out that the exodus of 400,000 Palestinians essentially represents the loss of upwards of 100,000 families who kept and maintained homes in Kuwait. Although a smaller number of Egyptians and other expatriates have entered Kuwait since liberation to fill some of the gaps left by this exodus, for the most part these are bachelors with much more modest spending patterns and a greater propensity to remit earnings out of the country. Bankers in Kuwait readily admit that even with a population of 2.2m people before the Iraqi invasion, the emirate was overbanked. But with as many as 1m fewer people and much tighter competition for what good business exists, the banking sector is certain to contract. Indeed, Kuwait's banks have already slimmed considerably since the war. Most have opened only half their branches and are operating with about 40 per cent of their pre-invasion staff level. Few analysts expect banks to expand much, if at all, beyond these levels for the next year at least. 'Cost cutting is the Holy Grail just now,' says one Gulf bank official. The next, and some argue inevitable step, is for there to be fewer banks. This is the professed ambition of the central bank, which has repeatedly insisted since liberation that the banks should consider mergers. But talk of bank mergers predates even bankers' moans about bad Souq al Manakh debts and so far such talk is little more than speculative gossip. In the view of most analysts, the issue can be sensibly broached only once the banks are able to publish balance sheets. No bank has done this since 1989 and none can until implementation of the debt settlement programme. 'There's not a hell of a lot anyone can say about Kuwait's banks until we have some books to look at,' says one analyst of the Kuwait market. For now, groups such as Capital Intelligence, the leading Gulf credit rating agency, are recommending that all Kuwait banks be treated more or less as sovereign risk until figures are revealed. They are also cautioning foreign banks seeking to establish relationships with Kuwaiti banks to hold off until the picture becomes clearer. Until then, Kuwait's bankers remain condemned to living in the short-term world they have occupied since they opened their first branches immediately after liberation: servicing depositors, lending limited and short-term funds to selected traders, dabbling in foreign exchange markets, processing letters of credit and, above all, drumming their fingers on the desk waiting impatiently for what is billed as final approval of the final plan to clear their bad debts.</p>

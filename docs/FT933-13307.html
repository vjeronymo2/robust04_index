			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / A new idiom of welfare: A change in approach to social security in Conservative and Labour parties The future of the welfare state has become the subject of intense political debate between the UK's main political parties. Despite both sides' desire to portray their differences as an unbridgeable gulf, however, there is a surprising amount of agree-ment on the need for radical change. 'Radical ideas will often prove impractical or unattractive,' Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said last month in his Mais lecture to City University Business School in London. 'But they often highlight strengths or weaknesses of the system and so help generate more modest but practical proposals.' The Labour party has contracted out its thinking on social security to the independent Commission on Social Justice, chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, the former director-general of fair trading. He was equally keen on radical thinking when he launched the commission's first two position papers yesterday. 'Tinkering will not improve an outdated system,' he said. 'We diagnose the need for radical change.' The reasons for this shared interest in new thinking are different, however, and lead to different sorts of conclusions. The Conservative government is struggling to contain a Pounds 50bn deficit in the public finances. Social security accounts for almost a third of public expenditure and has been soaking up an increasing share of national income since 1979. Cutting it - or at least constraining future growth - is essential if the Tories are to achieve their aim of reducing the share of national income spent by the state. That means better targeting, or more self-provision, or both, according to Mr Lilley. For Labour, the problem is shedding its image as a tax-and-spend party. At the last election, it was committed to a raft of policies that would have added further to the growth in the social security bill, such as restoring the link between pensions and wages. Labour needs a new approach that allows it to preserve its brand strength as the party trusted to look after the welfare state and combine this with a more realistic view about what people are willing to vote for. Sir Gordon's commission appeared yesterday to be squaring the circle by linking social security reform with economic renewal. 'You cannot create a successful economy in a sickly society,' Sir Gordon said. 'Equally you cannot have a successful society in a sickly economy.' He would rather treat the social security budget as an investment in helping everyone make the maximum contribution to the UK's economic success. The commission sees full employment as the key to creating a more just distribution of income and opportunity, and to enhancing economic efficiency. Reforms should be directed to creating full employment, rather than patching 'an increasingly tattered safety net'. Mr Lilley also emphasises the relationship between the welfare state and economic growth - or rather the importance of designing a social security system that does not stifle growth. He is, after all, a member of a government that implacably opposes the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty on the grounds that it would add to business costs and reduce the UK's competitiveness. So Mr Lilley warns of the impact on the economy if higher taxes are needed to pay for further growth in the welfare state. He is also aware that better targeting to cut social security costs could damage the economy if it reduces incentives. 'The more the provision for needs and risks is monopolised by the state, the less the incentive to work and save to provide for them,' he said. Labour's approach may be more attractive to the voters in the short term, since it stresses opportunities rather than cuts in benefits. In contrast, the dour Mr Lilley may yet be accused of losing the Christchurch by-election for the Conservatives through his efforts to encourage a debate. He published figures that appear to point inexorably towards cuts in social security benefits in the future on the day before the campaign started in a constituency where more than a third of the voters are pen-sioners. In the longer term, however, Labour probably has the harder task. The reluctance to pay more in tax is a worldwide phenomenon, and Britain is unlikely to prove the exception in the next general election. If Labour is to increase spending on, for example, childcare to help single parents get back to work, then something else will have to be cut. 'The language of priorities is the religion of socialism,' as Aneurin Bevan said. Finding popular support for new priorities may prove a harder task than attacking Conservative cuts.</p>

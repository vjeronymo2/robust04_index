			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Markets: Conundrum of assessing inflation credibility - Economic Eye Following the examples set by New Zealand and Canada, the UK and Sweden have both adopted explicit inflation targets. While such an objective can be helpful in establishing a coherent framework for monetary policy, it offers no guarantee that the target will be adhered to or is credible. A key issue relates to a phenomenon known as 'time inconsistency'. In essence governments may say one thing, but find that it is in their interest to do something different. Suppose, for example, the government stated that its objective was to secure zero inflation and that initially this was believed by wage bargainers. Wage settlements would then be struck on the basis of zero price inflation. But would it be optimal for the government to deliver this? Almost certainly not. If, instead, the government engineered a little bit of inflation, companies would find that prices were increasing faster than costs, making it attractive to take on more workers. From the government's perspective, for the price of a small increase in inflation unemployment would have been lowered. This is not the end of the story. The fall in unemployment would have come about because the government had managed to 'trick' workers into believing that it would deliver zero inflation, thereby forcing them to accept a cut in real wages. Workers would be unlikely to fall for that again. The 'time consistent' policy is one where inflation is at a level where the cost of 'cheating' by the government exactly outweighs the benefits. This may coincide with the government's official target, but it could easily not. Crucially, it is this level of inflation that will get built into wage settlements over the longer term. Such a situation may be developing in the UK. The Governor of the Bank of England continually stresses his commitment to reducing inflation into the lower half of the 1 to 4 per cent target range. Yet no government in the last 30 years has ever achieved this. If, instead, people come to believe that the authorities would be content with inflation simply within its target range, then it could prove impossible ever to lower inflation substantially below 3 to 4 per cent without a further deep and damaging recession. A further issue relates to the difficulty of forecasting inflation. Inflation responds with long and variable lags to monetary policy changes. This means that the UK authorities are obliged to set interest rates with a view to securing underlying inflation within its target range in one or two years' time. To achieve this they need to be confident in their ability to forecast inflation developments. Yet the government's poor track record in delivering consistently low inflation in recent years clearly calls this into question. One promising approach for the authorities to pursue is to take greater account of the expectations of inflation contained in financial markets. Market expectations should embody all the available information on inflation and these expectations provide an immediate guide to the credibility of the government's stated inflation target. This information is captured to a large extent in the yield curve. The standard yield curve shows the average interest rate expected over the period to maturity of bonds outstanding. It is more useful to turn the yield curve around to derive implied forward rates. Thus, for instance, the yield on a two-year bond can be re-expressed as the yield on a one-year bond together with the yield expected on another one year bond in one year's time, along with any risk premium that investors may require in case their expectations are not fulfilled. If we assume that this risk premium is small, then the forward curve will show the time path of short-term interest rates expected by the market. Furthermore, changes in the shape and level of the forward rate curve will carry important information about changes in market expectations for the path of interest rates and inflation. Developments in the UK forward interest rate curve over the past six weeks are shown in the accompanying graph. Prior to the base rate cut on February 8, market expectations were for interest rates to rise gradually over the next few years, settling down eventually at about 7.5 per cent. Following the base rate cut, short-term interest rates obviously fell, but the forward rate curve suggests that lower rates are not expected to be sustained beyond one year. After six years, interest rates expectations are actually higher than they were prior to the base rate cut. This shift in the forward rate curve can be interpreted directly as a worsening in long-term inflation expectations. In other words, the last base rate cut was viewed by UK financial markets as damaging the credibility of the government's inflation target. Since then there has been a further upward revision to interest rate expectations. Compared with the situation prevailing in early February, interest rates are now expected to be about 1 per cent higher from 1997 onwards, with rates expected to stabilise eventually at close to 8.5 per cent. The bulk of the deterioration would seem to reflect a further worsening in inflation expectations. Real yields on index-linked gilts are running at just under 3.5 per cent for maturities beyond five years. Even if we allow for an inflation risk premium on conventional gilts relative to index-linked gilts, it would now seem that the market no longer believes that the government's inflation target will be achieved over the longer-term. This is a marked turnround from the situation prevailing at the time of the Bank of England's last inflation report and should be of concern to the authorities. If the UK government is serious about reducing inflation into the lower half of the target range, it may soon have to think seriously about the possibility of raising interest rates to bolster its anti-inflation credibility.

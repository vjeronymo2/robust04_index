			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tajik </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] During the past week as well as during the first  days after the 18th session of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan,  the deterioration of the situation in relations between the  Center and Leninabad oblast has not decreased. On the contrary  it [deterioration of situation] has been increased.    The Parliamentary coup, as a result of which the dynasty of  ex-Prime Minister Abdumalik Abdullodzanov fell, became the theme  of a lot of talks in different circles in Khujand.    According to a report on Radio Liberty, this event in  particular became the reason for the intense rivalry between the  ethnic groups and political disputes between the dynasties which  are fighting for power.    A well known Tajik journalist [word indistinct] writes: The  existence of the groups and the dynasties which are fighting for  power in Tajikistan is a reality which one cannot deny. At no  other time was the government of Tajikistan in such a state of  disarray and mistrust. The politicians are developing the  spirit of the local tendencies by their actions among the  citizens and explain all their mistakes and failures only  because of the existence of misunderstandings between the groups  and the dynasties.    Recently, thanks to the efforts of the so-called Kulyabi  dynasty, the representatives of the Khujand dynasty [words  indistinct] Abdullodzanov, former chairman of the Council of  Ministers and his relatives, Homidov, chairman of the executive  committee of Leninabad oblast and his supporters were removed  from power. Abdulmadjid (?Dostiyev), first deputy chairman of  the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and Abdulmadjid Samadov the new  prime minister arrived in Khujand during the final days of 1993.  They have relieved (?Abujalil Homidov), [chairman of the  executive committee of Leninabad oblast] as well as the  prosecutor of the oblast, the head of department of Internal  Affairs and the head of the National Security Committee of the  oblast of their posts and have appointed to these posts the  people who are loyal to the Central government.    According to the latest news, (?Homidov) is at present at  the  government hospital of Tashkent city. Ergash Kurbonov, the  other representative of this dynasty who was the head of the  Leninabad oblast National Security Committee and who took the  initiative in killing and arresting hundreds of opposition  supporters have fled the oblast. Kurbonov, being an experienced  employee of the KGB and former chairman of Committee on  Legislation and the Human Rights of the Parliament of  Tajikistan, has played a big role during the bloody events of  Tajikistan. In particular, he took a great part in formation of  the people's front in Syrkhandarya oblast of Uzbekistan and  exerting big pressure on the people's deputies in the town of  Khujand during the historical [16th] session of the Supreme  Soviet of Tajikistan. And it was Ergash Kurbonov, who by the  order of Rakhmanov forced the deputies of Leninabad oblast to  abandon their separatist views and to come to Dushanbe for the  18th session of the Supreme Soviet.    But all these worthy services of the latter could not change  the decision of Dushanbe with respect to him. The oblast  [Leninabad] calmly reacted to the forced resignation of its  leaders. According to many analysts, the reason of this is that  Abdullojonov and Homidov have transformed the new economic  structures in oblast into their dynasty's monopoly and caused  hindrance to dozens of businessmen and entrepreneurs. That is  why this middle class of the Khujandi society have approved the  sudden changes; but on the contrary the reaction of the  leadership of the neighboring Republic of Uzbekistan to these  events was provocative.    Right after the resignation of the top persons of Leninabad  oblast, two platoons of the army of Uzbekistan left  Tavildarinskiy rayon and one platoon left the mountainous region  of Mastchoh and Aniyskiy, former Zahmatobod, rayon and returned  to Tashkent.    The relations between Imamali Rakhmanov, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan and Uzbek President Islam Karimov  have become further complicated. All of these are evidence to  the fact that lately the leadership of Uzbekistan had relied on  Abdullojonov and Homidov. In particular the proposals related  to revival of the presidential structure and nomination of  (?Homidov) to this post could be the evidence of this. It is  thought that these proposals have been started from Tashkent.  The support given to the above- mentioned proposals by Uzbek  speaking deputies of the Parliament and the Society of Uzbeks of  Tajikistan also point to the same conclusion.    The measures of Tashkent with respect to Imamali Rakhmanov  took place at the time when the latter has established close  relations with Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani. It is  possible that the latest events in Afghanistan may be connected  with these political games. At present, the units and companies  of the Uzbek Army have only remained in the border region of  Shaartuzskiy rayon and their presence is because of the events  in Afghanistan.    Similarly, protection of the Tajik-Uzbek border in the north  has been reinforced after the changes in Khujand. Tashkent  fears that in the case of the deterioration of the situation in  Khujand oblast [as heard], the unrest could spread to Fergana,  Syrdarya, Tashkent, Dzhisakh, Samarkand and Bukhara oblasts.    According to the opinions of the local observers, the action  of Imamali Rakhmanov related to relieving the leadership of  Leninabad oblast of their post as well as resignation of  Abdullojonov took place because of Russia's support.  Essentially, all these rivalries are the result of  contradictions between Russia and Uzbekistan in order to have  influence in Tajikistan. However, according to analysts, the  course of events could completely destroy the situation in the  region and cause even greater bloodshed. The experts say that  only finding a way of reconciliation between the government of  Tajikistan and the Tajik opposition can solve this case.</p>

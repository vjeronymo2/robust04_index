			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Magda </F> Pospisilova; place and date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Pospisilova] In the last few days, the  government has been working mainly on the summarization of its  policy statement. It is not quite clear from the policy  statement proposal so far to what concept of transformation the  government is going to adhere. Is it going to be a shock  method, or are you going to continue with what some people  consider to be a more acceptable method for Slovakia?    [Moravcik] We tried to solve this matter unequivocally and  express it in the programmatic statement of the government. We  are concerned with a speedy transformation, with maintaining the  budgetary deficit at a certain level, and we are also concerned  for this transformation to be socially viable. These are the  basic economic principles of the policy statement. [passage  omitted]    [Pospisilova] Are the elections going to take place at the  end of September and the beginning of October, as was agreed?    [Moravcik] We have no intention of lengthening this period.  We consider the elections at the end of September and the  beginning of October to be very necessary.    [Pospisilova] Negotiations with the IMF and World Bank  representatives that have taken place here seem to point to a  tangible change in their attitude toward Slovakia after the  change of government. Suddenly, it seems to be possible to  reach the set economic aims, not only by increasing taxes and by  reducing social allowances, subsidies, and similar items, but  also by a complex of interconnected active measures that are not  limited by the six months' period. Should the credit for this  go to the first woman deputy prime minister?    [Moravcik] Yes, she should also be credited for it. We have  to add that Mrs. Snegnerova represents a certain type of  economic and political view that is identical or very similar to  the one represented by other economy ministers. [passage omitted]    We were very pleased when this economic program found  response in the attitude of IMF representatives. It means that  our political and economic considerations are gaining an  international dimension, which is very important. It means that  we have come closer to the global way of thinking.    [Pospisilova] Representatives of the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement [MKDH] and others expressed dissatisfaction  over your government's tardiness in clarifying illegal  procedures of the so-called wild privatization of the former  government of Vladimir Meciar. Vojtech Bugar [MKDH chairman]  openly forecasts that, if you fail to clarify this matter by the  fall elections, you would lose completely. Simultaneously, he  asks what was then the point of voting the former government out  of office.    [Moravcik] Deputies did not vote the government out of  office  to confront it now with its mistakes. We took this step in  order to present a different policy, to introduce a different  political style. Naturally, it is important to point out  mistakes that were made. It must be said that, in the case of  privatization, it is not such a simple matter because illegal  steps were executed very cunningly. However, in the course of  time, we will be able to show the public the real face of those  who were privatizing in the previous government. [passage  omitted]    [Pospisilova] This week's visit of your Czech counterpart,  Vaclav Klaus, to Moscow drew attention not only because he  answered in fluent Russian the questions put to him by the  Russian editor during a live television broadcast, but also  because of the interesting agreements he concluded at the talks  with the Russian prime minister--in particular, the agreement on  settling the Russian debt to the Czech Republic. Slovak Deputy  Prime Minister Brigita Snegnerova already observed that you did  not want to continue in the direction taken by the former  government--namely, that the Russian debt to us would be paid,  for example, only by increasing import of military technology.  When then are you going to visit Moscow?    [Moravcik] We think that Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin will shortly come for a visit to Slovakia, as was  agreed.    [Pospisilova] Jozef Prokes, honorary chairman of the Slovak  National Party, said that your government was a traveling one  because you agreed on so many foreign trips right at the  beginning of your term, that they equal all the trips of  Vladimir Meciar's Cabinet undertaken in the space of more than a  year. If you are not going to Moscow, where are you going to go  within these six months?    [Moravcik] My program is not yet clarified. It is being  prepared. Concerning the reproach implied in your question,  quoting Prokes, it is totally unjustified and, in principle,  absurd because Slovakia is very dependent on foreign relations.  To move developments in all areas here in Slovakia is not  possible without very intensive foreign cooperation. It is the  government's duty to develop these contacts and to align  Slovakia into international relations.    [Pospisilova] Tomorrow's [9 April] Cabinet session will also  discuss the final report on the application of law passed by the  former federal parliament that deals with the return of the  Communist Party assets to the people of the federal republic.  This matter has been dragging on for three years, and rumors  have started to circulate about how interesting it is that,  after three years of quarrels, suddenly there is a chance to put  a stop to it--and this only one month after the present  government came to power, sharing it with seven ministers from  the Party of the Democratic Left.    [Moravcik] This point will be discussed on Tuesday's [12  April] Cabinet meeting. A full stop must be put to all  problems. We have to concentrate on business. [passage omitted]</p>

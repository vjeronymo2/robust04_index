			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Car industry is cautious over upturn: Sales for December 37 per cent higher; Ford loses lead to Rover for first time since 1984 A 37 per cent rise in new car sales last month compared with December 1991 does not signal that the motor industry has begun a sharp move out of recession, industry leaders warned last night. A significant factor in December's sharp rise was unusually large sales by some motor companies to their employees which had a disproportionate effect, in percentage terms, on the second smallest sales month of the year. The 79,903 cars registered in December brought the total for all of last year to 1,593,601 - only 0.08 per cent above the depressed level of 1991, according to Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders statistics issued yesterday. In December 1991 only 58,274 cars were sold, amounting to just 3.6 per cent of the year's total market. However, last month's figures meant that new car sales rose in each month of the final quarter of last year, indicating that a modest, sustainable recovery is under way after the market's earlier collapse from a record 2.3m units in 1989. Last year's sales were down 21 per cent on the 2m achieved in 1990 and 31 per cent down on the 1989 record. Reflecting the stance of most UK motor chiefs, Mr Ian Mc-Allister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said last night that 'it would be unwise to read too much into the dramatic rise in December sales, where special factors were involved. Incoming orders suggest that the underlying trend is showing a 10 per cent improvement, which is good news in itself.' He spoke as Ford came to terms with the fact that in December it lost the UK market leadership - to Rover - for the first time since 1984. Rover's December sales rose two thirds compared with last year to give it a market share for the month of 25.48 per cent compared with 16.65 per cent for Ford and 13.8 per cent for Vauxhall. Rover acknowledged that some 4,000 cars had been sold at discounts of up to 25 per cent to employees, and for the year as a whole it trailed well behind Ford - still in first place with 22.17 per cent. With the share of sales accounted for by imports also being reduced slightly, Sir Hal Miller, the society's chief executive, said the industry was 'delighted' with the figures. Volkswagen is to raise prices on its cars and vans by about 4.9 per cent from January 18. The average price of VW cars will have risen by about 8 per cent in two months. VAG (UK), the importer bought by VW from Lonrho on January 1, blamed the devaluation of sterling for the new increase.  ----------------------------------------------------------- UK CAR REGISTRATIONS - JANUARY-DECEMBER 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------                            December 1992          Dec '91                      Volume   Change%    Share%    Share%  ----------------------------------------------------------- Total market         79,903    +37.12    100.00    100.00 UK produced          40,860    +39.38     51.54     50.31 Imports              39,043    +34.82     48.86     49.69 Japanese makes       12,293    +115.8      15.4      9.62 Ford group           13,451     -7.64     16.84     24.99  - Ford              13,301     -7.82     16.65     24.76  - Jaguar               150     +11.9      0.19      0.23 General Motors       11,473    +23.08     14.36     15.99  - Vauxhall          11,030    +22.88     13.80     15.40  - Lotus                  5    -68.75      0.01      0.03  - Saab*                438    +33.13      0.55      0.56 Rover**              20,362    +67.35     25.48     20.88 Peugeot group         7,274    +35.30      9.10      9.23  - Peugeot            4,987    +25.55      6.24      6.82  - Citroen            2,287    +62.89      2.86      2.41 Volkswagen group      4,831    +92.55      6.04      4.30  - Volkswagen         2,342    +41.25      2.93      2.84  - Audi                 719    +77.97      0.89      0.69  - SEAT                 454   +105.43      0.57      0.38  - Skoda              1,316   +482.30      1.65      0.39 Nissan                6,802   +621.31      8.51      1.62 Renault               2,502    +11.25      3.13      3.86 Volvo                 1,487     -3.38      1.86      2.64 Toyota                2,711    +88.52      3.39      2.47 BMW                   1,401    +18.53      1.75      2.03 Fiat group            1,189    +29.24      1.49      1.58  - Fiat               1,042    +33.42      1.30      1.34  - Lancia                46   +109.09      0.06      0.04  - Alfa Romeo           101    -13.68      0.13      0.20 Honda                 1,068    -42.34      1.34      3.18 Mercedes-Benz           932    +77.52      1.17      0.90  -----------------------------------------------------------                         January-December 1992    Jan-Dec '91  ----------------------------------------------------------- Total market      1,593,601     +0.08    100.00    100.00 UK produced         718,245     +1.74     45.07     44.33 Imports             875,356     -1.25     54.93     55.67 Japanese makes      195,837     +5.97     12.3      11.59 Ford group          358,996     -8.37     22.52     24.60  - Ford             353,389     -8.44     22.17     24.24  - Jaguar             5,607     -3.48      0.35      0.36 General Motors      276,417     +6.77     17.35     16.26  - Vauxhall         266,072     +6.98     16.70     15.62  - Lotus                471    -53.19      0.03      0.06  - Saab*              9,874     +7.71      0.62      0.58 Rover**             215,257     -6.13     13.51     14.40 Peugeot group       188,434    +11.51     11.82     10.62  - Peugeot          124,019     +7.32      7.78      7.26  - Citroen           64,415    +20.57      4.04      3.36 Volkswagen group    100,806     -3.52      6.32      6.55  - Volkswagen        65,150    -12.28      4.08      4.66  - Audi              18,093    +26.14      1.14      0.90  - SEAT               8,198     +6.60      0.51      0.48  - Skoda              9,365    +14.40      0.59      0.51 Nissan               74,188    +15.53      4.66      4.03 Renault              73,165    +15.14      4.59      3.99 Volvo                43,141     -7.75      2.71      2.94 Toyota               42,213     +2.36      2.65      2.59 BMW                  40,672     +5.08      2.55      2.43 Fiat group           33,965    -14.28      2.13      2.49  - Fiat              31,006    -10.55      1.95      2.18  - Lancia               701    -46.90      0.04      0.08  - Alfa Romeo         2,258    -37.97      0.14      0.23 Honda                26,786     -5.18      1.68      1.77 Mercedes-Benz        22,425     +8.48      1.41      1.30  ----------------------------------------------------------- *GM holds 50% of Saab Automobile and has management control. ** includes Range Rover.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

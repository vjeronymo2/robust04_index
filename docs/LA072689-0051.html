			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STANDARDS URGED ON DISPOSAL OF MEDICAL WASTE  </P> <P> A year after used hypodermic syringes washed up along U.S. shores prompting  howls of protest and a spate of new government regulations, the nation's  ability to safely dispose of medical wastes has improved little, a House  subcommittee was told Tuesday.  </P> <P> To better protect the environment from potentially infectious wastes, Rep. Ron  Wyden (D-Ore.) said that the federal government should set new national  standards for handling and disposal of medical castoffs.  </P> <P> Wyden, chairman of a House Small Business subcommittee that is investigating  the issue, said that the "crazy quilt" of laws and regulations adopted after  the incidents last year has created unintended disincentives to the proper  disposal of medical waste.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urges Incinerators  </P> <P> Wyden stressed the need to build government-operated regional incinerators to  take the place of private facilities. Currently, about 90% of U.S. hospitals  burn their own waste, but tougher emissions laws are expected to make many  incinerators obsolete.  </P> <P> Some of those who testified at a hearing before Wyden's subcommittee on  regulation, business opportunities and energy said that the government needs to  become more active in dealing with the problem, but they offered few specific  recommendations.  </P> <P> Recent private and government reports have noted a lack of consensus on what  constitutes infectious waste and the extent to which it poses a public health  threat. Some states have no regulations, while others have rules that sometimes  work at cross purposes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tracking Act Passed  </P> <P> So far, the federal government's response to the problem has been limited. Last  year, Congress passed the Medical Waste Tracking Act, a measure designed to  chart the course of waste from hospitals to disposals.  </P> <P> Several officials testified that the act has been successful, but they said its  scope is too restricted. They said that better state coordination and national  waste standards focusing on the larger problem of dumping might be more  effective.  </P> <P> Most of the waste products that washed up on beaches last summer did not come  from hospitals but were illegally dumped, often by drug users, several experts  said, acknowledging that a solution to that problem will be difficult to  devise.  </P> <P> "I think there's a whole lot more to the problem than adding up the sum of the  muck that washes up," Wyden said.  </P></p>

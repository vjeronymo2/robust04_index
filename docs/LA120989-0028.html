			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR HIGH DROPOUT PROBLEM BURDENS LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS  </P> <P> As a former junior high teacher I agree with Ron Sakoda, principal of Gompers  Junior High.  </P> <P> He recently stated that part of the dropout problem is due to the lack of "fun"  electives such as wood shop where students could learn some real skills as well  as have fun.  </P> <P> Maybe if the bloated bureaucracy at LAUSD had not received such huge salary  increases lately there could have been a few more elective classes.  </P> <P> M.

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (3): The narrowing gap - Communications MR NEIL ROBERTSON, business development manager of the Cornwall Economic Development Office, believes that most businessmen who come to look at Cornwall have only been here once before. 'They remember as kids sitting in the back of their dad's old Austin car for 14 hours, driving across Dartmoor, going across Bodmin Moor, in and out of every town and village until finally they arrived at their seaside holiday.' They were left with a childhood memory of Cornwall as a far, isolated place, and may not fully realise that the journey from London or the Midlands is nowadays a lot shorter. Admittedly, there is still no motorway. But the A 30, the main spine road through Cornwall, is dual carriageway for all but 30 miles of its length. Most of the towns and villages that were once bottlenecks now have by-passes. The drive to London, with stops, takes around six hours. That is still a long time to small children but for businessmen it means only a moderate extra cost. A lorry leaving at night can reach Felixstowe or other east coast ports comfortably in eight hours. This is the maximum time that the tachograph (the so-called spy in the cab) permits a driver to stay on the road. He can then rest during the ferry crossing. Once on the continent, he can drive for another eight hours by when he is in reach of most important north European places. Mr Robertson's Development Office recommends that businesses take this route rather than the westerly crossings from Plymouth to Roscoff in France or Santander in Spain, which are far from the main European centres. The additional cost is only marginal since many cargoes are gauged by weight rather than by distance. Some large hauliers such as TNT and Securicor have set up in Cornwall because of the new businesses which settled there. Previously they handled their Cornish business from Plymouth or Bristol. For high value, low volume operations such as electronics or service companies, Cornwall's location does not necessarily mean greater expense. Many such of companies were formed before recession struck in 1990. But there are also large food companies which find it economic to import food from Europe, process it in Cornwall and distribute it throughout Britain. Any extra geographical costs can be offset by savings elsewhere. Then there is the question of what kind of managerial skills exist there. Many entrepreneurs have moved their small businesses to Cornwall because of the quality of life offers their families. But they still needed to keep in touch with London, and of it still takes four and a half hours by rail from Paddington to Truro, the duchy's administrative capital, a little too long for for frequent day trips. Until recently the answer lay with Brymon Airways, the small airline 40 per cent owned by British Airways and 40 per cent by the Danish Group Maersk. Equipped with five executive style Dash-7 aircraft, it offers four flight a day from Newquay to Heathrow. The flight takes an hour and the fare is comparable with a first class ticket on the British Rail. It actually costs more than the Pounds 66 for a first class ticket from Paddington to Truro, but there is a complimentary breakfast and a complimentary bar so the price works out roughly the same. The return flight from Heathrow to Newquay touches down at Plymouth. In the year to March, the airline carried 75,000 passengers on this route. It has other routes but because of recession and the Gulf war, which hit most airlines, Brymon had a very bad year. It expects a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m for its last financial year on a turnover of Pounds 30m. Usually, however, the Newquay to Heathrow route is very successful. The Dash-7s fly at 68 per cent capacity and more than 90 per cent of the passengers are business people. However, Brymon is worried by the decision of Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Secretary of State for Transport, to take the advice of the Civil Aviation Authority and throw open Heathrow to new scheduled and charter operators. Regional airlines such as Brymon have been told they will retain landing rights at Heathrow. But Brymon is concerned over an earlier statement by the British Airports Authority, owner of Heathrow, that 'if there is any major relaxation (of access to Heathrow), we may need to respond with pricing factors, involving higher Heathrow charges'. Mr Malcolm Naylor, managing director of Brymon, says 'any self respecting supplier of a monopoly product with unsatisfied demand would do the same'. However, Brymon's fees at Heathrow have risen 120 per cent in the past five years and account for one third of revenue on this route. The airline does not expect to be physically ejected from Heathrow but Mr Naylor fears it could be priced out. 'It has got to be Heathrow. Around 75 per cent of our passengers fly on from there to other destinations in the US and the Far East. Stansted and Gatwick just are no good for our needs', Mr Naylor says.</p>

He said in his Lunar New Year message that in a period of  unrest caused by different religions, races and conflicts, Macao  is still a place which bears understanding between different  cultures and a model in dealing with difficulties with peaceful  attitude.    The governor said he is convinced that the planned visit by  Portuguese premier and the announced visit by Portuguese  president to the People's Republic of China would be an  important symbol of maintenance of the mutual understanding and  friendly cooperation between the two countries.    Thus, he continued, "We have sufficient reasons to predict  that we'll have all conditions that will enable us to work for  our economic modernization, improving our infrastructural  construction and implementing localization policies."    He hoped that all people would do a good job in the new  year,  saying that "Our success will be a powerful contribution to the  strengthening of friendship between China and Portugal and a  stable base for the progress of Macao."</p>

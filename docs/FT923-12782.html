			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Small increase in jobless revives recovery hopes A SMALLER rise than expected in unemployment last month has revived cautious hopes about a recovery later this year. Government statistics published yesterday show that seasonally adjusted unemployment rose by 7,000 in June, the smallest increase for two years. It was the 27th consecutive monthly rise and brought the number registered as unemployed to 2,722,700, the highest total since August 1987. The rise followed a revised increase of 20,400 in May, and one of 42,600 in April. During the three months to June, the average monthly increase has been 23,300, the smallest recorded for any three-month period since September 1990. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the news was encouraging. She added: 'We all know that the improvement in the employment situation lags recovery, but this time there will not be such a long lag as in the 1980s.' The Treasury said the figures were 'a clear sign that increases in unemployment are abating' but the Labour party said there was 'no immediate prospect of a reduction in unemployment and the misery this brings'. Ignoring seasonal fluctuations, unemployment fell by 29,701 to 2,678,191. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 9.6 per cent, the same as in May. Out of the 7,000 extra people added to the adjusted jobless total, just over half were in the south-east, including Greater London. The 3,600 addition for the south-east pushed the unemployment rate for the region to 9.2 per cent, up 0.1 of a point on May. While most other regions saw small increases in jobless totals, the east Midlands and north-west England registered slight falls, of 200 and 300 respectively. The Employment Department also reported that registered workers - including people in employment, the self-employed and those in the armed forces and on government training programmes - totalled 25.56m at the end of March. Although that was 64,000 down on three months earlier, the reduction in employment was the smallest quarterly fall since mid 1990. While the number of workers in manufacturing showed a fall of 73,000 in the first quarter to 4.6m, those employed in services rose by 68,000 to 15.7m. That was the first quarterly rise in service employment since the second quarter of 1990. Unfilled vacancies at government JobCentres fell by 5,100 in June to 109,500.</p>

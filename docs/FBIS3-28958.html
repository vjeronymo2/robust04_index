			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- The government will  submit to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on  Tuesday South Korea's farm market opening schedule for 1,298  items under the Uruguay Round accord reached last December.    Revealing the schedule at a National Assembly Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Committee meeting on Monday, Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries Minister Kim Yang-pae said it would not  contain any cuts of tariff equivalent -- the difference between  the world and domestic prices -- on rice.    Instead, under the Uruguay Round accord the government will  allow a minimum rice market access of 1 percent of domestic  consumption for imported rice in 1995 and increase the rate to 2  percent in 1999, 2.5 percent in 2000 and 4 percent in 2004,  while not tarifficating rice for 10 years starting in 1995, Kim  added.    Regarding the 111 items due for tariffication under the  accord, the schedule calls for a 10-percent cut in the tariff  equivalents determined by the difference between world and  domestic prices in the 1988-90 period.    For barley, potatoes and other items whose imports are  currently minimal or zero, a minimum market access of 3-5  percent of domestic consumption will be permitted, while for  corn, soybeans and others whose imports currently stand at more  then 3 percent of domestic consumption, the existing tariff  system will apply.    As for the "balance-of-payments" clause items such as beef,  pork and chicken, the schedule will apply the tariff rates  already agreed with the United States and other countries. On  red pepper, garlic, onions and other "non-concessional" items, a  10-percent cut in the tariff equivalents is called for over the  coming 10 years, Minister Kim said.    For 102 import-liberalized items such as mushrooms and  carrots, the schedule sets forth a 10-percent cut in rates  determined by multiplying their 1986 basic rates by 150 percent  or more, while a special determining method will be used for the  175 tariff cut preference items, including fruit juice and  sunflower seeds.    Tariff cuts on frozen strawberries, soybean sauce and 813  other items will be made on the basis of their basic rates in  1986 or their concessional rates.    Minister Kim said the schedule would also call for a  13.3-percent cut in farm subsidies and a minimum subsidy of 10  percent of farming costs over a 10-year period ending in 2004,  reducing total subsidies from 1,718 billion won to 1,493 billion  won. But subsidies for grapes, silkworms and dairy products  will be less than 10 percent of the cost, he added.</p>

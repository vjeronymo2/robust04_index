			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (22): Key role in commercial computing - . . . For Unix UNIX is an operating system: the software that controls the computer hardware so that business systems can be loaded and run and given access to data files on disc, to printers and to other resources. However, Unix is special: it is being worked into a standard so that it can run on different computers of all sizes. Computer manufacturers have traditionally sold their own operating systems with their own computers. This has tied customers in, because moving to another supplier has meant large redevelopment of application programs. This tradition has also limited users' choice of program packages. Huge development costs have restricted package suppliers to offering their products on a very limited number of operating systems. All this is gradually changing, thanks to Unix, an unlikely candidate for such a key role in commercial computing. For one thing, Unix was originally developed more than 30 years ago by a researcher at AT&amp;T privately working on a computer game. Ken Thompson found a mainframe computer unsuitable for a game for a single user, so he wrote an operating system for a spare DEC minicomputer. As an operating system supporting on-line working on relatively cheap minicomputers, Unix gained a considerable following in universities, especially as AT&amp;T provided it at little cost. Meanwhile, the heart of the system was rewritten in the 'C' programming language, which runs on a variety of computers. Unix could now be moved from one computer to another without massive redevelopment. However, this meant universities and companies adapted it in different ways for their own needs. In 1980, Microsoft turned Unix into a serious product by launching a version called Xenix and other suppliers started showing interest. AT&amp;T now sought to regain control and in 1983 launched a version called System V to try to set a standard. The standards movement started rolling slowly in 1984, when X/Open was formed as a world-wide body of users and suppliers to gather contributions on standards, especially relating to Unix, and publish specifications based on the best proposals. However, the Unix world was split in 1988 when two rival industry groups were formed: Unix International, led by Unix originator AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems, and the Open Software Foundation, with top computer manufacturers IBM, Hewlett Packard and DEC among the founders. Unix International based its future on the Unix System V developed by AT&amp;T through its Unix System Laboratories subsidiary. The Open Software Foundation meanwhile built its Unix by combining the best pieces of software from its member companies. The organisation argued that there were risks in allowing a single company, AT&amp;T, to control Unix. Computer manufacturers joined one group or the other and there was open war. However, user pressure brought a truce, if not peace. This was marked in 1991 when Unix International adopted the Open Software Foundation's Distributed Computing Environment, a piece of software which enables different computers running different operating systems to work together. This and other agreements mean there is now considerable compatibility between versions of Unix in the way different versions run application programs. In March this year there was significant progress when all sides announced they would work towards common standards at the user level: in particular, to ensure common user screens and facilities - known as graphical user interfaces - the adoption of the same networking products, plus agreement on standards in the handling of graphics, multimedia (the linking, for example, of tradit ional magnetic disc files with pictures from CDs) and the management of company-wide distributed systems. Six companies from the rival factions, including world computer industry leader IBM, Hewlett Packard - which claims over 40 per cent of the world Unix market - AT&amp;T's Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems, announced they would combine the best of their products in these areas, present a single specification to X/Open and then make that specification available to anyone - free of charge. In addition they committed themselves to dropping further development of their own products and standardising on the agreed specifications. RED-LETTER DAY The six companies' announcement drew instant support from another two-dozen organisations, many of which made equal commitments to adopt the standards - 'this is a red-letter day for open systems and a sign that the open systems industry is showing a bit of maturity at last,' said Mr Bernard Hulme, head of marketing and support for Europe at Unix specialist software house Santa Cruz Operation. Mr Geoff Morris, chief executive of X/Open, said that by basing the proposed standard on established products the six suppliers ensured that the specification should be available by June. The six are organising a seminar for applications software producers in October and expect to launch products based on the standards in the first half of next year. The spectre at the Unix feast is Microsoft, ruler of the personal computer operating system market as developer of MS-DOS and Windows and due to announce its more sophisticated NT in a month's time. Unix suppliers are pooh-poohing NT. Yet at the announcement by the six partners in March they took every opportunity to attack Microsoft, even when answering questions on other topics. And only the week before the chief executive of Unix International, Mr Peter Cunningham, was in London with a presentation which specifically brought the NT challenge to the audience's attention and then proceeded to knock it down. Unix is available on computers ranging from powerful desk-top machines to mainframes. The focus of NT is expected to be desk-top machines and office processors managing local files and programs and running networks. If there is to be a battle at office and even desk-top level between Unix and NT, as many observers believe, last month's announcement means that the Unix army at last seems to be approaching unity. This in turn means that whatever the outcome of the battle, the customer looking for open systems already seems set to be the winner.</p>

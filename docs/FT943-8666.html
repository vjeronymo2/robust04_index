			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange woos listings by foreign companies The London Stock Exchange is to set up its first-ever share listing programme for foreign companies who want to tap into the UK's capital market. The move, announced yesterday, is part of the exchange's efforts to market itself to non-UK companies, strengthening its role as a centre for international share trading. Mr Michael Lawrence, London Stock Exchange chief executive, has pointed to the success of US exchanges in attracting foreign companies, particularly those based in emerging markets, to seek listings there. The success of the New York stock exchange and the Nasdaq stock market in attracting these companies has strengthened the role of the US exchanges in international share trading. Under the programme, foreign companies will be invited to set up so-called depositary receipts. These are sterling-denominated bundles of shares in a single company held by a trust bank which then issues certificates. The number of shares per bundle and the underlying currency will vary with each issuing company. The exchange expects the strongest interest in obtaining a listing for depositary receipts to come from companies based in emerging markets such as South East Asia and Latin America. Yesterday, the Inland Revenue said that unlike trading in the shares of UK-listed companies, investors would not pay the standard 0.5 per cent stamp duty on each depositary receipt transaction. However, issuing companies will have to pay stamp duty of 1.5 per cent on all shares transformed into depositary receipts. The rules are intended to make trading in the depositary receipts competitive with trading costs in the home country. Listing requirements and fees for those seeking depositary receipt status will be lower than for UK companies on the Official List. However, they will conform to the minimum set out in European Union law. The issuer must have a three-year trading record and, although audited accounts for the previous three years must be presented, the accounts may be prepared in accordance with home country standards. They also need not be consolidated. The depositary, typically a bank, must be acceptable to the exchange, and there must be at least one firm which agrees to act as market maker in respect of each company's depositary receipts.</p>

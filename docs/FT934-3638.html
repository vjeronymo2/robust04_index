			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / People: Robins takes Plastow's place at C&amp;W Sir David Plastow, who took over as chairman of Inchcape in September 1992, has decided to reduce his range of outside directorships and will step down as a non-executive director of Cable and Wireless at the end of the month. Sir David, who is also deputy chairman of Guinness, the TSB and BUPA as well as being chairman of the Medical Research Council, joined the board of Cable and Wireless in 1991. Some six months later he was asked to take over the chairmanship of Inchcape following the death of Sir George Turnbull. Inchcape, an international services group, operates in over 80 countries and Sir David's job entails a great deal of overseas travel - which explains his decision to resign the directorship of Cable and Wireless. He stepped down from the board of Tenneco, the US conglomerate, last year. His seat on the Cable and Wireless board is being taken by a former colleague - Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce (above). Both Sir David and Sir Ralph started their business careers in different parts of the Rolls-Royce empire in the mid-1950s. Sir David came up through Rolls-Royce Motors and Sir Ralph made his name on the aero engine side of the business. After Rolls-Royce was bailed out by the government in the 1970s, their careers diverged. Although they both remain good friends and are of the same age, Cable and Wireless stressed that the appointment of Robins was a coincidence. Sir Ralph, 61, had been vetted by Cable and Wireless's nominations committee and he had been interviewed by all the non-executive directors. He will join the board next April.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IG-Metall Chairman Klaus Zwickel by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given:  "IG-Metall Chief: We Do Not Want to Ruin the Economy With  Strikes"]    [Text] [BILD] What result do you expect from the strike  ballot?    [Zwickel] I expect overwhelming approval for the strike.  Some months ago approval was still not so great. Since then it  has increased constantly.    [BILD] Why?    [Zwickel] This is primarily due to the employer's blocking  attitude and to the fact that the working people have realized  how important binding wage contracts are, because they have  oriented their plans for life toward that. The employers want  clearly to worsen these contracts by canceling them at the  expense of the employees. And now the working people say: Not  with us!    [BILD] Is the strike assuming political dimensions?    [Zwickel] We want to limit the strike. We do not want to  ruin the economy with strikes. With the strike ballot in Lower  Saxony and the possibility of expanding it to the area of the  "western coast," we want to make it clear that we will limit the  conflict regionally.    However, if the employers respond with lock-outs in other  areas and if, at the beginning of the super election year, the  shameful Article 116 of the Labor Promotion Law -- which the  Federal Government wanted -- for the first time leads to  hundreds of thousands of people outside a strike district being  turned into the streets without financial support, then we will  have a large-scale conflict with political dimensions.    [BILD] If the employers' chief negotiator now calls you and  asks: Could the two of us meet for breakfast at some time and  try to find a solution....    [Zwickel] I prefer to breakfast with my wife. But joking  apart: Readiness for negotiations alone is insufficient. An  offer must be put on the table. We want to reach a compromise  as quickly as possible. This must be done during the first two  weeks of the strike in Lower Saxony. If this is not done, there  will be strikes in two wage areas after the second strike ballot.    [BILD] And what if nothing happens then, either?    [Zwickel] Then we want to wait and see. However, I think  that there are not just firebrands among the employers but also  people with a sense of responsibility. If this is not so, the  strikes must continue until a compromise is found.    [BILD] What is your goal?    [Zwickel] We want safe employment and are also willing to  have wage increases included in this calculation.    [BILD] But the economy is in a bad state....    [Zwickel] We have made concessions to the employers in many  fields. However, they are practically forcing us to strike.    [BILD] How full are your coffers?    [Zwickel] They are full enough for us to be able to finance  the strike. However, we cannot finance lock-outs.    [BILD] How do you, as IG-Metall chief, feel before a strike?    [Zwickel] I am aware of my special responsibility. I am  very worried about the employers' likely decision to impose  lock-outs. Then the people's behavior might become  uncontrollable.    When hundreds of thousands are locked out, there is the  danger that they will no longer follow their trade union. I am  worried about the spontaneous individual reactions that develop  if people want to get into their companies and are prevented  from doing so.</p>

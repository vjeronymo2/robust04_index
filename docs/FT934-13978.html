			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Four banks in final bidding for Gota THREE Swedish banks and one foreign bank have reached the final round of the bidding for Gota Bank. Gota, one of two large commercial banks which the state had to take over last year at the height of Sweden's financial crisis, has some SKr60bn (USDollars 7.62bn) of healthy assets. The government's aim is to finalise the sale before the end of the year. According to one estimate, Gota could fetch a price of between SKr2.5bn and SKr3bn, given the general recovery that has taken place in the country's banking sector this year. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Handelsbanken and Nordbanken have confirmed that they are the Swedish banks in the bidding, but the identity of the foreign bank is unclear. The four banks have been selected from the 12 candidates which submitted preliminary bids to acquire all or part of Gota Bank last month. The short-listed contenders have said that they are interested in acquiring the whole bank, excluding the SKr43bn of problem loans which were last month split off into a separate 'bad bank' entity, called Retriva. Analysts said that a Swedish buyer would be able to derive greater synergy than a foreign bank from a takeover. 'It is difficult to see why a foreign financial institution would be interested in buying a regional bank with a very high cost structure and a client base of small- and medium-sized businesses and private individuals,' said one observer. However, Sweden's finance minister Mrs Anne Wibble has made plain that she would welcome a foreign purchaser of a Swedish bank. A victory for Nordbanken, which has also been taken over by the state, would be controversial because the government has been criticised for capitalising it too generously.</p>

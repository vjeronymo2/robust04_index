			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Independent Newspapers doubles to IPounds 16m INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the Irish publishing group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits doubled from IPounds 7.97m to IPounds 16m for the year to December 25. The outcome was struck after exceptional items of IPounds 1.23m (IPounds 3.37m) related to continuing rationalisation costs. Turnover increased to IPounds 169.9m (IPounds 155.8m); opera-ting profit jumped 45 per cent to IPounds 23.4m (IPounds 16.2m). Higher advertising volumes increased the group's market share in Ireland as growth in circulation revenues also improved profitability of domestic newspaper operations. In the UK, the publishing side incurred a small loss but was now showing signs of improvement, said Mr Liam Healy, chief execu- tive. The results included a maiden six month contribution of IPounds 3.1m from Australian Provincial Newspapers, where the group increased its indirect interest to 20 per cent last July. Net interest charges rose from IPounds 2.53m to IPounds 3.08m. The group said it will shortly be relieved from bond servicing costs which amounted to IPounds 1.8m in 1992. A final dividend of 10p makes 15.5p (14p) for the year. Fully diluted earnings per share increased 64 per cent to 32.67p (19.93p). A 2-for-3 scrip issue is also proposed.</p>

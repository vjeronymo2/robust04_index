Al-Qadhdhafi has sent a personal message to President  Mubarak, informing him of Libya's commitment not to touch Libyan  opposition figures who reside in or have been granted asylum in  Egypt.    Libya has informed Cairo that it was not involved in  al-Kikhya's disappearance on 10 December 1993 either directly or  indirectly. Libyan Embassy sources noted that the investigations  carried out by Egyptian security agencies have not pointed a  finger at anyone.    Egyptian Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi  submitted a report to President Mubarak about the circumstances  surrounding al-Kikhya's disappearance.</p>

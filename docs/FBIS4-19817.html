			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Industrial  Credit Cooperatives (BVR, Bonn) expects a two in front of the  decimal point in the inflation rate this May at the latest.  Import prices as well as industrial producer prices have  remained almost stable for months, and the pressure of prices in  services and rents is also declining, the BVR writes in its  economic report, published on Wednesday [20 April]. As a  result, the prospects for economic development have further  improved regarding prices. Since, at the same time, foreign  orders have increased strongly in the wake of the international  economic recovery, the BVR expects a slightly increasing output  for the coming months, even though domestic demand remains  rather weak.    In general, framework conditions for economic recovery have  improved strongly over the past few months. The revival of the  international economic development is now also reflected in  orders received from abroad, which were about 7 percent higher  during the first two months of this year than a year ago. The  companies' measures for rationalization and cost reduction are  beginning to have an effect.    The wage negotiations, which have practically been  concluded,  will lead to a clear reduction of costs for the companies. The  development of collective wages and salaries in the most  important fields amounts to 1.5 percent in gross terms and is  thus lower than the expected increase in productivity. Improved  expectations for income and sales have a positive influence on  investments, in particular since tax conditions have improved as  a result of the Location Safeguarding Law.</p>

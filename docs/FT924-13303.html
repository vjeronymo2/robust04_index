			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Trafalgar forced to amend accounts TRAFALGAR House, the engineering, property and construction group, has bowed to pressure from the Financial Reporting Review Panel to amend its 1991 accounts. The FRRP had threatened to seek a court order requiring Trafalgar to prepare revised accounts for the financial year ending September 30 last year. The amendments will cut Trafalgar's 1991 pre-tax profits by Pounds 102.7m to Pounds 19.7m and reduce shareholders' funds by Pounds 20m. Trafalgar will restate the 1991 figures when the 1992 accounts are published. The FRRP was set up last year to monitor standards of financial reporting. The Trafalgar case is the largest issue it has yet considered and the first time it has come close to going to court. The panel said the case showed companies that it 'would and will go to court if necessary'. Trafalgar is under siege from Hongkong Land, which last week failed to build on its 14.9 per cent stake in Trafalgar through a tender offer. Trafalgar said in its defence document against the tender, published earlier this month, that it was in talks with the FRRP but that amendments to its accounting practices and policies should not affect the aggregate of shareholders' funds at September 30, 1991. The group had reclassified some properties as fixed assets rather than current assets. As a result a Pounds 102.7m deficit on revaluation of properties had originally been charged direct to reserves. This deficit will now be charged against 1991 profits, cutting the pre-tax profit from Pounds 122.4m. The company will also change its policy on advance corporation tax, adding Pounds 20m to the 1991 tax charge originally stated at Pounds 40.4m, and reducing shareholders funds' at September 30, 1991 by Pounds 20m to Pounds 684.6m. The change in policy on ACT will also affect the 1992 tax charge, increasing the write-off. Trafalgar's 1991 accounts received an unqualified report from its auditors Touche Ross. The Ritz, Trafalgar's luxury London hotel, yesterday lost an appeal to the House of Lords to overturn a High Court ruling that the hotel was to blame when Mr Anthony Ward fell over the balustrade on the hotel's terrace. Mr Ward is suing the hotel for up to Pounds 3m, which if successful will be the largest personal damages award ever given in the UK. Lex, Page 24; Observer, Page 23</p>

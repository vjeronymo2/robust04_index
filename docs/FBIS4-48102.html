			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has said  that the experience of South Africa, where a democratic  administration was installed today, is a big lesson for Nigeria.  He was speaking in an interview with a Radio Nigeria Network  news correspondent in Pretoria shortly after watching the  inauguration of Dr. Nelson Mandela.    Gen. Abacha stressed that his administration was committed  and anxious to return the country to democratic rule. He  reaffirmed the readiness of the government to support the  transition program with human and material resources to make it  a huge success.    The head of state said that Nigeria's high commissioner to  South Africa would soon be named. Our correspondent reports  that already a building has been acquired in Pretoria for use by  the Nigeria High Commission when established.</p>

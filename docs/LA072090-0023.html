			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAIL FACILITY STUDIED FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY  </P> <P> U.S. Postal Service officials announced Thursday that they hope to build a mail  facility in the Antelope Valley in the next several years as part of an effort  to improve service and shorten delivery times in the area.  </P> <P> Regional Postmaster William Jackson said the new facility could be anything  from a 200,000-square-foot mail processing center on about 20 acres to a  substantially smaller distribution center, depending on the outcome of studies  on the area's service needs.  </P> <P> "We've got to manage and service the growth in the Antelope Valley area,"  Jackson said. "We've got what was a rural area rapidly becoming an urban area."  He said his Van Nuys-based postal headquarters should have a specific proposal  for the Antelope Valley facility by next month.  </P> <P> The Postal Service's goal will be to give Antelope Valley residents overnight  delivery of letters addressed to at least some Los Angeles areas. Now it  usually takes two days to get mail to Los Angeles. Any new facility would  require approval from postal officials in Washington.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Act does not allow for bans on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions under these or any other circumstances, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible for the State or HCFA to impose State monitoring as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an additional remedy. While large civil money penalties are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also allowed, they may not be as likely to result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediate corrections, since they may not be collected until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility has the opportunity for a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters believed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation as proposed does not promote the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies in situations involving immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy and argued that this approach does not follow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spirit of OBRA '87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act makes a clear distinction between how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases involving immediate jeopardy will be handled as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to how all other cases will be handled. The Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deficiencies through the use of temporary management or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, or both. While it allows for the use of other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies which are in addition to temporary management or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> termination, it is clear that the penalty for a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with noncompliance which constitutes immediate jeopardy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to be swift and severe. The regulation reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intent of the Act; therefore, the use of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies in addition to temporary management is allowed but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not stressed for immediate jeopardy situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters asked for a better  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of immediate and serious threat. Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that the scope and severity scale, as issued for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment in the proposed rule, would lead to many more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances of immediate jeopardy than are now being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the many comments received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the proposed scope and severity scale, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amending the definition of immediate jeopardy in the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation (see &sect;488.301). In making decisions on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of immediate jeopardy, HCFA and the States will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to refer to the traditional guidance on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject which is contained in Appendix Q of the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter pointed out that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation does not address who will prevail (HCFA or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State) about whether or not immediate jeopardy exists in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, and asked for clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFA always has the option of reviewing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's compliance determination and making its own decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the survey agency's survey findings. It is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for HCFA to conduct its own survey of a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to make a decision as to whether immediate jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does or does not exist. Whether HCFA's decision is based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its own survey or on a review of the State's findings, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision as to whether or not immediate jeopardy exists is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made pursuant to section 1919(h)(5) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the determination of immediate jeopardy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether it is the survey agency's or the Secretary's, will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that the facility and not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State be responsible for notifying attending physicians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and licensure boards, as outlined in &sect;&sect;488.410(e) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 488.325(h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated in sections 1819(g)(5)(C) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(g)(5)(C) of the Act, Disclosure of Results of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inspections and Activities, the responsibility for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification lies with the State; it may not be redelegated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter asked that we clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.410(e) to indicate that the notice should go to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensing authority of the nursing home administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree, and this comment is reflected in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters asked that the text of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.410(c)(2)(i) be amended to indicate that the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management is for the purpose of correcting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies that resulted in a finding of immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are not adopting these comments, as we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe they would provide for a more narrow interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the Act specifies at sections 1819(h)(4) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(5). These sections state that the appointment of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary manager shall be for the purpose of removing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardy and correcting the deficiencies. Further, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated in the comments and responses for &sect;488.415,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temporary management will be removed when the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminated, or when HCFA or the survey agency has determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the facility is in substantial compliance and has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management capability to ensure continued substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with all requirements. Consistent with sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(2), 1919(h)(2) and (h)(3) of the Act, temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management would not necessarily end as soon as deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> causing the immediate jeopardy have been corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four commenters indicated that HCFA should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt a procedure utilized in Louisiana, whereby a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may request sanctions other than a temporary manager and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request may be granted if the State determines that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate plan to correct has been devised by the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State can monitor the implementation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As presented, this procedure does not appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the requirements of the Act which call for immediate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action to remove the immediate jeopardy through termination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or appointment of temporary management, or both. It would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear that the proposed procedure would allow something  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to a directed plan of correction and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring to replace termination or temporary management as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the remedies for immediate jeopardy cases. Such a policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would constitute a violation of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.412&blank;Action When There Is No Immediate Jeopardy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters said that the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State or the facility to repay funds received from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal government if corrective action was not taken in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the approved plan of correction conflicts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with HCFA's intent to promote the use of alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments regarding the State and facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment provision of &sect;488.412(a) will be answered in our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of proposed &sect;488.232 (redesignated as &sect;488.450,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuation of payments to a facility with deficiencies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters objected to the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a denial of payment for new admissions be imposed if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any deficiency remains uncorrected 90 days after the survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They believed that it is illogical to cut off funds after 90  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days because the funds might be needed to make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrections. Other commenters said that the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should allow continued participation with substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance because the 100 percent compliance is impossible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to achieve. Still other commenters made the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Major physical environment deficiencies may take longer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 90 days to correct;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The regulations should permit an appeal of the decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to deny payments for new admissions;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

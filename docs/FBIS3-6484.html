Also, it has gained a noble achievement in  maintaining the solid unity and cohesion with them. The  people's absolute trust in the party is just a true  revolutionary ethos in our society.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our  people only recognize the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] as their  political guide and totally entrust their fate to the party.  They are also overflowing with a firm resolution to consummate  the chuche revolutionary cause to the end under the leadership  of the party.    The devotion and greatness of our party -- which sacrifices  itself to the interest and happiness of the popular masses --  our people's absolute support and trust in the party, and the  invincibility of the unity and cohesion between the party and  the popular masses have been fully embodied in our social ethos  in which the party serves the people, while the people trust and  follow it.    The party's political leadership for the masses and the  people's trust in the party are inseparably related to each  other. The people's trust in the party will be deepened only if  the party's leadership, the party's politics, serves the popular  masses. Also, the working class party can maintain close ties  of kinship with the popular masses.    Under the wise leadership of the great comrade leader and  the  dear comrade leader, our party has, first of all, formulated the  people-oriented policies in all stages of the revolution, as  well as in all areas of the social life. By vigorously  implementing them, it has established a high leading authority  among the popular masses. As a result, it is absolutely  supported and trusted by the people.    Ties between the party and the masses can be maintained  based  on the people's absolute trust in the party. Also, the people's  trust in the party can be consolidated based on the party's  people- oriented policy. If the party encroaches upon the  interest of the popular masses or carries out a policy running  counter to the people's intent, it cannot obtain support from  the masses nor maintain close ties of kinship with them.    Our party has given priority to satisfying the demands of  the  people even when it has to adopt a decision. Also, it has  considered the people's convenience first even when it has to  build a certain plant. All our party's policies are rooted in  the people's interest and happiness.    By regarding the constant enhancement of the people's  standard of living as the best principle for our party's  activity, the dear comrade leader has led the party to  energetically struggle to responsibly and endlessly take care of  the people's material and cultural lives and to provide them  with an abundant life.    Even today, our party has constantly carried out the grand  plans and operations to significantly raise the people's  standard of living. It has also resolved to do everything if it  is for the people.    This is why our people entirely entrust their destinies to  our party and fight through fire and water for the party.    Our party also wins the people's great confidence by  providing all members of society with worthy lives and by  trusting them. The party's and leader's trust is the  ideological and spiritual source that makes the popular masses  trust the party and the leader. People can enjoy worthy lives  because they trust the party and the leader.    Our people's confidence in the party is being amplified by  our party's trust that guides and enables them to glorify their  valuable political lives forever.    Thanks to the great trust of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il, who values the people's social and political lives  above all, all working people in various classes and strata have  been able to grow to be undaunted revolutionaries with precious  social and political lives even in the environment of our  country, which has a very complicated social structure of  residents [chumindurui sahoejok kusongi maeu pokchaphan  urinaraui chogonesodo].

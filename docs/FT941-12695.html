			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: 3M shares hit by stagnant figures 3M, the Minnesota-based diversified adhesive, magnetic tape and medical products manufacturer, marked time in the fourth quarter. The group reported income for the quarter of Dollars 286m or Dollars 1.33 per share, little changed from Dollars 289m or Dollars 1.33, a year ago. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 3.4bn the year earlier. The company said that while sales volume increased by 8 per cent in the quarter, selling prices dipped 3 per cent, with the strong US dollar affecting overseas sales. Currency fluctuations reduced income by an estimated Dollars 22m, or 10 cents per share. Mr Giulio Agostini, 3M's chief financial officer, said the company's first quarter in the next fiscal year might also be flat, or fail to match last year. 3M's fourth-quarter performance and its cautious comments on earnings sent the company's shares down Dollars 4 1/8 to close at Dollars 106 7/8 on Wall Street yesterday. For the year, 3M's income was Dollars 1.26bn or Dollars 5.82, up from Dollars 1.23bn or Dollars 5.63 in 1992. Sales for the year were Dollars 14bn, up from Dollars 13.88bn last year. Mr Agostini said the company's cost-cutting measures were proceeding ahead of schedule. 3M expected to shed 5,000 jobs by the end of 1995. The company projects sales growth to continue at a moderate 6 per cent to 7 per cent in 1994.</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Amtrak plans to cut services and workforce Amtrak, the US government-owned passenger rail company, yesterday announced plans to cut its workforce by a quarter and shut 21 per cent of its routes in an effort to drag itself out of the red for the first time in six years. The Amtrak board approved elimination of three main routes in the west and midwest, shutdown of segments of 10 other routes and frequency cuts on other routes - including even Amtrak's flagship Metroliner service between Washington and New York. Cuts will be phased in from April next year, and will lead to elimination of about 5,400 jobs - including 600 management jobs which the company has already said it would cut. Mr Tom Downs, Amtrak's president, said the cuts would reduce revenue by Dollars 66m (Pounds 42.3m) a year but cut expenses by Dollars 430m. Even though phased in, he said, they should produce a balanced budget by the end of this fiscal year on September 30. Without the changes, Mr Downs said, Amtrak faced a Dollars 200m cash shortfall this year, despite an Dollars 822m federal government subsidy. Amtrak was created in 1971 with what was intended to be a once-and-for-all subsidy of Dollars 140m and a mandate to 'operate rail service on a for-profit basis. It has since cost taxpayers about Dollars 16bn. The company said yesterday its financial weakness was attributable to 'an undercapitalised system being spread too thin, trying to provide more service than the corporation is capable of providing, and to brutal price competition from the airlines.' This ought to be the best of times for Amtrak: frequent air crashes, especially of smaller commuter airlines, should have presented a golden opportunity to win passengers back - although Amtrak has had its own share of crashes in recent years. However, the number of travellers fell by about 300,000 last year to 22m and it faces increasing demands from the freight companies over whose tracks it runs. Amtrak has also been obliged to keep open many unprofitable routes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Sadiq] </F>   [Excerpt] Washington -- Representatives from the United  States, Jordan, and Israel yesterday began talks in Washington  which will last two days, that is in the framework of the  tripartite U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli committee formed in the wake  of the creditor states conference held in Washington at the  beginning of last October, to discuss economic issues. Israel  and Jordanian officials are hoping that these talks will help to  break the deadlock in the peace negotiations.    Sources in Washington have said that the talks, which are  the  fourth round held by the committee, will discuss issues like the  issue of the border between Jordan and Israel, as the latter has  agreed to discuss it in these talks. The sources denied that  the talks are a kind of Jordanian separation to secure a peace  agreement with Israel.    Meanwhile, Jordanian sources have said that the talks being  held in Washington were not allocated to discussing the border  issue, but to discussing economic issues in the framework of the  tripartite committee. But Israel agreed to discuss the border  issue.    The sources pointed out that the talks will also deal with  the water issue between the two countries. However, they  stressed that it is out of the question for Jordan to sign a  peace agreement outside the scope of the comprehensive solution  on the basis of which the peace process was launched.

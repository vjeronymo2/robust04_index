			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (21): Airbus takes the strain - France fights against falling orders THE French aircraft industry was given a much needed shot in the arm in July, when United Airlines, one of Boeing's main customers, ordered up to Dollars 5bn worth of Airbus A320 airliners. The sales coup comes as French state-owned Aerospatiale, a 37.9 per cent shareholder in the European Airbus consortium, is struggling with a decline in orders in both civil and defence markets. It needs the breathing space. Aerospatiale saw its orders fall by 50 per cent last year, worse than the overall 30 per cent decline recorded by the French aerospace industry generally in 1991, according to Gifas, the industry federation. Snecma, the state-controlled engine maker, saw its orders go down by 30 per cent, and Dassault, the maker of fighter jets which has not had a military export order for four years, saw its orders fall by a quarter. They all know that United Airlines type bonanzas will be very rare, so they cannot depend on a sudden upturn in civil business to bail them out. The same is true of defence markets, where the French military, French aerospace companies' main defence customer, has been told to freeze its budget in real terms for the next three years. French aerospace companies' response, therefore, has been to step up the search for foreign alliances, to pool their heavy research budgets, exchange costly technology and seek economies of scale. In the past year, Aerospatiale led the first real rationalisation of the hard-pressed western helicopter industry through a merger of its helicopter business with Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to form Eurocopter. The new group, formed in January and controlled by Aerospatiale, becomes the world's second largest supplier after Sikorski of the US. Mr Jean-Francois Bigay, its French chairman, believes this is the first step towards cutting the number of leading western helicopter makers from eight to three or four by the end of the decade. In defence, Dassault recently revealed that it is discussing collaboration on a future generation of fighter aircraft with British Aerospace. This would come into production in at least 30 years' time. It is separate from the troubled four-nation European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) and France's Rafale, the two new fighter projects in which both companies are separately involved. Sadly for Dassault, the Rafale cannot replace the EFA because it is designed for ground attack, rather than the air to air combat for which the heavier EFA is needed. France is sticking to the Rafale, on which Dassault's future largely depends, but has been forced by the pressure on its defence budget to delay the first deliveries by two years to 1998. Seeking strength through co-operation is also behind the plans by Aerospatiale, with Dasa and Alenia of Italy to acquire joint control of Fokker, the Dutch aircraft producer. The trio teamed up last year to form a regional aircraft consortium called Regioliner, controlled by Dasa, resembling a mini-Airbus Industrie. Airbus has been thinking about making smaller aircraft itself, but has not objected loudly to Regioliner's ambitions because it is putting most of its effort into planning for a giant long-haul carrier for 600 to 1,000 people. Snecma, the main engine supplier to Dassault and Airbus, is also looking for a foreign partner. It is discussing possible collaboration on future military jet engines with Rolls-Royce of the UK. Currently, Snecma is the only European company to develop a fighter jet engine - the M88 for the Rafale - on its own. By contrast, Snecma decided long ago not to go it alone in civil engines, where it has for the past 23 years had a successful partnership with General Electric of the US. Their joint subsidiary, CFM International, had a 27 per cent share of the world market at the end of last year. France's largely state-controlled aerospace industry has just seen a reshuffle at the top, as part of the three-yearly review of mandates of public sector chairmen. Mr Henri Martre stepped down at the end of June after nine years as chairman of Aerospatiale, to be replaced by Mr Louis Gallois, who was head of Snecma, the jet engine maker, for the past three years. Mr Martre is due to reach the mandatory retirement age of 65 next year. Mr Gallois, 48, who has been an Aerospatiale board member for the past two years, was front runner for the job and is expected to continue his predecessor's strategy of seeking international partners. Mr Gallois' empty chair at Snecma has been filled by 51-year-old Mr Gerard Renon, a former junior defence minister from 1989 to 1991 and technical adviser to President Mitterrand for the two years after Mitterrand came to power in 1981.</p>

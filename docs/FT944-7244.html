			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Tory MPs advise on trade with Iraq Two Conservative MPs, including the parliamentary assistant to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, have been advising a commercial lobby group which wants to increase trade between Iraq and the UK. The two are Mr Henry Bellingham, parliamentary private secretary to Mr Rifkind, and Mr Michael Colvin, chairman of the Conservative foreign affairs committee. They have been advising the Iraqi British Interests (IBI) Group - a lobby association which in August organised one of the first British trade delegations to Baghdad since the Gulf war. Sanctions were imposed on Iraq in August 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait. 'They have advised us on who to speak to in Whitehall if we want to seek advice on how to avoid breaking United Nations sanctions, how would we do so,' said Mr Edmund Sykes, secretary of the IBI. Mr Bellingham said: 'I have no regular contacts with the IBI.' Mr Colvin was unavailable for comment. Some 34 British and European companies will exhibit in Baghdad next week in an attempt to win contracts from the Iraqi government. Companies from Germany, France, Austria, Spain and Britain involved in the health and water treatment sectors will exhibit at two trade fairs in Baghdad organised from the UK by Orient Exhibitions, a Kent-based company. Mr Andrew Maclean, one of Orient's directors, said communication licences, issued by the Department of Trade and Industry, had been obtained by 17 UK concerns, enabling them to talk directly to the Iraqis. Mr Maclean said the companies attending the fair included Zeneca, the pharmaceutical group; Weir Pumps, the Glasgow-based engineering group; and Johnson &amp; Johnson, a leading supplier of medical products. 'Iraq has been a major market in the past and we are confident it will be in the future. We want to be in position when sanctions are lifted,' said Sir Ron Garrick, managing director and chief executive of the Weir Group. Mr Stephen Crouch, the IBI's director-general, travelled to Jordan in September, with Mr Bellingham, the MP for Norfolk North West. The MP had an informal meeting with a senior official from the Iraqi foreign ministry on September 3. Mr Bellingham said the visit 'was a private visit paid for by myself as a backbench MP'. He was not told that he would be meeting the Iraqi official at a social engagement. He informed officials from the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence of the meeting. 'They were grateful that I'd informed them,' he said. In a letter obtained by the Financial Times, Mr Crouch states that with Mr Bellingham he had meetings with a number of Jordanian government officials and that 'we also met with a delegation from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to listen to their point of view'.

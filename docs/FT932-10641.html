			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Volvo's short-term debt downgraded VOLVO, the Swedish motor vehicle group, suffered a further blow to its prestige yesterday when Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, cut the company's short-term debt rating from A-1 to A-2. The move had been signalled in March when the rating was placed under review for possible downgrade, following the publication of the group's 1992 result. This showed a SKr4.75bn (Dollars 650m) loss after financial items, compared with a SKr1.5bn profit in 1991, and an increased operating loss of SKr2.25bn. S&amp;P said it was downgrading the group because of Volvo's continuing poor operating performance and the weakening of its balance sheet after net debt rose last year to SKr13bn from SKr7bn. 'Given the generally difficult trading environment for the automotive industry, debt reduction is expected to be constrained over the near term,' it added. The rating agency also pointed to a number of positive factors, including the company's cost-cutting campaign, and the expected recovery in its two principal European markets, the UK and Sweden, in the next two to three years.</p>

"Military morale is at its lowest," is illustrated by the  fact that 71.5 percent of the respondents said their welfare was  dissatisfactory.    National Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae has also stressed the  enhancement of military morale on various occasions. The Army  can complete its missions only when high military morale is  added to strong combat capabilities and outstanding strategy and  equipment.    With the end of the cold war, the world is turning toward  peace, reconciliation, and cooperation. The "economic war,"  however, is becoming fierce. We cannot win the economic war  without a security posture based on strong combat capabilities.    The situation on the Korean peninsula, where the cold war  continues, demands more emphasis on security posture.  Therefore, it is time for our people to stand in front to  recognize the importance of security posture and pay more  attention to the enhancement of military morale.</p>

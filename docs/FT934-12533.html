			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Goodyear meets profit projections with Dollars 136m GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last of the big US-owned tyre companies, yesterday posted third-quarter profits at the top end of its projections. The Akron, Ohio-based company earned Dollars 136.2m, or 92 cents a share, in the 1993 third quarter, compared with net income Dollars 91.5m, or 64 cents, in the same period of last year. Earlier this month, Goodyear predicted earnings of Dollars 130m to Dollars 135m for the quarter. Sales in the three months slipped to Dollars 2.9bn from Dollars 3bn. The company attributed the decline to currency translations and weakness in world economies. In addition, 1992 sales included Dollars 92m from subsequently divested businesses. Goodyear said that its business unit operating margins of 10.5 per cent for the quarter continued to exceed its long-term objective of 10 per cent. The company has cut costs, reduced sales and administrative expenses and improved its manufacturing efficiency. Unit sales of tyres rose in the quarter, led by Goodyear's premium lines in the US and by light and medium truck tyre sales worldwide. Operating income from tyres rose 12.2 per cent to Dollars 261.2m in the quarter, although sales eased slightly to Dollars 2.5bn. The company's general products division had operating income of Dollars 47.3m, including one-time gains of Dollars 9.1m from the sale of its Reneer Films business. A year earlier, the business had operating income of Dollars 46.3m. Goodyear's oil transportation operations continued to post an operating loss in the quarter of Dollars 2.4m, compared with Dollars 2.6m a year earlier. Results for the first nine months were muddied by special items in both years. Including these, Goodyear posted net income of Dollars 360.9m, or Dollars 2.47, against a net loss of Dollars 746.1m, or Dollars 5.24 a year ago. Stripping out extraordinary items, last year's accounting changes and adjusting for a two-for-one stock split, Goodyear earned Dollars 375.5m, or Dollars 2.57, in the first nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 264.5m, or Dollars 1.86, in the same period of last year.</p>

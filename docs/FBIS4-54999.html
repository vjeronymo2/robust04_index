			<p>BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, 7 May (TANJUG) -- We will accept no  compromise on Brcko under any conditions and any pressures,  because the corridor in that area "is the main artery in the  blood system of the entire Serb nation," Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the republic of Srpska assembly, said in an  interview for tomorrow's issue of DNEVNIK of Novi Sad.    "An attack by Muslim-Croat armed forces on the corridor in  the Brcko area would be the end of all peace initiatives and war  would break out with all ferocity and with unforeseeable  consequences," Krajisnik said. He stressed that the conflict in  the Brcko area could be effectively prevented by reaching a  global peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and certainly not by  proclaiming Brcko a safe area.    "For days, efforts have been made to make the whole of the  world public believe the disgusting lies broadcast by West  European and U.S. media that Brcko is allegedly a Muslim town,  and that the Serb army is allegedly preparing an attack on  Brcko. All this is aimed at proclaiming Brcko a safe area so  that the Security Council can insist on the demilitarization of  Brcko under the threat of violence," Krajisnik stressed. "We  must warn the world public that Brcko is in Serbian hands  because it has a Serb, and not a slim, majority. That is why  the Serbian side will at no cost allow its units in the Brcko  area to be disarmed because, by doing this, they would allow the  noose prepared by Western strategists to be put around their  neck. This would cut the corridor for both Krajinas [in western  Bosnia and in Croatia], that is for the republic of Serb Krajina  and the republic of Srpska, or more precisely, its western part  -- the Banja Luka Krajina," the president of the republic of  Srpska assembly stressed.    Krajisnik recalled that a session of the republic of Srpska  assembly will be held in Brcko on 10 May, in order to "prove to  the whole world that Brcko is a Serbian town and that it will  remain Serb."</p>

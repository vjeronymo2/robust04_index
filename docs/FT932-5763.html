			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Ex-communists help De La Rue rise 34% PROVIDING bank notes and passports for 26 former communist countries helped De La Rue, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, offset the declining world demand for cheques. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 increased by 34 per cent from Pounds 77.9m to Pounds 104.7m, which was at the top end of City expectations. Sales rose by 35 per cent to Pounds 559.5m, against Pounds 415.4m, which included Pounds 15.1m from discontinued activities. The biggest jump in profits came from payment systems, which included a full year's contribution from Inter Innovation, the Swedish competitor it acquired for Pounds 94.7m at the end of 1991. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, said the overall market for cheques fell by 2 per cent last year, and was expected to continue to decline at similar or increasing rates as debit cards became established. However there was no sign of a drop in demand for banknotes in any market. De La Rue supplies the Royal Bank of Scotland and some building societies with debit cards incorporating laser-engraved users' photographs, which have sharply reduced fraud levels. Yesterday, the company also announced a joint sales venture in the UK and Irish Republic with Philips, the Dutch electronics group, to develop 'smart cards', which use embedded microchips to authorise transactions. Strong internal cash generation helped the group increase its net cash over the year from Pounds 111.5m to Pounds 170.9m at March 31. Mr Marshall said the group was ready to expand, but any acquisition would have to be in a related area and enhance earnings, which was not a common combination. Operating profits grew by 22 per cent to Pounds 79.4m, compared with Pounds 65m which included profits on discontinued activities of Pounds 1.4m. Payment systems accounted for 59 per cent of sales and 46 per cent of operating profits, compared with 48 per cent and 36 per cent previously. Lord Limerick, the chairman, said 'the group has entered the new year with strong order books in the major businesses and we look forward to continued earnings growth in the current year.' The proportion of the group's sales arising outside the UK and Ireland increased from 90 to 91 per cent. Sales in the rest of Europe increased from 44 to 48 per cent, including an increase in Germany from 26 to 28 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 24 per cent to 38.8p (31.2p). A 14 per cent increase in the recommended final dividend to 13.15p gives a total for the year of 17p against 15p, a 13 per cent advance. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by (APW): "New Offer of Designers from Gliwice; To </F> Help the Infantry"]    [Text] The prototype is supposed to be ready at the end of  this year. For the time being, it remains only an offer from  the Development and Research Center of Mechanical Devices  [OBRUM] in Gliwice. What is important, however, is that it will  not be simply art for art's sake. At the third conference  devoted to the problems of armament, held in Rydzyna, Wojciech  Zajler, one of the designers of the new Polish infantry vehicle,  pointed out that the vehicle is being prepared in close  cooperation with "a military decision- maker."    At the request of the Army, the new combat armored vehicle  [BWP] is supposed to resemble the T-72 tank. Even though the  Gliwice designers believe that it will not be an "optimum  structure" as a result, they take the Army's opinion into  account. This compromise has very real economic dimensions,  both in the present difficult financial situation and in the  immediate future, which will probably be equally difficult. The  same spare parts as in the tank as well as similar crew training  will certainly have tremendous influence on the price of the  entire undertaking.    It is clear that the Army would like to have something new,  something that would be in line with the present development  trends; however, they would like to achieve that for the lowest  possible price. The offer of OBRUM may make that possible.    However, there is one snag in the entire affair. As a matter  of fact, the Army would like to have a BWP with an armour  thickness of between 10 and 60 millimeters; in addition, the  military would like it to be amphibious as well. This is not  possible, said the designers in Gliwice and therefore, their new  proposal consists of... two offers.  <H5>  BWP-94 </H5>   This is the one that should meet the requirement of strong  armor and strong power in general. The engine and the  transmission are identical to those in the T-72 tank; however,  the mechanisms were moved to the front. Two gearboxes (the same  that are found in the tank) were located on both sides and  linked coaxially to the drive wheels of the track system.  Between the engine and the gearbox there is supposed to be  generator starter, also of the T-72 tank type. The designers  changed the indirect transmission crankcase, due to the  necessity of adjusting it to front-wheel drive.    On the left side behind the engine there is room for the  driver. On the right side are the radiators and the fans. The  exhaust system is connected into the outlet radiator air channel.    On the central part of the frame is mounted a turret with  the  main armament. In the rear there is room for eight soldiers,  sitting back-to-back in two rows. In front of each soldier, in  the side panels, is a narrow firing slot. On the rear there is  a loading platform. It opens hydraulically and contains two  smaller hatches for soldiers.    The drive mechanism consists of six geared wheels, fixed on  cranks. All this, including the tracks, are just as on the  tank. The vehicle's suspension consists of coiled torsion bars.    The armament of the BWP-94 is supposed to be made up of a  35-  millimeter gun ("Oerlikona") located in a two-man tower. Placed  coaxially to it is a 7.62-millimeter gun and 12.7-millimeter NSW  plot above the tower. The design also provides for PPK  launchers above the tower.    The combat weight of this 11-person vehicle is supposed to  be  approximately 30 tons. It is anticipated that its range will be  500 kilometers and with a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per  hour.    It will be 6.7 meters long and 2.3 meters high. The width  between the tracks is supposed to be 3.37 meters, and ground  clearance -- 0.45 meter.    It is planned that it will be equipped with a fire-fighting  and anti-explosion Deugra system. Communications is supposed to  be maintained by means of: an R-173 radio transmitter, an R-173  radio receiver, and an R-124 radio telephone.  <H5>  BWP Amphibian </H5>   Due to the requirement of floatability, the parameters of  this offer of OBRUM are entirely different. The combat weight  of the vehicle is "only" 17.3 tons; the thickness of the armor  -- from 6 to 10 millimeters. It has room for nine soldiers.    In order to achieve the location of the center of weight on  the axis of the center of the uplift pressure, the designers had  to place the greatest burdens symmetrically, along the  lengthwise axis of the frame. The drive of the vehicle, which  is a 800-horsepower MTU V 6 engine, is at the front, behind the  driver. In the central part there is an armament turret; in the  rear part -- there is room for six soldiers.    The front was designed to enable smooth ride on the water  and  to achieve a positive dynamic uplift pressure. Above this board  there is a suspendible breakwater. The drive mechanism consists  of six special drive wheels of 6 centimeters in diameter.    Above the landing-troops part two tight hatches were  designed. The rear, more specifically, the loading platform  which is lifted hydraulically, has two hatches as well.    The armament of this vehicle is supposed to be the same as  the armament in the other vehicle.  <H5>  Will the Army Buy It? </H5>   It is too early for the final answer. It cannot be said  today whether the Army will be interested in one or both offers.  However, it is good that there is something going on in our  arms industry. At any rate, it seems that the above-described  constructions of OBRUM may be some supplement to the cooperative  offer (with the Swedish Bofors) of the factory in Stalowa Wola.</p>

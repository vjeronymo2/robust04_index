High-performance polymers constitute a  very promising class of materials and have already entered areas  of application heretofore assigned to metals, glass, or ceramic  only. They will become increasingly important in the future,  despite a few problems relating to economics.    "High-temperature thermoplastics can today already withstand  temperatures about 350C for short durations, temperatures  above 250C continuously causing no problem any more." Dr.  Eckard Koch predicts above average growth rates for these  materials in the coming years. The plastics expert in the  Application Engineering Department for Thermoplastics at the  BASF (Baden Aniline and Soda Works) in Ludwigshafen believes  that these materials will play a more significant role  especially in the electrical and electronic industry, where now  the principal demand for them exists.    One of the reasons for the further increasing demand is that  "exactly in this industry the fire resistance requirements are  becoming more stringent" says Doctor Koch. "Because of new  specifications regarding precautions and commercial use, fire  proofing by conventional means will in the future be done to a  limited extent only."    The automotive industry, too, promises a growing demand for  these materials. According to Doctor Koch, work is now being  done on parts located near the engine block. Here pressure-cast  aluminum is eventually to be replaced with high-performance  thermoplastics.    Also Grad. Eng. Gerhard Kloetgen also recognizes the  greatest  economic potential for highly heat-resistant polymers in the  automotive industry as well as in the electrical and electronic  sector. The sales manager for engineering materials at the  DuPont Nemours Deutschland (Germany) Ltd in Bad Homburg sees  future applications generally where the requirements exceed the  capability limits of conventional materials. He finds it almost  impossible, however, to quantify their innovation potential in  terms of worth. This is especially so because of a specific  problem peculiar to all high-performance polymers: They do in  many cases fail the economics test. "The development costs are  very high, owing to the small ratio of quantities eventually  sold to the potential production yield" says Kloetgen. The  prevailing enormous downward pressure on prices makes it,  moreover, very difficult to cover these costs with the proceeds  from sales a product stored in the warehouse.    This was a sufficient reason for the Bayer Corporation to  discontinue producting of several high-performance polymers such  as liquid-crystal polymers (LCP), polyphenylene sulfides (PPS),  and composite materials. Meanwhile the Leverkusen people are  concentrating more on engineering thermoplastics.    Polyether ketones (PEK) are the best among heat-resistant  thermoplastics. They can withstand temperatures above 250C  and remain rigid under heat. Their excellent mechanical  properties are reflected in their Young's modulus: 4000  N/mm[.sup]2[/] without reinforcement, still 3000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] even  at 150C. When reinforced with carbon  fibers,  their Young's modulus rises to 20,000 N/mm[.sup]2[/] and  higher.    Its high flexural fatigue strength even at elevated  temperatures makes the "Ultrapek" polyether ketone an ideal  material for gears when light weight as well as sufficient  overload capacity and adequate chemical resistance are demanded  all at the same time.    Polyether imides (PEI), according to Peter Stahl, feature an  outstanding combination of thermal stability, flame repellence,  electrical properties, and high mechanical durability. The  technical director at the Plastics subsidiary of the German  General Electric Company in Ruesselsheim includes them among the  few thermoplastics approved for the interior furnishing of  aircraft, because of their high oxygen index along with the thin  smoke and the low toxity in case of fire among other favorable  properties.    "The great application potential of polyether imides should  also lead to an economic winner" adds Peter Stahl. Their growth  proceeds at double-digit rates, even though at this time there  is an oversupply of high-temperature thermoplastics on the  European market. The development potential of polyether imides  has, however, by far not yet been realized.    One of the most important goals for Peter Stahl is improving  processability. The range of applications can thus be broadened  by new kinds of blends, i.e., mixtures of plastics. Research is  being done not only on blends but also on copolymers which  promise entirely new properties and applications.  Semicrystalline polyphenylene sulfides have a properties profile  very similar to that of polyether ketones. They not only can  withstand high service temperatures and are inherently very  flame-repellent but also have a high chemical and oxidation  resistance along with adequate hardness and stiffness.    Also liquid-crystal polymers can withstand service at  temperatures significantly above 200C. They surpass steel  in tensile strength and yet are much lighter. They have a high  chemical resistance, also against polar and nonpolar solvents or  acids. Peter Gleisberg, product manager at "Vectra" (trade name  of liquid-crystal polymers made by Hoechst), is convinced that  these engineering materials still have a great development  potential. "They will find their market wherever an extremely  high fluidity, narrow tolerances, and stability during soldering  are demanded."    In order to impart high mechanical strength to a part made  of  a crystalline polymer and to optimize the layout of its  structural unit for minimum weight, it would be necessary to  orient the molecular chains in the entire part with their  principal axis in the direction of the acting load. This should  make such a layout much more difficult to achieve, as experience  at the Institute of Plastics Engineering in Aachen has  confirmed. Without the aid of simulation programs, for one, it  is hardly possible to predict the orientations of molecular  chains in individual layers and the thicknesses of those layers  in the the finished part. Furthermore, most engineers who design  injection molding equipment are not used to take into account  the anisotropic behavior of a material inside the mold.</p>

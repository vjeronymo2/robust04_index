			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> VIET REFUGEES FLEE CHOLERA  </P> <P> Hong Kong's government removed 2,500 Vietnamese "boat people" from the outlying  island of Tai A Chau after an outbreak of cholera and moved them to a nearby  island that once served as a leper colony, officials reported. Another 2,000  Vietnamese living in tents on Tai A Chau will be evacuated to Heiling Chau  island today, the officials said. Last month, a dispute over distribution of  rice touched off a riot on Tai A Chau. Shortly afterward, the first case of  cholera was detected, and the disease has so far stricken 21 Vietnamese,  officials said. They said Tai A Chau will be used as a detention center again,  once it has been cleaned up and huts are built there.  </P></p>

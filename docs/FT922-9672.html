			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fisons suffers setback over drug relaunch Fisons, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday received a setback in its efforts to have Opticrom, an allergic eye treatment, relicensed in the US. The company said inspectors from the US Food and Drug Administration had completed their visit of its Holmes Chapel plant in Cheshire, but had made several observations. Mr Peter Woods, director of corporate affairs, refused to give details of the observations, adding that he did not want to jeopardise future discussions with the FDA. He said Fisons is responding to them and will continue a dialogue with the FDA. He insisted the FDA had not yet made a decision about whether to relicense the drug or not. The FDA inspectors will not return to the US for another two weeks after which they will make their report, according to Mr Woods. Opticrom was withdrawn last year, after the FDA complained about the quality of manufacture at Holmes Chapel. The company must have permission to relaunch the product soon, if it is not to miss the rag-weed season in the US which starts in September. So far the withdrawal of Opticrom and another drug, Imferon, has cost the company Pounds 65m. Glaxo, the international pharmaceutical company, has won UK approval to market its Zofran drug for a new indication, the prevention and treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting. At present it is used to control nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy. A licence to market Zofran, the first approval for the indication, helped the company's share price rise in both London and New York.</p>

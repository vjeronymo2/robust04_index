This was disclosed by  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana at the end of yet another  meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC]. He  said the government's decision is designed to speed up the peace  process and enable soldiers to leave assembly areas.    The simultaneous demobilization of troops of both sides  should have started on 22 February, but Renamo was late in  submitting the list of its troops. Raul Domingos, head of  Renamo's delegation to the CSC, said the government's decision  to unilaterally begin confining [as heard] its troops was  worrisome. Raul Domingos said the two sides should operate  within the parameters of the General Peace Accord so as to  prevent mistrust. He said the delay in demobilizing Renamo  troops was due to technical problems.</p>

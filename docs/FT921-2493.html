			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Elkem president resigns after reshuffle MR FREDRIK Vogt Lorentzen, president of Elkem, the loss-making Norwegian metals producer, has resigned after four years in the job. Mr Vogt Lorentzen's departure comes less than two months after a board reshuffle which involved Orkla and Saga Petroleum - Elkem's two biggest shareholders - tightening their grip on the company. Last month, Elkem announced a 1991 pre-tax loss of NKr528m (Dollars 160.38m), compared with a loss of NKr659m in 1990. The company also passed its dividend. 'Two years with extremely difficult market conditions have contributed to the fact that I have not reached my stated goal of achieving a profit at the bottom of the business cycle,' Mr Lorentzen said yesterday. 'At the same time, the effort to reach this goal has significantly drained my own strength,' he added. At the time of the January board changes, Mr Finn Jebsen, Elkem's plain-speaking chairman, said closer co-operation among the board, the owners and the corporate management would be needed to improve the company's operations and future results. Elkem said Mr Ole Enger, currently vice-president, would become acting president.</p>

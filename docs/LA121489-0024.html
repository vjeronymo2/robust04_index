			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUR COATS  </P> <P> Everyone has a right to wear a fur coat. However, before purchasing that fur,  everyone has an obligation to be fully informed of how a fur coat is made. I  can assure you that after viewing, personally or by videotape (with sound  intact), how one captures, raises and skins an animal, one would think twice  about wearing a fur coat. After all, we are suppose to be intelligent beings.  </P> <P> Let's keep the fur where it belongs-on the animals.  </P> <P> KADY LANE  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

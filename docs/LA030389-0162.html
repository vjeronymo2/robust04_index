			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY TACKLES ROSSINI, MOZART, SHOSTAKOVICH AND BOCCHERINI  </P> <P> The Pacific Symphony gave its patrons a healthy dose of the music-making basics  -- an acceptable stylistic approach, correct balance and all the right notes --  plus that intangible X-factor -- artistic charisma, or call it what you will --  on Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Guest conductor Vakhtang Jordania opened the program at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa with a robust reading of Rossini's  Overture to "La Gazza Ladra." The Segerstrom Hall acoustics revealed bracing  tuttis and charming wind solos, but ragged ensemble mitigated against this  being anything more than a warm-up.  </P> <P> Enter Viktoria Mullova, to essay Mozart's Violin Concerto in A, K. 219. She  possesses a fluent technique, with telling command of articulation. The tone is  sweet and the intonation impeccable.  </P> <P> Yet when it was over, one was left with the feeling that this was not Mozart --  just the notes Mozart wrote. Everything was in its proper place, including the  standard 19th-Century cadenzas, but the interpretation was soulless.  </P> <P> Using appropriately reduced forces, Jordania accompanied neatly. Only the  famous Turkish section of the rondo added spice.  </P> <P> Given his background (defecting from the Soviet Union to the United States in  1983), it came as no surprise that Jordania has an affinity for Shostakovich,  in this case the Symphony No. 5. However, it was not simply a matter of an  artist feeling at home with a compatriot's work.  </P> <P> The polished ensemble playing, the bite and soar of the strings and the overall  intensity of the group attested to the fact that Jordania had communicated his  convictions to the players -- and thus to the audience.  </P> <P> Conducting imperiously, he even managed the near-impossible: persuading the  listeners that the finale is not cheap, special-effects bombast, but a logical  resolution of the work.  </P> <P> Lacking only more finely honed brasses (though the horns on several occasions  produced sonic thrills), the ensemble sounded like a new orchestra.  </P> <P> An arrangement for the full strings of Boccherini's Minuet from the Quintet,  Opus 13, No. 5, proved a stylish encore.  </P></p>

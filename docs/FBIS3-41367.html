The government has prepared a  detailed list of individuals delinquent in repaying loans  showing that they owe a total of 62 billion rupees. Reportedly,  up to now 700 million rupees have been repaid to banks and other  financial institutions. According to press reports, the  candidacy papers of 63 individuals who wanted to run for  National Assembly seats from various parts of the country have  been rejected because these individuals did not repay their  loans and their names appeared in the list of delinquents. These  individuals will not be able to participate in the elections.  Twenty-six of these individuals whose candidacy papers have been  rejected because of delinquency are residents of Punjab;  eighteen are from Sindh; six from the Frontier Province and  twelve belong to federally administered tribal areas or "FATA"  [Federally Administered Tribal Areas]; the candidacy papers of  ten individuals were accepted on the condition that the  individuals would repay their loans to the bank or financial  institution within the legally designated time.    The people in general have expressed their approval of the  actions taken to end the curse of drug addiction. These measures  were approved in a meeting of the federal cabinet and included  certain legal amendments which will allow the immediate arrest  of individuals involved in drug dealing and smuggling and the  confiscation of tbeir goods and property. Such individuals could  also be sentenced to death. At the same time, laws enforced in  other parts of the country would apply to federally administered  tribal areas as well. The jurisdiction of the special court  which hears drug smuggling cases has been extended to the FATA  areas. In order to end the curse of drugs, the civilian control  of the special task force has been given to the Army thus making  the military responsible for dealing with the drug mafia. The  government of the Frontier Province has declared a dozen  individuals who were suspected of connections with the drug  mafia unqualified to participate in the elections. Three of  these twelve individuals are former members of the national  assembly.    Everyone is aware of the ignominy suffered by the nation and  the country as a result of the black drug trade. Drug addicts in  Pakistan are the living dead whose families face great hardship;  these pitiful families are a common sight on every street and  alley. The black wealth of drug dealers and smugglers has  promoted various forms of evil in the society and overwhelmed  the respectable members of society so that now the entire  society is a hostage to "money". No one cares whether the money  has been acquired by putting in jeopardy someone else's honor or  life. The merchants of evil and death are now the nouveau riche  who, in order to ply their illicit trade, do not hesitate to  destroy human values and the dignity of the country and the  nation. Some of the drug dealers have acquired greater influence  and power by marrying into prominent families, whereas others  have tried to gain power by winning elections as the candidates  of political parties. This time as well, merchants of evil were  expected to use their black wealth to run in the elections;  however, the measures taken by the caretaker government may  prevent them from doing so. The actions of the caretaker prime  minister and the caretaker government deserve commendation.    Ten or 15 years ago, there were no drug addicts in Pakistan  nor were there any drug producers. Today, there are 2.5 or 3  million drug addicts in Pakistan. According to a CIA report,  over the last 15 years, Pakistan has changed from a corridor or  way station for the drug trade into a large scale producer of  narcotics. Obviously, when narcotics are prepared on a large  scale, its use will increase as well; thus, the number of drug  addicts has increased over this period. According to the  statistics available, illegal drug trade brings an annual profit  of $120 billion. This huge sum has strengthened to an  overwhelming degree the power of evil. The great wealth which  narcotics dealers have acquired now gives them the power to  attempt everything possible to ensure the continuation of their  business.    On the face of it, the cultivation and preparation of opium  is forbidden in Pakistan, but in reality, the opium poppy is  planted on 8170 hectares and about 100 modern factories in  remote tribal areas produce heroin from opium. Opium grown in  Pakistan as well as opium from Afghanistan is brought to these  factories and a total of 70 metric tons of pure heroin is  produced annually. Two thirds of the total heroin produced is  used in Pakistan so that now there are 2.5 to 3 million addicts  in this country.    Opium, hashish and heroin are produced in the remote areas  of  the Frontier Province and distributed throughout the country.  When the drug Mafia is unable to send a shipment of heroin to  the Middle East, Iran, Turkey, Europe or the U.S., it sells the  entire quantity locally in Pakistan and thus keeps the domestic  addicts supplied with heroin. Actually, one could say that the  heroin and narcotics prepared in Pakistan pose a greater danger  to this country than to Europe or the U. S.    Up to 1979, very few people in Pakistan were aware of heroin  addiction, but, gradually, the addiction spread. Whenever  addicts were caught, they generally told the same story to the  effect that an individual gave them free heroin to smoke and  when they became addicted to the narcotic, he began to charge  them for the heroin. Such statements and stories appeared in  many newspapers.    Organizations and departments formed to control drugs have  failed to do so generally because they have seized drugs now and  then for the sake of appearance and in order to have the  photographs of such seizures appear in the press. The fact is  that to be able to control narcotics, it is necessary to stop  the cultivation of opium and the production of heroin and to  arrest and punish the prominent drug dealers who control the  business but these measures have not been taken. Past  governments acting under emotional or foreign pressure prepared  impressive plans to end the curse of drugs and made tall claims  but did nothing. Departments in charge of drug control do exist  but their performance is zero and one reason is the black wealth  of drug dealers which is spent relentlessly in order to allow  the black drug trade to continue. Departments in charge of  controlling drugs should be made effective and active and, at  the same time, measures should be taken to make chemicals and  other paraphernalia used in heroin production unavailable in  Pakistan at any price. These chemicals are imported from  outside. More effective measures than those taken in the past  are required to stop the cultivation of the opium poppy in the  Frontier Province. Cultivators should be encouraged to plant  other crops instead of opium and the government should make up  the resulting financial loss to the cultivators. The objective  should be to make better use of the aid Pakistan receives from  Europe and the U. S. in this connection and to phase out the  cultivation of the opium poppy gradually. The hundred or more  heroin producing factories should be destroyed otherwise it will  not be possible to eradicate drug addiction.</p>

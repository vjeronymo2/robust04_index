			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Letter: Impractical poaching Sir, Your report, 'Employers face transfer fee for poached staff', (February 10) raises interesting questions in an EC context. The practicality (which is highly questionable) of such a fee aside, it seems likely that the ability to inhibit employees from changing jobs would prima facie contravene articles 43 and 49 of the Treaty of Rome requiring the removal of obstacles to the free movement of workers. Indeed, this has already been debated in the European Parliament, Commission and Court of Justice with regard to an Italian footballer. Attempts to resolve the 'poaching' problem are welcome, but the price of introducing new rigidities into the labour market is too high.

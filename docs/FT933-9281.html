			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / GA back in the black at Pounds 126m GENERAL ACCIDENT, the Perth-based insurer, demonstrated the strength of recovery in the general insurance sector when it unveiled its first pre-tax profit since 1989. The pre-tax figure of Pounds 126.2m for the first six months of the year represented a turnround from a Pounds 15.4m loss. Though the result was ahead of expectations, the market was disappointed at the company's decision to leave its interim dividend unchanged at 9.7p. Earnings per share were 21.5p, against a loss of 3.4p last time. The share price slipped 9p to 683p. Mr Nelson Robertson, chief executive, applauded 'the achievement of an underwriting profit in the UK' and expected the improvement to continue for the rest of the year. The company said the improvement reflected increases in premiums, more selective underwriting, reductions in costs and a fall in claims, especially those such as subsidence that are related to bad weather. Premium rates for home and motor insurance have risen by an average of 40 per cent in the past two years. Underwriting profits in the UK reached Pounds 3.5m for the half year compared with a deficit of Pounds 104.8m. The improvement was achieved in spite of losses of Pounds 13m from the Perth floods in January and a payout (net of reinsurance) of Pounds 10m following the Bishopsgate bomb in London in April. The turnround helped trim overall underwriting losses to Pounds 129m compared with a loss of Pounds 235.2m in 1992. Net investment income (investment income less interest on loans) rose 9 per cent from Pounds 215.1m to Pounds 238.8m. Losses from the group's estate agency operations fell from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 4.5m. Profits from life operations amounted to Pounds 20.9m, compared with Pounds 14.6m. General business premium income rose from Pounds 1.9bn to Pounds 2.12bn, with life premiums up to Pounds 413.7m (Pounds 357m) making for a total of Pounds 2.52bn (Pounds 2.26bn). The value of shareholders' funds was strengthened as a result of recent buoyancy in the equity and bond markets. Shareholders' funds amounted to Pounds 1.99bn at June 30, compared with Pounds 1.63bn at the end of last year, with a further rise to Pounds 2.02bn by 6 August 6. Net asset value per share reached 394p on August 6 compared with 331p on January 1, giving a solvency margin of 48.8 per cent, up from 41.5 per cent. Lex, Page 14</p>

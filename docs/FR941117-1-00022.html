			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Requirements for Participation for Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We propose to establish standards in subpart F of part 483 for all facilities and units that wish to participate in Medicaid as providers of the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed requirements relating to active treatment and the inpatient plan of treatment would apply to psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units in general hospitals that provide the psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 benefit, as well as to PRTFs. In &sect;483.202, Active treatment program, we propose to require that the facility provide treatment designed to enable the individual to achieve sufficient stability to progress to outpatient care, and to attain the objectives specified in the inpatient plan of treatment that would be required in &sect;483.202(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 483.202(b), Inpatient plan of treatment, would require that an interdisciplinary team, which includes a facility staff physician and at least one other professional staff person, develop the inpatient plan of treatment which specifies the interventions to be provided for the individual. We would require that the inpatient treatment plan include specific measurable treatment objectives and timeframes for meeting these objectives. In addition, we would require that inpatient mental health services be coordinated with any other services being provided under the individual's comprehensive services plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interval for review of inpatient care by the review team in acute care psychiatric <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 providers would be set at 7 days after admission and every 7 days thereafter. In a PRTF, reviews would be required every 7 days in the initial month of stay; after the first month, reviews would be required at monthly intervals. We do not believe that longer periods should elapse before the treatment modalities being used are assessed for their effectiveness. Any necessary changes should be made as soon as possible in order to make certain that discharge occurs at the earliest possible time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. PRTF Conditions of Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing the proposed requirements for PRTFs, we have tried to allow flexibility for providers whenever possible, and to avoid requiring specific documentation of administrative procedures. We recognize that policies and procedures relating to such matters as personnel and admissions are generally necessary but we believe that facilities that can meet the requirements specified in this proposed rule can develop these administrative procedures without additional Federal requirements. We have made an effort to minimize the imposition of any paperwork burdens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

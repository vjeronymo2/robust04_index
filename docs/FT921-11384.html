			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Yeltsin finds some friends in the London fog MR BORIS YELTSIN must have been pleasantly surprised to meet a crowd that wasn't demonstrating about the cost of sausage. Previously given low-key welcomes by western countries unsure of the etiquette while Mr Gorbachev was still Soviet president, Mr Yeltsin is now afforded full 'world leader' treatment and is discovering the Gorbachev syndrome of being baited at home but feted abroad. Hailed last year as the saviour of Russia, Boris Nikolaevich is now the target of constant criticism about his economic programme. In London yesterday, the questions were different, but his answers were characteristically blunt. Was Russia receiving enough aid, 'Tsar' Boris was asked by reporters as he perched atop the steps outside the Russian embassy, evoking memories of his defiant leap on to a tank during the Moscow coup. 'No, of course not,' he snapped back brusquely. 'There has been a lot of talk about this. But we need deeds, not words.' After a quick shopping list of Russian needs - food, credit lines to build storage and production facilities, and new technology - he was off without another word in a Zil limousine. Mr Yeltsin might be forgiven for not being in the best of moods. His intensive, seven-hour visit had consisted entirely of meetings with British politicians. Even as the former party boss from Sverdlovsk in the Urals touched down at Heathrow, a beaming Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was on the tarmac to greet him. Within an hour he was shaking hands with Mr John Major on the red carpet outside 10 Downing Street before being taken inside to meet such luminaries as Mr Tom King, defence secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr John Selwyn Gummer, agriculture secretary. In the afternoon he had a 15-minute tete-a-tete with the Labour leader Mr Neil Kinnock, and more than half an hour with Mrs Margaret Thatcher, a fellow sufferer from the Gorbachev syndrome. Naya Iosifovna, Mr Yeltsin's 60-year-old wife, was spared the politicians and treated instead to a tour of London by Norma Major. She was, however, under even more scrutiny than her husband, tailed by reporters anxious to see how she matched up to the elegant Raisa Gorbachev. 'Rather smart, I thought,' remarked one Downing Street aide, with a touch of surprise. Mr Yeltsin's visit also provided a shindig for the Russian press, though some were disappointed. 'It's a bit small,' said one reporter, clearly unimpressed by 10 Downing Street, and by Mr Major's inability to fix himself up with something better. British politics, too, seemed to cause some consternation. Was Mr King a Konservator or a Laborist, asked one Russian reporter, running through the list of politicians Mr Yeltsin was to meet. Laborist was his colleagues' consensus. At least it was foggy, they reassured themselves. Popular myth in Russia has it that London is still the victim of constant pea-soupers. Perhaps not all the propaganda was wrong.</p>

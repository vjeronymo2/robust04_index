			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Arts: An Affair with Numbers - Barbican Hall and Radio 3 At the weekend, the BBC mounted an almost compendious survey of Alban Berg's music in four concerts. 'Almost compendious', because his operas Wozzeck and Lulu were represented here only by the concert-suites Berg drew from them; but nothing else of significance was omitted. Writing at half-time in this mini-festival, I can say already that it is a signal success: excellently planned and beautifully performed, with the great bonus (for the audience in the hall) of George Perle's searching programme-notes. Among major composers of any period, there is scarcely another whose oeuvre adds up to so few hours and minutes ' except, of course, Anton von Webern, Berg's own colleague and fellow Schoenberg-disciple. Webern, however, took early to 'miniature' forms, or more exactly to composing atonal pieces of extreme, stripped-down concision. Berg wasn't a natural miniaturist at all; as we heard on Friday and Saturday, his experiments with very brief pieces went no further than those for clarinet and piano, op. 5, and his op. 4 songs (with a disproportionately huge orchestra) on tiny poems by Peter Altenberg. When Webern came to embrace Schoenberg's method of composing with 'twelve-note rows', his music expanded just a little: movements a few minutes long, instead of a few seconds. Meanwhile Berg was developing his own idiom in works on a much more substantial scale, in which gingerly Schoenbergian experiments figured only here and there. Except for a single song from 1925, only his very last works ' he died in 1935, in his fifty-first year ' are committedly 'twelve-note' music, and then in a style that constantly infringes the austere ground-rules of the Schoenberg method. What really happened, as the first two BBC concerts let us hear quite clearly, was that Berg developed his own musical language ' highly chromatic, highly calculated, potent and poignant ' without forcing it into Schoenberg's mould. He espoused a version of 'twelve-note' composing, quite individual, only when it could accommodate his own expressive idiom without cramping it. There is no sharp break between the hyper-sensitive, post-Romantic songs of his earliest, pre-Schoenberg years (which Arleen Auger and Alan Opie sang on Friday with acute sympathy) and the intricate density of his mature works, but merely a steady acquisition of technique and a unique composer's voice. After Friday's little banquet of early songs, the clarinet pieces (in which Antony Pay and Ian Brown were impeccably subtle) and Berg's reduced version of the Adagio from his later Chamber Concerto, Saturday's BBC Symphony concert was a sumptuous affair. Each work bore the marks of superb preparation by the conductor Andrew Davis. We had the 1912 Altenberg songs ravishingly sung by Yvonne Kenny, their monster orchestra handled with the utmost delicacy; and the orchestral Three Pieces op. 6, the Wozzeck Suite and the great Violin Concerto, Berg's last completed work. All the performances were rich in insights, and they were precisely exquisite ' almost to a fault. Davis dwelt lovingly over the concerto, in perfect tune with Ulf Hoelscher's chaste, tender account of the solo role, at some cost to the dramatic muscle of the score; but for once, at least, the result was so lovely to hear that one barely missed a tougher thrust. If the climactic 'catastrophe' in the third movement was under-powered, the final Adagio was still extraordinarily moving, and rendered transparent far beyond any run-of-the-mill treatment. In the Wozzeck movements, the innate gentility of Miss Kenny's soprano did not make her a natural Marie (the ruined heroine of Buchner's text), but she captured the felt anguish marvellously, and Davis brought off the famous summing-up 'interlude' with searing conviction. The Three Pieces ended the concert with all the right baleful force, still with refined control and sharp understanding.</p>

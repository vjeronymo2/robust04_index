			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Bosch-Siemens buys Gaggenau of Germany Bosch-Siemens Hausgerate, Europe's second biggest producer of white goods, is strengthening its position in upmarket domestic appliances with the purchase of Gaggenau, the long-established German manufacturer. Terms were not disclosed, but Gaggenau has about 900 employees and annual sales of DM215m (Dollars 138.6m). A restructuring programme already under way at Gaggenau will continue, said Bosch-Siemens, which will maintain the Gaggenau brand. The deal continues the trend of consolidation in the European domestic appliances sector. It comes a few days after Munich-based Bosch-Siemens said it would link with China's Wuxi Little Swan to build a washing machine factory in China. The Dollars 30m venture, in which Bosch will have a majority stake, will produce European-designed washing machines for the Chinese market.</p>

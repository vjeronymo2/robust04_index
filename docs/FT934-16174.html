			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Finland gains favourable pricing for Pounds 500m offering FINLAND achieved its best pricing for five years yesterday when it raised Pounds 500m through an offering of seven-year Eurobonds. The all-in cost of the funds, which were kept in sterling, was thought to be 16 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Syndicate managers said that the radical improvement in the spread which Finland paid over UK government bonds provided more proof that international investors no longer harboured doubts about the sovereign borrower. Finland's bonds were priced to yield 37 basis points over the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2000, well below the spread of 60 basis points that Finland had to pay in March for a deal of the same size but with a 10-year maturity. That offering was launched only days after Standard &amp; Poor's cut Finland's credit rating by two notches to AA minus and at a time when Finland was borrowing heavily in the international bond market. Finland has been a less frequent borrower since the first quarter of this year, opting instead to increase its issuance in its domestic bond market. An improvement in Finland's current account position has also kept its net borrowing requirement down. Investors were also keen to buy the offering which they believed would be Finland's last big issue this year. A senior finance ministry official said yesterday that Finland was close to reaching its foreign borrowing target of around Dollars 8bn. The bonds rose to 99.70 in the late afternoon, up from its re-offer price of 99.65, and the spread tightened accordingly. Around 25 per cent of the bonds were placed in Asia and the rest in Europe. Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, is expected to launch a Eurosterling issue of around Pounds 500m in the near future, via Salomon Brothers and UBS. Turkey is also likely to tap the Eurosterling sector with a 10-year offering, via SG Warburg. The World Bank gave details of its first D-Mark global bond offering, which will be lead managed by Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers. Mrs Jessica Einhorn, the World Bank's treasurer, said at a presentation in Frankfurt that the fixed-rate issue was likely to raise about DM3bn and have a maturity of five to 10 years. The World Bank expects to achieve a spread within 10 basis points above the yield on underlying German government bonds. The D-Mark sector was active yesterday as the European Investment Bank raised DM500m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced at nine basis points over the yield on the Bobl series 107 of medium-term German government bonds. The issue was seen to be tightly priced and the bonds traded at 100.20 in the late afternoon, just outside fees. Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, got a better reception for its DM250m offering of 10-year Eurobonds which were priced at a spread of 22 basis points over underlying German government bonds. The bonds rose to 99.50 bid from a re-offer price of 99.375. The pricing of GECC's FFr1.5bn five-year offering was viewed as aggressive which caused the bonds to fall to 98.75 bid from a re-offer price of 98.898 and the spread widened by two basis points to 22 basis points.</p>

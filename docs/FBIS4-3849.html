			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 23 (XINHUA) -- A cease-fire  agreement has been reached today between the U.N. secretary-  general's special representative for the former Yugoslavia and  Bosnian Serb civilian and military authorities.    According to the agreement, which is available here, both  sides have agreed on "an immediate and total cease-fire in and  around Gorazde from 1200 hours" on Saturday [23 April] and  immediate start of negotiations on all military matters.    They also agreed on, as a first step, urgent deployment of a  U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor) battalion in an area of three  kilometers from the center of Gorazde on both sides of the Drina  River, from which Bosnian Serb Forces will be redeployed by  midnight on Saturday, to closely monitor, supervise and report  on the observance of the cease-fire by both parties.    Not later than midnight on April 26, heavy weapons will be  withdrawn out of a 20 kilometer radius of the center of Gorazde  and out of range so as not to constitute a threat to the safe  area, the agreement said.    The two sides also agreed on the guarantee of secure  conditions for immediate medical evacuation from Gorazde and  complete freedom of movement for all personnel of Unprofor and  humanitarian organizations.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: China turning to US for financing China is likely to turn increasingly to the US bond market for external financing of its ambitious infrastructure programme, according to an International Monetary Fund survey. The IMF, in its report* on trends in international capital markets, reports that China will 'place more emphasis on bond financing relative to bank financing in view of the lower interest rates on bonds and the availability of longer maturities'. This view is consistent with recent statements by a senior Ministry of Finance official, who said China planned to borrow some Dollars 10bn in the next five years in international capital markets. The IMF report says the Chinese authorities have targeted the US, which they view as the 'deepest market' and the one most likely to produce the longest maturities. This has been borne out, the report said, by the 'recent elongation' of maturities in the dollar market to seven years in November 1992 for the People's Construction Bank of China, and to 10 years in July 1993 for the China International Trust and Investment Corporation. The survey says China was 'quite active' in international markets between 1982, when it resumed bond issues, and 1989, when capital-raising abroad slowed. The pace picked up again in 1991 and accelerated in 1993. International bond placements at the end of last year stood at Dollars 9bn. The IMF is critical of China's '10 windows' monopoly on international bond issues. This restricts organisations authorised to borrow abroad to some 10 financial institutions. However, it notes that the authorities are experimenting with 'necessary first steps' to give enterprises independent access to international bond markets. *International Capital Markets: Developments, Prospects and Policy Issues.

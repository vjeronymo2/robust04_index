			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW COMPUTER FROM HITACHI OUTPACES IBM  </P> <P> Japan's Hitachi Ltd. unveiled a new computer that is faster than IBM's biggest  mainframes, although industry analysts say the Japanese company will not likely  sell enough of them to challenge the U.S. giant's lead.  </P> <P> Hitachi Data Systems, owned 80% by Hitachi Ltd. and 20% by General Motors  Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Inc., introduced, as expected, three new models  of its HDS EX Series mainframe computers.  </P> <P> Two models, the EX 310 and EX 420, designed to meet increased computing  capacities of the largest users of mainframe systems, will be shipped in the  second quarter of 1991, Hitachi said.  </P> <P> Initial shipments of a third model, the EX 85, are slated for the fourth  quarter of 1990.  </P> <P> "The 420 will offer one-third more performance than the current competition,"  said James Balassone, Hitachi Data executive vice president-marketing, at the  unveiling of the new high-end mainframe.  </P> <P> Mainframes are large-scale computers often used for large business  applications.  </P> <P> Hitachi Data Systems' new computers are expected to outperform International  Business Machines Corp.'s current line, the 3090s, but analysts disagree over  whether they will jostle IBM's dominance of the $40-billion market.  </P> <P> "We expect Hitachi to leapfrog IBM," said Bob Djurdjevic, an analyst at Annex  Research.  </P></p>

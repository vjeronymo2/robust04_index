			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Markets: No time to start a wild bull chase - Serious Money THE FT-SE 100 index surged through 3,000 this week, prompting reports on the Nine O'Clock News and talk of a prolonged bull market with the index heading swiftly for 3,500. Regular readers will know that this column believes private investors have an unfortunate tendency to buy when the market is high and sell when it is low. So, is this one of the occasions when the wise private investor should head for the exits? The first point is that we should not get too excited when share indices hit records. Over time, share prices have a tendency to rise, partly because of economic growth and partly because of inflation. A new high does not necessarily herald a fall. The bull argument at the moment is interest rate related. Now that European countries have been freed from the constraints of the exchange rate mechanism, they can lower their interest rates. This will stimulate their economies and provide a boost to British exports. It will also allow the UK to cut its interest rates without worrying about a plunge in the pound. The result should be increased growth at home. Furthermore, this growth should occur in a period when inflation is not a problem. That allows rates to stay low, both on short-term rates and long-term bonds. So, with returns on the main alternative investments - cash and bonds - both low, investors naturally are eager to put money into the stock market. Hence, bulls argue, prices should keep rising. Is there any need for caution? Two of the most fundamental measures of share price valuation are the price-earnings ratio and the dividend yield. At present, both of these make shares look expensive by historical standards. The p/e ratio is the relationship between the share price and the proportion of a company's profits attributable to an individual share. If its price is 100p and the most recently announced earnings per share were 10p, then the p/e would be 10. An investor would have to pay the equivalent of 10 years' profits to buy that share. Broadly speaking, the higher the p/e ratio, the faster investors expect profits to grow. If they are set to double, then a share trading on an historic p/e of 20 is trading only on a prospective p/e of 10. Talking recently to US fund manager Michael O'Higgins, whose high-yield, low-price theory of stock picking I have described many times, I was struck by his remark that 'people spend too much time looking at the outlook for corporate earnings, and not enough at the p/e ratio.' When the p/e is high, the market is at its most optimistic about prospects for corporate earnings (and is likely to be disappointed); when the p/e is low, the market is at its most pessimistic (and likely to be pleasantly surprised). I decided to test this by looking at the p/e on the FT-A 500 Index since 1965 (this happens to be the benchmark for which Datastream has the longest series of information). The method was simple: compare the p/e at the start of the year with the gain made by the index over the year. Over the 28 years from 1965 to 1993, the p/e on January 1 varied between 4.02 in 1975 and 22.49 in 1969. I divided the 28 years in four batches, ranging from the seven lowest to the seven highest, and then compared average stock market returns for the four groups. The results were not a smooth progression but were still fairly conclusive. In the seven years when the p/e was at its lowest, the growth of the index over the following year averaged 32.37 per cent. In the seven years when the p/e was at its highest (above 14.23), the index subsequently grew by just 2.41 per cent. Just in case this was a statistical fluke, I tested the theory on the 28 periods since 1965 starting August 1. Again, the result was clear. In the periods when the p/e was low (below 9), the average return over the subsequent year was 19.86 per cent; when it was high (above 14.5), the return was minus 4.82 per cent. There were three occasions when the p/e on the 500 index was over 20. In each case, the market fell by more than 15 per cent over the following year. In other words, it is a bad time to buy the market when the p/e is high. The current p/e on the 500 index is 19.78. Perhaps the past 28 years were unrepresentative, however, in that inflation was high. Now it has fallen, bulls could argue that the valuations appropriate in the high-inflation era are no longer relevant. So, what about the dividend yield, now 3.71 per cent on the All-Share? BZW has figures dating back to 1918, which cover years of both low and high inflation. If contrarian theory is right, years when the dividend yield is high should be followed by better market returns than years when the yield is low. Sure enough, when the yield was, like now, below 4 per cent, the average rise in the index over the following year was 0.3 per cent. When the market yielded over 5 per cent, returns averaged 15.8 per cent. All this proves is you should buy low, not high. It does not mean you should sell all your shares today - they are still the best long-term investment - but it does indicate you should avoid chasing the market with new lump sums.</p>

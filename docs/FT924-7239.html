			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Sell-off possible for Scots water THE GOVERNMENT will today set out its options for bringing private-sector capital into the Scottish water and sewerage industry. Although these are likely to include pri vatisation by means of a stock market flotation, other possi bilities are to be advanced. Strong opposition to sation has arisen following the disclosure in July by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, that he was looking at ways 'in which the private sector might contribute enterprise and investment' to Scottish water. An opinion poll showed only 4 per cent of Scots in favour of privatisation. Apart from creating compa nies and then selling them off, private capital could be brought in by granting conces sions to run and invest in water services.</p>

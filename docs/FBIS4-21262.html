			<p>Explain   DEA Actions   <F P=102> PY2204165894 La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 12 Apr 94 p A5 </F> <F P=103> PY2204165894 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz LA RAZON </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "United States Owes Explanations to Bolivia"] </F>   [Text] The United States -- its embassy, and through it the  DEA -- owe Bolivia an explanation for the events related to "the  narco-accusation" being discussed by the FELCN [Special  Antinarcotics Force] and Congress, even if this is simply for  considerations of diplomatic practice or good manners, for lack  of a more precise and appropriate definition.    It is already known with certainty that the DEA has been and  continues to be a decisive factor in these actions. This much  is known precisely because of the apologies presented by the  U.S. Embassy to the Costa Rican Government, and through a DEA  communique explaining the appearance and later disappearance, in  Costa Rica, of Bolivian citizen Edgar Fernandez Lazcano.  Nothing of the kind has occurred in La Paz, until today,  despite the fact that our country was directly affected by those  U.S. actions, which have hurt our national dignity.    The explanations offered here by the ministers of government  and social communication regarding the Fernandez case are not  convincing. We do not understand why our government does  nothing effective to bring him back to the country, particularly  as he is considered a key element in the Chamber of Deputies  Justice Commission hearing, and given the fact that he himself  has stated his willingness to testify before the commission  following a previous detention by the FELCN. His extradition  seems to be impossible due to a lack of charges against him.  However, it should not be impossible for Bolivian authorities  to ask the DEA -- which currently holds him detained, or  protects him, and which is also suspected of helping him get out  of the country, enter Costa Rica, and later leave it, presumably  for Miami -- to bring him back to the country.    But independent of what the Bolivian Government does or does  not, it is the U.S. Government which has the obligation, or at  least the moral duty, to explain its participation in these  affairs.</p>

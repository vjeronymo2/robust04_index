After the meeting Bucan said that he discussed with Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid the agreement concluded by Bosnia-Herzegovina's  Muslims and Croats to establish a confederal union with Croatia  so that the Muslim-Croatian "canton" would become an independent  state, but at the same time linked to Croatia in matters of  joint defense, markets, and a customs union.    He added that he sensed during his talks with Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid that the latter shares his view that the agreement  is essential to a peaceful solution of the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the general crisis in the former  Yugoslavia.    The Croatian ambassador said he expects the agreement to  succeed in view of the longstanding friendship between Muslims  and Catholics in that region. He referred to the existence of a  mosque and Islamic center in Croatia.    Bucan said he hopes Russia will play a positive role in  ensuring the agreement's success.</p>

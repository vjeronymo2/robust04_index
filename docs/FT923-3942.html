			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y to surrender NY building to bondholders OLYMPIA &amp; York, the ailing Canadian developer, is turning over ownership of its biggest New York office building to the property's bondholders. The deal, which involves a 53-storey building at 55 Water Street in Manhattan's financial district, marks a rare vote of confidence in the future of the New York office market which has been plagued for the past four years by high vacancy rates and tumbling rentals. Besides exchanging their Dollars 548m in secured notes for a 100 per cent equity stake in the 3.3m sq ft building, the bondholders have agreed to invest an extra Dollars 21m in preferred shares. The deal is expected to be finalised early next year. The biggest bondholder, the Retirement System of Alabama, has expressed a willingness to buy out the remaining investors as well as to contribute their share of the preferred share issue. Mr Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild, which has advised the bondholders, said this commitment could require an investment of up to Dollars 140m by the Alabama pension fund. Mr Ross interpreted the pension fund's commitment as a major vote of confidence in the New York property market. 'This is not some real estate speculator doing it on borrowed money. This is a very serious investor,' he said. Mr David Bronner, chief executive of the Alabama Retirement System, added the pension fund believes 'the New York real estate market provides excellent long-term opportunities.' Following completion of the transaction, the building will be debt-free. Mr Ross said the new owners will have considerable room for manoeuvre to attract new tenants and to pay for the improvements required over the next few years. O&amp;Y will continue to manage the building pending further negotiations with the new owners. O&amp;Y made an interest payment on the Water St bonds as scheduled on June 30, but warned rental income from the building would not be sufficient to meet debt-service payments beyond the middle of 1993. It said up to Dollars 200m would also be needed for tenant refurbishment, brokerage commissions and asbestos removal.</p>

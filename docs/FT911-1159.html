			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Aker to acquire marine engineering company NORWAY'S Aker group yesterday announced it is to acquire Houston-based Omega Marine engineering company in a move which forms a central plank in its international expansion strategy. Omega Marine had 150 employees and a revenue of Dollars 17m in 1990, while last year Aker recorded profits of NKr632m (Dollars 93m) on turnover of NKr13.41bn. The new company is to be called Aker Omega Marine. Omega has been involved in several important engineering projects for the Gulf of Mexico market and engineered the Joliett tension leg platform (tlp) which has evolved into cost-efficient floating production technology for the development of oil and gas fields. Aker is best known for its giant gravity base offshore platforms, of which it has built 13 for the North Sea and has three under construction. Mr Gregers Kure, president of Aker Oil and Gas Technology, said the acquisition gives his company a strong foothold in the Gulf of Mexico market, where he estimates investment in tlps may reach Dollars 2bn annually by 1994. Aker and Omega have recently completed preliminary studies on tlps for US-based Mobil Research and Development Company, Shell, Exxon and Amoco. Omega Marine is currently owned by key employees and will continue to operate under Mr Kenneth Caldwell, its president.</p>

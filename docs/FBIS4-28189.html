			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets  have committed military provocations in an unbroken chain in the  Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) along the Military Demarcation Line  (MDL) in June, getting on our nerves, according to military  sources.    On June 3, they openly brought recoilless guns in the DMZ in  front of Komsa-ri, Chorwon County, in the central sector of the  front, and two mortars in the DMZ in front of Maebong Peak in  Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, in the Eastern sector of the front and  installed them toward the North side and conducted fire service  drills.    More than 300 fully armed bandits of the puppet army who  scrawled into the DMZ of the central sector of the front on June  1 and 2 maliciously got on the nerves of our People's Army  soldiers, taking a sighting posture against the North side all  at once.    The South Korean puppets illegally brought over 2,500 armed  bandits and 1,400 odd vehicles of different types in the DMZ  from June 1 to 4 for war exercises, search operations and  excavation of positions.    Such military provocations and criminal acts were  premeditated acts to incite the North-South confrontation and  deliberately aggravate the situation in the DMZ.    We cannot overlook such hostile acts of the South Korean  puppets, still less because they timed to coincide with the  bellicose outbursts of the U.S. military brasshats and traitors  against the northern half of Korea.    The South Korean puppets must stop acting rashly, deeply  mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their  military provocations and violations in the DMZ of the MDL along  which the armed forces of the two sides stand in acute  confrontation.</p>

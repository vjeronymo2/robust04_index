			<p>BFN     [Text] Now that six members of Komeito have become  ministers in the Hata cabinet, the party will play a major role  in administration of the minority ruling parties. While the  party is excited at being in such a position, bewilderment is  spreading in the party. Originally, there was strong concern in  the party and "Soka Gakkai," a large religious group supporting  Komeito, over other parties' opposition to a leading role for  the "Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-Komeito bloc" in the  coalition administration. Because their "leading role" has  become apparent since formation of the new cabinet, this concern  has also led to apprehension about the party's future because  the administration "may remain in the minority force." It is  likely that for the time being Komeito will not participate in  the new parliamentary group "Kaishin," which has prompted the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to secede from the  coalition. And, the party will likely try to consolidate its  internal structure while urging the SDPJ to return to the  coalition.    The SDPJ's secession from the administration was an  unexpected incident for Komeito as well. On 28 April when the  new cabinet was inaugurated, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi  Ishikawa said to a party general meeting of both lower and upper  house members: "The situation does not allow us to be pleased  with the increase of Komeito cabinet members from four to the  current six." Ichikawa thus admonished against the optimistic  view within the party, and stressed a sense of crisis about  Komeito having become one of the minority ruling parties.    The party plans to put off its participation in "Kaishin"  for  the time being, because it intends to serve as a "mediator" in  the future in persuading the SDPJ to return to the  administration. A senior Komeito member says: "If Komeito  makes a move now, this will stimulate the SDPJ to confirm its  determination to leave the coalition. We want to continue to  persuade it to return to the coalition." Takenori Kanzaki,  former posts and telecommunications minister, who has now  returned to party affairs, stated in an NHK discussion program  on 8 May: "We had better watch the situation for a while  regarding this issue."    Before the SDPJ left the coalition, Ichikawa and Shinseito  Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa urged the SDPJ to understand the  need to raise indirect taxes, including the consumption tax, and  to deal with the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea's) suspected  nuclear weapons development, through such occasions as meetings  of the coalition policy council. However, the actual situation  concerning Komeito is that women within Soka Gakkai have still  expressed a strong opposition to the consumption tax hike, and  that the party "has not yet discussed the final details of  measures to deal with North Korea, including the extent of  Japan's possible logistical support for the U.S. forces" (as  stated by a member in charge of policies).    In an effort to soften internal dissatisfaction with Komeito  acting in concert with Ozawa, Ichikawa has begun to study the  idea of changing the Komeito image that Ichikawa's personal  leadership has so far sustained the party, by gradually  entrusting management of party affairs to the young combination  of Kanzaki and Akihiro Ota in the future.    Ichikawa has not ostensibly changed his intention to support  the new administration in carrying out policies, stating that  "as long as the administration makes adequate decisions on  policies, the general public will support it." However, with  the remarks by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano [on the  1937 Nanjing massacre], the SDPJ has enhanced its opposition to  the Hata cabinet, and the possibility of the party returning to  the coalition is now decreasing. It appears that it is not easy  for Komeito to pave the way for breaking the deadlock in the  current situation in which the ruling coalition has unexpectedly  become a minority as a result of the "power game."</p>

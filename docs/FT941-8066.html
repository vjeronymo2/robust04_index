			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Newcomers swell Italian election lists More than 80 per cent of the members of Italy's next parliament are likely to be either new to national politics or politicians who have changed parties. This became evident yesterday as the list of candidates in the March 27 election closed before the campaign begins formally on Friday. Former leading figures such as former prime ministers Mr Bettino Craxi and Mr Arnaldo Forlani have stepped down, discredited by corruption scandals. The parties, new and old, have recognised that all those tainted by the scandals risk being a political liability and the emphasis is on new or acceptably recycled faces. The greatest haggling has been within the Popular Party (PPI) - previously the long-governing Christian Democrats - who have forged a tenuous electoral alliance with the Italian Pact movement of Mr Mario Segni, the referendum leader. The PPI and the Pact were the last to hammer out an agreement on candidates for the 475 seats in the chamber of deputies to be elected by the new first-past-the-post system. The remaining 155 seats will be decided by the old proportional representation system. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate turned politician who has injected the main element of uncertainty into the result, is to contest a seat in the historic centre of Rome having originally sought a Milan constituency. He is being opposed by Mr Luigi Spaventa, the budget minister in the present government, who is standing as a candidate for the Progressive Alliance, dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The two men could not be more different. Mr Berlusconi represents entrepreneurial success and television soap opera culture; Mr Spaventa, a Fellow of All Souls at Oxford, is a brilliant intellect with a technocratic background. The third main candidate in this constituency is Mr Alberto Michelini, the closest aide of Mr Segni and strongly identified with the Roman Catholic organisation Opus Dei. Mr Berlusconi had originally considered a Milan constituency but, following an agreement with the populist Northern League, agreed to let Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, treat the city as his seat. The League alliance with Mr Berlusconi's new Forza Italia movement appears to be holding. But there are continued strains over Mr Berlusconi's links in southern Italy with National Alliance, the renamed neo-fascist MSI movement of Mr Gianfranco Fini. The polls show Mr Berlusconi and Forza Italia holding 25 per cent of the vote, well clear of any other party. The polls also indicate that Forza Italia, League and National Alliance movement would win about 45 per cent of the vote, insufficient to form a government. Also, once the campaign starts, the polls are likely to change and the PDS alliance believes it can recover ground.</p>

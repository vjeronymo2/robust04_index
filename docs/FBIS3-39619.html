			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, by Sebastiano Messina in Rome  on 16 February: "D'Alema Vents Feelings About His Toughest Day"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Messina] Basically,  you were expecting this charge [of illicit party funding], Mr.  D'Alema, were you not?    [D'Alema] The bringing of charges as a political weapon is  something unprecedented in modern democracies. If someone  tries, he can find three or four unscrupulous lawyers and set  them to work in connection with the investigation of a number of  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's aides for having given money  to postal service officials, and with the business involving his  brother, Paolo -- well, he can try. He can formulate a fine  charge and make the rounds of the attorneys' offices. Let us  be frank: The very idea that someone should consider settling  the political contest in this way seems to me frankly monstrous.    [Messina] But it has happened    [D'Alema] So, I tell you that this initiative on Craxi's  part, this anti-PDS super-prosecuting attorney, is revealing.  It sheds light on other judicial matters, other "spontaneous"  statements from members of the business demimonde that evidently  felt -- what shall we say -- inspired to act. Then, when he  realized that he was not succeeding, he acted himself. He used  a trick learned from judo -- causing your adversary to fall  under his own impetus. I believe that this is all he has been  doing for the past several months. It must be an obsession for  him, his job. To contact people, to send them to attorneys'  offices, to acquire documentation. In human terms, it is all  rather pathetic: Someone who used to be a very prominent  political leader, a statesman.    [Messina] You spent a long time at Attorney Mele's office.  Is it true that you were questioned by the magistrates?    [D'Alema] What questioning! I went to the attorney's office  to lodge a formal charge for libel against Bettino Craxi. And  to institute a legal action in this connection.    [Messina] On the basis of what was reported in the  newspapers?    [D'Alema] Certainly. He accused me of being the organizer,  the promoter, the accomplice in a series of actions of illegal  party funding. And this is not true. What is more, none of the  attorney's offices in Italy knows anything about it either. It  seems that this charge is nothing but a collection of judicial  proceedings, statements, and articles cobbled together by some  clever lawyer that Craxi can permit himself to pay. But it is  all old hat. And since during the past two years of inquiries  not only have I never been investigated by any attorney's  office, but no judge has even felt the need to summon me as a  witness.    [Messina] But do you or do you not know whether the  magistrates have included you on the list of investigatees?    [D'Alema] I do not know; that is secret information, or  should be. For that matter, we do not even know how many people  have been included on the register of investigatees over the  past two years, or who they are. We do not know. Because that  is a preliminary and necessary action that the magistrate  carries out in absolute secrecy. Above all, it is a secret to  whoever is on the register, because he must not know that he is  the subject of preliminary inquiries. But we have now  monstrously distorted everything.    [Messina] But why does Craxi want to hit you and [PDS  Secretary] Occhetto? Is it revenge, an attempt to spread the  guilt?    [D'Alema] He wants to hit us because were are in the midst  of  an election campaign.    [Messina] What direct interest could he have in doing so,  since he is no longer your political adversary?    [D'Alema] First, Craxi is motivated by an implacable hatred  for those who have always combated him. He considers us his  fundamental enemies. From this viewpoint, I feel honored by so  much esteem. It is the best reply to those who used to say that  we and Craxi were closely associated: This action bears the  stamp of hatred. Moreover, it is not true that Craxi is not in  the arena. He is. I do not know who may have deluded  themselves that the decline of a political system would put an  end to that system of government, that complex of vested  interests and businesses. Those forces still exist. The  difference now is that Berlusconi is in the front rank and Craxi  in the second rank. Craxi is involved in the political  struggle, as well as seeking a personal vendetta.    [Messina] Is there not some personal factor in this  business? What did you say last time you met?    [D'Alema] I have not spoken with Craxi for a very long time.  I believe that I have definitely maintained a civil attitude  toward him since his fall from grace. I have never attacked  him. I fought him when he was powerful. He will not find a  single statement by me against him since he became implicated in  the corruption inquiry. I love political struggle, not the  persecution of individuals.    [Messina] What were your thoughts the other night?    [D'Alema] Personally, I am confident, I actually slept  fairly  well except for the fact that my three and one-half year old son  wakes up from time to time. Of course, I have some concern for  my friends and family.    [Messina] Of what nature?    [D'Alema] Well, I will have to visit the people who know me  as a result of the battles that I have waged, and I will have  to explain to them that I am an honest man. That is the last  thing in the world that I thought that I would have to do.    [Messina] And will you do so?    [D'Alema] Who knows? You have the suspicion that the person  in front of you may have seen a television news program, read  the newspapers. And frankly I find that rather difficult to  accept.    [Messina] Have you thought what you would do if you were to  receive an investigation notice?    [D'Alema] I do not need to think about it. I am a fighter.  And we progressives have decided on the following rule: If  anyone receives an investigation notice for offenses connected  with matters relating to Bribe City, including illegal party  funding, he will not stand as a candidate. This is the rule,  and I will adhere to it, like everyone else. Having said that,  I am a responsible person, and certain things are not solely up  to me.    [Messina] What if they were up to you?    [D'Alema] I will tell you that I am not very keen.    [Messina] To conduct an election campaign?    [D'Alema] No, I would willingly conduct it more  energetically. I am not very keen to go around telling people:  You must vote for me. I feel a great weight on my mind at the  moment.</p>

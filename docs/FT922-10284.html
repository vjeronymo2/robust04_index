			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Ford calls for more productive working MR HAROLD POLING, chair-man of Ford Motor, said yesterday that the company's British subsidiary had to narrow its productivity gap with continental Europe. He implied that Ford might otherwise consider moving production out of the UK. Mr Poling, speaking at a press lunch in New York, added that Jaguar, the loss-making British car manufacturer Ford bought for Pounds 1.5bn in 1989, was expected to remain in the red this year but had ' a chance' of an operating profit in 1993 if the UK economy made a sustained recovery. Mr Poling was speaking the day after Ford reported that its European vehicle operations made a net profit of Dollars 84m in the first quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 129m a year before. Mr Poling said the UK results were 'very encouraging' given the general decline in car sales. Nevertheless all Ford's UK factories suffered from historic inefficiencies, including productivity rates and amount of time worked. 'The productivity differences between the UK and the Continent must be addressed,' Mr Poling added. Ford was very pleased with the product qaulity, cost structure and productivity at its much newer Spanish operations, he said. The company hoped to be able to make the progress necessary to maintain its operations in the UK. 'As long as we continue to make progress on a reasonable schedule I think we'll continue to be patient.' Mr Poling said British unions were 'starting to recognise that the competition is intense, not only from other countries in industrial Europe but also from the Japan transplants located there'. He said Ford expected to see the required benefits of its Jaguar acquisition in the later half of the decade.</p>

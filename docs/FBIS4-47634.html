			<p>Against   Russia                                         SUMMARY     Gennadiy Zyuganov, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) outlines his  view that Russia is the target of a broad and centuries-old  conspiracy in his book Derzhava (Great Power), a collection of  his essays and interviews with him, published in January 1994.  He sees the main forces behind the conspiracy today as Zionists,  capitalists, and Western nations, especially the United States.  Their plot is carried out by agents in Russia, who in recent  years have included former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin.  Since the plotters and their  agents have successfully employed a strategy of successively  defeating opposing forces in Russia by luring them into violent  confrontations such as those of August 1991 and October 1993,  Zyuganov believes that "patriots'' can defeat Yeltsin and the  anti-Russian plotters only trough nonviolent, legal opposition  and by uniting behind an ideology that fuses elements of Russian  nationalism and communism.  Zyuganov has consistently expounded  these themes of a broad plot against Russia and the need for a  nationalist-communist fusion to counter it since 1992, when he  became a leading force of the anti-Yeltsin opposition.  These  themes are not unique to Zyuganov and the CPRF, however, for  other opposition leaders, including Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, have  cited the existence of an international plot against Russia and  articulated an ideology that combines nationalism with elements  of traditional Soviet communism.                                       END SUMMARY     According to Zyuganov the great plot was hatched more than a  thousand years ago, at the dawn of Russian history, by malevolent  forces determined to subjugate Russia, which they see as the main  obstacle to their plans for world domination.  Zyuganov blames  this plot for all the horrors and suffering, such as the Great  Purges of the Thirties, that have afflicted Russia throughout its  history.  In his view, those behind the plot have used witting  agents and manipulated unwitting fools inside Russia to undermine  Russia's economic and social structure by orchestrating economic  chaos, political unrest, and social upheaval.     Behind the Plot     While Zyuganov sometimes explicitly accuses the United Nations  and the United States of being instigators of what he describes  as recurring attempts to destroy Russia in the current era, at  other times he is less explicit and lapses into mystical rhetoric  about the secretive roots of the plot.  Although he uses Soviet  style anti-capitalist rhetoric, his depiction of the plot appears  to be drawn from the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion,  allegedly a blueprint for world domination by the Masons and  Jewish Elders now acknowledged as a forgery concocted by the  Czarist secret police.  The Protocols, which have been repeatedly  reprinted by ultranationalist media in post Soviet Russia, warn  of a strong President installing a new constitution and  accumulating personal power for the benefit of his unseen  patrons, the Jewish-Masonic plotters and a rapacious capitalist  class, ever prepared to sell out the Motherland to enhance the  power of the hidden hand behind the great plot.  (See Box 1)     Zyuganov explains both the Bolshevik revolution and the  disintegration of the Soviet Union as products of this plot and  its efforts to subvert Russia.  During the revolution,  russophobes and internationalists among the Bolsheviks perverted  the struggle of honest Russians against the rapacious capitalist  class and instituted a Soviet dictatorship that kept Russia in  subjugation.  According to Zyuganov the good features of the  Soviet era--the victory over Fascism or social protection for  children, for example--were due to the selfless qualities of the  Russian people and the patriotic Russian elements within the  communist party.  The bad features--the cruelty and bureaucratism  of the system, for example--were the work of the plotters and  their witting and unwitting agents.  He sees the breakup of the  Soviet Union as a move by the plotters and "agent" like  Gorbachev and Yeltsin to keep the USSR from obstructing the  establishment of a new world order under U.S. domination.     Interpretation of Recent Events     In a section of Derzhava titled "The Algebra of Politics"  (published in FBIS USR 94-003-L, "Zyuganov on Russian  'Catastrophe"'), Zyuganov applied his conspiracy theory to the  attempted coup of August 1991 and Yeltsin's clash with the  Supreme Soviet in September-October 1993, seeing both events as  the skillful elimination of opposing forces in Russia by the  plotters and their agents.  Describing both as examples of  "virtuoso use" of the natural flow of events and the "method of  controlled explosions," Zyuganov alleges that the plotters used  the clashes to remove from the Russian political arena "all  forces capable of impeding the country's integration into the  single supra-state system of the 'new world order.'"  According  to Zyuganov's interpretation of the fall 1993 clash, Yeltsin took  advantage of his almost complete control of the country's power  structures to  deliberately provoke a confrontation with the  Supreme Soviet during 1993 in preparation for defeating and  ousting them.  "All who were 'against' democratic extremism"  gathered under the banner of the Supreme Soviet, but they were  completely and decisively defeated.  Among the few positive  facets of this crisis, Zyuganov says, was that certain extremist  organizations that had afforded the "democrats" a pretext for the  "dirtiest and most unbridled accusations against the patriots"  were "swept from the political stage."     Zyuganov's Current Strategy     Zyuganov concludes the "Algebra of Politics" with an assertion  that "the present antipopular regime" will inevitably collapse  under the pressure of an increasingly hostile populace if the  opposition does not repeat the mistakes of the past and refuses  to be drawn into a violent confrontation.  As a result of the  1991 and 1993 clashes, he claims, more people have become aware  of the "real nature of the present authorities" and are convinced  that Russia can be saved only by "the unification of all healthy  forces based on our centuries-old national-state, spiritual,  moral, and religious values."  Arguing that the Yeltsin regime  can hold on to power "only by intensifying the dictatorship",  Zyuganov argues that the opposition must pursue a peaceful,  nonviolent path that will provide no pretext for the use of force  against it.  "If it is compelled to exist for any length of time  under the conditions of peaceful, nonviolent development and  legal stability, [the Yeltsin regime] will inevitably be swept  away by the opposition."     Nationalist-Communist Fusion     A main element of Zyuganov's strategy for defeating Yeltsin and  the plotters is his effort to unite the opposition under an  ideology that fuses Russian nationalism and communism.  He  rejects Marxism-Lenninism's traditional international focus in  favor of an explicitly Russo-centric version of communism.  Indeed, despite his long career in the communist apparatus, which  included a stint as an ideologist with the CPSU Central  Committee, the views he expounds in Derzhava make clear that he  is not a proponent of communist ideology's official  internationalism.  Zyuganov views the communist era as a  continuation rather than a break with Russian history, but an era  flawed because the Russian people suffered at the hands of the  Russophobes within the communist party.  According to Zyuganov,  the Russian people, ever altruistic and selfless, suffered more  than all the other nations of the Russian-Soviet empire as they  were required to sacrifice their interests for the good of all.     Although he rejects some aspects of the communist era, Zyuganov  sees many of its features as positive continuations of Russian  spirit and achievement.  In his view, the USSR continued Czarist  Russia's powerful spiritual legacy, its collectivist spirit, and  ideological consensus, which enabled the communist rank and file  and the common people to build a powerful, feared, and respected  state, which became an industrial society, repulsed the Nazi  invaders, launched powerful rockets, and looked after the old and  the sick.  Zyuganov sees the effort to use these common positive  elements from the Russian imperial past as the basis for a  revival of Russia, a revival that should be lead by undogmatic,  patriotic communists who are willing to work with the Church and  other traditionalist elements.  Proceeding from this  identification of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union,  Zyuganov calls on all "patriots," that is, those who want Russia  to inherit the USSR's great power status, to unite to achieve  that goal.     The Two Parties Within the CPSU     Central to Zyuganov's fusion of nationalism and communism is his  view that the Soviet Communist Party was divided internally  between two philosophically antagonistic parties: the party of  "our country" ("nasha strana")--made up of populists and  patriots--and the party of "that country" ("eta strana") made up  of internationalist, cosmopolitan, and mercenary elements, coming  largely from among ethnic minorities.  According to Zyuganov, the  party of "our country," the party of rank and file communists and  men like Marshall Georgiy Zhyukov (hero of the Great Patriotic  War) and Cosmonaut Yuriy Gagarin, was fundamentally patriotic and  Russian.  It never lost its affection for Russian tradition and  its sympathy for the common man, in whose name the Great October  Revolution was made.  In Zyuganov's view, the party of "our  country" saw the particular talents and spiritual qualities of  the Russian people, rather than dogmatic adherence to Marxism-  Leninism, as the essential element in the construction of the  Soviet Union and its socialist system, which, for all its  shortcomings, achieved much that is worth preserving.     Zyuganov holds the party of "that country" responsible for all  the black pages of Soviet history, due, at least in part to its  strong non-Russian composition.  He cites the influence of the  Jews Leon Trotsky and Lazar Kaganovich, and the Georgian Lavrenti  Beria (but not the Georgian Stalin).  Zyuganov sees these non-  Russians as incapable of drawing on Russian traditions which were  alien to them.  Indeed, he views them as Russophobes with  accomplices among the mercenary, careerist elements within the  party, elements he says were exemplified in the late Soviet  period by figures like former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev  and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.     Relationship to Other Nationalists     Despite ideological and political divisions among Russian  Ultranationalist groups, Zyuganov's notion of an international  plot against Russia is shared in some form by virtually all these  groups.   LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and other nationalist  figures (See Box 2) frequently make reference to Western-Zionist  (in the sense of the "Zionism" of the Protocols, that is, as a  world-wide Jewish conspiracy) attempts to destroy Russia and have  wielded terms like "agent of influence" to describe those they  consider ideological enemies.  Such politicians seem to agree in  viewing the Soviet period as merely one stage in the unbroken  chain of Russian history.     Box 1                           The Protocols of the Elders of Zion     The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, concocted by the Czarist  secret police to encourage ultra-nationalist resistance to reform  of the Czarist system, were published in a widely circulated  edition in Russia in 1905 by the court printers at Czarskoye  Selo, and later at the print shop of the Troitse-Sergeyeva Lavra,  one of pre-revolutionary Russia's foremost monasteries.  The  Protocols ostensibly are the records of meetings of the Elders of  Zion, a secret Jewish society allied with the Masonic order and  dedicated to establishing world rule by the elders.  Nationalist  fanatics saw the Protocols as proof that not only the  revolutionary movement, but capitalists and reformers as well,  were agents of a world-wide conspiracy to destroy the Czarist  order.     The Protocols have found a ready audience among oppositionists  today, and they have been reprinted and commented on countless  times in the opposition press.  Reports of opposition gatherings  regularly report the sale the Protocols to participants.     All references are to the version published in Molodaya Gvardiya  No. 10, 1993:     "Our watchwords are force and hypocrisy . . . we must not shrink  from bribery, deception and treachery . . . on the path to world  domination . . . around the world the words 'liberty, equality,  fraternity,' are attracting whole legions of our blind agents."  p.134     "The role of the press is to order up the necessary demands, to  pass along the plea of the people's voice, to express and create  discontent . . . it [the press] will be in our hands." p.135     "Having created by all the underground means available to us,  with the help of our gold, all of which is in our hands, a  general economic crisis, we will throw whole crowds of workers  out on the streets simultaneously in all the countries of Europe.  p.138     "We must undermine faith, to take the very principle of God and  the spirit from the lips of the gentiles and exchange everything  for a simple arithmetic of accounting by material demands . . .  all feelings toward the Motherland and religion will be displaced  by cosmopolitan institutions." p.139     "They [the gentiles] will be forced [by perpetual crisis] to turn  over international power to us . . . to form a supergovernment."  p. 141     "Through speculation all of the world's money will wind up in our  hands, and that will force all of the gentiles into the ranks of  the proletariat." p.142     "We have serving us people of all opinions, of all doctrines . .  . monarchists, . . . socialists, and all kinds of utopians."  p.146     "From liberalism is born constitutional government . . . the  president will be taken from among our creatures, our slaves."  p.149     "We will supply our own opposition . . . which will present  itself as our antipode . . . our actual opposition will, in  spirit, accept this opposition as their own."     "[In order to undermine traditional morals] we have created  mindless, filthy, disgusting literature." p.157 A footnote  states: "The participation of Jews in the creation and  distribution of this type of literature is well known."     "The Russian autocracy is the single serious enemy for us in the  world, if the Papacy is not taken into account." p.158     "When it becomes necessary to strengthen strong security  measures, we will arrange simulations of disturbances and  manifestations of discontent." p. 166     END BOX 1     BOX 2              Other Opposition Figures on "Plot" Against Russia     Claims of international Zionist or imperialist conspiracies  against Russia are prominent features of the ideologies of most  Russian ultranationalist groups.  The mainstream Russian media  have noted the commonality of conspiracy theories among the  movements, as illustrated by the following account of the first  meeting of General Aleksandr Sterligov's Russian National  Assembly, from a Moscow Mayak radio account:  "What unites these  people?  After all, one can see monarchists, nationalists, KGB  staffers, engineering and technical personnel, along with many  military and communist figures in the hall.  So, in the view of  these patriots, international forces embodied by the  International Zionist Organization, the World Jewish Congress,  and some other organizations are destroying Slavic statehood  through the United Nations, the CSCE, the EC, and NATO." (12 June  1992)     From an ITAR-TASS report on the same meeting: "Addressing the  delegates, [nationalist writer] Valentin Rasputin said that  'Satanic forces are experimenting on Russia,' which is  'surrounded by domestic and foreign devils,' and that 'Russia  cannot recover from the blows it received from the democrats' . .    [Russian National Assembly Chairman] Aleksandr Sterligov said  that Russia's foes are 'working on destroying Russia' and added  that 'the goals of American imperialism to demolish Russia have  been achieved' . . . Yeltsin and his accomplices have reached  their objective to weaken Russia and now they can 'board their  plane and fly off to their Western values.'" (12 June 1992)     Direct statements from ultranationalist groups themselves also  cite the existence of conspiracies against Russia as in this  appeal by military officers to the Russian Supreme Soviet:  "The  destruction of the USSR has been carried out through the joint  actions of imperialism, Zionism, and internal reaction."  (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 March 1993)     From an interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy: "The United States  is the evil empire, the nucleus of hell, which is behind the  beginning of every war . . . .1 spit on the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs.  They are criminals, CIA agents'        They  have trying to introduce their system everywhere and at all times  . . . the Anglo-Saxon model under the ideological influence of  Jerusalem." (Warsaw, Sztandar Mlodych, 1 February 1993).     From an interview with the Russian Orthodox Church's Metropolitan  Ioann of St. Petersburg:     Reporter: "During the past 50 years it has been declared  repeatedly that the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' is a  literary falsification.     Ioann: I think this way: there is a saying that the cap burns on  the thief.  If these Protocols are forged, then what are the  Zionists worried about?  Of course it is difficult to determine  who wrote them, but the program is already in operation. . .     Reporter: Do you believe in the possibility of a world conspiracy  against Russia?     Ioann: It is not just possible, there is one. . .  Zionism is  founded not on religious domination but on the golden calf, on  domination on a global scale." (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 16 April  1993)     According to a 27 July 1993 Interfax report on a conference of  the oppositionist National Salvation Front: "A number of  nationally-minded parties' have left the NSF . . . . [Russian  National Republican Party leader Nikolay] Lysenko claimed that  certain unnamed members of the NSF [which includes Communist  Party Chairman Gennadiy Zyuganov] were 'obsessed' with a 'Judeo-  Masonic conspiracy'."     END BOX 2     Appendix A     Unless otherwise noted, all quotations below are from Derzhava     Continuity of Russian/Soviet History     The communist party has behaved differently toward the Church at  different times in its history, from harsh opposition to  cooperation during the Great Patriotic War. . . . I see no reason  to repeat old mistakes . . . . We [CPRF] are for freedom of  conscience to such a degree, that believers have the right to  join our party without any sort of limitations. p.8     Life forces us to greater wisdom. . . . We should look at our own  history and understand the meaning for the world of the thousand  year history of Russian statehood . . . from century to century  we were inspired by the labor and the achievements of our  forebears in building a great power. . . . Our main, primary duty  is to re-establish this holy connection [with our past]. p.13     An empire, a great power, they [the democrats] tell us, means an  all-powerful bureaucracy . . . [it means] censorship, the absence  of elementary rights. . . . This is a lie!  Empire is the  historical and geopolitically stipulated form of development for  the Russian state . . . it is many different . . . peoples,  connected by a single general and higher culture. . . . From  ancient times, Russia recognized itself as the successor and  preserver of the imperial heritage.  'Moscow is the third Rome' .      Russia is the continuation of the universal imperial  tradition. p.15     It [the national unity of imperial Russia] found expression in  the formula "Autocracy, Orthodoxy, Narodnost [national roots]."  p.15     The revolution of 1917 was the natural result of the general  crisis . . . Autocracy gradually was transformed into a regime of  all-powerful, cosmopolitan bureaucrats . . . [which had] divided  the supreme power from the people. p.18     Having united the "red" ideal of social justice . . . and the  "white" ideal of national . . . statehood [Russia will have] the  might [necessary to reestablish] our . . . Fatherland! p.33     The Russian people . . . are the preservers of Russian statehood,  its main bearer and defender . . . the free development of . . .  peoples . . . who have connected their historical fate with  Russia must become the cornerstone of Russian state policy. p.41     Conflict of the Two Parties Within the CPSU     In fact, there were two parties . . . [during] the Soviet period,  and a fierce, but quiet struggle, between them took place. .  The first was the party of "our country," the party to which  . Zhukov and Gagarin belonged . . . the largest part of ordinary  functionaries and administrators belonged to it . . . but there  was a second party in the Soviet Union--the party of "that  country," . . . for whom "that country," and "those people" were  merely the arena for the realization of their own . . . ambitions  and . . . reckless social experiments.  It was the party of  Trotsky and Kaganovich, Beria, . . . Gorbachev and Yeltsin,  Yakovlev and Shevardnadze.  Its legal successor today is  "Demrossiya." p.66     I joined the party of . . . Zhukov . . . each person must bear  personal responsibility for their own actions, and the effort [by  the Yeltsin administration] to portray 40 million people, people  who were members of the party, as state criminals--this is  political genocide directed against the Russian people, and that  cannot be allowed to happen again. p.7     [During the revolutionary period of 1917 and after] heroism and  treachery . . . patriotism and Russophobia poured forth in one  fiery torrent . . . among the victors. . . . [There were] various  approaches to the future of the country . . . for some, Russia,  regardless of her new name [the USSR], was . . . the Fatherland,  the beloved native country . . . but for others she was simply  . . [a platform] for the "permanent" revolution, a proving ground  for new world cataclysms . . . for inhuman experiments . . . a  reserve of resources and "human material."  The first group  endeavored to reestablish the destroyed, paralyzed economy . . .  to modernize the economy, build new factories, and resurrect the  armed forces.  The second group . . . cruelly destroyed hostages  by the thousands . . . [and] organized the concentration camps.  .  . The interparty struggle of these two groups . . . went on for  many long decades . . . and decisively predetermined the dramatic  events of the last few years. p.19     [During World War II] for communists there was one privilege, to  be the first raised up in battle, to be the first to be shot if  captured. . . . During that period there was [an internal-party]  decision to turn away from doctrinal myths, from Russophobia and  the . . . anti-Church campaign. . . . [During the] "Khrushchev  thaw" all of the haters of Russia were able to . . . freeze the  process of Russian national rebirth which had only just begun.  p.21     The Great Plot Against Russia     A.  Historical Roots     From "The Russian Question" (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 3 July 1993):     To a large extent, the West does not understand us.  It is afraid  of our might as a world power.  It has a self-interest in  weakening, dismembering, and, if possible, enslaving Russia . . .  [efforts to do so span] a period of more than a thousand years.     The Western states and the transnational banking and financial  corporations are, in the final analysis, the obedient relayers of  thee aggressive and irreconcilable anti-Russian policy . . . an  independent, self reliant Russia, [represents] in the modern  world, the chief hindrance on the path of creating a "New World  Order," that stipulates the formation of supernational agencies  of political, economic, and military leadership.  That maniacal  idea has an ancient history that is closely linked with the  development of secret political societies, religious sects, and  mystical dogmas.  But it was not until the end of the 20th  century that the idea received the fundamental possibility of  practical realization as a result of the achievements of  scientific-technical programs and the objective processes of  global economic integration.     B.  Current Manifestations     If you look over the program of the International Monetary Fund .  . . you will find that the essence of it amounts to one thing--to  make our economy non-competitive--first [they plan to] destroy  fundamental science. . . . From the point of view of America, I  understand their interest [in such a program].  From our point of  view, this is nothing more than colonial democracy. . . . We live  on one planet, on the same cosmic ship, which is flying through  space at great speed, and if we violate the balance of  equilibrium in something, and a narrow, American elite gets it  into their heads to form a new planetary system of a one-party  nature, and thereby establish a new dictatorship, a world order,  then we are waiting for, in our own time, a Macedonian,  Napoleonic, Hitlerian order.  [Such an order] is unnatural. pp.  8-9     [Technological changes after the second world war make possible,  for the first time in history] effective coordination of the  development of world civilization in all the most important  parameters. . . . It is not surprising that this development has  caused the sharp activization of trans-national, cosmopolitan  forces, who are attempting to realize such possibilities in the  concrete geopolitical form of a world superstate.  This  superstructure must, by the logic of its own elaboraters,  gradually eliminate sovereign national states. . . . [These  efforts] are proceeding from a single ruling center.  The  practical work of the creation of such a center began long ago.  p.23     The developed capitalist states are prepared to support the idea  of the creation of the "New World Order," within which they will  strengthen their own leading role. . . . [Within the New World  Order] certain regions will prosper, while the development of  others will be artificially frozen.  Is it necessary to clarify  in which group Russia will be under such a "division of labor."  p. 23     [Under conditions of a division of labor there must be a] planned  reduction [of population] . . . of peoples "without prospects"  . . It is easy to do it by regulating the conditions of life  without need of concentration camps or gas chambers.  In Russia,  in any event, for two years . . . the population has been  dropping, and this is a concrete example of how economic  "reforms" can regulate demographic processes. p.25     Our own "time of troubles" has obviously revealed the fact of a  crisis of Russian national consciousness.  The collapse of the  Soviet Union convincingly has shown that the denationalized  ideology of the "stagnation" period was not able to resist the  destructive, anti-state activities of Russia's enemies. . . . The  nationalist regimes of the periphery were able to form and  survive thanks to two factors: the betrayal by the ruling clique  of the interests of the Russian people and the apathy of a  significant part of the Russian majority, which found itself  indifferent to the fate of their own countrymen who were  "abroad." p. 29     "De-Russification" is being carried out by the current regime . .  . by the order of, and under the control of, world-wide "centers  of influence." p.29     I have studied documents of the State Department of the USA and  the CIA, which were directed toward the destruction of our  country and requested the Constitutional Court, where they [the  government] were trying to portray the CPSU as a criminal  organization, to publish them.  Let everyone know who is who and  what are their true plans. p.38     The experience of the last few years proves the lie of the idea  of division of powers . . . it is necessary to subordinate the  executive power to the legislative and liquidate the institution  of the presidency. p. 69     The executive authority has deprived itself of legitimacy, having  . . . violated the . . . Constitution . . . the results of the  [December] referendum have no legal force . . . a so called  opposition bloc, that of Shakray, is being formed for the purpose  of the formation of a dictatorship of the Anglo-American type. .  . . All of this, down to the last detail, was thought out and  considered for the purpose of deceiving the people. p.75     From "Appeal to the Citizens of Russia by the National Salvation  Front Organizing Committee" signed by Zyuganov, among others: We  are convinced that the tragedy that has befallen our country is  the result of a deliberate anti-people policy by the ruling  elite. . . . The foreign masters of our new rulers are going  around Russia telling us what to do and how to live (Sovetskaya  Rossiya, 1 October 1992).     Opposition Strategy     Why should we communists take part in the elections?  First of  all so that we, together with our people, who have been decieved  [by the Yeltsin regime], can try to take advantage of the small  possibility [opened for us by the elections] for liberating the  people from deception. p.75     In brief, this set of methods [used by the Yeltsin regime to  destroy the opposition] could be formulated as follows:  "DIVISION--CONFLICT--DEADLOCK--EXPLOSION--COLLAPSE."  The seed of  division is introduced. . . . The rival factions are artificially  polarized. . . . This is followed by political deadlock and then  a severe crisis, in the course . . . of which the "enemy"  political grouping is liquidated.     There is no future for the present anti-popular regime, however.  IF IT IS COMPELLED TO EXIST FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME UNDER THE  CONDITIONS OF PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT DEVELOPMENT AND LEGAL  STABILITY, IT WILL INEVITABLY BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE OPPOSITION.  The present "elite" can hold on to power only by intensifying the  dictatorship.  Increasingly new conflicts and social unrest are  needed as a pretext for this. p.63     (AUTHOR:  ALLENSWORTH.

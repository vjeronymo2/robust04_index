			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Canadian poll puts helicopter deal at risk A UK-Italian consortium and Canadian defence chiefs are preparing a last-ditch effort to dissuade leaders of Canada's Liberal party from cancelling a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.85bn) helicopter order after next Monday's general election. The Liberals look almost certain to win the election. Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader, has promised during the campaign that an incoming Liberal government's first acts would include cancelling the order for the 50 EH-101 helicopters, which was placed in mid-1992 by the present Progressive Conservative government. The main contractors for the helicopter are EH Industries, a joint venture between the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy, and Paramax, a Canadian company controlled by Unisys of the US. EH Industries will supply the basic aircraft, while on-board systems will be provided by Paramax. The Liberals and other opposition parties have attacked the helicopter order as an extravagance at a time of austerity. They also question the need in the post-Cold War era for an aircraft designed largely for anti-submarine work. The deal's supporters counter that the Canadian forces urgently need to replace their ageing fleet of Sea King and Labrador helicopters. In addition, the EH-101 order will bring substantial benefits to the Canadian economy, including an estimated 13,000 jobs and sizeable export orders. Contracts worth CDollars 225m have already been placed with 14 domestic companies. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, raised the helicopter order with Ms Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in July. But Ms Campbell announced at the start of election campaign that she would cut the order from 50 to 43 aircraft. The UK is expected to renew its expressions of concern once the new government takes office. However, the brunt of the post-election lobbying is likely to fall on the shoulders of local contractors and the Canadian defence department. Senior military officers 'will want to make sure Mr Chretien does not make any precipitous announcement before he has been briefed by the department,' one source said. They are expected to try to persuade him to include the helicopter deal in a wide-ranging defence policy review.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Arafat by correspondents Mohamed </F> Halloub and Nouara, in Algiers on 31 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Mr. President, welcome to Radio  Algiers.    ['Arafat] Thank you. I am very glad I can talk from this  radio and from this Algerian information rostrum which, I can  still remember, afforded me the first opportunity to give an  interview to EL MOUDJAHID before I was elected as chairman of  the PLO. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] In an interview we had with you two years  ago  in Tunis, we asked you about the future of the  Palestinian-Israeli talks, and your answer came in the form of a  disapproving question [as heard], so what has changed in your  stance?    ['Arafat] We now say (?yes), because what is happening now  is  based on the first recognition of the Palestinian people. In  the past, they wanted to recognize neither the Palestinian  people nor the PLO, the legitimate representative of the  Palestinian people. They wanted to give us autonomy, autonomy  [word repeated in English]. Full stop. Autonomy to the  inhabitants, not to the land.    But now, the decision is the withdrawal -- when we say Gaza  and Jericho first, this means the withdrawal of the Israeli Army  from the first Palestinian land, so that it becomes a  Palestinian liberated land and the Palestinian liberated flag is  hoisted over this free Palestinian land for the first time in  this century. Yes, we still have big problems facing us.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Mr. President, the Palestinian authority  will  be organizing elections. Do you expect participation by the  opposition, and do you expect victory in these elections?    ['Arafat] In reality, according to what was conveyed to me,  my brothers in the opposition -- I cherish this Palestinian  opposition [pauses] we are a democratic movement, a democratic  scene; as Voltaire said: I might disagree with you, but I am  prepared to fight for your freedom of opinion. Our  constitution, which we announced in Algiers, provides for the  majority to respect the view of the minority, and the minority  to follow the decision of the majority. The opposition have let  us know, in the talks we have had with them, that they will be  taking part in the coming elections. This is official. Bu at  the same time, we ask them to come and participate with us from  now, because this is the homeland of all, and let everybody  build. They should not leave us for ourselves now, and come  only when the food is cooked. I have the right to ask them to  start building now. Let us build together. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] You have mentioned in one of your statements  the issue of jihad, a word which aroused a strong reaction in  Israeli spheres. How will you deal with the conditions on  relinquishing the armed action?    ['Arafat] If people think that we are going for a leisurely  walk [words indistinct]. I know that we are not going for a  leisurely walk. You should know that every day we have a  problem. Are you following me? What could one say? Every day  we have a problem. Every day we have an issue over which we  disagree.    We know that we are not going for a leisurely walk. Did you  forget the first and second Evian treaties in Algeria? We have  the same story. [passage omitted]    There are secret organizations within the Israeli Armed  Forces which collaborate with the settlers, just like what  happened to you in Algeria. Our situation is similar to yours.    Yes, we do have problems, and those who think that we are  going for a leisurely walk, let them know that we are not. Is  this homeland not worth suffering for? We have paid the price  of peace with our blood. Our leaders have been assassinated.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Mr. President, the last question. The  subject of Jerusalem is one of the challenges facing the  negotiations in the future. How do you see this subject?    ['Arafat] [passage omitted] The Israeli ruler must  understand  one thing: That sacred Palestine, Arab Palestine was occupied  in 1967 and in accordance with Resolution 242, Jerusalem, Arab  Jerusalem, is part of the Arab and Palestinian territories which  were occupied in 1967.    The basis from which we have proceeded in Madrid, Oslo, and  Cairo is Resolutions 242 and 338, namely the lands which were  occupied in 1967 including holy Jerusalem, Arab Jerusalem. Even  the governments closest to them and their strategic ally the  United States of America did not accept the decision that Israel  should include Palestine's eternal capital. The capital of Arab  Palestine is the capital of the state of Palestine. The battle  is for it. We know that there are Israeli attempts to bring  about demographic change. I say to my brother Arabs, Muslims and  Christians: Jerusalem is not my Jerusalem, it is also your  Jerusalem. Thank you.</p>

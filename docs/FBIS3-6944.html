Ramos on Tuesday directed  Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr. to formally withdraw  from the Commission on Appointment the nomination of Tomas Gomez  III as consul-general to Los Angeles (L.A.), California. The  president issued the instruction after Gomez, former press  secretary of ex-President Corazon C. Aquino, asked him to  withdraw his nomination during a 30-minute meeting with the  president. Gomez said in a letter he gave to President Ramos,  and I [broadcaster] quote, the Commission on Appointments  developments concerning my going to Los Angeles have become  untenable and it appears that I may have become a liability to  you when the least I could do is not to add to the burden that  the president already has. It was evident that the foreign  affairs community is not at all bothered that its very own  constitutional process has been knowingly mocked and abused by a  witness who lied under solemn affirmation, unquote, or Gomez, at  the second statement, was referring to Dr. Carlos Manlapaz who  accused Gomez of making anti-Ilocano statements. The former  press secretary stressed he has not asked to be posted to Los  Angeles. It was Secretary Roberto Romulo's suggestion, the  foreign affairs secretary, that he accepted his posting which he  [Romulo] recommended to the president.</p>

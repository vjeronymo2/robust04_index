			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network  in Spanish at 1400 GMT on 8 January broadcasts a three-hour  panel discussion during the "Saturday Focus" program hosted by  Denis Vargas with the participation of President Alberto  Fujimori and panel members Richard Bauer, president of the  National Association of Foreign Correspondents; Arturo Salazar  Larrain and Ismael Leon from LA REPUBLICA; and Augusto Alvarez  Rodrich, chief editor of Apoyo Company publications.    Vargas begins the program by reminding the president that it  is traditional for the executive to give every new year a name.  Fujimori says he does not think the year should be given the  name of a historical figure but that it should reflect the  country's goals and objectives. He remarks: "I think that in  the short and medium term, our children must be better prepared;  therefore, education and sports are the main themes of the year.  Although this has not been approved by the Council of  Ministers, I would like to go ahead and call it the Year of  Education Modernization and Sports. We will continue this  campaign to modernize our education system and to sponsor  sports. For example, we will build coliseums and stadiums  nationwide"    Vargas goes on to say that because 1994 will be the year of  education modernization, it is understood that the main reforms  will be in that field. Vargas notes: "It has been said that the  directors of state schools will be rigorously evaluated. Those  who are good will remain, those who are not prepared will be  dismissed." President Fujimori responds that the evaluations do  not mean that the directors will have to take exams but that  they will have to show results. Fujimori comments that this  evaluation will give the directors stability for five years, but  appointments cannot be indefinite as if the directors were  judges. Fujimori notes that although the community will be in  charge of the school administration, that does not translate  into privatization of education because the state will continue  to provide funding.    Bauer asks when the first school will be turned over to  local  administration. Fujimori replies that the pilot plan will be  implemented in Arequipa, where a chain of eight schools have  already been built with 10 more to be completed. "The state  will not eliminate subsidies. On the contrary, it will increase  these subsidies." Fujimori adds that free education will now be  offered in modern buildings rather than in straw huts.    Changing the subject, Bauer asks President Fujimori for his  assessment of the continued violence following the arrest of  Abimael Guzman. Fujimori responds that it is a fact that the  level of violence has gone down. "Shining Path no longer has its  previous organizational capacity." Fujimori notes that there  are still some fanatics whom he intends to capture or eliminate.    Bauer asks if there is any truth to rumors that the  government is exporting repentant terrorists to other nations  with new identities. Fujimori laughs and responds: "Well,  concerning trade in terrorists, I would say that we have had  imports rather than exports from some developed nations, which  in turn have protected those people." Fujimori adds that there  have been more cases of repentant terrorist and that these have  been presented to the media.    Vargas asks if terrorist leaders will receive death  sentences  now that the new Constitution is in force. Fujimori answers  that such sentences must be in line with international treaties  and follow certain steps. "In the coming years, I do not think  it will be necessary to apply the death sentence because I am  sure we will achieve peace in the nation."    Commenting on human rights, President Fujimori insists that  it is necessary to defend the human rights not only of  terrorists but of civilians, the human and social rights Peru's  22 million inhabitants. He concludes that Peru is entitled to  live in peace, to give life sentences to terrorists, and to  correct its mistakes.    In response to a question from Augusto Alvarez concerning  the  scope of the concerted effort proposed by Democratic Constituent  Congress, CCD, President Jaime Yoshiyama, Fujimori says that  "consensus comes through proposals. Yoshiyama's proposal  purports to resolve the country's problems through truly  technical rather than political mechanisms or methodology."    Fujimori said the invitation extended by Engineer Yoshiyama  to various organizations has been very timely because those  organizations will be able to set forth proposals free of  partisan and ideological influence and will therefore be more  widely accepted by the people.    Having been put in contact with several Latin American  reporters via satellite, President Fujimori takes a question  from Eduardo Lozano of Colombia's Radio Cadena Nacional. Lozano  asks President Fujimori what qualities the Peruvian people see  in Colombian President Cesar Gaviria to make him worthy of being  OAS secretary general, to which Fujimori responds: "I have seen  President Cesar Gaviria in action at various international  forums, where he has proven himself to be a true statesman with  a spirit of integration. He has also displayed the ability to  analyze situations and make decisions, an attribute which I  believe is necessary for the secretaryship. Moreover, I am a  personal friend of President Gaviria, and he has Peru's total  support. We are among his promoters."    The topic of the interview changes when Elsy Barroeta from  Caracas Radio Caracas Television Network asks President Fujimori  about the presence in Peru of the Venezuelan coupist military  officers and the efforts made by the two governments to achieve  the officers' return to Venezuela. Fujimori responds that there  have been contacts at the Foreign Ministry level, but Venezuela  wants to prosecute these officers, so some of them are unwilling  to return under those conditions.    Barroeta then asks Fujimori what kind of relations he  expects between Peru and Venezuela after Rafael Caldera takes  office and what personal relations between he and Caldera will  be like. Fujimori says: "I do not have the slightest doubt that  we will continue to strengthen the ties between our two  countries and that we will continue working to make integration  a reality. I have already spoken personally with President  Caldera, he said, and I wish him the greatest success in office  so Venezuela can progress."    Jorge Melo of Radio Quito then asks president Fujimori  whether the visit Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen will  make to Peru is official and if the border conflict will be  included in the agenda. Fujimori responds: "Of course his  visit is official, as was my first visit to Quito, of which I  have very fond memories. Every time someone mentions Quito to  me, I become emotional. However, this visit is to strengthen the  friendship between our two countries. Instead of discussing  border conflicts, we will discuss integration as we did during  my first visit to Ecuador in January 1992."    Program host Dennis Vargas then brings up the issue of  expectation among Latin Americans, especially in the Andean  region, concerning Peru's exact position on integration and the  Cartagena Agreement. Why has Peru decided to distance itself  from integration until March or April?    Fujimori responds with two reasons, the first of which is  tariffs. Peru, he says, has a flat [previous word in English]  15-percent tariff on consumer or capital goods, while other  countries' tariffs vary from 0 to 30 percent, which undermines  Peru's competitiveness. The other reason is subsidies, which  have been eliminated in Peru.    Vargas insists on the issue, saying that integration is  happening through blocs and that Peru is absent from Latin  America's first integration bloc, the Cartagena Agreement. He  asks President Fujimori: Do you agree with people who say it is  impossible to enter the big NAFTA market without being in a  group, which even the U.S. Government has admitted? What policy  will Peru adopt on NAFTA?    President Fujimori answers that at some point Peru will have  to rejoin the Cartagena Agreement. He says that for the past  three years the country has developed very rapidly in order to  be able to join other markets by creating competition through  the reduction of protectionist measures. We are working,  Fujimori said, for an open economy, which is essential if we are  to join any free market.    The host concludes Peru's participation in the satellite  linkup with a question concerning the struggle against drug  trafficking in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia. He asks President  Fujimori what Peru's strategy will be with the new  administration in the United States, which consumes almost 80  percent of the drugs produced worldwide, to which Fujimori  responds: "I think we must continue communicating on realistic  terms, which is what the Peruvian Government has always done,  and we must acknowledge that the previous strategy did not work,  that it was a true failure, and that effective measures must be  adopted before it is too late." Fujimori goes on to explain  that Peru produces coca, not heroin, and that the government  will implement very drastic measures whereby penal and civil  sanctions will be imposed on individuals who produce poppies.  These measures will include the seizure of properties and  prison sentences, and there will be no lenience whatsoever.    Dennis Vargas Marin asks President Fujimori to comment on  the situation in Chiapas State, Mexico and whether he believes  there is any connection between the Zapatista National  Liberation Army, EZLN, and the Shinning Path or other guerrilla  groups. Fujimori then says he hopes there is no ideological  relationship between the EZLN rebels and terrorist groups, even  though it is known that some Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement  terrorists have gone to Mexico.    Fujimori says he thinks the Chiapas affair is "a rebellion  in  a poor area headed by -- I suppose -- leftist intellectuals,  socialists, who mean to say: You see, the market system does  not work. It is something like that. However, I do not believe  a rebellion like the one in Chiapas State has the  characteristics of a terrorist movement."    Augusto Alvarez Rodrich then asks President Fujimori about  the lessons learned from the referendum on the constitutional  reforms. Fujimori answers that he has received a message. The  message is that the people are not against the reform but that  they want adjustments to those reforms.    Alvarez then asks the president if he believes the  referendum  results mean that he no longer represents the spirit of renewal  that the people want. Fujimori replies that there has indeed  been a rebellion of the citizenry and society at the ballot  boxes, but that he "still represents the rebellion against the  political system that has taken place here in Peru." He adds  that the desire for renewal continues, but that the government  has not been weakened. He states: "It had been said that the  honeymoon was only going to last nine months or a year.  Instead, there is popular support. All modesty aside, I think  I continue to represent this need for change in the country."    Alvarez asks whether the visits to the departments and  provinces are part of a strategy to drum up support after the  referendum. Fujimori answers that it is only a continuation of  his original policy and that he is trying to provide the people  with more information on educational and government programs "to  disprove the disinformation that the government is privatizing  education, eliminating free schooling, and taking land away from  the peasants."    In response to several short comments and questions from  Alvarez, Fujimori compares the country's situation in 1992 to  that in 1993 and points out the improvements and advances in the  economy, the pacification process, and the privatization  process. Regarding the privatization process, he says that  State enterprises are now worth 10 times more than what they  were worth in 1992.    Arturo Salazar Larrain asks whether the situation for  Peruvians will improve and if people's budgets are in the red  even though the fiscal year has ended with a positive balance.  He says that taxes are going up while salaries have stagnated.  Salazar adds that it is not fair that the budget for defense is  five times greater than the health budget.    Fujimori responds by saying that taxes for the poor have  gone  down. He says that except for one socioeconomic level, everyone  is paying a little less. The president cites the elimination of  the tax on business assets and says he hopes this measure will  bolster economic reactivation. He then adds that the government  has also eliminated the minimum income tax.    Salazar says the national budget increased enormously  between  1991 and 1993. It was $3.617 billion in 1991, $4.885 billion in  1992, to $5.434 billion in 1993. He then asks: How are those  resources distributed and where do they come from?    President Fujimori answers: "Right now they are coming from  people who pay high taxes, and that is precisely what allows us  to provide greater social attention. I agree with you that  fiscal funds are in the black and the majority of people's  pockets are in the red. But that is the part we are still  inheriting. We are fixing many things. I ask: Is there an  alternative? I wish the economists would give me alternatives.  Tell me there was a better alternative to the dealings with the  Paris Club. If they would give me the numbers, I could debate  it even though I am not an economist. Things are being handled  very seriously. Our country was in a crisis with  hyperinflation, but we are overcoming the situation."    Regarding a comment from Salazar on the difference between  the budgets for health and defense, Fujimori goes on to outline  the changes in the military budget that will be in accordance  with the advances in the pacification, saying that the number of  troops and policemen will not be increased.    Ismael Leon tries to pin Fujimori down on the poor  referendum results by suggesting that he, Fujimori, should not  try to explain it by saying that "50 percent of the people have  been deceived." Leon says the president should look at it from  a different point of view: "There is unemployment, health care  problems, school truancy, and in many ways, there is less  democracy." Leon says that when Fujimori speaks of "taking  resources to the regions," he is speaking in paternalistic  terms. Leon asks what has been done with the funds earned from  the sale of public enterprises. He says he has a letter from  Constituent Assemblyman Dr. Antero Flores Araoz, who was unable  to obtain that information from the government.    Fujimori asks Dennis Vargas for a 30-minute program to  debate  each of Leon's points, then he reminds Alvarez of the fact that  the media is respected and allowed full freedom. In reply to  Leon, Fujimori says that in many provinces he visited, there  were widespread misconceptions about what the referendum really  meant, including the belief that capital punishment would bring  about a bloodbath. The president justifies taking resources to  the area and used improvements to the Cuzco airport as an  example. He says that a Korean credit has allowed eight  tourists flights a day. "Public enterprises have been sold  under the best conditions, and I challenge anyone to identify  one that has not been properly sold." Fujimori tells Leon to  examine the public budget to see where the money has gone. He  says: "Look at the social expenditures, go to the poor  neighborhoods where the privatization funds have been invested."  He adds that there is a list specifying how the funds have been  invested.    Alvarez goes directly to the point and asks: "Why not admit  there is a problem. I do not think the funds are being  improperly used." He says that if Fujimori gave a better  explanation of how the funds were used, there would be greater  acceptance.    Fujimori answers by saying that he is surprised that an  economist of Alvarez' stature is apparently unaware that all  revenues go into a common treasury fund, thus individual  government projects cannot be attributed to specific sales of  government enterprises.    Ismael Leon asks Fujimori what made him change his mind,  albeit for the better, on such things as his initial refusal to  privatize certain basic public services, including ports, postal  services, and telecommunications. Fujimori half jokingly refers  to a book called CITIZEN FUJIMORI [Ciudadano Fujimori], which  describes him as pragmatic. He admits that he rejected such  privatization on 3 June 1990, and by 6 July 1992 he had changed  his mind. Fujimori recalls saying that "public enterprises do  not work -- probably on Radio Programas -- and that they have  incurred a $2.5 billion deficit" despite the fact that "every  possible effort was made to prop them up." He adds: "We are  looking for democracy. People want privatization, thus the  change. We need not be stubborn."    Replying to Ismael Leon's question on telecommunication  monopolies, Fujimori says that this is sometimes unavoidable in  communications and electric enterprises and adds that the  telephone system should serve not only Lima and the surrounding  area but the entire country. Fujimori adds: "I know that Mr.  Genaro Delgado Parker has interests in communications systems,  but I do not defend anyone's interest. I want things to be  clear." The topic continues with a discussion about the lack of  telephone lines, with Lima alone requiring 160,000 new lines and  needing large investments. Fujimori adds: "We have 2.6  telephones for every 100 inhabitants. Do you know how we rank  among Latin American countries? Next to the last; the last  country is Haiti." Fujimori suggests to Dennis Vargas that a  technical debate be held on this topic alone.    The topic then shifts when Vargas asks Fujimori if there  will  be a reduction in the Army and if the Army Technical School will  close. Fujimori denies that the school will be closed and says  defense and education expenditures will remain the same with no  reductions except "a minimum reduction in recruitment."  Fujimori says there will be training changes for the new  recruits and uses the "example that those learning to operate  tanks will now know how to operate heavy equipment. Those who  drive trucks will leave the service with a certificate for  commercial trucks." Fujimori explains that the new Armed Forces  for peace should become "a great professional technical training  center in addition to instilling patriotism, order, and  discipline in many youths who need it." Fujimori adds that he  "does not intend to purchase Mirage fighter jets, tanks, or  missiles. It is a reduction and rationalization of  expenditures."    Fujimori explains that expenditures are being cut and made  more economical. He notes that Peru "has approximately 100,000  policemen. That is enough. Better yet, it is too many for  Peru." The president reports that there will be no more police  recruiting.    A panelist asks Fujimori about unjustified arrests, and he  replies that government attorneys are investigating such cases  but that everyone must be patient. He admits: "There are some  cases that have yet to be corrected, but sometimes mistakes are  made in the struggle against terrorism. I ask you: What  country has not make any mistakes? Tell me if no mistakes were  made in Vietnam, Algeria, and in many other places." He states:  "We cannot let isolated cases make us forget the situation that  existed in Peru." Referring to the remodeled Castro Castro  Prison, Fujimori says it looks like a five-star hotel: "We are  enforcing respect for human rights as much as we can."    Asked about communications with Abimael Guzman, Fujimori  explains: "Contacts continue. Of course in recent days we have  said that there have been attacks and that there should be some  control mechanisms. Otherwise the entire process could lead to  stagnation. I hope we are successful."    One panelist asks Fujimori why he shook hands with Cox  Beuzeville and not the other alleged criminals. The Peruvian  president explains: "I cannot shake hands with 3,000  terrorists. I greeted him because we happened to meet, and  courtesy is always foremost. In the case of Guzman's letter,  there have been notable effects. The desertions in Sol de Oro,  Ayacucho, occurred because of the information about the  surrender of Abimael Guzman. There have been mass desertions  like never before. In the past, only one or two isolated  Shining Path members deserted. There were always many  desertions from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, but the  Shining Path desertions began with these letters."    Fujimori later explains that he is president of all  Peruvians  and is therefore uninterested in party organizations. "Parties  have not worked out in many Latin American countries, and that  is why democracy is being questioned and why some want more  Chinese [Fujimori calls himself El Chino, the Chinese] in Latin  American countries."    A panelist asks: "How can a president feel safe without a  political party supporting him. Do you only trust the people  and the Army?"    Fujimori explains: "I feel safe with results, with the  support of the common people, but I defend myself from power  groups that try to undermine my position. Democracy is built  with the people, by supporting the people. Democracy is not  edible. Please visit Pamplona and ask the people there about  democracy.    Alvarez tells Fujimori that he is going to close the  interview with a personal question. He tells Fujimori that he  was aggressive throughout the interview and that he has aged.  Alvarez then asks: "How have these four years changed you?  Tell me!"    Fujimori laughs and retorts: "I will answer you. I said  earlier that old people are meeting here. If you look at  yourself in the mirror, you will find that you also have changed  in the past three years, Alvarez, and your criticism has failed  quite often. I regret that I was aggressive. I had not  realized that. I wanted to engage in a specific debate. When  somebody tells me that things are not functioning in the Armed  Forces -- I suppose this is where I am aggressive -- I could  jump all the way to the roof. If there had not been a  television camera here, I could have pounded on...[pauses] not  on Dennis but on the table!"    Vargas closes the interview by asking: "When will you begin  your 1995 campaign, Mr. President, and how long before then do  you plan to resign from the presidency so Congress President  Jaime Yoshiyama can replace you in the government palace?"    Fujimori responds: "I don't know. I haven't thought about  it. I don't have an answer now. Invite me to another program."</p>

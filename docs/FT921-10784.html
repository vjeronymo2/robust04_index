			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Abbey National sets up share service Abbey National, the retail banking group, is setting up its own retail stockbroking and share registration services. The operation, which will be based at Sheffield, marks a departure by Abbey National from its traditional core business areas. The share registration services will be introduced in the late summer of 1993 when Taurus, the electronic share record system, is introduced by the Stock Exchange. Its introduction will bring to an end Abbey National's link with Lloyds Bank registrars which at present looks after the certification of its 3.5m shareholders. The bank will phase out its existing business with Sharelink by the end of the year. Mr Geoffrey Osbaldeston, commercial services director, said that the share dealing service would operate by post and on an execution-only basis. Abbey National branches will not handle the share dealing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 26 April (AFP-NA) -- Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo today revealed that Washington is getting ready  to put Argentina on the list of nations that could be subject to  commercial sanctions. Cavallo said, however, that if the United  States goes ahead with the threat the country will appeal at  GATT and defeat the measure.    "The matter of threats with sanctions is irrelevant to us,"  Cavallo said in a news conference at the end of his meeting with  U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor and other economic  cabinet officials.    Kantor "told me that it is practically decided to  incorporate  Argentina on the list of countries" on a list of priorities for  sanctions in a maximum period of 18 months. The sanctions would  be due to commercial practices unacceptable to the United  States, Cavallo said.    The minister stressed, however, that once the U.S. and  Argentine Congresses ratify the Uruguay Round of GATT agreements  signed in Morocco on 15 April, "no single party will be able to  impose sanctions against another party as long as the other  party fulfills its obligations under the chapter on TRIPS  (intellectual rights' protection)."    If the United States applies sanctions, "we will ask (GATT)  to appoint an investigation commission and we will win the  case," the minister insisted.    The conflict revolves around Argentina's lack of respect for  U.S. pharmaceutical rights.    Cavallo said a draft bill on patents protection similar to  the bill approved by Mexico in 1991, which was widely approved  by the international community, currently is being discussed by  the Argentine Congress.    He stressed, however, that "Argentina's decision to grant  patent protection to pharmaceutical products will not be adopted  under pressure or according to the list on which we are  included," but "to make sure that Argentina will be a country  where research for new pharmaceutical products and strong  investments are possible."    Cavallo told Kantor that the threats, "instead of helping  the  approval of a patents law in Argentina, will create more  resistance."    The minister also met President Bill Clinton's assistant for  economic policy, Robert Rubin; Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown;  and Laura Tyson, Council of Economic Advisers chairman.    The minister said he "found a very good climate for  everything" in the four meetings he held with these officials  today. Earlier he had participated in IMF and World Bank  meetings.    "I am very satisfied," Cavallo stressed.    The minister said that during his meetings with the U.S.  officials he proposed that the December hemispheric summit in  Miami "issue a communique declaring the American continent a  zone free of agriculture subsidies."    Argentina would consider it "very encouraging if the  presidents of the hemisphere agree not to permit the entry of  subsidized agricultural products into the continent (...) and  that our countries will not subsidize the sale of their  agricultural products to other countries in the continent."    The four U.S. officials told him that the initiative was  "worth analyzing and studying."    The Argentine minister said his country was not taking any  steps to be placed on the list of countries eligible to join  NAFTA that is being prepared by the United States. Cavallo  added, however, that he would be "surprised" if Argentina and  Chile were not the first two nations in the list.    The list of countries liable to suffering sanctions as well  as the list of countries eligible to join NAFTA are "too  unilateral for our liking," Cavallo said. "This thing about  lists is a U.S. problem," Cavallo added.</p>

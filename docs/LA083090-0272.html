			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Theatre Work -- Because of erroneous information provided by the Latino Theatre  Lab, Nuestro Tiempo reported in its July issue that the drama work "August 29"  was written by Violeta Calles. In fact, Calles is a ficticious name. The work  was written as a collaborative project of the Latino Theater Lab of Los Angeles  Theatre Center.  </P></p>

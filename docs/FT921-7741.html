			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: Northrop advances at operating level NORTHROP, the US defence contractor which is heavily dependant on the B-2 Stealth bomber programme, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 200.8m for 1991 - a little lower than the Dollars 210.4m seen in the previous year. However, comparisons between the two years are slightly misleading. The 1990 figure included a Dollars 67.1m after-tax gain from the sale of the company's headquarters complex, while the 1991 results are depressed by about Dollars 4m by accounting changes. At the operating profit level, Los Angeles-based Northrop reported Dollars 474.2m, compared with Dollars 346.8m in the previous 12 months. The company said profits were higher in the aircraft and the missiles and unmanned vehicle systems divisions, but fell in the electronics business segment, where the cost of settling legal and product disputes impinged. Overall, sales for the year reached Dollars 5.69bn, up by 3.7 per cent on 1990. In the fourth quarter alone, net profits improved from Dollars 42.7m to Dollars 158.5m, with sales totalling Dollars 1.57bn (Dollars 1.52bn). Northrop shares rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 7/8 yesterday.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Maastricht -forget the treaty, enjoy the fair - Susan Moore previews an event which, in only five years, has surged to the forefront of the international fine art calendar IN JUST FIVE years, the European Fine Art Fair at Maastricht, Holland, can claim to have established itself as the one truly international art and antiques fair. Unlike the far more glamorous Paris Biennale, London's Grosvenor House or Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, it is not a national fair that simply invites foreign exhibitors. Neither is it predominantly a 'floor' or 'wall' event. Maastricht - which opens this year on Saturday, March 13 - has flourished on the department store principle of shops within shops. Its fairs within the fair have always placed equal emphasis on paintings, works of art and textiles. It is a formula that seems to have worked. In 1989, the fair attracted 106 exhibitors (60 non-Dutch) and 17,000 visitors; by 1992, there were 144 exhibitors (93 non-Dutch) and the number of visitors had doubled to 35,500. Maastricht's unlikely rise to pre-eminence - its roots lay in two small provincial and biennial picture and antiques fairs which merged in 1985 and re-launched three years later - is explained partly by its now-famous location in an affluent and easily-accessible corner of Europe. The relatively low costs of exhibiting at the functional (although camouflaged generously with flowers) Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Centre has alsocontinued to attract the trade: few dealers could afford to show three-score pictures or a dozen wall-size tapestries anywhere else. Perhaps the fair's greatest strength, however, is its restlessness. Over the years, the formula has been honed endlessly by the 21 international dealers who make up the board of trustees. There have been experiments with Orangerie-style displays, exhibitions, lecture and concert programmes and, most importantly, with a variety of new dealers and sections which have either become fixtures or been dropped. The fair is not allowed to rest on its laurels, and neither are the exhibitors. There are more refinements and innovations this year - and even more drastic ones planned for next. Last year saw the introduction of La Haute Joallerie du Monde, and the jewellery boys are back. (Harry Winston follows his 1992 conversation-piece pair of ruby slippers, a la Wizard of Oz, with the world's largest green diamond planted in a Garouda brooch). The somewhat disappointing gravura section has been expanded to include books, prints and maps, and the 20th century section is hoping to see a much-needed improvement with the participation of London's Waddington Galleries, which shows Picasso, and Amsterdam's Gallery Delaive, which brings Karel Appel and Niki de St Phalle. The major addition this month is an antiquities section. Board member Ben Janssens explains: 'Last year, two very good antiquities dealers came and, in terms of publicity, were extremely successful. We felt it was an area that should be encouraged.' Exhibitors include HAC Kunst der Antike, the Royal-Athena Galleries, Galerie Samarcande, Tradart, Kunsthandel M. Zilverberg, and the Chinese antiquities dealer Gisele Croes, who is exhibiting at Maastricht rather than the Salon de Mars. There are some 25 new faces among the 160 exhibitors this year including Partridge of London, Moatti of Paris, and Albrecht Neuhaus of Wurtzburg. Some broaden the range of the fair still further. From Vienna, for instance, comes glass dealer Michael Kovacek, bringing with him a fine, early-16th century stemmed bowl emblazoned with the Medici arms. London-based Ermitage specialises in Faberge and Russian works of art. Its managing director, Alexander von Solodkoff, says: 'Maastricht seems to be the one truly international fair, and our clients are international. Paris is for la grande decoration, much less for objets d'art.' Inevitably, there are many familiar faces among the exhibits themselves - but they are not necessary any the worse for that. Heide Hubner, for instance, brings an impressive panoramic river landscape by Phillips de Koninck, from the Mountbatten collection and sold recently at Sotheby's; its price tag is Pounds 900,000. Moatti offers the luminous and sensitive 'Portrait of a boy in a Persian costume' by Rembrandt's pupil, Jan Lievens. Do not leave without taking a look at Neuhaus's outstanding silver and silver-gilt table fountain by the Augsburg goldsmith, Melchior Gelb I. Recent discoveries have also been held back especially for Maastricht. SJ Phillips repatriates a silver-gilt cup dated 1691 that probably can claim to be the masterpiece of Willem Zeestra. The Royal-Athena Galleries introduce an unpublished Roman bronze of Ares disarmed and overcome by love, a composition known previously only in paintings and mosaics. It is only 4 in high. Moatti presents a recently-discovered further fragment of Rubens' celebrated altarpiece of the Gonzaga family in adoration of the Trinity: a portrait of the young Prince Francesco Gonzaga. Happily for Johnny Van Haeften, his sumptuous Willem van Aelst still life of dead game, illustrated in the handbook, has turned into tombstone advertising. He says the mood among exhibitors is 'cautiously optimistic.' For Klaus Hubner, Maastricht has become 'the most important Old Master field world-wide - there is nothing comparable.' Certainly, there is little serious competition for the title now that London's distinguished Burlington House Fair has been subsumed into Grosvenor House. Despite spirited efforts by the likes of Colnaghi (not exhibiting this year) to bring Italian Old Masters to cut a swathe through the ubiquitous Dutch and Flemish flower pieces, landscapes and 19th century townscapes, Maastricht remains predominantly a northern fair. Those in search of southern bravura this year should turn to the Luca Giordano Nativity belonging to a new Spanish exhibitor, Concha Barrios, and the Melendez still-life chez Charles Roelofsz. The one section that sees little change at Maastricht is textura. For five years, its small and exclusive band of dealers has offered the finest carpets and textiles to be found anywhere on the market. Next year will see standards tightening even further as Maastricht is pulled back into more manageable and rational shape. For years, the only major complaint about this marathon of a fair has been its epic and ever-increasing scale and labyrinthine floor plan. This year, however, you are still advised to bring walking shoes and compass. The European Fine Art Fair shows at the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Centre from March 13-21; weekdays 11 am-8 pm, weekends 11-6. Tickets for the private view, fair and catalogue, and information on Sabena World Airlines' 50 per cent discount on all first and business-class flights for visitors, are available from TEFAF. Tel.

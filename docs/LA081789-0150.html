			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS TAKE ISSUE WITH FREEWAY LINK AS A SOLUTION  </P> <P> South Pasadena Mayor Pro Tem Evelyn Fierro's letter in The Times (Aug. 3) needs  to be questioned because of some facts and figures she presented. Fierro  stated: "The completion of the 710 Freeway will not . . . substantially relieve  any traffic problems."  </P> <P> Recent transportation studies indicate the 710 will operate with "severe  congestion" the day it is completed. Current estimates put the number of cars  at 180,000 per day. Taking 180,000 cars a day off other transportation arteries  and onto the freeway should be viewed as a substantial reduction for people  affected by the freeway runoff at the two 710 stubs. Traffic on Fremont Avenue  will be reduced more than 50%.  </P> <P> Fierro continues: "Caltrans will tell you the cost is $425 million . . . . It's  basing its numbers on ancient history." Researching "ancient history" produced  the following information:  </P> <P> * A Caltrans environmental impact statement (circa 1976) estimated the total  cost for an eight-lane freeway at $145.5 to $223.4 million.  </P> <P> * A Caltrans second draft (environmental impact statement) (circa 1983) had  increased the cost almost 100% to $442.6 million.  </P> <P> * Three years later (1986) the third draft (environmental impact statement)  came out and predicted the total cost for completing the 710 would be $425.5  million, a $17.1-million reduction from the 1983 estimate. Could this be  possible?  </P> <P> Over the past year real estate values in South Pasadena have increased 41%. The  cost for right-of-way purchases should reflect this increase.  </P> <P> In my opinion, both South Pasadena and Caltrans have been engaged in a  prolonged propaganda war at the public's expense. To paraphrase "Dragnet's"  Sgt. Joe Friday, both entities should "just give us the facts!"  </P> <P> ROBERT O. COOK  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

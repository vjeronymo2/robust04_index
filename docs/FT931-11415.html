			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Russians at loss on bankruptcy RUSSIAN legislators and officials said yesterday there would be problems in implementing a long-awaited bankruptcy law, due to go into effect on March 1, because of gaps in related regulations and a shortage of qualified staff, writes Leyla Boulton. Mr Alexei Manannikov, a member of the parliament's economic reform committee, said for instance the government's postponement of a decision on indexing enterprises' fixed capital to keep up with inflation would leave the door open to fraudulent bankruptcies. Although arbitration court judges were being trained to handle bankruptcy procedures, an economics ministry official said a lack of qualified staff remained another serious problem. Mr Manannikov said he believed that galloping inflation would discourage creditors, who may have to wait up to two and half years for the completion of bankruptcy proceedings, from retrieving money owed to them, except if the debts were denominated in hard currency.</p>

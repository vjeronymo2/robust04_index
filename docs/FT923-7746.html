			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Food: Smoke over the Irish sea - The varying quality of cured salmon DINISH ISLAND is a few miles off the coast of Kerry; not far from those grim Skellig Rocks where Irish monks kept European civilisation warm during the most sombre moments of the Dark Ages. Our lifeboat had come to a halt some 100 yards from the Irish shore and we had transferred to a dinghy for the rest of the journey. The boat went aground on the soft, yellow sand of the island, leaving a yard or so of water to cross. Those women in the party who were not wearing stockings were able to remove their shoes and wade ashore; with varying degrees of success, the men leapt. Once settled on land we were able to look back at the magnificent Kerry coastline. Around us grazed a few untended sheep and a great many uninhibited snails. But we had not come for the snails. Just off Dinish Island is one of Ireland's larger salmon farms owned by Salmara Fisheries. Here in the warm, Gulf Stream waters of southern Ireland salmon grow to maturity rather more quickly than they do in Scotland or Shetland: a minute smoult will achieve a saleable weight of 3.5 kilos in just under 14 months. These waters are also some of the least polluted in Europe. As with the better farms on Shetland the salmon live far out to sea and inhabit spacious pens to give them a semblance of life before death. Irish salmon is far less well known in Britain than its Scottish equivalent. Exports go chiefly to France, America, Germany and Spain. This must be, to some extent, a result of an inbuilt prejudice on the part of the British consumer as the fish can be quite magnificent. I well remember my own first experience of Irish smoked salmon in the Champagne Bar at the Curragh race-course. At the time I thought it was the best I had ever eaten. The Curragh salmon was probably a wild fish. I recall its irregular texture and the presence of the occasional blood clot. Both these factors now count as faults in salmon. Idiosyncratic patterns in the flesh relegate the fish to the pate manufacturers; the fish are systematically bled, although most knowledgable people in the restaurant business admit that the blood contributed massively to the flavour. Pretty patterned flesh is not the sole prejudice which currently gnaws at the quality of smoked salmon. The need to produce a pretty pink colour determines the feed of the fish on the farms. Yet, as Remi Benoit (a French man who owns a smokery near Kenmare) points out, possibly the best smoked salmon was an ivory white fish from Denmark. The lack of pigment came from the absence of krill in the Baltic. I have eaten similarly white, but distinctly oily, smoked salmon in Poland, the oil marking it down as a farmed fish. Before the days of refrigeration not only was the fish wild, but the cure was much heavier to prevent the fish from going off. In our own days we have seen the removal of this crust, and the trend towards less smoke and salt. With this modern cure we now experience far more of the flavour of the fish. Smoked salmon has long since ceased to be a luxury food, and this is very largely as a result of the mad enthusiasm to create fish farms which has affected all the more remote corners of the British Isles. Many of these I feel will come to grief: the prices for salmon are now at rock bottom, with the margins all being made by the middle men. Stylistic uniformity is also a problem: one is beginning to regret the passing of the old fashioned cures which used to abound in certain places, notably in the East End of London. One highly individual salmon I experienced recently was introduced to me by my sister. The fish comes from North Uist where it is smoked over a good deal of peat by George and Rosemary Jackson. The result has the pungency of a bonfire and I recommend that you eat it with a good, peaty Islay malt whisky: Lavagulin would be the best. For anyone whose palate has become saturated with smoked salmon over the last couple of months, a good alternative is smoked sevruga sturgeon. The flesh of the sturgeon is very dense and meaty, and lacks the slightly sickly oiliness of so much farmed salmon. The London restaurant Bibendum, both in its downstairs fish bar and upstairs in the restaurant, is promoting smoked sevruga sturgeon accompanied by a portion of sevruga caviar and a glass of champagne. As a light lunch it sounds like civilisation itself. Information: For Irish salmon contact the Irish Sea Fisheries Board, tel: (010-353-1) 284-1544, fax: 284-1123.

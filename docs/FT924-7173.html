			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Indian brokers in strike over fees INDIAN stockbrokers yesterday staged a strike in protest at the introduction of hefty registration fees, bringing trading on the country's exchanges to a halt. The strike will do nothing to restore investors' confidence in the market, which has suffered this year from the Rs35bn (Pounds 812m) Bombay securities market scandal. Furthermore, it will aggravate the danger of defaults among investors and brokers since a rapid fall in share prices in recent weeks has strained finances. The Bombay stock exchange (BSE) index has fallen by more than a fifth in the past month. It was not clear last night which exchanges would open today. Brokers were expressing their anger at the actions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the newly established industry watchdog. The watchdog has proposed charging a registration fee of Rs5,000 plus a turnover fee of 0.01 per cent of turnover. This has angered brokers because the revenues they raise from trading varies greatly between different kinds of business, such as own account trading and client account trading. Mr Ajit Day, president of the Calcutta Stock Exchange, said the proposed fees were 'ridiculous'. Earlier this year brokers staged a two-week strike when the watchdog first introduced the principle of registration. But the authorities eventually got their way. This time, too, the brokers' protests could well fail since many firms would be unable to sustain a long suspension of trading. The president and vice president of the Bombay stock exchange will meet Mr G V Ramakrishna, chairman of Sebi, this morning ahead of a general meeting of the brokers at the exchange. The strike coincides with a the arrest of a leading Calcutta stockbroker on allegations of fraud in the latest twist in a payments crisis which has paralysed trading for a week. The exchange was closed after brokers noticed forged documents being passed in settlement transactions. The market was re-opened partially yesterday. Mr Day said about eight of the exchange's 630 members had serious problems settling claims totalling about Rs150m-Rs170m. Mr Day, who represents the fifth generation of his family in stockbroking, regretted the fact that the crisis had blown up after Calcutta had avoided any involvement in the scandal which this year hit the Bombay market. He named the broker as Mr Dilip Dugar, head of a firm called Bajrang Lal Mahabir Prasad.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Award to Name reduced by half A High Court judge yesterday reduced sharply the damages awarded to a member of the Lloyd's of London insurance market who successfully sued his members' agent, Andrew Jack writes. In an unprecedented decision in April Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled that a members' agent was liable for the losses incurred on syndicates to which it allocated two Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. Yesterday Mr Gatehouse issued a revised judgment cutting by about half the damages to be awarded to the richer of the two Names, Mr Richard Brown. His decision followed a technical re-calculation of the way in which Mr Brown's underwriting was allocated to higher risk insurance syndicates. The award will now be calculated pro rata based on his allocation to particular syndicates in each year of underwriting. The award may still be under threat because Elborne Mitchell, solicitors for KMR Services, formerly H G Poland, the members' agent being sued, is believed to be considering an appeal. The amendment does not affect the award to Mr Michael Sword-Daniels, the dentist who brought the case with Mr Brown. It is unclear, however, how much money will be received by either of the two Names because KMR went into liquidation last month following claims arising from the original court award. The liquidator said yesterday KMR had cash of Pounds 120,000, compared with claims so far from creditors of Pounds 825,000, including Pounds 130,000 from Mr Sword-Daniels and Pounds 333,000 from Mr Brown.</p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (2): Foundations laid for stability - The economy / new incentives are offered to foreign investors At a faster pace than seemed possible a year ago, the government of Ms Benazir Bhutto has pulled Pakistan out of a foreign exchange crisis and laid the foundations for economic stability. Ms Bhutto has also given a new impetus to efforts to attract foreign investment by offering extra incentives and further liberalising an economy that was already among the most open in the developing world. Overseas companies have responded by pouring funds into the stock market and pledging to increase direct investment, notably in power generation, to which the government attaches the highest priority. Yet, as Pakistani and foreign businessmen are united in telling the government, all this progress in the economy could still be wasted unless Pakistan also tackles its non-economic problems - above all the crime and violence in Karachi. As Mr Nisar Memon, general manager of the Pakistani operations of IBM, the US computer maker, and president of the Overseas Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says: 'The number one priority is the law and order situation.' The economic turnaround dates back to the caretaker government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former World Bank economist, who led the country for three months last year between the fall of Mr Nawaz Sharif and Ms Bhutto's election victory. But the new government deserves credit for persevering with his tough curbs on public spending, bank lending and foreign exchange outflows. Since the summer of 1993, the budget deficit has been cut from over 8 per cent of GDP in the year to June 1993 to 5.8 per cent in 1993-94. The target for 1994-95 is just 4 per cent. The expansion of domestic credit has dropped from 24 per cent in 1992-93 to 9.3 per cent last year. Imports, which jumped 12 per cent in 1992-93, fell almost 15 per cent last year. Foreign exchange reserves have risen from a low of Dollars 300m to a record USDollars 3bn. Inflation has fallen but is still to be brought under control. Prices have been pushed up by increases in power charges and other administered prices and by the influx of foreign exchange which has expanded the domestic money supply. However, the government's short-term economic management has been so good that it has brought plaudits from international observers including the International Monetary Fund. The squeeze on credit, imports and public spending has contributed to a slow down in economic growth. GDP rose only 4 per cent last year after 2.3 per cent the year before - down from 7.7 per cent in 1991-92. However, the government, which is now easing credit restraints, is forecasting a sharp increase to 6.9 per cent in 1994-95. Much depends on agriculture, especially the cotton crop, which determines the commercial health not just of cotton farming but of textiles production, Pakistan's biggest industry and largest contributor to exports. As Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's adviser on financer, says: 'As far as growth is concerned, the key question is the cotton crop.' The drought and disease which have hit cotton in the past two years have been the principal reason for slow economic growth. This year, the government is planning for a recovery in cotton production from 7.6m bales to 9.5m. Some cotton farmers have said the lingering effects of drought and disease will hold back output, but no-one can be certain until the harvest reaches its peak in January. The finance ministry estimates that each 1.5m bales of cotton output is the equivalent of 1 per cent of GDP. Given the uncertainties, some economists doubt whether growth will be as fast as the government plans. They believe 5-6 per cent GDP growth is a more reasonable target. There is also concern about the state of business confidence. Power shortages and the disturbances in Karachi have hit industrial output, which has grown at an average of just 5.5 per cent in the past two years. Karachi bankers say that local businessmen are noticeably less enthusiastic about prospects than foreign companies. One reason is that domestic companies are more involved than overseas groups and their Pakistani subsidiaries in the depressed textiles industry. Exports, mainly cotton and textiles, actually fell last year, albeit by only 0.1 per cent, for the first time - despite a 10 per cent devaluation in the rupee in mid-1993. By contrast, foreign investors are responding favourably to the Bhutto government's initiatives. Foreign investment inflows rose 20 per cent to Dollars 693m in 1993-94, including Dollars 339m in portfolio investment. This year's figure could come close to Dollars 2bn, given that the overseas sales of shares in Pakistan Telecommunications Company, the state-owned carrier, raised Dollars 900m this autumn and that construction is starting on the Dollars 1.8bn Hub River power station. The government is also hoping to attract foreign investment in future privatisations. Though perhaps not on the scale of PTC, stakes in state-owned power and gas producers and distributors could also raise large sums. Even greater is the amount ministers hope to attract into the construction of new power stations. A new energy policy, launched in March 1994, offering attractive terms to private sector investors, including a guaranteed price for power purchases, has encouraged US companies to sign letters of intent for building power stations worth Dollars 4bn. Mr Gordon Wu, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, has unveiled an even bigger programme, offering to build generating capacity worth Dollars 8bn. There is some doubt about how fast these investments, which would almost double Pakistan's electricity output, might materialise. But for Ms Bhutto they already represent a powerful boost to confidence in her economy. These investors are attracted partly by Pakistan's chronic need for power and partly by the consistency with which successive governments have pursued market-oriented policies favourable to foreign trade and investment. Despite the political divide separating them, Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif have few differences on economic policy. Ms Bhutto's government has pursued her predecessor's initiatives in virtually all important areas including liberalising trade through tariff cuts, deregulating foreign exchange rules and financial markets, and privatisation. The sale of shares in a leading state-owned bank, UBL, is top of the privatisation agenda, to be followed, as mentioned above, by sales of stakes in utilities currently operated by the Water and Power Development Authority. Although there were plans to privatise it en bloc, WAPDA is now seen as too unwieldy for such a sale. All this is music to businessmens' ears. But the government's tune is in danger of being drowned out by the country's political turmoil. Investors can learn to live with chaotic Parliamentary politics, as they have in Italy, for example. They can also cope with corruption, which is widespread in Pakistan, but which is common in almost every developing country and most developed nations as well. But the risk of being robbed or even murdered on the streets of Karachi has made more than one potential investor think twice about Pakistan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) on Monday [13 Jun] called for the  government to take all kinds of measures to put the Japanese  economy on a steady recovery track, a trade ministry official  said.    Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda and other senior Keidanren  executives made the request during a breakfast meeting with  high-ranking officials at the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI), including Eijiro Hata, the trade minister.    The fiscal 1994 national budget should be enacted at the  earliest possible time, while tax reform and deregulation  packages should be worked out by the end of this month, Toyoda  was quoted as saying by the MITI official.    Yutaka Kume, Keidanren's vice chairman, asked for the  corporate tax burden be eased and a landholding tax to be  abolished, to spur overall corporate activity in Japan.    Kume, chairman of Nissan Motor Co., also proposed the  government support research activity at universities and  national institutes as part of efforts to upgrade Japan's  industrial infrastructure, the MITI official said.    Hata replied that the ministry will respond to these  requests  "positively," the official said.    On the worsening of employment prospects for college  graduates, Toyoda said Keidenren will urge business corporations  to step up new recruitment, especially of female graduates, who  are finding it extremely difficult to get jobs.</p>

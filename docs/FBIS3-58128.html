Scharping told the BILD newspaper (Monday  [10 January] edition): "The legitimate security interests of  Russia and the other CIS states have to be considered in this.  We must not give the nationalist, partly fascist, in any case  antiwestern and anti democratic forces in Russia any cheap  excuses. So this has to be a process of several stages that  must not ignore the economic side of things, in particular."    The SPD leader also stressed that the Central and East  European states' fear of "being under Moscow's control again"  had to be taken seriously. It was therefore "sensible to use  existing instruments -- NATO and CSCE -- to give states such as  Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, possibly also Slovakia and  others, security prospects." The SPD chairman stressed,  however, that Russian membership of NATO was "unrealistic from  today's point of view." (This report was prereleased to DPA in  an edited form)</p>

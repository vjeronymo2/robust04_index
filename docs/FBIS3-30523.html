			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, Deputy Prime  Minister Marek Borowski, and Aleksander Kwasniewski, leader of  the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic last night discussed  reaching a new coalition agreement. We were told this by  today's guest, Aleksander Kwasniewski. Later today the leaders  of the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance  will meet.    [Begin recording] [Kwasniewski] I am trying to convince both  Marek Borowski and the prime minister about the hierarchy of  issues. The most important issue for today is the budget; the  most important issue is an effective government; personal  matters are somewhere behind. I am convinced that if such  principles are accepted by the prime minister then Marek  Borowski will not submit his resignation--he is a responsible  politician....    [Unidentified correspondent, interrupts] But did he say  yesterday that he was withdrawing his resignation?    [Kwasniewski] The resignation has not been submitted...    [Correspondent, interrupting] It was submitted last Friday.    [Kwasniewski] No, it was not submitted; it was just  announced...    [Correspondent, interrupting] Then did he withdraw his  announcement?    [Kwasniewski] Yes, if these principles are accepted then I  think that the whole issue will be settled positively. [end  recording]    Kwasniewski added that he expects Prime minister Waldemar  Pawlak's reply on the question of possible nominations for  deputy ministers of defense, foreign affairs and internal  affairs from among the coalition members. The prime minister  will also explain the role of Jerzy Milewski, deputy defense  minister and the head of the National Security Office, in the  government.</p>

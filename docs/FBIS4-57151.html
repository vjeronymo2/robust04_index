			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] For the third straight day, students and police  clashed in Caracas. The clashes left three injured and more than  30 others arrested. On 11 May, a long day of protest started in  the early morning hours, specifically at the Francisco Fajardo  School located in U.V. Siete de Caricuoa. The day of protest  left three students injured, as well as 30 arrested by  metropolitan police agents.    At the Francisco Fajardo School on Caricuoa, three students  were wounded. One of these students--Marvin Uzcategui--was shot  in the stomach; Juan Carlos Vivas, a 15-year-old student, was  shot in the ribs; and Guillermo Useche got a shot in the arm.  According to witnesses, the shots were fired by Metropolitan  Police deployed along the main streets of the area known as U.V.  Siete de Caricuoa, who opened fire on the protesters.    Nevertheless, General Orlando Henandez Villega, the  commander  of the Metropolitan Police, categorically denied these reports.    [Begin Hernandez recording] I want to reiterate what I said  previously. The Metropolitan Police are not using firearms to  quell the demonstrations. Clear proof of this is that, if  firearms had been used at Francisco Fajardo School, there would  have been wounded students. Instead, the wounded included a  five-year-old who was not demonstrating, as well as a  15-year-old from a neighborhood next to the school. Apparently,  there were clashes with criminals or shots were fired in the  area, resulting in these people being wounded. [end recording]    Despite General Orlando Hernandez Guillen's version of what  happened, it was unofficially learned that, according to  officers of the Technical Judicial Police's Homicide Division,  police officers opened fire with .38 caliber weapons on students  protesting the hike in student bus fares.    Violent demonstrations also were reported at other schools,  such as Fermin Toro in El Silencio; Luis Espelozin; Miguel  Antonio Carela on Sucre Ave.; and Luis Blanco in Propatria,  where two police officers were wounded. Also, in the wake of  disturbances at the Jose Felix Ribas School, which is located on  the main road in Dos Caminos, a store was looted. There also  were disturbances reported at the Luis Caballero Mejia  Politechnical Institute in La Yaguara, at the Central University  of Venezuela, the Instituto Pedagogico of Paraiso, and the Campo  Rico Technical School in El Marquez.    Officers from the Metropolitan Police and the National  Guard's Urban Security Brigade continue to be deployed  throughout the city in an attempt to control all of these  outbreaks of violence.</p>

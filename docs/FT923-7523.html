			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar loses D-Mark gain THE DOLLAR surrendered an early gain against the D-Mark yesterday as the foreign exchange markets ignored a series of factors that might have been expected to boost the currency, writes James Blitz. In early European trading, the dollar peaked at DM1.4761 as dealers continued to digest the promising economic news out of Germany. July's figure for wholesale price inflation, down 1.3 per cent on the month, could signal a turning point in the German economy, reducing the need for a Lombard rate rise. When US trading opened, the good news was forgotten. The dollar dipped well in excess of a pfennig to a low of DM1.4610, and ended in Europe at DM1.4630, down 55 basis points from Friday. Yesterday's close in New York was DM1.4645. There is still a creeping uncertainty in the market as to where the dollar is going. In its latest currency report, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said the risks to holding dollars will fall over the next month, supporting the US currency at the upper end of the DM1.4500 to DM1.5050 trading range. Others believe that if this week's figure for July M3 money supply in Germany emerges worse than expected, at 9 per cent or above, the market will test the dollar's historic lows again. A Bundesbank council member compounded the gloom at the weekend, saying the Lombard rate will only be cut when M3 is back in the 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range, and inflation is below 3 per cent. Whatever view is taken, the dollar is undeniably weak. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, said: 'There was talk of new military action against Iraq at the weekend, there was talk of a new fiscal stimulus in the US, and the Republican convention is under way in Houston. All this should have led to a stronger dollar today. It did not.' By contrast, the markets ought to have seen a much weaker pound on the back of even gloomier UK statistics. The Confederation of British Industry announced a sharp year-on-year fall in retail sales in July and the Bank of England said more than 1m households may be trapped in homes that are less than the value of their mortgage loans. But sterling ended  1/4 pfennig above Friday's close at DM2.8175. It was nearly a cent stronger against the dollar at Dollars 1.9260. The Italian lira firmed a little as the effect of Moody's downgrading of Italy's foreign debt wore off. The lira closed at L759.0 to the D-Mark after a previous L759.9. The Swiss franc was firmer against the D-Mark at SFr0.899, compared with SFr0.901. A dealer said that uncertainty over European union continued to strengthen the 'Swissie's' reputation as a secure haven.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Savings; where to find the best returns - Investors are faced with lower rates. Philip Coggan and Scheherazade Daneshkhu guide you through the maze HOW MUCH interest are you getting on your savings? The answer could be: less than you think. An instant saver account from Abbey National pays just 6.15 per cent gross (4.61 per cent net) on sums between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 9,999. If you have more than Pounds 25,000 in Lloyds Bank's 30 day notice account, you get just 6.2 per cent gross - 4.65 per cent net if you are a basic rate taxpayer and 3.72 per cent net if you are a top rate payer. Those with Pounds 5,000 in Barclays Select (a 90 day account) are getting 5.6 per cent gross, a net 4.2 per cent or 3.36 per cent respectively for basic and top rate payers. Most savings accounts normally offer a lower return than the prevailing level of base rates. Now that base rates are 8 per cent, double digit savings returns are hard to find. To get anything more than 8 per cent, you will need a large sum or you will have to look in other places than the very largest banks and building societies. And even then, you will probably have no guarantee that the rate will stay competitive. Those who stick with an instant access account at a big bank or building society, may well find that their net returns are not much better than inflation (currently 3.6 per cent). That may not be all the bad news. There was speculation this week that base rates may have to fall to 6 per cent, if the government is to kick start the economy. Such a change would result in savers' incomes falling by a quarter. So what are the best returns at the moment? Moneyfacts has provided us with its normal weekly table of highest rates (on Page IV) but we also asked it to tell us the returns available from banks and building societies on Pounds 10,000, Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000. Pounds 10,000 On an instant access account, Moneyfacts points to the Scarborough Building Society (0800-590578) which is paying 9.85 per cent gross and the Bristol &amp; West (0800-100117), which offers 9.65 per cent. These rates are better than any notice account, where the top rate is City &amp; Metropolitan's 60 day account (081-464-0814), paying 9.5 per cent. Those who want a fixed rate can get 9.67 per cent gross from the Beneficial Bank (021-633-4400), or 9.0 per cent from Portman BS (0202-292444). Both have a one year fixed term so should not be chosen by those who might wish to withdraw their money early. Colin Jackson, of Baronworth Investment Services, (081-518-1218) has details of a Tessa which will pay 9.3 per cent for those prepared to invest a lump sum of Pounds 8,650. After five years, this sum will turn into Pounds 13,061. Pounds 25,000 Scarborough and Bristol &amp; West also offer the best instant access rates at this level. The former is offering 10.1 per cent gross, and the latter 9.75 per cent. On notice accounts, Moneyfacts points to the Cheshire BS (0800-243278) which is paying 10 per cent on its 100 day account. The Beneficial Bank again leads the fixed rate field at this level, with a rate of 10 per cent gross. Pounds 50,000 The best instant access returns at this level are provided by the Scarborough (10.15 per cent gross) and by the Leeds &amp; Holbeck BS (0532-438292), at 9.8 per cent. The 100 day account from Cheshire BS pays 10.5 per cent on Pounds 50,000, with this rate fixed until the end of the year. Beneficial Bank also pays a 10 per cent fixed rate on Pounds 50,000 for those prepared to invest for the one year term. What about the rule that higher reward means higher risk? It is a thin line between shopping around for the best rate and taking an unnecessary risk with your savings. The Weekend FT cannot vouch for the safety of any financial institution and any mention on these pages does not imply a recommendation. Investors can study the accounts of the quoted institutions, but many deposit-takers are privately-owned. And as the Bingham report showed this week, one cannot rely on the regulatory bodies to protect the investor. The investor's main protection is the Deposit Protection Act, which guarantees 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 sterling deposits; ie a maximum protection of Pounds 15,000. The building society protection scheme covers 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, equivalent therefore to a maximum limit of Pounds 18,000. So those who invest more than Pounds 20,000 with one institution should be aware that they are taking on a slightly higher risk. The good news for bank and building society depositors is that there are other choices which provide higher, or in some cases more certain, returns. National Savings Although rates on National Savings products have fallen in recent months, they still offer safety and tax efficiency. The 39th issue certificates pay 6.75 per cent tax-free if held for five years, equivalent to a 9 per cent gross return for basic rate taxpayers and an 11.25 per cent return for top rate payers. Non-taxpayers will find Capital Bonds more suitable, since interest is paid gross. The present Series F pays 9 per cent compound when held for five years. The First Option bond, which is aimed at basic rate taxpayers, is offering a rate of 6.5 per cent net over one year, on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. This compares favourably with, for example, Abbey National's instant saver account, paying 4.35 per cent net. Those who want to put away Pounds 20,000 or more in the First Option Bond will earn a slightly higher rate of 6.8 per cent net. But perhaps the most attractive deal at the moment is offered by the index-linked certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per annum over the retail price index, when held for five years. Inflation would have to average under 2.25 per cent over the next five years for the 39th issue to beat the rate on the index-linked certificates. And if inflation stayed at the current level of 3.6 per cent for five years, the return would be 8.1 per cent - the equivalent of 10.8 per cent for the basic rate payer and 13.5 per cent for the top rate payer. The snag is that these certificates do not pay income. It is possible to create an income flow by cashing in certificates early, but this reduces the return. Indeed, savers should be aware that returns on these certificates will be meagre if cashed in within the first two years. There is a income-producing product from National Savings, but rates are variable. Income bonds pay a gross variable rate of 9 per cent but this will decrease to 8 per cent gross from November 5. Gilts These also rank high on the safety front, since they are bonds issued by the government. They pay a fixed rate of interest, so investors are protected against falling rates. Gilt yields have fallen substantially in recent weeks, but it is still possible to lock in to rates at over 8.5 per cent. The cheapest way to buy gilts is via the post office, although this may be slower than via a stockbroker. Yields could fall while the deal is going through. It is the tradeability of gilts which makes investing a tricky business. Most gilts have a face value of 100, and you can be sure of receiving that sum if you wait until the gilt is repaid by the government. But if you need to sell before the repayment date, you may not get your capital back. Indeed, the vast majority of gilts currently trade at above the face value. For example, on Friday morning, the Treasury 13 per cent 2000 was trading at 126 5/8 . If you bought the issue at that price, you would get a gross annual income of Pounds 10.27 for every Pounds 100 you invested. But if you held the gilt till the year 2000, you would lose a fifth of your capital, which reduces the redemption yield to 8.26 per cent. Guaranteed income bonds These are issued by insurance companies and offer a fixed rate of return, paid after deduction of basic rate tax. An element of safety is built in by the Policyholders Protection Act, under which 90 per cent of a policyholder's investment is protected. However, rates are pretty low at the moment, so a substantial sum is needed to beat base rates. Liberty Life, for example, is offering 7.35 per cent net (the equivalent of 9.8 per cent gross) to those who invest Pounds 50,000 for three years (more details on Page IV). PIBS Permanent interest-bearing shares (PIBS) are a relatively new form of fixed interest investment, available from building societies as a way of raising capital after legislation was passed in June last year. Their main advantage is the relatively high rates of fixed interest they pay. For example, when Britannia building society launched its second tranche of Pibs earlier this month, the shares carried a fixed coupon of 13 per cent and a yield at issue of 12.14 per cent. The yield yesterday was 11.89 per cent. This rate is higher than for gilts - but not without reason. It reflects the increased risk of buying shares backed by a building society rather than the government. There are a number of other drawbacks. The shares are undated, which means that the building society is not under obligation to pay back the original capital (unless it is wound up). You would therefore have to sell your shares in order to encash them and this can only be done through a stockbroker, who will charge commission. The minimum denomination is usually quite high since Pibs are aimed mainly at the institutional market. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, for example, which launched an issue this week, had a minimum holding of Pounds 50,000. However, the minimum holding in Britannia's issue is Pounds 1,000. PIBS are deeply subordinated, which means that in the event of a wind-up you would be behind depositors in the queue for compensation. And if one PIBS issuer got into difficulty, prices might fall across the sector. They should therefore be handled with caution.</p>

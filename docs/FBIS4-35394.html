			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Waht, Yemen, May 31 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni  troops repelled an assault by northern tanks on a village near  the south's stronghold of Aden on Tuesday [31 May], a  correspondent reported.    Two tank crewmen were killed and 12 captured, while a  southern civilian also died and 10 others were injured,  according to an Aden television reporter also at the scene.    A T-54 tank was overturned at the entrance to the village of  al-Waht, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Aden. Black smoke  emerged from three other tanks outside Waht.    Southern soldiers and militiamen, backed by Mil MI-8  helicopters, raked the area with RPG-7 rocket and automatic  weapons fire, while northern artillery on the nearby Subbayhah  Mountains provided cover for the retreating tanks.    Northern forces have opened new fronts in their four-week  war  to capture Aden, with fierce fighting around villages northwest  of the port city, a military spokesman and correspondents said.</p>

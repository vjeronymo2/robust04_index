			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Japanese sales of vehicles fall further in November The severity of the downturn in Japan's vehicle market was underlined yesterday by figures showing that new vehicle sales in November fell 7.7 per cent, the eighth consecutive monthly decline. According to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association, passenger cars suffered a 7 per cent decline in spite of the introduction by several makers of new models in the autumn. Truck sales were down nearly 9 per cent, reflecting the overall weakness in economic activity. Mr Futoh Fujii, vice president of Nissan, noted in an interview last week that the Japanese car industry could face a 'double dip recession'. Such concerns were supported by the weakness of demand in November, which is the peak year-end sales period as it comes before consumers receive their bonuses in December. Failing a November pick-up, car makers will probably have to wait until the spring for the next opportunity for demand to gather pace, a Honda official said. The downturn in the domestic market has come as exports have also been forced lower, largely as a result of the yen's strength and sluggish demand particularly in the European Union. Japanese manufacturers have had to scale back production plans significantly in order to adjust inventories. Mazda had a two-day closure last month, and Nissan will follow suit this month. Honda plans to halt production for four days between this month and next April and to reduce output by about 10,000 units.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guaimaro, (Camaguey), 11 Apr (PL) -- Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly, said during a  ceremony here that the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP] upholds the principles of the Constitution  signed in this town 125 years ago.    Alarcon spoke after a ceremony commemorating the anniversary  of the first Cuban Constitution, which was signed in this town  during the independence war against Spain. The ceremony was a  celebration of the origins of the Cuban nationality.    At Constitution Plaza in Guaimaro, some 500 km from Havana,  Alarcon stressed the similarity between the current struggle of  the Cuban people to maintain their social project and the ideals  of the founding fathers who established the motherland.    Alarcon asserted that amid the difficulties Cuba is facing,  the effort to perfect the Cuban socialist program is still  pursued in difficult and unpredictable times.    Alarcon recalled that from the very beginning of Cuba's  struggle to gain its independence from Spain the island was  threatened by the ambitions of the United States, the same  country that is now trying to smother the social system that was  able to fulfill the dreams of the founding fathers.    He pointed out that following the historic principles of  Cuban legislation, Cuban deputies will examine on 1 May the  serious economic and financial problems of the island to seek  viable solutions to improve the current situation.    Alarcon underscored that the constituent assembly of  Guaimaro  made provisions to guarantee the equality of Cuba as a nation  and that of all Cuban citizens among themselves to achieve the  national ideal: the homeland, "the same one that we defend  today on an island besieged as in the past century."    Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez; Julian Rizo Alvarez,  first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in Camaguey; and  Camaguey Mayor Evis Blas Gonzalez also attended the ceremony.</p>

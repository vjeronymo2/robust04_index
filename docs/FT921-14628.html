			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Thyssen Stahl to shed 2,000 jobs and cut output THYSSEN STAHL, Germany's biggest steel-maker, is to cut 2,000 jobs and reduce output by 4 per cent following a 42 per cent slump in profits last year. Mr Ekkehard Schulz, chairman, said yesterday that the current year's results, although still in the black, would be 'markedly worse'. Further economy measures might include a merger of the company with Thyssen Edelstahl, the special steels division of the parent Thyssen group. 'In the light of technical and economic developments over the last year there is every reason for bringing them together,' Mr Schulz said. A decision would be made in the summer at the earliest. Blaming low prices for the second profits fall in succession, he claimed the company's revenues from steel fell DM60 (Dollars 38) a tonne last year. 'If you consider that we have volume of 10m tonnes, you can see the problems we have had to face,' he said. Although some improvements could be seen, prices were still 15 per cent below 1989 levels. Sales fell in all the company's main markets. Even in Germany turnover edged down from DM6.6bn to DM6.5bn, reflecting weakening demand in the last quarter. Group sales in the year to the end of September dropped 8 per cent to DM10.44bn, and net profits, adjusted for acquisitions, tumbled to DM317m from DM549m in 1988-1989, the group reported a net return of DM969m on world sales of DM11.8bn. Mr Schulz said that in the present circumstances wage increases should be less than 6 per cent. The company, which employs a third of all Germany's steelworkers, would not be 'killed' by a strike, he added. He was responding to threats, later confirmed, that the IG Metall union was to call a strike ballot following the breakdown of pay talks over a 10.5 per cent claim.</p>

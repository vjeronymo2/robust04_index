The river originates from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Its  upper reaches are within China where it is called the Lancang  River, while its lower reaches are called Mekong River, running  through Laos, Myanmar (the former Burma) and Thailand.    Ding Weimin, an official of the Department of Communications  of Yunnan Provincial Government said at today's opening of the  meeting that expert groups of the four countries all made  proposals to their own governments after they made a joint  survey tour of the river last year, February to May, urging that  an agreement on opening the river to navigation should be signed  as soon as possible.    During the four-day meeting, representatives from the four  countries will thoroughly discuss a draft of the agreement.    After the meeting, the participants will go to make a  further  survey of a section of the river.    A source from the meeting said that the results of the  Sino-Lao- Myanmar-Thai joint survey last year showed that a  60-ton vessel can negotiate the river all year round and a  150-ton one can use the river for eight months a year. If the  river is dredged, 300-ton vessels would be able to use the river  all the year round.</p>

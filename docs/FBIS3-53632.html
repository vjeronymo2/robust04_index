			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Islamabad -- Responsible sources say that  representatives of the world's leading weapons manufacturing  companies have become active in Pakistan after the cabinet  defense committee decided not to depend on only one country for  defense needs. Various arms producers, through their  representatives in Pakistan, are trying to influence public  opinion in a bid to thwart the negotiations for the purchase of  the Mirage-2000 from France and SU-27 and MiG-29 planes from  Russia. Important institutions in Pakistan have received  reports of mysterious activities by representatives of arms  companies from various countries of the world. Instructed by  company offices in New Delhi, the representatives are carrying  out a propaganda campaign in a bid to scuttle the 1989 agreement  with the United States for the purchase of 60 F-16 planes and to  thwart the negotiations for the purchase of Mirage-2000 planes  from France, and SU-27 and MiG-29 aircraft from Russia.    Important sources in Rawalpindi said that political-level  talks with France for the purchase of Mirage-2000 planes have  ended. Experts of the Pakistan Air Force have approved  Mirage-2000 planes as technically suitable for induction into  the Pakistani Air Force. Financial details, however, are yet to  be worked out and the Government of France and the concerned  company have been given a financial package proposal. The  sources said that no political-level talks have been held yet  with Russia on the purchase of SU-27 and MiG-29 planes. A  Russian delegation will visit Pakistan soon during which  Pakistani officials will hold talks on the purchase of these  planes as well as other matters.    The sources said that the test and trial stage for the SU-27  and MiG-29 planes have not yet begun. It will be after the  political-level talks between Pakistan and Russia. Therefore,  it is premature to say anything about the suitability of the  SU-27 and Mig-29 planes for Pakistan before their test and  trial. A senior officer in Rawalpindi expressed the hope that  the people responsible for mobilizing public opinion either for  or against any issue will act with a greater sense of  responsibility when dealing with defense-related matters and  will not turn themselves into the tools of elements attempting  to exploit the situation after the suspension of the U.S. aid.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Management buy-out rescues Leyland Daf: 700 jobs saved at assembly plant - Dutch unit gets dealer network / Council offshoot acquires site A MANAGEMENT buy-out team reached agreement yesterday to take over the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire from the administrative receivers. The MBO is one of the most significant steps in the rescue of the former Daf group in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium, which collapsed into receivership at the beginning of February. The deal announced on the shop floor was greeted with an emotional two-minute ovation by the workforce of 700. In a parallel move Daf Trucks of the Netherlands, which was created in March to take over the core medium and heavy truck operations of the old Daf group in the Netherlands and Belgium, reached agreement with the UK receivers to acquire Leyland Daf Trucks, the former UK marketing and sales arm in Thame, Oxfordshire. The Dutch group will control the UK Leyland Daf dealer network and will market and sell the 45 series light trucks and other heavier models made in Leyland through this network in Britain along with its own heavy trucks. It will also sell the UK-built light trucks through its existing dealer network in continental Europe. The two deals secure the 700 jobs at the Leyland assembly plant and 150 at Thame. As part of the MBO deal the entire 230-acre site in Leyland has been acquired from the receivers by Lancashire Enterprises, the development arm of Lancashire County Council, for development as a business and technology park. The new MBO company, Leyland Trucks Manufacturing, will lease the site of the assembly plant. The buy-out, led by Mr John Gilchrist, Leyland Daf's managing director, has been backed by Pounds 5m of equity funding from Barclays Development Capital. Working capital finance has been provided by National Westminster Bank. Mr Gilchrist yesterday forecast a turnover of Pounds 140m and an output of about 10,000 trucks in the first 12 months of operation. When Daf collapsed in February the group had about 12,000 jobs in the UK, the Netherlands and Belgium. If the remaining parts of the group are rescued as planned that total will have been virtually halved with about 2,845 jobs remaining in the UK (there were 5,500) 2,500 in the Netherlands (5,000) and 750 in Belgium (1,500). The truck plant management buy-out has put in place the most crucial piece of the jigsaw in the complex rescue of the failed Daf commercial vehicle operations in the UK. It may appear to potential truck and van buyers as if business is being resumed as normal with the same products, the same brand names, and virtually the same dealers. Behind the scenes, however, the former group has been broken into independent units, separately owned and financed, but still linked through arm's-length supply agreements and buyer-seller deals. According to Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen, one of the joint administrative receivers, the rescue of the UK business has been the biggest and most complex manufacturing receivership in the UK since the collapse of Rolls-Royce in the early 1970s. Leyland Daf had an annual turnover of Pounds 350m. He said: 'At one time we thought it might be too complicated to hold it all together.' The Daf group collapsed with debts of more than Fl 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) after running up net losses in the previous three years of Fl 880m. Before the collapse the workforce in the UK and the Netherlands had already been cut to 12,289 in 1992 from 16,782 in 1989. By the time the rescues are completed it will be halved again to about 6,000. Including yesterday's crucial agreements separate rescues have now been completed for: the Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy duty truck operations in Eindhoven and Westerlo. The Birmingham-based van operations. The truck assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire. The truck marketing and sales operation in Thame, Oxfordshire. Still to be finalised are the rescues of the Albion axle plant in Glasgow, the spare parts distribution business in Chorley, Lancashire - now trading under the name Multipart - the Leyland components and test facilities, and the disposal of the assembly and sales operations in Africa. The core medium and heavy-duty truck operations in the Netherlands and Belgium were the first parts of the collapsed Daf group to be rescued at the beginning of March. A new company, Daf Trucks NV, was formed with the backing of fresh equity and subordinated loans totalling about Fl 445m. About half of that figure was provided by the Dutch government and the Flemish regional government, with the remainder coming from a group of Dutch and Belgian banks, institutions and, to a limited extent, from suppliers, dealers and importers. Daf Trucks expects to produce about 10,000 medium and heavy duty trucks this year and is forecasting an annual turnover in a full year of Fl 2bn. The receivers' first success was at the end of April with the MBO of the Leyland Daf van operations in Birmingham. The formation of the new company, Leyland Daf Vans, was supported by about Pounds 6.5m of equity finance from the venture capital group 3i. Other main elements included working capital and a bank loan of more than Pounds 7m provided by Royal Bank of Scotland, financing of up to Pounds 20m from United Dominions Trust, a TSB Bank subsidiary, for dealer stocks, and UK state aid of Pounds 9m. According to Mr Allan Amey, chief executive and leader of the MBO team, Leyland Daf Vans expects to achieve a turnover of about Pounds 150m in its first year of operation. It is forecasting output of about 12,000 vans a year. By securing the future of the UK truck and van plants the way has been opened for disposal of the remaining operations. The lucrative former Leyland Daf spare parts distribution and warehouse business at Chorley, Lancashire, now trading under the Multipart brand name, has reached parts management and royalty agreements with the UK van and truck manufacturing operations and with Daf Trucks NV. With a turnover before receivership of Pounds 140m a year it was the most immediately viable part of the collapsed group with about 200,000 Leyland Daf vans and trucks on the road in the UK and still requiring replacement parts. An MBO team led by Mr David Little, operations director, is negotiating with the receiver. It faces stiff competition from organisations including Unipart, the vehicle parts distributor and manufacturer. The Albion axle plant in Glasgow has negotiated long-term supply agreements with its main customers, Leyland Daf Vans and Leyland Trucks Manufacturing. The plant is likely to be acquired by Scottish engineering interests in the next few weeks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The Big Break-Up (Workforce in UK, The Netherlands and Belgium: before 12,000, now 6,100)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Glasgow Albion axle plant: possible acquisition.

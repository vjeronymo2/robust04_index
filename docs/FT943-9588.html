			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical turns in 72% rise to Pounds 9.81m Shares in Holliday Chemical Holdings yesterday rose 13p to a post-flotation high of 250p after the industrial dyes and speciality chemicals company announced a 72 per cent increase in first half profits. The company, which came to the market last year, saw pre-tax profits rise from Pounds 5.69m to Pounds 9.81m on turnover of Pounds 62.9m (Pounds 54.9m). On a pro-forma basis profits showed a 46 per cent advance from Pounds 6.7m. Mr Michael Peagram, the founder and chairman, said the healthy results and rising share price showed the group had recovered from last November's profit warning, when concerns over its Spanish subsidiary sent the shares tumbling to 174p. Operating profits in Spain - where Holliday makes pharmaceutical actives and fine chemicals - have improved in recent months, although Mr Peagram admitted they remained 'below aspirations'. Group operating profits rose to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 7.19m) following better-than-expected performances from all six divisions. The figures were enhanced, however, by a Pounds 1.2m currency gain and a Pounds 1.69m contribution from Reckitt Colours International - the former Reckitt &amp; Colman subsidiary acquired for Pounds 52m in March. Mr Peagram predicted that Reckitt Colours, which is to be renamed Holliday Pigments, would emerge as the company's largest profit centre. Profits from the business, which supplies 60 per cent of the world market for industrial grade ultramarine - the tints for plastic bottles - helped offset flat demand for the group's other dyes and pigments. Its contribution underpinned profits of Pounds 4.9m in the colours sector, against a pro-forma Pounds 3.17m last time, while the existing chemicals operations made Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 4.26m). Welcoming the performance, Mr Peagram pointed to increased demand for waste recycling products, hair dyes and fine chemicals. 'We do not have one single product, or customer or market that could more than dent our growth if it was wiped out overnight.' He also hinted at further acquisitions which could be financed from bank facilities. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 32m following the Reckitt acquisition to Pounds 29.6m at the end of June - equivalent to gearing of 56 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 5.8p to 7.4p on a pro forma basis and an interim dividend of 2p (1.6p) is declared. COMMENT On the surface, Holliday's results look as rosy as some of its industrial pigments. After stripping out the favourable currency gains and contribution from Reckitt Colours, they appear a little less bright. Nevertheless, the group has overcome tough price competition in Spain and enjoyed organic growth elsewhere. Reduced operating costs should feed through in the second half and new products are likely to generate profits. With Reckitt likely to show further substantial gains, full year profits could exceed Pounds 21m. Although the shares may pause for breath following their recent rise, they remain a relatively attractive option on a forward multiple of 16.4.</p>

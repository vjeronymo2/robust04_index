			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Industrial output declines 5.1% in year INDUSTRIAL production in Japan is in its longest ever downturn, figures from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry showed yesterday. Output in June fell 5.1 per cent year-on-year, its 21st successive month of decline. The previous record stretch was 20 months from May 1974 to the end of 1975. The economic environment which will be inherited by whichever government is formed in the coming weeks is thus the gloomiest for nearly a generation. The latest fall was the worst since February, when a 5.8 per cent annual fall was recorded. It bears out a warning earlier this week by Mr Osamu Takatori, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, that recent data appeared to give the lie to earlier assumptions that the corner had been turned. For the second quarter as a whole, industrial production was down 4.5 per cent from the same period of 1992 and 1.7 per cent below that of the first three months of this year. On a month-on-month basis, though, seasonally adjusted output for June emerged 1.3 per cent higher, the first rise since March, when a 2.5 per cent upturn was followed by two months of downward movements. Shipments rose 2.1 per cent in the month but, reflecting the amount of destocking of goods still in the pipeline, inventories rose 0.4 per cent for a second successive monthly rise. Compared with a year earlier, the reining back of supply and demand meant inventories were down 4.9 per cent and shipments off 4.8 per cent.</p>

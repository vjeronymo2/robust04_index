			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEW;  </P> <P> *** BILLY IDOL "CHARMED LIFE" CHRYSALIS: STAR SCALE: ONE (POOR) TO FIVE (A  CLASSIC).  </P> <P> And with a rebel moan. . . . No, Billy Idol hasn't gone in for whimpering  confessionals. But the personal healing chronicled in much of "Charmed Life" is  a long way from the exaggerated bluster that made the singer famous.  </P> <P> Credit Idol's maturity, but also backhandedly credit his longtime guitarist and  sidekick Steve Stevens, who had the good grace to go off to pursue a solo  career and let Idol be.  </P> <P> Over the years Idol seemed to be trying to top Stevens' guitar histrionics with  his own increasingly buffoonish vocals. But the more restrained guitar of Mark  Younger-Smith leaves Idol a free man, able to pull off such relatively subtle  and affecting material as "Prodigal Blues" (a gently moving examination of his  relationship with his parents) and "Trouble With the Sweet Stuff" (a caution  against all sorts of addictions).  </P> <P> But lest you miss the cartoon Idol, there's an embarrassing version of the  Doors' "L.A. Woman." Idol yelps and growls and hollers while the band manages  to avoid all the drama of the original -- which was hardly the Doors' best  moment anyway. Skip this, but savor the rest. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

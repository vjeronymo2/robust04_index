			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING HOPES FOR THE FUTURE;  </P> <P> RANGE OF PROMOTERS WOULD WELCOME ARENA AT CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE  </P> <P> Experts in the professional sports and entertainment industries reacted  enthusiastically Wednesday to news that construction of a multiple-purpose  arena at Cal State Northridge is under serious consideration.  </P> <P> They also predicted the venture would succeed at the game, an area in which the  school's athletic teams are likely to initially struggle.  </P> <P> Northridge officials are in the process of compiling information on the past  ticket and concession sales of the school's athletic events for use in a  feasibility study on the proposed complex.  </P> <P> The Ogden Corp., a New-York based conglomerate with management ties to several  major sports facilities nationwide, has agreed to conduct the study, The Times  reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> The final revenue numbers, CSUN administrators believe, will not be impressive.  Matador basketball and volleyball teams have rarely come close to filling the  school's 3,000-seat gymnasium that has served as their home court.  </P> <P> That trend will change, it is hoped, when Northridge begins playing against  Division I teams beginning in September, 1990. The Matadors currently play at  the Division II level.  </P> <P> "If we have a solid, winning program, people will support it," said Bob  Hiegert, CSUN's athletic director. "If we don't they won't. That's the way it  is in this town."  </P> <P> Until the Matadors are competitive at Division I, income from sources such as  concerts, professional sporting events and a variety of other events would be  relied upon to generate operating expenses.  </P> <P> Brian Murphy, president of Avalon Attractions, one of the busiest concert  promoters in Southern California, estimated that his company might book "six to  12 shows a year" at such an arena, provided the size of the facility was  suitable.  </P> <P> "I don't think this venue can look to compete with the Forum and the Sports  Arena and the 16,000 seats they have for concerts," Murphy said. "But if they  had a medium-sized place, in the 9,000 to 10,000-seat range, I think we could  pull some business in their direction."  </P> <P> The size of the proposed complex has not been determined, but administrators at  CSUN had originally favored an arena with 8,000 to 12,000 seats. Ogden  officials are thought to favor something in the 15,000 to 20,000-seat range.  </P> <P> Including the surrounding areas of the Simi, Conejo and Santa Clarita valleys  and Glendale, the Valley area has a population base of more than 2 million.  </P> <P> The Universal Amphitheatre, with a capacity of about 6,000, is host of the  Valley-area's largest concerts.  </P> <P> Murphy said he believes rock-and-roll groups would find a Northridge site  particularly attractive.  </P> <P> "A lot of rock-and-roll acts just play the Long Beach Arena, but I think if  there was something in the Valley they'd play both," Murphy said. "They could  get two dates instead of one and avoid the basin entirely."  </P> <P> There is little chance, Murphy said, that a group would book concert nights at  large facilities in both the Valley and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Acts that come to L.A. want to sell out," he said. "I don't think Cal State  Northridge is going to compete with the Forum and the Sports Arena because of  their central location and history."  </P> <P> In the area of family entertainment, a Northridge site would be virtually  without competition, said Tom Abramson, marketing director for the Ice Capades  and Harlem Globetrotters.  </P> <P> "The Valley is a market that is completely untouched," Abramson said. "There's  the (Hollywood) Bowl and the Amphitheatre but neither one of those venues lends  itself to a production of our magnitude.  </P> <P> "I know we'd look seriously at the possibility of playing there. I think every  major show would."  </P> <P> While the Globetrotters usually play two nights at a site, the Ice Capades has  a normal run of six consecutive nights and might sell close to 100,000 tickets  depending on the site.  </P> <P> "Frankly, we've been saying among ourselves that we wish there was another  place that we could play in this locale," Abramson said. "The L. A. market can  bear it without question. And it's a natural flow from a tour's point of view  -- they do Anaheim, L. A. proper and the Valley, then slide right up to Fresno,  the Bay and Sacramento."  </P> <P> An arena might also draw interest from professional sports teams. The Clippers  have shown some interest and team president Alan Rothenberg had an informal  meeting with CSUN administrators earlier this year.  </P> <P> Dan Goossen, manager of boxer Michael Nunn, the International Boxing Federation  middleweight champion, said he would like to prove boxing can be successful in  the Valley on a large scale.  </P> <P> "The Valley is where I want to be and I know a place like that can succeed out  here," said Goossen, whose organization promotes fight cards at the Reseda  Country Club.  </P> <P> "Let the people in Inglewood be the ones who have to get on the freeway."  </P></p>

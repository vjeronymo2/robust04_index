			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calculating FMV in the context of administrative reviews, it is the Department's practice to use a monthly weighted-average of third country or home market sales, as appropriate, for comparison to the U.S. sales price when several home market or third country sales may represent the behavior of the company for a given month during the period of review. (See ``Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice from Brazil; Preliminary Results and Termination in Part of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review,'' February 3, 1992, 57 FR 3995.) However, in this review, distortions could result from the application of a monthly FMV because of hyper-inflation. Where such distortions would have been created, we calculated FMVs, as we have done in previous reviews, based on shorter periods as determined by the Brazilian government-mandated minimum export price (which is derived from the FCOJ 30-day futures contract price on the New York Cotton Exchange). (See ``Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice From Brazil; Preliminary Results and Termination In Part of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Intent to Revoke in Part the Antidumping Duty Order,'' June 19, 1991, 56 FR 28138.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of Branco Peres, the Department used constructed value, as defined in section 773 of the Act, for comparison to those U.S. sales where no contemporaneous third country sales existed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Constructed value consisted of the sum of the costs of materials, fabrication, general selling and administrative expenses, freight and profit. Because the actual profit was more than the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of general expenses and cost of manufacture, we added the actual profit in accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Results of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,xs46,xs32  -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/exporter  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Time period  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin (percent)  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Branco Peres  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5/1/91 to  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> &blank;4/30/92  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.03.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Citropectina  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5/1/91 to  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> &blank;4/30/92  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Zero. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Frutropic  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 5/1/91 to  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> &blank;4/30/92  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Zero.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department intends to revoke the antidumping duty order with respect to Frutropic if, at the time the Department publishes the final results of this review, Frutropic has demonstrated three consecutive years of sales at not less than foreign market value, and it is not likely that Frutropic will sell subject merchandise at less than foreign market value in the future.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Local calls cost more than abroad LOCAL calls cost more in the UK than in any other large country in Europe, north America or Australasia according to a survey of international telecommunications prices. But the UK's international calls are the cheapest of the 10 countries surveyed, and its trunk calls the second cheapest. The survey, published by National Utility Services, a consultancy group, shows that for a three-minute local call at average rate UK consumers pay at least twice more than those in Canada, the US, Sweden, the Netherlands and Italy. Canadians pay an unusually high exchange line charge, equivalent to Pounds 38.78 a month. However, at Pounds 10.28 British Telecom's monthly charge is found to be higher than those in Australia (Pounds 10.21), France (Pounds 9.57), the US (Pounds 8.62), Italy (Pounds 7.70), the Netherlands (Pounds 7.62) and Belgium (Pounds 6.76). The survey shows UK consumers fare better in long-distance and international calls. They pay less for international calls - Pounds 1.24 for three minutes at average rate - than those in any of the other nine countries, and barely half the going rate in Italy (Pounds 4.41), Italy (Pounds 2.44) and Sweden (Pounds 2.42). At 27p for three minutes at average rate for trunk calls, UK customers pay less than in all nine other countries except the Netherlands (21p). Germany and France are highest at 80p and 77p respectively. Mr Andrew Johns, National Utility Services director, said: 'Having finally won approval from industry watchdog Oftel to rebalance its costs and increase exchange line rentals, it is surprising that BT has not lowered local charges other than through volume discount schemes.'

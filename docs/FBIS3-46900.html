			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Production Committee under the  Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], which  is organized by about 80 defense-related companies, released a  200-page report in mid-December. The report carries a  translated text of the theater missile defense (TMD) plan, which  was released by the U.S. Defense Department in June 1993.    In view of trends in the post-Cold War period, the TMD is  proposed as a regional defense system to replace the strategic  defense initiative (SDI) plan. The United States is calling for  Japan's cooperation in developing and purchasing the TMD system,  and Japan is beginning to think seriously about it since it  became obvious the DPRK (North Korea) is developing the "Nodong"  missile with an effective range of 1,000 kilometers. Under such  circumstances, the Keidanren Defense Production Committee has  decided to study the U.S. proposal.    A senior official of a major electric appliance manufacturer  noted the TMD plan is expected to awaken Japan's interest in  better warning and control systems as well as defense missile  systems, saying: "Japan's air defense system is intended for  airplane attacks, and the nation is completely open to ballistic  missiles. The TMD will be a chance to modernize the nation's  capability to cope with missile attacks."    During his Tokyo visit in November, U.S. Secretary of  Defense  Les Aspin stated that Japan should contribute to the TMD project  not only by offering its technology, but also by purchasing  U.S.-made equipment. If so, the project would be unattractive  to Japanese companies.    Japan decided to purchase airborne warning and control  system  (AWACS) late last year, and the purchase of four AWACS planes  was incorporated in the 1993 and 1994 budgets; however, this  suppressed expenditure for Japanese-made equipment.    Therefore, Managing Director Shozo Ojimi of  Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Limited showed a prudent  attitude toward Japan's participation in the TMD project,  saying: "It is questionable that we really have to join the TMD  project thoughtlessly. We have to carefully study its  technological merits, or we will just waste money." Also, a  senior Defense Agency official said: "While the United States  wants to use Japanese technology in the TMD, Japan's  technological contribution to development of the missile system  would be quite limited due to legal restrictions."    Some quarters express concern that, even if some sort of  technological cooperation is possible, such Japan-U.S. projects  may produce nothing but technological friction just like the  joint project for development of Japan's next-generation support  fighter (FSX).</p>

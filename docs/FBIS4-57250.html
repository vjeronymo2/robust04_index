			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santiago, 14 May (EFE) -- Today the Chilean  Government insisted that it would be inconvenient if Carabineros  Director General Rodolfo Stange resumed his activities on 17 May  when his special leave permit, which he requested when he was  brought to court, expires.    Secretary General of Government Victor Rebolledo read a  communique drafted during a two-hour meeting with President  Eduardo Frei and other political ministers.    The government believes it would be a "highly critical  political and moral problem" if Gen. Stange returns to the  Carabineros high command.    In Rebolledo's opinion, it is "useless" to continue arguing  about legal aspects of Gen. Stange's situation.    The official communique disclosed today reiterates the  validity of Frei's arguments on 5 April when he requested  Stange's resignation after Judge Milton Juica asked that he be  tried on charges of "omission of military duties." [passage  omitted]    There are reports that Stange, the day after returning to  work on 17 May, will travel to northern Chile for a month to  avoid having to attend the opening of Congress sessions on 21  May.    Gen. Stange was questioned twice this week by Martial Court  Judge Alfredo Pfeiffer on "omission of military duties." Cesar  Mendoza also has appeared in court on the same charges.</p>

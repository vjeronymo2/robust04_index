			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ADMINISTRATION. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The administration of the benefit provisions of the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program is similar to the regular TAA program except that the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program requires workers to be enrolled in training to qualify for TRA payments. The NAFTA&hyph;TAA program prohibits the waiver of the training requirement when training is not ``feasible or appropriate,'' which is available to eligible workers in the regular TAA program. Also, the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program requires workers to be enrolled in training by prescribed time periods to qualify for TRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Employment Services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Employment services described in section 235 of the Trade Act are to be provided to NAFTA&hyph;TAA certified workers as provided to workers certified for regular TAA. Employment services are to be provided to NAFTA&hyph;TAA certified workers to the same extent that such services are provided to any workers seeking employment services under other Federal laws; i.e., Wagner-Peyser Act and Title III of JTPA. (See 20 CFR 617.20 and 617.21) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Training is to be provided to NAFTA&hyph;TAA certified workers according to section 236 of the Trade Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workers certified under NAFTA&hyph;TAA will have to satisfy the same criteria in 20 CFR 617.22(a) as apply to workers certified under the regular TAA program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that payments for NAFTA&hyph;TAA training for any fiscal year shall not exceed $30 million. With regard to this funding limitation, the Department will track nationally the amount of program funds allocated to the States and the amount of funds committed by the States in order to satisfy this statutory provision. States will be informed when the amount approaches $30 million nationally. Should the demand for funds exceed the limitation, instructions will be furnished on how to handle demands for training that exceed the statutory limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Trade Readjustment Allowances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To qualify for TRA payments, an eligible worker must be enrolled in a training program approved by the later of_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) the last day of the 16th week of such worker's initial unemployment compensation period, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the last day of the 6th week after the week in which the Secretary of Labor issues a certification covering such worker. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of time periods.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 16-week time requirement for enrolling in training in order to qualify for TRA will be applied literally. In order to be eligible to receive TRA under a NAFTA&hyph;TAA certification, the worker must be enrolled in an approved training program by the end of the 16th week of that worker's initial unemployment compensation benefit period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This fixed 16-week period begins with the effective date of the claim and ends with the last day of the 16th week thereafter. Included in this 16-week fixed period are weeks of waiting period credit, weeks of disqualification, weeks of employment, and weeks of unemployment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Initial unemployment compensation benefit period <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the same as the term ``first benefit period'' defined at 20 CFR 617.3(r). ``First benefit period'' means the benefit period established after the individual's first qualifying separation or in which such separation occurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Enrolled in Training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For purposes of this provision, a worker shall be considered to be enrolled in training when the worker's application for training is approved by the State agency and the training institution has furnished written notice to the State agency that the worker has been accepted in the approved training program beginning within 30 calendar days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extenuating Circumstances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Act provides that the Secretary, for justifiable cause, may extend the time for enrollment for a period not to exceed 30 days. It is anticipated that there will be situations beyond the worker's control where the worker is unable to enroll in training by the later of the last day of the 16th week of the worker's initial benefit period or the 6th week after the week that a certification was issued. Such situations could involve training programs that are abruptly canceled or circumstances where the first available enrollment date is past the deadline, as well as injury or illness which may adversely affect the ability of workers to enroll in training. The authority to grant 30-day extensions to workers is delegated to States or State agencies as one of their responsibilities under section 239 of the Trade Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application of this 30-day grace period will be used only in rare circumstances. Workers who fail to enroll in training by the end of this 30-day period are still eligible to participate in approved training and have the training costs paid with NAFTA&hyph;TAA program funds but will not qualify for TRA. This provision places added responsibilities on both the worker and the State agency to satisfy the time limits for enrolling in training in order to qualify for TRA. Workers certified for NAFTA&hyph;TAA must be informed promptly of the time provisions by the State agency when a NAFTA&hyph;TAA certification is issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to satisfy these provisions, information bulletins or brochures furnished to claimants by the State unemployment insurance agency and to applicants for employment services should include information on the time provisions for NAFTA&hyph;TAA certified workers to qualify for TRA. Other means of informing workers of the time limits are through newspaper notices and letters sent to individual workers when a certification is issued, as required in section 225 of the Trade Act and regulations at 20 CFR 617.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Konstantin Zhukovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- The Russian-Argentinean  documents recently signed in Moscow bring the bilateral  relations onto a new level, said Argentinean Foreign Minister  Guido di Tella.    Argentina is a key Latin American state, and Russia is  working to expand and establish contacts with regional political  organizations and economic groups.    Although no economic cooperation documents have been signed,  it is not accidental Guido di Tella is accompanied by a large  group of Argentinean businessmen. In the words of Secretary for  Foreign Economic Relations of the Argentinean Foreign Ministry  Jorge Campbell, the visit opens up broad prospects for the  expansion of bilateral trade and economic cooperation in various  spheres.    When in St. Petersburg and Moscow the Argentinean  businessmen  met local entrepreneurs and were received by Deputy Russian  Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Karastin. Upon  his return from St. Petersburg, Guido di Tella said that his  ministry will render comprehensive political support to all new  forms of bilateral trade and economic cooperation if the  business community initiates the expansion of bilateral  relations.    The Russian-Argentinean diplomatic relations were  established  in 1885. Now that Argentina is a major member of the South  American common market, Russian interest in this state has  considerably increased. Argentina also has a large Russian  diaspora.    The Moscow documents is the basis and the upper part of the  "bilateral cooperation iceberg", said Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev upon the completion of negotiations with his  Argentinean colleague. Argentina is a member of the United  Nations Security Council, and the Russian-Argentinean  cooperation has both bilateral and global dimensions, he  stressed.    The Moscow visit of Guido di Tella is a landmark in  bilateral  and Russian-Latin American relations, he said.    In his turn, the Argentinean foreign minister believes in  the  Russian future and considers the Russian Federation to be a  great world power. The only thing necessary is to put the  country in order and abstain from inventing new social systems,  he said.</p>

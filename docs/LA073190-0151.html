			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Camarena trial -- A story in Friday's editions incorrectly reported that two  government witnesses, Hector Cervantes Santos and Enrique Plascencia Aguilar,  had testified that they had seen Honduran drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta  Ballesteros at 1984 meetings where the kidnaping of U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration agent Enrique Camarena was discussed. In fact, only Cervantes  testified that he had seen Matta at the meetings.  </P></p>

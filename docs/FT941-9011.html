			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Icy weather grips US economic growth Exceptionally cold weather could cause economic growth in the first quarter to fall short of administration projections, Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said yesterday. He was reacting to the worst figures for housing starts in a decade. Starts fell 17.6 per cent between December and January, but officials said the decline mostly reflected the weather. Last month was the third coldest January in 99 years. The decline in starts, which tend to be volatile on a monthly basis, followed disappointing figures for retail sales and industrial production, which fell last month after robust gains late last year. Before allowing for disruptions caused by bad weather and the Los Angeles earthquake, most analysts - including the administration - expected first quarter economic growth at an annual rate of about 3 per cent. Mr Brown did not indicate by how much growth might fall short of this target, but he claimed the bad weather would have only a transient effect. 'The economy's underlying momentum remains intact.' Starts fell sharply in the northeast, midwest and south, all regions affected by severe weather. They rose slightly in the west in spite of the disruption caused in California by the earthquake. However, even after last month's big fall, the national rate of starts was running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.29m, 11 per cent higher than in January last year, reflecting robust increases in building activity in the second half of 1993. Officials yesterday revised figures for December to show an increase in starts of 11.7 per cent rather than the 6.2 per cent previously reported. Analysts had expected bad weather to result in a fall in starts of about 9 per cent. Building permits, a guide to future construction activity, also fell sharply last month. However, most analysts are confident that starts will rebound when the weather improves because of the stimulus from low long-term interest rates.</p>

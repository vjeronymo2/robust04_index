			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Leading Article: More fear than greed It is part of the perversity of stock markets that they frequently fall on good news and rise on bad. But where political shocks are concerned, behaviour is more predictable. The murder of Mexican presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio on Thursday deflated global markets that were already nervous after the US Federal Reserve had signalled a further quarter-point rise in short-term interest rates on Tuesday. It has been a dismal week for bond and equity investors, who have been swept along by a strongly bearish tide since early February. There is a growing political factor at work in markets. Putative plots in Moscow and the threat of civil war in the Crimea are a nagging worry for bond markets in Europe. In Japan, the unpredictable behaviour of North Korea over a nuclear capability that may or may not be real has played a similar role in unnerving yen bonds. Whitewater continues to undermine the political authority of the Clinton administration, while giving rise to fears that the president will try to extract himself from political trouble by pursuing a more populist, and thus destructive, trade policy. A more predictable influence is the electoral timetable, notably in Europe. Apart from the Italian elections this weekend, there is a federal election in Germany in October, while France has a presidential election in 1995. Here the impact on markets is more subtly corrosive, because of the longer-run political pressures on fiscal policy. Since the Amato government's savage attack on the oversize budget deficit last year, the government under Mr Ciampi has been blown off fiscal course. Whatever coalition ultimately emerges from the present electoral process in Italy, it would be ill advised to pursue anything other than an orthodox budgetary path, given that public sector debt will exceed 120 per cent of GDP by mid-decade. Yet media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi has been wooing voters with promises of tax cuts. Substantial subsidy Perhaps more surprising has been the French government's backsliding on the fiscal virtue so painfully acquired in the 1980s. This week's huge injection of capital into the state-owned loss-making bank, Credit Lyonnais, comes close on the heels of the substantial subsidy for Air France. Mr Edouard Balladur, a potential presidential candidate whose poll rating is sinking, appears ready to incur heavy economic costs in an attempt to restrain the rise in the political temperature. This is worrying for those who hope that the European markets will ultimately uncouple from the US, leaving room for a recovery in European bond prices. Apparently high real (inflation-adjusted) rates of interest may be lower than they look if people are over-sanguine about the durability of disinflation. Also worrying is the fact that the general trend in short-term interest rates outside the US is either static or falling too slowly to offer much of a gravitational pull for bond yields. In the UK, where recovery is well established, a less benign than expected set of inflation figures this week has made it harder for the chancellor to push for a rate cut. In Germany and France, the beginnings of recovery are clearly perceptible, implying that the scope for further cuts is limited. Even in Japan, which has lagged the rest of the world on its way to the upturn, the central bank governor Mr Yasushi Mieno has been suggesting that the recession is past its trough. That, too, carries a hint that further monetary easing is not on. Subdued recovery Paradoxically, the good news for markets may be precisely that recovery outside the US looks like being subdued. Labour market weakness in parts of continental Europe and Japan is a dampening influence on demand. Another dampener is the recent rise in bond yields, since long-term interest rates in continental Europe have a greater influence on real activity than in the English-speaking economies where short rates are more important. That suggests that neither inflationary pressure, nor the pressure of demand on the global pool of capital, will prove unmanageable and that the the panic in bonds is overdone. The trouble with forecasting an end to a correction of this kind is that markets overshoot. As Professor Gordon Pepper points out in his new book, Money, Credit and Asset Prices, there are times when a degree in crowd psychology might provide greater understanding of financial market behaviour than a degree in economics. Expectations of a change in financial forces can, he argues, cause a bunching of speculative transactions, leading to volatile and disorderly markets. At present, neurosis prevails and the central bankers lack the appropriate bedside manner. Just as the Fed's earlier policy of small and repeated rate cuts encouraged investors constantly to hope for more, gradual increases are now causing fear to become self-feeding. The correction may have gone too far. Yet it requires boldness to act on the assumption that it will not go even further next week.</p>

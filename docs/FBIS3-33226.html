			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose M. Rojas] </F>   [Text] The Defense Ministry, through General Rafael Montero  Revette, has reported that leaders of the bloody 4 February and  27 November coup attempts have expressed to the government their  interest in reaching agreements to resolve the current  situation. Gen. Montero said there are no preexisting conditions  for dismissing the proceedings against them. Gen Montero, who  arrived with High Military Command members, met with President  Rafael Caldera at the Miraflores presidential building.    Montero said informal talks have been held with the coupists  who fled to Peru on 27 November but that these contacts have not  been held at the Defense Ministry level. There is great interest  in resolving the problem, not only for those imprisoned in  Venezuela, but for those living abroad as well. Francisco  Visconti and other exiles asked about their legal situation and  were told that everything was status quo. Montero said the  coupists are willing to return, but the government has not  established any prerequisites for their return. "No one has been  told to apply for discharge," he said. This government  position was also reported to Commander Hugo Chavez, who has not  been pressured to request his discharge. The minister said he  has not personally talked to Chavez. "But I know he has every  intention of helping to solve the detained officers' problem."  Montero denied Chavez has demanded his proceedings be dismissed  based on a decision to discharge him. Montero said none of the  officers have been pressured in this sense.    In addition, Montero said the Armed Forces and the  government  will help those who ask to be discharged to get a job so they do  not have any problems. The files of those who do not request to  be discharged will be studied carefully but none will be forced  to request it. All of the files are being studied. Some of them  have been approved and the officers have been released. Others  will probably be released, too. The Military Justice  Administration, Legal Advisory Office, and Defense Ministry are  currently considering each of the files.    [Rojas] Will the officers benefited by dismissing the  proceedings remain in the Armed Forces?    [Montero] Probably.    [Rojas] Can you guarantee that they will not become a reason  for division in the Armed Forces should they be readmitted?    [Montero] We will first consider who will be reinstated.    Montero finally referred to rumors that Venezuelan  businessmen support Colombian guerrillas at the border. The  minister said the Military Intelligence Directorate is  investigating, but he does not believe there are "Venezuelan  traitors."</p>

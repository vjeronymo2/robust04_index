			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Japan 'to open rice market by year-end' JAPAN is likely to liberalise its controlled rice market in time to allow completion of the Uruguay Round negotiations by a December 15 deadline, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, indicated after talks in Tokyo yesterday. Mr Major, who is on a four-day visit to Japan, said Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, had agreed during two hours of talks that completion of the Round was 'crucial' for world trade. 'We share the determination that it should be concluded by December 15,' Mr Major said. 'We agreed that immense damage would be done to international confidence and trade were there not to be an agreement in the Uruguay Round.' Mr Hosokawa said he and Mr Major had 'mutually reaffirmed' the need for countries facing 'difficult' agricultural problems to over-ride these differences. British officials refused to expand on Mr Major's remarks. However, Mr Hosokawa is thought to have given a private assurance that Japan will move quickly to ensure that rice does not constitute a last-minute hurdle for the talks. Japan has come under increasing pressure from the US and members of the 14-strong Cairns Group of agricultural exporting nations, chaired by Australia. The issue of Japan's closed rice market has been in abeyance because of the controversy in Europe over French opposition to the Blair House agreement between the US and the EC on agricultural trade. However, Tokyo is aware that world attention will shift to the rice market if it becomes clear that the Blair House agreement will survive. Mr Major said he had relayed to Mr Hosokawa Britain's strong opposition to French demands for a renegotiation of Blair House.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Adam &amp; Harvey profits move ahead by 16% Adam &amp; Harvey, the international distribution and steel stockholding group, increased pre-tax profits by 16 per cent from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 5.7m in the 12 months to end-March. Turnover rose from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 42.1m, and earnings per share improved from 54.2p to 77.6p. Mr Gerald Stuart-Lee, chairman, said trading conditions had been 'unusually varied', but the company had had a 'promising' start to the year. 'The UK subsidiaries and export trading companies will benefit from the strengthening UK economy and increasing world trade,' he said. However, although changes in South Africa, Malawi and Kenya, and progress towards a free market in Zimbabwe, 'should lead to substantial advantages for the steel division . . . current market instability and pressures on margins could limit results in the short term'. In the UK, the hardwood and agricultural machinery companies increased profits substantially. Recession held back household goods and medical equipment in Germany. But agricultural, construction and food processing machinery prospered.</p>

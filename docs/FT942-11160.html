			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rallies to fresh high - Market report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures perked up towards the close, briefly reaching fresh five-year highs. The market had opened softer and slipped further, looking set to consolidate recent strong gains. The July position was Dollars 15 down at Dollars 1,668 a tonne by the mid-session close, having touched a low of Dollars 1,655. But a flurry of trade and commission house buying late in the afternoon quickly took the price up to a new high of Dollars 1,710 before it eased to close at Dollars 1,700, up Dollars 17. 'We saw good buying again towards the close, it would be a brave man to go short in this market,' one trader commented. The COCOA market ended a very dull but choppy day mixed, the near July futures position dipping to Pounds 870 a tonne before closing Pounds 4 up on balance at Pounds 886. Traders said the market shrugged off news that according to the chief executive of the Ivory Coast's Caistab, the country was short of its current commitments and the mid-crop would only be 80,000 tonnes, against forecasts of up to 200,000 tonnes. 'The market isn't in the mood for bullish news,' one explained. 'Sentiment is slightly unfriendly.' At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices snapped higher in the afternoon, setting the market up for a further attempt on recent highs at Dollars 1,983 a tonne, but other markets ended mixed. ALUMINIUM prices moved off their lows aided by copper. But the three months delivery quotation was unable to repeat Wednesday's foray above Dollars 1,330 a tonne, and final business was at Dollars 1,327, down Dollars 2. Price trends were mixed for the PRECIOUS METALS after gold fixed unchanged from its lower morning setting and the New York markets mostly opened sharply lower. Dealers said the turn-round in the dollar's strength from weak to firmer and the apparent calm in South Africa had taken away GOLD'S two major price supports. London SILVER prices struggled for most of the day after only briefly holding a firmer opening level at Dollars 5.17-Dollars 5.19 for the cash position. A sudden bout of selling took the price down to around Dollars 5.10 support near the morning gold fix and although a couple of rallies were attempted, the support was re-visited when the New York market lost nearly 11 cents shortly after opening.

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Chechens under verbal attack Chechnya, the rebel Russian republic in the north Caucasus, continued to be under sustained rhetorical attack from the Russian government over the weekend, in what appears to be preparation for either an armed intervention by Russian forces or an effort to stimulate the Chechen opposition to stage a coup. Mr Umar Avturkhanov, head of the opposition Temporary Council for Chechnya, was given prime time on Commonwealth TV on Saturday night to claim that the Council was the rightful government of Chechnya - a broadcast which would not have been seen in Chechnya itself because of the republic's decision to jam Central TV programmes. Mr Avturkhanov said neither he nor Russia wanted intervention by armed forces from outside the republic - but 'The Russian authorities should accept our request (for recognition). . . as the highest organ of power in the republic'. Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff for President Boris Yeltsin, accused General Dzhokar Dudayev, the Chechen president, of beheading his opponents and putting the severed heads on display. The daily Komomolskaya Pravda said that on Saturday three opposition activists were beheaded and their heads set up on poles in the main square of the republic's capital, Grozny. The opposition broadcast and Mr Filatov's comments came after the official news agency Tass published a statement from the government on Friday describing Gen Dudayev's rule as illegitimate and promising that the Russian authorities would intervene to ensure the rule of law and the protection of its citizens. Chechnya, which declared independence in 1992 and has since defied all efforts by Russia to bring it within the fold of the Russian Federation, is widely seen in Russia as a state run by and for criminal gangs who prey off Russian cities, especially Moscow and St Petersburg. Its gang warfare has spread as far as Britain - where two Chechens were found murdered in a London flat last year - and the country is believed to be a conduit for drugs from the Caucasus and Central Asia into Europe.</p>

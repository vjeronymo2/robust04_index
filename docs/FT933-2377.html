			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Sport: Cathedrals of the game - Soccer ONE OF the pressing questions early in each soccer season is how well clubs have spent their money over the summer. Usually, this means casting a critical eye over the talent on the field - but not this season. Roy Keane may have cost a record fee. But while Manchester United paid Pounds 3.75m for him they spent Pounds 10m modernising the Stretford End of Old Trafford. United were not alone. Before the season started a friend phoned to report that he had already been to Highbury, just to inspect the new Pounds 22m North Bank stand. There comes a point for fans when their obsession with soccer spreads beyond the game and embraces the stadia in which it is played. Sports arenas are often casually referred to as cathedrals. But for soccer fans the place where they have performed their weekly ritual of torment and euphoria does take on a superstitious aura. This obsession manifests itself in different ways. Fans go to the ground in the off season to watch paint dry. On the other hand Millwall fans, faced with the prospect of a move to spanking-new Senegal Fields, marked the last match at their ramshackle slum on Cold Blow Lane by pelting the club's directors with abuse and turf. Whenever fans gather, conversation turns to stadia. Part of the reason is pragmatic: is there a good Balti restaurant near Villa Park? How can you get away from Upton Park without being beaten up? But there is something more: what is a ground like as a place to perform the Saturday ritual? Talk turns to the architecture and the atmosphere. A strange new book, The Aerofilms Guide To Football Grounds, (Dial, Pounds 9.99) attempts to answer the practical questions. Like so much that is sold to the English soccer fan it opts to offer too little rather than too much; it works best as an illustrated companion to Simon Inglis' wonderful, eccentric Football Grounds of Great Britain (Willow, Pounds 9.95). In the Aerofilms book, each club's entry contains sparse information. The interest is in the two aerial views of each ground. One taken from a great height, is plastered with helpful yellow code. Arrows point into the distance. 'Oxford BR Station 3 miles' reads one useful caption. A letter 'T' shows toilets for visiting fans (only ever one it seems). Anything which encourages fans to use the urinals is a good thing. But there is not a word to explain the question that is raised by nearly all the splendid oblique-angle aerial close-ups: why is the ground that shape? One after another there are asymmetrical grounds (Barnet, Birmingham, Bradford, Brighton, Bristol Rovers) and stands with strange kinks (Blackburn, Bolton and so on). Hardly an English ground is an architectural whole. Everywhere there are gleaming new stand roofs next to aged brown expanses of terracing. Everywhere the spy plane flew the builders were in, as clubs raced towards the deadline for all-seater grounds. The pictures of Highbury, Elland Road and Old Trafford show building sites. What good to the fan is a picture of a hole where there is now a stand? But as a historical document of a game in a period of rebuilding the book is excellent. It is also highly suggestive. Here are the newly-built Bescot Stadium, Walsall, and Senegal Fields sitting in their freshly-cleared urban wastelands, surrounded by the little yellow boxes of generous parking facilities. Here is Old Trafford, the shape of big grounds to come, rebuilt into a huge, symmetrical donut, but pictured with a large bite - the Stretford End - missing. It still has room to breathe and expand. Here is White Hart Lane hemmed on three sides by roads. One of its old assets, its compactness, cramps the potential capacity of an all-seater stadium. Tottenham are planning a development that will make the ground look rather like Old Trafford, with a single sweeping, curving roof. But where Old Trafford holds 45,000, White Hart Lane's capacity, even when the development is finished and every corner crammed with seats, will be 40,000 at the most. How will Spurs compete financially with United if they sell 5,000 fewer tickets for every home game? At least Spurs do not have the problems of Chelsea. The aerial picture of Stamford Bridge offers a condensed history not just of a soccer club but of England itself over the last 20 years. The Bridge was one of the few English grounds built to the Continental oval model. A dog track separated the fans from the action. In 1972, after winning the FA Cup and the European Cup winners cup, the club started the redevelopment they hoped would cement their place in the game's elite. It began with the magnificent East stand which perches close to the pitch towering over the rest of the ground. Here John Major, Norman Lamont and David Mellor, sit in luxury in their royal blue seats, to watch their soccer. The stand almost bankrupted the club. The Mears family, Chelsea's founders, sold out to brassy Ken Bates, the lease passed into and out of the hands of property speculators, the club slipped into the second division and abandoned redevelopment. The fans have had to finance the debt through high ticket prices. In the aerial picture the contrast is clear. Next to the great stand sits the Shed: a small roof over a large expanse of terracing which can hold 10,000 standing fans. Part of it closed, marked off by a snaking blue barrier, in one corner stands the remains of a floodlight pylon. The Shed is separated from the action by a great bow of grass and the wide sweep of the unused track. At Spurs, fans in two stands can reach out and touch a player taking a corner. A Sheddite would have trouble hitting him with a hurled brick. Here is proof that environment and behaviour are linked. Stamford Bridge was, and according to a recent police report, remains, the home of the nastiest fans in English soccer; the lumpen proletariat outside the palace. Now it is threatened by the club's planned Pounds 36m redevelopment. No doubt fans will protest. They will have a point. The Shed is part of English soccer's history. Someone should slap a preservation order on it. Mind you, I will never stand in it again.</p>

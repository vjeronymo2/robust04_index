			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S.P. Stazic on a news conference by Milan Djukic, </F> president of the Serb National Party, in Zagreb on 13 April:  "The NATO Attack Injured the Dignity of the Serbs!"]    [Text] Commenting on the air strikes against the Serb  positions around Gorazde, Milan Djukic, president of the Serb  National Party [SNS], stated on Wednesday at his party's news  conference that "the Serb people, as any other people, have  dignity, and there is a limit to how much injury to this dignity  can be tolerated."    According to Djukic, "with the one-sided air strikes,  without  any warning," the NATO forces and the United Nations have  "injured the dignity of the Serb people." Djukic believes that  NATO should have bombed the Muslims too, for the sake of peace  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Djukic thinks that, because of this  action carried out by international mediators in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war, the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina  has become more distant, and that a new war is emerging. Djukic  claims that the NATO action at Gorazde will make the peace  process more difficult and put a strain on the relations of the  conflicting sides in the negotiation process. Djukic explained  that the international mediators cannot ask the Serbs to join  the peace process while bombing them at the same time. By not  approving of the air strikes against the Serb positions near  Gorazde, and condemning NATO for not having attacked the Muslims  too, Djukic threw the ball into the neutral court and added that  "the United Nations and NATO are the most responsible for the  situation in Gorazde, as they did nothing to really protect the  area except declare it a protected area."    The SNS officials also discussed the possible continuation,  that is, the postponement of the Zagreb negotiations between the  local Serbs from the UNPA's [United Nations Protecred Areas] and  representatives of the Croatian Government. Namely, they  believe that the second stage of negotiations, which has the  establishment of economic ties on the agenda, will be much more  difficult than the first, as the negotiators will have to tackle  political issues, that is, sovereignty. They believe that the  negotiations that were supposed to have been held on Tuesday in  Zagreb have been postponed because the so-called Krajina is  undergoing the process of establishing their government. They  also believe that miracles should not be expected in the second  stage of negotiations, even supposing it ends successfully, as  the critical point will be reached in the third stage, when the  subject of negotiations will be the status of the Serbs and the  so-called Krajina. According to their estimates, the second  stage of negotiations will only be finished in eight months, and  they are thus critical of the Croatian politicians who have been  promising fast reintegration. The SNS officials repeated their  request that representatives of the Serbs from the free  territories of the Republic of Croatia also participate at the  negotiations.</p>

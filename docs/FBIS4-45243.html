			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Stateless Ship `Was Carrying &pound;57m Worth of </F> Cannabis'"]    [Text] Customs officers in a helicopter descended on a  stateless ship carrying 17 tonnes of cannabis resin with a  street value of &pound;57 million, Leeds crown court was told  yesterday.    Five Dutchmen and one Spaniard were aboard the rig support  vessel, Britannia Gazelle, which was carrying the drug in 857  bales in the North Sea, it was alleged.    The six seamen pleaded not guilty to charges relating to  drug-running brought under the Criminal Justice (International  Co-operation) Act, 1990.    Michael Harrison, QC, prosecuting, said the Britannia  Gazelle, a former trawler which had been de-registered in  Britain, had left Lowestoft, Suffolk, in November 1992, and  rendezvoused in the Atlantic with a trawler believed to be from  Spain.    In mid-ocean the cannabis was transferred to the Britannia  Gazelle, which then returned to the British Isles around the  Scottish coast before steaming towards Norway and eventually to  a position 130 miles east of Newcastle, where it was boarded by  customs after being secured by armed forces.    Jan Wagenaar, aged 48, Laurens Frans Dirk Pels-Rycken, 29,  Cornelis Van Delft, 45, Hans Pronk, 48, Jan Peters, 46, and  Rojeirio Santiago-Maya, 48, deny conspiring together with other  persons unknown fraudulently to evade prohibition of the  importation of cannabis resin.    All six further deny being knowingly concerned in carrying a  controlled drug on a ship.    The trial continues.</p>

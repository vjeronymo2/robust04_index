			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has held his  first news conference. Mykola Polonskyy has the story:  [passage omitted] Yuriy Meshkov read out a statement expressing  his readiness to cooperate with all political forces and  economic structures since the elections. Having almost 1  million Crimeans, 72 percent of the adult population, supporting  his candidacy demonstrates, in the president's opinion, the  great unity of the peninsula's population that now forms a  single people. Crimea, in his words, can become a bridge of  friendship between Ukraine and Russia.    It was relations between the young republic and these states  that raised many questions from journalists. A question was  raised on a referendum on the status of Crimea. Yuriy Meshkov  confirmed his resolve strictly to comply with the letter of the  law. His principal aim, however, is the economic well-being of  the Crimeans, while all the rest is secondary. In other words,  the question of the Crimea either seceding from Ukraine and  developing as an independent state or not, virtually remained  unanswered.    Obviously, reality compels Yuriy Meshkov not to hurry  secession, for the economic situation in Crimea is complex, so  much so that even a thought of the republic surviving  independently is absurd.    As for Russia, the president only spoke about the need to  restore and strengthen economic relations with it. The news  conference somehow did not discuss the integration of Crimea in  the Russian ruble zone, which so far has been regarded as a  panacea for every trouble. [passage omitted]    Meshkov told journalists that he would not take steps  drastically different from the previous course and that he would  not undertake substantial structural changes and replacements in  power structures. In other words, everything will remain  unchanged. But if so, how can the Crimeans expect any  improvement in their well-being and living standards?  Unfortunately, journalists did not hear the Crimean president's  specific proposals or concrete ideas in this respect.</p>

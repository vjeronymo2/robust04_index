			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Costs that do not scrape the sky - New York hotels charging less than Dollars 100 a night Travellers staying in New York hotels can have a nasty surprise: a nightly 19.25 per cent room sales tax, plus a Dollars 2 occupancy tax. New York City levies the taxes on rooms costing more than Dollars 100 (Pounds 68) a night. A lower tax of 14.25 per cent, plus Dollars 2, applies to rooms costing less than Dollars 100. While such weighty surcharges can push a night in one of New York's ritzier hotels out of the reach of some business travel budgets, the city does offer several alternatives. There are many moderately priced hotels, and weekend stays can bring savings. Among the establishments offering rooms for less than Dollars 100 a night is one of New York's most chic hotels, the Paramount (tel-ephone 212 764-5500) at 235 W 46th Street. You can get a single room at the weekend for Dollars 99. Bearing the mark of French designer Philippe Starck, the Paramount features beds with framed artworks that serve as headboards; cone-shaped, stainless-steel sinks; and a 24-hour health club. Video recorders are standard in all rooms, and guests can watch movies from a 1,000-title library. If you do not appreciate the Barbizon Hotel's lobby, with its deep blue, domed ceiling decorated with gold frescoes of the signs of the zodiac, you are likely to enjoy the room rates. Studios, which include single or double beds and a TV set, cost Dollars 99 a night. The Barbizon (telephone 212 838-5700) is located at 140 East 63rd Street. It is hard to beat Dollars 75 a night for lodging in Manhattan. That is the price of a studio, comprising one big room with a TV, at the Esplanade Hotel. It is located close to Lincoln Center and Riverside Park at 305 West End Avenue (telephone 212 874-5000). For Dollars 20 extra, you can have a suite, which consists of one bedroom with a sitting area, kitchenette and TV. However, the hotel prefers to rent to guests by the week or month, so you might not be able to take a room on a nightly basis. Single rooms at the Wentworth Hotel (telephone 212 719-2300), located in the jewellery district at 59 West 46th Street, cost from Dollars 75 a night. Doubles start at Dollars 85. Each of the 195 large rooms features at least one double bed. Midway be-tween Rockefeller Centre and the United Nations is the 730-room Lexington Hotel, at 511 Lexington Avenue (telephone 212 755-4400). Until April, single and double rooms, which include TVs, begin at Dollars 85 a night. The hotel offers free admission to its country and western dance club. At the Comfort Inn Murray Hill at 42 West 35th Street (telephone 212 947-0200), single and double-room rates start at Dollars 94 and Dollars 99 a night, respectively. Its 120 rooms feature colour TVs. Don't forget to get your share of free coffee and Danish pastries that are served each morning. At 228 W 47th Street, in the Times Square area, the 1,000-room Edison Hotel (telephone 212 840-5000), with its art-deco lobby, advertises single rooms starting at Dollars 90 a night and double rooms at Dollars 99. Each room comes with a colour TV set.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEW TWIST: MALONE TO SKIP ALL-STAR GAME AGAIN  </P> <P> Utah forward Karl Malone, after twisting his ankle with five minutes left in  the Jazz' 94-74 victory over the Charlotte Hornets Thursday night, said he  would not play in the All-Star game Sunday at Miami.  </P> <P> Malone, who earlier threatened to boycott the game because the Lakers' A. C.  Green was selected to start over him, remained in the game at Charlotte long  after victory was clinched.  </P> <P> "I can't go down there with a sprained ankle," said Malone, who went to a  hospital for X-rays 30 minutes after the game. "I'm not going down there and  stand around the whole time. That doesn't make sense."  </P> <P> Utah trainer Don Sparks said he would put a soft cast on the ankle and examine  it again today.  </P> <P> Malone did not have a good game against the Hornets, who lost their ninth in a  row and 16th in their last 17. Malone played 36 minutes and had only 15 points,  going six of 18 from the field.  </P> <P> The Jazz struggled early, but Thurl Bailey came off the bench to score 22  points.  </P> <P> Detroit 104, Milwaukee 101 -- With Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre leading a  fourth-quarter surge at Milwaukee, the Pistons stretched their winning streak  to nine games.  </P> <P> Thomas had 10 of his 23 points in the last 12 minutes, and Aguirre had 11 of  his 15 in the same span.  </P> <P> Indiana 105, San Antonio 100 -- The Pacers, who struggled for the past month  after a great start, ended the Spurs' 20-game home winning streak.  </P> <P> The shooting of Chuck Person and Reggie Miller enabled the Pacers to beat the  Spurs for the eighth time in a row.  </P> <P> Person had 32 points on 13-of-19 shooting, and Miller had 28.  </P> <P> David Robinson had 21 points and eight rebounds for the Spurs, who are 22-2 at  home.  </P> <P> Denver 123, Chicago 98 -- The Nuggets, playing at home, held Michael Jordan to  15 points, his lowest total of the season. Alex English, who engaged in a  shouting match with Coach Doug Moe during an overtime loss to Indiana Tuesday  night, led the Nuggets with 24 points.  </P> <P> Jordan had only one basket in the second half and was only five of 18 from the  field.  </P> <P> Atlanta 110, Houston 108 -- Moses Malone sank a 16-foot jump shot with two  seconds left at Houston to end the Hawks' six-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Malone had 21 points and 14 rebounds. Akeem Olajuwon had 27 points and 15  rebounds for Houston.  </P> <P> Orlando 101, Philadelphia 99 -- Reggie Theus made an 18-foot jump shot with one  second left to lead the Magic at Orlando.  </P> <P> The Magic is 4-1 in games it has held opponents to less than 100 points.  </P> <P> Cleveland 106, Miami 82 -- The Heat, playing without flu-stricken center Rony  Seikaly, was no match for the Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio.  </P> <P> Mark Price scored 18 points for Cleveland.  </P> <P> New York 122, Golden State 118 -- Mitch Richmond led a furious Warriors' rally  that cut a 20-point deficit to four points with three minutes left, but they  couldn't get any closer to the Knicks at New York.  </P> <P> Richmond had 27 points.  </P> <P> Dallas 90, Minnesota 77 -- Rolando Blackman scored 21 points at Dallas and the  Mavericks pulled away in the second half.

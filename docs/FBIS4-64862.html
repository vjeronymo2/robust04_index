			<p>BFN     [Text] Heringsdorf (DPA) -- At their regular conference on  Friday [6 May] the interior ministers of the laender were not  able to agree to a stop to the deportations of Kurds. This was  stated by Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz Eggert (Christian  Democratic Union) in Heringsdorf on the Baltic Sea island of  Usedom. A joint working group is now supposed to examine to  what extent victims' descriptions of being tortured after their  return to Turkey are correct. Eggert criticized the work of the  Foreign Ministry, which "did not" examine these reports "quickly  enough and did not eliminate all doubts."    At the beginning of the meeting, FRG Interior Minister  Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) presented a report  on the security situation. In addition, the agenda also  included the observation of the right-wing extremist  Republikaner, equal rights for policemen in eastern and western  Germany, as well as cooperation with the police in East Europe.</p>

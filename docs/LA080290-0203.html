			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SAN PEDRO ZONE CHANGE MAY PUSH SCRAP YARD OUT;  </P> <P> LAND USE: THE CHANGES ADDRESS NORTH GAFFEY STREET NEIGHBORS' PROBLEMS WITH A  SCRAP METAL YARD. BUT NEARBY OIL TANK FARMS APPARENTLY WILL STAY.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has approved rezoning of about 150 acres along  North Gaffey Street in San Pedro to limit or phase out heavy industry, an  action that officials believe will lead to the relocation of a disputed scrap  metal storage yard that abuts the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> The unanimous vote Tuesday brings to an end a five-year struggle by San Pedro  homeowner groups and Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to restrict  operations at the Hiuka America Corp. scrap yard, which ships about 500,000  tons of scrap through the Port of Los Angeles each year.  </P> <P> Under the new zoning, the 14-acre scrap yard will be allowed to remain open but  will be declared a "nonconforming use," meaning it will be barred from  expanding.  </P> <P> The new designation will also make it easier for city officials to declare the  operation a public nuisance, based on noise or health and safety complaints.  The city would then have the authority to shut the scrap yard after holding a  hearing.  </P> <P> "It is very much a victory for the community," Flores said. "In the very worst  scenario, if the scrap yard stays there for a long time, they know they are  going to have to be very diligent about being concerned for the community. If  they aren't, they'll be slapped with the nuisance" declaration.  </P> <P> After objecting to the rezoning effort for years, Hiuka officials in the end  did not fight it. No one from Hiuka addressed the council Tuesday, and the  rezoning passed without discussion. The zoning will take effect in about two  months, when the council is expected to approve several ordinances needed to  enact the changes.  </P> <P> Hiuka president David Creigh could not be reached for comment. But several city  officials said Hiuka has decided simply to relocate, rather than contest the  zoning change. A spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles said Hiuka wants to move  the scrap yard to a new location within the port, possibly Terminal Island.  </P> <P> "The search for alternative sites is active and ongoing," said spokesman Chuck  Ellis. "Some sites have already been identified as having potential."  </P> <P> Flores said Hiuka officials came to realize that "this is not the best spot for  that kind of operation." She said her office has encouraged the company to find  a location away from residential areas. "My aim never was to put them out of  business," Flores said.  </P> <P> Noah Modisett, president of the San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners Coalition, said  residents as far away as Western Avenue have been bothered by noise from the  Hiuka operation. Over the years, residents have also complained that the scrap  yard is an eyesore, although Hiuka attempted to address those concerns by  erecting a berm and redwood fence along the freeway.  </P> <P> "This has not just been a local neighborhood thing," said Modisett, whose  coalition of 20 homeowner groups called for Hiuka's ouster in 1987.  </P> <P> He added: "This has been long and hard work. We are really happy to see  progress made."  </P> <P> An attorney for West Oil Terminals and West Basin Co., which own the scrap yard  property and lease it to Hiuka, said the two companies did not object to the  council action because Hiuka "is hoping to move the scrap yard anyway."  </P> <P> Although apparently resolving the scrap yard problem, the new zoning does  little to address community concerns about fuel tanks in the area. Property  west of Gaffey will be zoned for light industry, which prohibits fuel tanks,  but the existing tank farms will not be affected because they are exempted from  zoning laws, city officials said.  </P> <P> In addition, the new zoning places only minor restrictions on two fuel tank  farms east of Gaffey, which residents had hoped to eliminate. The zoning bars  the tank farms from growing "substantially," but allows the property to be  upgraded and additional tanks to be built.  </P> <P> Unlike the scrap yard, which opened in 1985 because of a loophole in a zoning  ordinance, city planning officials said the tank farms have been in existence  since the 1920s, predating residential development in the North Gaffey area.  </P> <P> Planning officials sided with West Oil Terminals and West Basin Co., which also  own the tank farms east of Gaffey, in deciding it would be unfair to severely  restrict use of the property. Lawyers for the owners argued at a hearing early  this year that to target the whole area in order to close the scrap yard would  be to take a "meat-cleaver approach" to a problem that requires a scalpel.  </P> <P> Flores said she agreed to less stringent restrictions on the tank farms as part  of a compromise with the Planning Commission, which at one point was opposed to  rezoning the scrap yard or the tank farms.  </P> <P> "The planning commission felt (the tank farms) had some proprietary rights,  because they were there first," Flores said. "While we would prefer they be  someplace else, the timing wasn't right to do it this time."  </P> <P> Modisett, the homeowner coalition leader, said residents were more concerned  about the scrap yard than the tank farms. He also expressed confidence that  development trends eventually will resolve resident concerns over the tank  farms.  </P> <P> "The whole thing in San Pedro is a move away from heavy industry and toward  clean industries," Modisett said. "The time will come when it just won't be  economically feasible to keep the tanks there any more."  </P></p>

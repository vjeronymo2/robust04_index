			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / TUC chief talks to CBI council The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress addressed the council of the Confederation of British Industry yesterday for the first time in its history. Mr John Monks told business leaders that employers and unions could become partners in making the economy successful and in creating a better-trained workforce. His appeal to private-sector employers may upset some leftwingers in unions who are already concerned about Mr Monks' strategy to widen the appeal of the TUC. Mr Monks told the CBI there were still differences between them. He pointed to the need to treat public-sector workers fairly because there was 'a real danger of creating second-class, badly paid jobs in the public sector'. He also urged the CBI not to be negative about the introduction of works councils under European rules.</p>

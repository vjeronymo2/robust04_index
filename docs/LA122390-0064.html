			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTECTION OF ENDANGERED SPECIES  </P> <P> That animal-rights activists are opposed to the efforts of wildlife ecologists  is not surprising. The idea of rights for animals has on the surface an easy  emotional appeal to people interested in environmental issues; however, the  animal-rights philosophy is severely inconsistent, especially with respect to  wild animals and plants.  </P> <P> The attempt to endow animals, like people, with individual rights is  unrealistic and turns a blind eye to our most severe environmental problems.  Animals cannot make moral decisions, and many species must eat one another.  There is no mechanism in animal rights to resolve extinction-threatening  conflicts among species of animals and no real means of resolving the impacts  of human population growth on the Earth. Real solutions to environmental  problems will require, in the short term, conservation of major tracts of  wilderness habitat with native plants, herbivores and carnivores and in the  long term, stabilization of the growth of the human population and its  economies.  </P> <P> WILLIAM MAUTZ, Laguna Beach  </P></p>

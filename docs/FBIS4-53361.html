			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Han Tong-su] </F>   [Text] Former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung's remarks  seemingly permissive of the North Korean nuclear program have  touched off controversy with the ruling Democratic Liberal Party  [DLP] demanding the government clarify its position on the issue.    In an interview with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim, now visiting  the United States, said that even if Pyongyang possessed "two or  three atomic bombs," it would not be much of a problem compared  with the 20,000 nuclear warheads that the U.S. has.    Kim's remarks are in sharp contrast with the government's  official policy, which was expounded by Deputy  Premier-Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku at the Korean Newspapers  Editors Association's breakfast meeting on March 12. Yi told  the editors, "If North Korea develops even one half of a nuclear  bomb, the declaration of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula will be  scrapped."    DLP officials said Kim's remarks sound like support for  North  Korea's possession of nuclear weapons, adding that they may  jeopardize the ongoing international efforts to stop the  dangerous nuclear game.    Kim Tae-chung's Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, meanwhile,  argued that Kim's remarks were quoted out of context, saying  that Kim made the remarks to stress the futility of North  Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons.    In a meeting of DLP key post holders, senior party officials  expressed grave worry that Kim's "irresponsible" remarks may  embolden North Korea which undoubtedly has nuclear ambitions.    DLP spokesman Pak Pom-chin said, "Kim's remarks will confuse  the government's North Korean policy and create uneasiness among  the people."    Chief policymaker Yi Se-ki said that he can hardly  understand  why Kim made the "unthinkable" remarks at a time when the entire  nation and international community are striving to stop the  North Korean nuclear program.    DLP leaders decided to request that the National Unification  Board issue a statement clarifying the government's formal  position in connection with Kim's controversial remarks.    They also took issue with Kim's remarks at Washington's  National Press Club advising U.S. President Bill Clinton to  invite Kim Il- song to the United States and to send former  president Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang as a special emissary.    DLP officials accused Kim of engaging in political activity,  reneging on his earlier statement that he had quit politics for  good after his presidential election defeat. If he wants to  re-enter politics, he should make a formal announcement, they  argued.    The opposition Democratic Party [DP] and Kim's Asia-Pacific  Peace Foundation, meanwhile, tried to cool down the controversy,  issuing statements saying that Kim's remarks had been  misinterpreted.    DP deputy spokesman Sol Hun said that Kim has insisted on  North Korea's not having nuclear weapons under any  circumstances. "With his latest comments, Kim only wanted to  stress that it is foolish for Pyongyang to possess such  weapons," he added.</p>

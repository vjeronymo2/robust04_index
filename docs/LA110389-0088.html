			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Tracor to Sell Units: Tracor Inc., an Austin, Tex.-based defense electronics  company owned by Westmark Systems Inc., said it will sell its instruments and  aviation systems units as part of a restructuring plan approved by its debt  holders. No sale price was disclosed. Proceeds will be used to reduce the  company's outstanding debt of $747 million. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will  manage the sale. Much of the debt was incurred when Westmark, a holding  company, acquired Tracor in a leveraged buyout in October, 1987. If the  divestiture is completed, Tracor will be left with the components group.  </P></p>

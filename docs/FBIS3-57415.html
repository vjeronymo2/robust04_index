			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Bekker article: "Viktor Gerashchenko's Creative </F> Plans"]    [Text] Boris Fedorov, who for a bet showed just how stable  the ruble was against the dollar this summer, proposed a new  wager the other day -- the rate would fall to 2,000 a week after  his resignation. Viktor Gerashchenko picked up the gauntlet and  stated that the panic on the foreign exchanges had died down --  "it was even necessary to buy the currency so as to prevent a  sharp fall in the dollar."    Throughout the year the chief financier and the chief banker  publicly exchanged caustic remarks or political invective until  the former put the question quite bluntly: It's either me or  Gerashchenko. The chairman did not leave the Central Bank,  noting that he might be prepared to quit if Mr. Fedorov were to  propose to the government something more valuable than he  himself [Gerashchenko] was proposing. These poignant details of  the clash between these two high officials would, in different  circumstances, be a suitable subject for a gossip column, but  behind their war of words is a fundamental question -- which  course of reform will Russia choose?    Until virtually the middle of last year the conflict between  the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry was open and, so to  speak, across the board -- in monetary, credit, budgetary, and  currency policy, and on the problems of the ruble zone.  January's slide by the ruble on the foreign exchanges was an  indicator of the market's attitude to the merest hint of a  deviation from the principles of strengthening the ruble. It  was amazing to hear Viktor Gerashchenko's interpretation to the  effect that the rate slumped because it had formerly been  supported artificially. First, this was ruled out by the May  agreement between the Central Bank and the government "not to  intervene on the foreign exchange market." Second, the Central  Bank had repeatedly stated on previous occasions that it merely  smooths out fluctuations in the rate. And if throughout the  entire past year 4 billion dollars passed through the market,  was enough to ensure a smooth fall in the ruble, and has  suddenly been termed artificial support, why was it necessary to  throw $1 billion into the Moscow International Foreign Currency  Exchange in the space of three weeks in January?    Yet it is hard to get away from the impression that the  Central Bank chairman is beginning the decisive round in the  big-time political game called "change of course." Last May he  formally abandoned his protracted confrontation first with  Gaydar and then Fedorov and, as stated above, accepted the  government's conditions. It was as if he were saying "if you  want to pursue a tough monetarist policy I wash my hands of it,  let's see what comes of it." Today not a thing can be said  against Gerashchenko. Even the IMF, where he has long been out  of favor, has no complaints about him -- the refinancing rate  has been raised to a market level, loans are issued only through  the budget, mutual offsetting of debts is not being allowed,  circulating capital has not been indexed, and lending ceilings  have not been breached.    Outwardly it is hard to find fault with the Central Bank.  But the Central Bank can point the finger at the monetarists in  the government -- the production slump has deepened, investment  is falling, inflation is high, and the budget is in a bad way.  "The Finance Ministry is bankrupt," Gerashchenko stated on  television. He is also talking of a link between 12 December  and "market romanticism," and proposing that policy be amended.  It is a more than successful situation for him. Fedorov has  been removed from the government, and this means that it will be  easy to bury the Finance Ministry's ideas. Ideas such as  securitizing enterprises' debts. It will finally be possible to  restore soft loans and import subsidies. It will not be  difficult to force exporters to sell 100 percent of their hard  currency -- and not to just anyone, but to the Central Bank,  which has an automated control system. Fedorov has gone, and  so, probably, has the Finance Ministry's intention to  independently sell hard currency in the marketplace through a  pool of banks, reducing the dollar rate.    Gerashchenko can now play safely. Our reserves may keep  the ruble afloat for a bit. "But what then?" a television  reporter asked. "We will try to find other means," the Central  Bank chairman replied. He is a civilized banker and refrained  from using the word "administrative" in this context. But Mr.  Gerashchenko is implying a fixed ruble rate, the idea of which  was ratified last May by the abolished Supreme Soviet. I think  it will be no great problem to get Viktor Chernomyrdin to do the  same thing now.    Gerashchenko's exceptional skill is his ability, acting on  the "quiet," to move things to a point where the only decision  can be a strong-arm one -- in other words, a political decision.  This was the case after the bank note exchange in July, when  there was a high-level flurry over the fact that Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan were joining the ruble zone. Then everything  collapsed at the last minute -- the Finance Ministry managed to  show that a ruble union would be premature. But in  December-January the Central Bank, sensing the support of Viktor  Chernomyrdin, acted even more vigorously, expediting the  unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems.  Boris Fedorov calls the agreement on the procedure for this  unification signed by Viktor Gerashchenko and Stanislav  Bogdankevich, chairman of the National Bank of Belarus,  "provocation on a large scale."    The Central Bank chairman's influence over the head of the  government is now obvious to all. Gerashchenko is a special  kind of polyglot. He talks to the premier in his own language,  he is subtle and witty with journalists, and speaks English and  is very official with IMF experts. But Gerashchenko's main  political talent, his strength, and the source of his  unsinkability is his unerring ability to second-guess the secret  wishes of the country's top leaders. Sensing Boris Yeltsin's  "Belovezhskaya complex," he worked on the ruble zone agreements,  cutting through Rutskoy's pathological hatred for Gaydar, and  presented a balance of payments for Russia with a corresponding  assessment of the level of capital flight abroad. Gerashchenko,  latching onto the premier's unquenchable love for centralized  administration, responded with proposals to organize interstate  transactions among the CIS countries under the auspices of the  Central Bank of Russia.    Gerashchenko is indeed convinced that infusions of money and  the restoration of old economic ties will revive production and  ease the transition to the market by using methods of state  regulation. An "easy transition" and "state regulation" are  exceptionally important to him on a personal level too.  Gerashchenko already has his eye on the post of chairman of the  CIS countries' interstate bank. If Russia's monetary system is  united with Belarus and Tajikistan to begin with, and if the  "offense" felt by Messrs. Nazarbayev and Karimov is assuaged,  then he -- Viktor Vladimirovich Gerashchenko -- would once again  be head of virtually the USSR State Bank. And if that post is  ratified by the parliaments of five or seven countries, then no  Russian reformers would be able to budge this chief. It would  be like the lifetime appointment of a U.S. Supreme Court justice.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: DESIGNER ON TRACK  </P> <P> Barry Kieselstein-Cord is becoming the Paul Newman of the fashion industry. The  New York-based jewelry designer, who has a boutique in Neiman Marcus Beverly  Hills, has formed a partnership with Dallas-based car enthusiast David Bell to  back "Team Kieselstein-Cord." Consisting of five Shelby racing cars and two  professional drivers, the team will compete for the first time in a Southern  Vintage Racing Assn. race at Moroso Park near Palm Beach, March 9-11. For the  record, Kieselstein-Cord owns 13 cars, including a Porsche 911 and a Mercedes  6.9.  </P> <P> BOB AND BARBIE: Mattel's Barbie has really gone Hollywood. Bob Mackie, best  known as Cher's costume designer, has created a special Collectors' Edition  Barbie. He's zipped up the world's most famous fashion doll in a gold lame,  body-hugging gown that bares the midriff and swathed her in a white marabou  stole. Asked if dressing Barbie was like dressing any of his long list of  celebrity clients, Mackie mused: "She's a combination of all the best parts."  This first Collectors' Edition Barbie from Mattel will be available in June at  a suggested retail price of $120.  </P> <P> JACKET CODE: Bruce Springsteen, Bruce Willis, Cleavon Little, Emilio Estevez  and Mickey Rourke all showed up wearing their leather jackets one recent night  at the China Club. Do you suppose they called each other first? Rod Stewart  bucked the trend, suited in pinstripes and a white tux shirt.  </P> <P> SAFARI SO GOOD: Other designers hand out tote bags when they introduce a new  fragrance. Not so Ralph Lauren. His new $300-an-ounce Safari fragrance is part  of an entire fantasy theme that is right out of Africa. Lauren has designed a  line of ready-to-wear and home furnishings to complement the new scent -- the  whole package, clothes, furnishings and fragrance is called the Safari  Collection. Even the Polo Ralph Lauren store on Rodeo Drive has been  transformed: The decor of leather riding boots and saddles has given way to  leather riding boots, travel trunks and silver tea services.  </P> <P> FASHION STAT: A survey called "Profiles in Courtship," conducted by R. H.  Bruskin Associates for Korbel Champagne, found the seventh most likely way to  meet a mate is to go shopping.  </P> <P> FILLING A NEED WITH SOME STYLE: Dawn Wells (better known as Mary Ann on  "Gilligan's Island") has designed a line of clothes for people who have  difficulty dressing themselves because of handicaps or arthritis. Her garments,  called the Wishing Well Collection, are made with full overlapping panels in  the back that fasten with Velcro closures, replacing buttons, zippers and  over-the-head entrances. In designing user-friendly garments, she has not  forsaken style -- a bright red, double-breasted coat dress with black trim, a  tuxedo-front dress in pastel colors and a panne velvet, mandarin-collar robe  are just a few of the items in her mail order catalogue, available by calling  (818) 840-6919.  </P> <P> WE'VE COME FOR YOUR DAUGHTERS: Strutting down the Paris runways are two models  with decidedly conspicuous names -- Svetlana and Natasha. They are Soviet  lasses signed with French modeling agency Glamour. "We plan to start scouting  around the main cities in the Soviet Union to see who's out there for us," said  Glamour President Jerome Bonouvreir, who plans to open a Moscow office in  April. He got a well-manicured toe-hold on the market through Pierre Cardin,  who is known for his longstanding manufacturing relationship with the Soviet  Union.  </P></p>

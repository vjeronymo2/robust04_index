			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROZEN MICROWAVABLE SNACKS: FOODS FOR MOOD RATHER THAN NUTRITION;  </P> <P> HEALTH: AMERICANS ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE ON THESE TYPES OF FOODS -- FROM  LEAN POCKET SANDWICHES AND PIZZAS TO BROWNIES AND MILK SHAKES.  </P> <P> A joke floating around comedy clubs a few years ago concerned a then-overweight  (but since slimmed-down) actress who stood in front of her microwave shouting,  "Hurry, hurry."  </P> <P> For the actress, and for most of the rest of us, speed is essential. Less  significant to the actress, but more important to the rest of us, are the ways  the pressures of a two-income family have shortened the amount of time most  people spend cooking.  </P> <P> The pressures have an impact in other areas as well, but nowhere do the  hurry-up tendencies of daily life mesh with the possibilities of the microwave  as well as they do in the area of frozen, microwavable snack foods. Although  there are other choices when it comes to microwavable snacks, from popcorn to  individual-serving soups, the frozen foods case is where folks in a hurry will  find the greatest variety of quick snacks.  </P> <P> There are no specific statistics on frozen, microwavable snacks -- the kind  that, typically, come prepackaged in individual servings and can be prepared  within minutes and eaten quickly and informally, using hands rather than the  generally accepted polite utensils.  </P> <P> But Americans have been spending more and more on frozen foods in general, and  that would include microwavable snacks. Manufacturers are turning out  everything from Lean Pocket sandwiches and pizzas to brownies and milk shakes.  Most of these choices are goodies picked to suit a mood rather than a specific  nutrition plan.  </P> <P> Statistics compiled by the American Frozen Food Institute show that U.S.  shoppers spent $9 billion more and ate 113 million pounds more frozen foods in  1988 than they did during the previous year.  </P> <P> About 1,510 new frozen-food products were introduced during 1988, and an equal  number of new products were introduced during the past year, according to  Steven Anderson, chief executive officer for the American Frozen Food  Institute.  </P> <P> In our health-conscious times, a legitimate concern with microwavable snacks is  their nutritional value, especially when compared with ready-made snacks or  snacks prepared from mixes.  </P> <P> "On the whole, most of the microwave products are, in my opinion, high in fat  and in sodium in particular," says Tina Amato, a registered dietitian with the  Allentown (Pa.) Health Bureau. "There are some better selections you can choose  within each of the categories." Frozen soft pretzels or individual-serving  vegetable packs rather than a Danish or sausage biscuits are examples.  </P> <P> Amato suggested people avoid microwavable snacks that have no nutritional  labels on them. Typically, only foods that make some type of health claim are  required to display a label, which would provide information on the amount of  fat, sodium and other health-related information.  </P> <P> Consumers should also look at the amount of fat, measured in grams, and sodium,  measured in milligrams.  </P> <P> Any product with a single serving that registers more than 5 grams of fat or  240 milligrams of sodium should be avoided, Amato says. Avoid palm oil (As a  rule of thumb, palm oil is the least expensive of most commonly used oils, so  if several oils, including palm oil, are listed, bet on the palm oil).  </P> <P> Jayne Hurley, a registered dietitian with the Center for Science and Public  Policy, said that tests were done comparing a microwavable cake mix to a boxed  cake mix that someone would prepare at home.  </P> <P> "Both are very fatty," says Hurley. "I don't know if you can make a case for  them (microwavable snacks) being worse than prepackaged. They are certainly as  fatty as those other products. There is no net positive or negative."  </P> <P> Microwavable foods are "no worse than and no better than the ones you are  whipping up at home. At home, you have more control over the ingredients. You  can substitute skim milk instead of whole milk. You can cut fat and sugar. You  have more control whenever you are making the food yourself," Hurley says.  </P> <P> Will the sheer convenience of the microwavable food snacks pose problems for  some?  </P> <P> Hurley said they might.  </P> <P> "When people are dieting, we recommend they only have foods in the house that  need to be prepared," Hurley said. "So, if you want to binge on cookies and  cake, you have to get eggs and milk out and make them. Chances are, you are not  going to do that. The convenience of (microwavable foods) might lead to an  increase in consumption for these kind of products."  </P> <P> Judith Newman, a specialist on eating disorders at Pennsylvania State  University's Ogontz Campus, says that the convenience of the foods will not  matter much to the anorexic, who suffers from appetite loss. For the bulimic,  or the binge eater, the quickness of the foods' preparation may in fact feed  the food addiction.  </P> <P> However, with extreme cases of binge eaters, Newman said, it is not uncommon  for them to "eat frozen pastries or dough before it is cooked. They eat raw  things. Once that drive comes over them to binge, the taste of the food or the  texture of the food is really unimportant."  </P> <P> Snacking has gotten a bad name, Hurley says, mostly because of the kinds of  snacks people choose. Eating several smaller meals a day is no better or worse  than eating the traditional three square meals, Hurley says. It is what is  chosen that is important.  </P> <P> Assigned to eat my way through the frozen-snack category and critique the  choices, I found some winners as well as some losers.  </P> <P> Celeste Vegetable Pizza-For-One: High in fat (26 grams) and high in sodium  (1,260), the pizza would not get rave reviews from the dietitians but still got  excellent remarks from an ad hoc committee of tasters. Vegetables were good and  a crisping disk included in the package to help keep the crust crisp worked as  promised.  </P> <P> Acme Breakfast Sandwich: This version included sausage, egg and cheese on a  biscuit. The biscuit was too floury for my tastes. But overall, it was equal to  the kind of sandwich one might get out of a vending machine. Another category  with alarming statistics. This brand contained 1,450 milligrams sodium and 29  grams of fat.  </P> <P> Lean Pockets Chicken Supreme: Of the non-sweet foods tested, this was tops for  taste and nutrition. It was very low in fat (4 grams), but didn't offer any  data on sodium content. The crust was crisp and the chicken stuffing was tasty.  </P> <P> Oh Boy Stuffed Potatoes: Because these came two to a box, there was enough to  put it before the tasting committee. One tester thought the potato was bland  but passable. Another felt somewhat deceived by the box, which listed real  bacon was included in the potatoes. She found only tiny bacon bits and also  thought the potato was peppery, but not to a degree that would make the potato  inedible. Each stuffed potato takes about four minutes to cook -- enough time  to make one wonder if it wouldn't be far smarter to microwave a real potato and  season to taste.  </P> <P> Hormel New Traditions Cheeseburger: As might be expected, the fat content here  is high (19 grams) and the sodium fairly high as well (550 milligrams). This  brand requires only that the hamburger be defrosted for about 4 minutes, so  folks with a microwave that doesn't have a defrost mode may have to guess as to  cooking times -- a critical point when it comes to final quality.  </P> <P> Sara Lee Classic Cheesecakes: At 200 calories, 14 grams fat and 150 milligrams  sodium, these tasty treats (four individual snacks) exact a steep nutritional  price.  </P> <P> Pepperidge Farm's Newport Hot Fudge Brownie: This is part of Pepperidge Farm's  American Collection, and while the individual-serving brownie is kind to the  taste buds, it is rather pricey. I paid $1.39 for it at a convenience store,  but the item is discounted slightly at supermarkets. No nutritional data is  provided; probably because a snacker is probably better off not knowing the  statistics.  </P> <P> Rachel's Double Chocolate Brownies: Rachel, bless her, is most likely on the  Weight Watchers hit list. The 1-pound tray of frozen Rachel's (with walnuts) is  too good to be sold without a license or a prescription. Worst of all, you can  eat the brownies when still frozen (Rachel suggests it on the back of the box)  for a different taste treat. There are no health claims on this box, and,  therefore, a snacker has no idea just how good or how bad these things are for  him or her, which might be a small blessing.  </P> <P> Sara Lee Chocolate Fudge Cakes: These relatively dry cakes (six individually  wrapped snacks) are better with coffee or tea than alone. They are of medium  caloric content (190) and high in fat content (10 grams per). The sodium level  was at a reasonable level (125 milligrams).  </P> <P> Oregon Farms Carrot Cake: A fairly tasty, fairly moist carrot cake (cream  cheese frosting with walnuts). Again, no nutritional information. For the  calorie-conscientious among us, you can slice one or two pieces of the frozen  cake and place the rest safely back in the freezer. The slices can be  microwaved to thaw.  </P> <P> Sara Lee Corn and Oat Bran Muffins: Both muffins come in packaging that allows  the user to microwave one, or several. The corn muffins are tastier than the  oat bran muffins, which are bland tasting. The oat bran muffins are also on the  dry side. Of the two, the corn muffins had more fat per serving -- 13 grams,  compared to the oat bran muffin's 8 grams. Also, they both were fairly high in  sodium -- 330 milligrams for the corn, 320 milligrams for the oat.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "New Plans for Luring Machinery </F> Investors"]    [Text] China is encouraging foreign companies to invest in  large and medium-sized machinery enterprises owned by the State.    But, cautioned Nong Keqiang, head of the Foreign  Co-operation  Division under the Ministry of Machinery Industry, controlling  stakes in key enterprises with large shares of the domestic  market must be held by Chinese.    In the past year, many multinational corporations, including  Siemens, ABB, General Electric, Westinghouse Electric, Linde and  Hitachi, have come to China looking for co-operative partners.    Their targets are large and medium-sized enterprises, which  are the backbone of the industry.    The Ministry of Machinery Industry also hopes to renovate  these State enterprises with foreign technology capital and  management, Nong said.    However, most foreign companies interested in turning these  enterprises into joint ventures want majority stakes.    They also ask for control of sales and marketing and deduct  a  percentage of sales revenue for research and development costs.    This will hinder joint ventures in developing new products,  Nong said.    In order to maintain State control, he said, the ministry  has  ruled that Chinese partners must have the final say when turning  key enterprises in basic industries into joint ventures.    Nong said the ministry will intensify its efforts to raise  foreign capital this year to promote industry-wide development.    Foreign investment will be channeled into basic machinery  products and components and into power generating equipment,  which are the industry's priorities.    Because of the country's massive demand for energy, many  foreign companies wish to set up joint ventures to produce power  generators and transmission equipment.    Nong said China will open part of its domestic market to  attract foreign investment.    However, he said that if a large State enterprise is turned  into a joint venture, no less than 70 percent of the stake must  remain in Chinese hands.    If part of an enterprise is turned into a joint venture or a  new venture is launched, foreign companies can own the majority  of its shares.    Foreign companies can also hold controlling stakes if they  bring in advanced technology that China lacks.    China's production of power generating equipment is  dominated  by three giants in Heilongjiang and Sichuan provinces and  Shanghai.    The Dongfang Power Station Equipment Corp, in Sichuan, will  set up several joint ventures with Siemens AG of Germany to  produce thermal power generating equipment.    Parts of the Shanghai Power Station Equipment Corp will be  turned into joint ventures with the Westinghouse Electric Corp,  which will invest nearly $90 million.    The Harbin Power Station Equipment Corp in Heilongjiang,  China's largest manufacturer in this field, is planning to  establish a joint venture with General Electric Co to produce  gas turbines.</p>

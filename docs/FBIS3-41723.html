Other forms of  diseases that had fallen into oblivion have grown in frequency  as well--tuberculosis of bones, joints and lymph nodes, while  the overall infection rate of the population by Koch's  tubercular bacillus is reaching a once unprecedented  value--70-80 percent.    The disease is selective: It strikes mainly the poor.

Weakened by low-calorie food and avitaminosis,  the body is unable to resist infection.</p>

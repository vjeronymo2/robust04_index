			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S LITTLE DEFENDING RAM SEASON;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: INJURY-WEAKENED DEFENSE HAS EARNED ITS SPOT AS LAST IN NFL.  </P> <P> Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith were part and parcel of the Rams' best-laid plans,  which opposing quarterbacks have made go awry.  </P> <P> The Ram coaches had hoped that Hawkins and Smith, 6-foot-6 second-year  defensive linemen, could step into the middle of the defensive line on pass  downs and cause chaos with their long arms and aggressive play.  </P> <P> Nobody was expecting miracles, but the anticipation was for something more than  the zero sacks and 14 tackles the two injury-weakened defensive linemen have so  far produced.  </P> <P> Now, four games and three defeats into the season, the Ram defense is ranked  last and Hawkins and Smith clearly are feeling the heat.  </P> <P> Just this week, Coach John Robinson called the tandem's lack of progress "the  most disappointing thing" about a disappointing defense.  </P> <P> Without Hawkins and Smith providing an inside push from the tackle spots,  quarterbacks have been free to sit back in the pocket and wait for a receiver  to break clear.  </P> <P> And there is a real sense that until Smith and Hawkins start pushing around  pass blockers, the Rams will be a defense without damage. So the Rams wait,  worry and wonder why.  </P> <P> "Yeah, (there's) definitely a lot of pressure on us to rush the passer," Smith  said. "But that's just how it is. I mean, it has to fall on somebody.  </P> <P> "When things aren't going well, everybody wants to know what's going on or  what's happening or why this isn't getting done or why that isn't getting done.  And the pressure has to be put on somebody. Somebody has to step up and do it."  </P> <P> As the Ram coaches try to come up with a pass rush -- plan more blitzes,  consider moving players around -- Smith says he knows it is still basically up  to him and Hawkins.  </P> <P> "I'm not begging down from it," Smith said. "I feel like I can do it. But so  far it just hasn't been going, for whatever reason, I don't know. I feel the  pressure, but it's not something I'm afraid of."  </P> <P> Hawkins, who attributes almost all of his problems to the knee injury he  suffered at the end of last year and is still limited by it, says he is sure  that the absence of a Ram rush is not permanent.  </P> <P> So far this season, the Rams have only eight sacks and Hawkins, who plays on  most passing downs, has two tackles and no sacks.  </P> <P> "Do I feel like I'm letting down the team?" Hawkins repeated pointedly, "No,  because I'm trying my hardest. I hope they (understand). I think it's more than  just one guy or one position or a couple guys inside.  </P> <P> "You always want to go out there and get 10 sacks, but you can't dwell on the  negatives of it. You've got to keep pushing, keep getting stronger."  </P> <P> Hawkins was the Rams' No. 1 choice from the University of Miami in last year's  draft and played in the first 13 games before hurting his knee. Smith was the  second of three second-round selections that year, coming into the pros as a  rangy stand-up end from Auburn who had to learn how to play defensive tackle.  </P> <P> Both were college-tested sackers, and both seemed to fit a scheme that featured  linebacker Kevin Greene from the outside and tall, strong tackles coming from  the inside.  </P> <P> They were supposed to develop together, transform the Rams from passive to  aggressive. Instead, they have stalled together, and the Rams defense has  stalled with them.  </P> <P> Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said: "The only thing we did do when we  developed the scheme was to say, 'Hey, we've got some young guys we can put in  this spot, make them productive as pass rushers and play the run OK.' And  obviously, we haven't been productive in that area.  </P> <P> "What you're looking for is production. Go in the game and make plays. Get to  the quarterback, tackle the ballcarrier. That's what the deal is."  </P> <P> Hawkins says that up until about three weeks ago, he couldn't even bend the  knee, and was unable to get any kind of push on the pass rush.  </P> <P> He says he is coming along better now but acknowledges that this recovery is  taking far longer than anybody expected and perhaps longer than the Rams can  afford.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going to be ready for mini-camp," Hawkins said. "In the  beginning, up to about three weeks ago, it was the hardest thing I ever went  through.  </P> <P> "But now I'm coming out here, getting the offensive guys mad at me a little  bit. That's when you know you're doing something right."  </P> <P> Robinson kept both Smith, who was nursing a series of little injuries after  suffering a knee injury in the exhibition season, and Hawkins out of practice  the week before the bye weekend, hoping they would come out of that layoff fit  and ready to attack quarterbacks. Then came the Bengals last week, and neither  was a factor.  </P> <P> Now, Robinson seems almost ready to move on without them. Thursday he conceded  that the team isn't going to spotlight the two so much on pass downs and that  fellow second-year defensive tackle Mike Piel, a third-round pick who had a  sack last Sunday, will play more.  </P> <P> "They'll be more integrated in the group, but I think we're going to keep that  group playing," Robinson said. "(But) where we were featuring them to a degree,  (thinking that) hopefully they'll develop into something, now we're kind of  backing off of that."  </P> <P> But Piel, who wasn't a big pass rusher in college, is coming off a serious  elbow injury and is clearly a second choice. Hawkins and Smith were -- and  continue to be -- the Rams' major hope as big-time pass rushers.  </P> <P> "Of course it's disappointing," Smith said. "You like to feel like you're  putting yourself in position to help the team, and we feel like we aren't. It's  just how it goes. When things aren't going well, that's just how it is."  </P></p>

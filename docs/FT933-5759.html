			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (12): Fresh hope of progress - Mining THE ZAMBIAN copper industry is a useful exemplar of mining in Africa. During the late 1950s to the early 1970s there was growth and diversification. The post-colonial era, however, saw an increased state involvement which caused a decline in efficiency and profitability. The 1990s, however, have brought hope of progress. Although statistics are hard to come by, the anecdotal evidence of greater interest in Africa by international resource groups is overwhelming. Most of the work is exploration, but further investment is bound to follow. One reason for the upsurge in interest is that other mining areas are fully exploited. Also, an effective environmental lobby means much of the developed world is becoming increasingly hostile to mining companies. Africa, by contrast, still tolerates some environmental degradation. Favourable policy reforms, however, have also contributed to a healthier investment climate. In Zambia, for example, the government's commitment to market economics and privatisation brought an upsurge in foreign interest. Prospecting licences, mostly for copper and gold, have been issued to Phelps Dodge of the US and South African mining houses including Anglo American, JCI and Anglovaal. In Ghana, liberalised mining investment laws have attracted Dollars 900m of new capital and helped to quadruple the country's gold production to 1m ounces a year since 1986. The government has plans to double production to 2m ounces a year by 1997. Much of the expansion will come from the rich Ashanti mine, but gold deposits in western Ghana have also attracted investors. And in Zimbabwe, Mr Derek Bain of the Chamber of Mines says exploration 'is the greatest it has ever been'. Most hope lies in platinum where BHP, Delta Gold, Anglo, RTZ and Union Carbide all have interests. Mr Alan McKerron, head of Anglo's New mining business division, says the example of Ghana is spreading to other countries. Further bolstering economic liberalisation is the 'conditionality' of multilateral financial bodies. Mr Bernard van Rooyen, executive director of Gold Fields, comments: 'Politicians are increasingly willing, but there is also a degree of compulsion because the only funds are from the World Bank and IFC and you won't get funds if you don't toe the market line.' Mr John Fernyhough, head of South African Sales at SG Warburg in London, argues that there is considerable pent-up interest in Africa among North American mining houses. Given political stability, Mr Fernyhough argues, these companies will pile into Africa. In its 1989 report, sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth, the World Bank concluded: 'Mineral production could (and should) become an important source of growth in many African countries. But this potential will not be fully realised unless a mutually beneficial partnership is established between government and investors.' That partnership may now be taking shape.</p>

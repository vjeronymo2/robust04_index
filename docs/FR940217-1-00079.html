			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary disagrees with this rationale. To ensure that the Title IV, HEA programs are properly administered and Federal funds are safeguarded, the Secretary has always required an institution to demonstrate that it is administratively capable and financially responsible. More and more institutions, however, are employing third-party servicers to administer their programs, thereby delegating responsibility to entities that the Secretary has not reviewed for administrative capability or financial responsibility. Because the Secretary does not directly approve or regulate the qualifications of these servicers, the Secretary believes that it is reasonable to require these servicers to stand behind their work and to be accountable to Federal taxpayers for any losses to Federal funds through the servicer's administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. Moreover, if the issue of liability is left to the discretion of the contracting parties, it is more than likely that some servicers will assume no responsibility for their actions. In proposing direct third-party servicer accountability to the Department of Education, the Secretary believes that institutions employing servicers to administer aspects of their participation in the Title IV, HEA programs would benefit from increased servicer integrity in fulfilling contractual obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the negotiators argued that it would be unreasonable to require a third-party servicer to be prepared to assume liability potentially far in excess of the fees earned by the servicer from the institution. Under this argument, the consequence of requiring third-party servicers to be liable for their actions would be to increase servicing fees charged to institutions and could make it economically impossible, in many cases, for institutions to contract with third parties for services related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The negotiators indicated that in some contracts, institutions specifically give up the right to hold a third-party servicer responsible for the consequences of the servicer's actions in exchange for a lower fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary does not believe that assumption of liability by servicers will make servicers unavailable to institutions. The Secretary believes that most servicers are, or should be, confident enough in the quality of their work to stand behind it financially. To the extent that a third-party servicer is unwilling to assume responsibility, it would seem to indicate that the servicer has no incentive to ensure compliance with the Title IV, HEA program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the negotiators who objected to these proposed provisions claimed that the Department of Education does not impose similar constraints on its own contractors to assume contingent liability for the consequences of their actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary disagrees with this rationale. Those that contract with the Department of Education have different and more rigorous requirements imposed on them, both in their selection by the Department and in contracts into which the Department enters to ensure the proper use of Federal funds. The Secretary is able to select the Department of Education's contractors and retains the ability directly to enforce contractual provisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an effort to respond to these objections during the negotiated rulemaking sessions, the Secretary suggested a compromise that would have limited joint and several liability of a third-party servicer for violations by the servicer of Title IV, HEA program requirements, in cases where the servicer was not an affiliate of the institution with which the servicer contracts. In those cases, joint and several liability would be capped at the fees and compensation received by the servicer from the institution during the period for which the liability is assessed. The Secretary suggested that, for the purposes of this section, an affiliate could be construed as a third-party servicer that_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is a parent or subsidiary corporation of the institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Shares a person who exercises substantial control over the institution and servicer as defined in &sect;668.13; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Shares a common owner, partner, or officer with the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary suggested this alternate language to decrease the financial risk for servicers that are not related parties to the institutions with which they contract. However, the Secretary believes that servicers that are linked to institutions should be fully accountable to prevent shielding of liability by shifting services to an affiliate. The Secretary invited reaction from the non-Federal negotiators on whether this compromise would sufficiently guard the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs by providing the Secretary the means to ensure that a liability is repaid and the violation contributing to that liability is redressed and alleviate any legitimate objections raised by the negotiators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other negotiators did not accept the Secretary's offered compromise. Some negotiators would not agree to assumption of any liability by a third-party servicer. Thus, there was no consensus on this matter. Because consensus was not reached on either proposal, the Secretary is under no obligation to modify the position originally taken at the start of the negotiated rulemaking sessions. The Secretary therefore proposes regulations consistent with the position taken at the start of negotiated rulemaking because the Secretary believes that this proposal will best provide the greatest protection for Federal tax dollars in the form of Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because the issue of joint and several liability was debated throughout the negotiated rulemaking sessions without resulting in consensus, the Secretary invites specific comment on this issue, and in particular on the Secretary's compromise rejected by the non-Federal negotiators, as explained previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

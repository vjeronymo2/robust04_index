			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRANE HITS OVERPASS AND CLOSURE TIES UP FREEWAYS  </P> <P> Rush hour traffic was snarled for hours on the Golden State and Simi Valley  freeways Tuesday because a large earth excavator on a transporter truck hit an  overpass in Sun Valley, seriously damaging the structure, the California  Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> The truck was traveling south on the Golden State Freeway at the junction with  the Hollywood Freeway shortly after 2:30 p.m. when it hit an overpass, knocking  off pieces of concrete, CHP Officer Howard Daily said.  </P> <P> There were no injuries.  </P> <P> All but one lane of the southbound Golden State Freeway were closed at the  junction.  </P> <P> The transition road leading from the northbound Hollywood to the northbound  Golden State Freeway was closed to keep motorists off the damaged overpass.  </P> <P> Southbound traffic on the Golden State Freeway backed up for about three miles  and was diverted to the southbound Hollywood Freeway, while motorists on the  northbound Hollywood freeway were diverted at Sheldon Street to relieve  congestion, Daily said.  </P> <P> Traffic on the eastbound Simi Valley Freeway was also congested for about a  mile west of the juncture with the Golden State.  </P> <P> The truck driver, Marty Thurmon, said he was transporting a 75-ton shovel for  construction excavations from Sacramento to San Juan Capistrano when it slammed  into the overpass while the truck was traveling about 50 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Thurmon said he had a Caltrans permit to travel that route, indicating that the  load was not too tall for the overpasses on it, and added that no signs were  posted near the overpass specifying height restrictions.  </P> <P> Caltrans spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli said she did not know if Thurmon had been  issued a permit to carry the load or if signs with height information were  posted.  </P> <P> "If he had a permit, he would have known what areas to avoid. . . . I don't  know what information the driver had," she said.  </P> <P> Tiritilli said she had no estimate of the cost of the damage.  </P></p>

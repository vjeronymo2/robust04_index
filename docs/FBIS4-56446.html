			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 3  May.    Despite the purchase of electricity from Panama, electricity  rationing in Tegucigalpa will be increased by 30 minutes this  week. This is evident by the periodic outage report the National  Enterprise for Electric Power, ENEE, has published. The report  indicates the outages will be for periods of five hours. The  ENEE has also announced outages on Sundays for San Pedro Sula,  Villanueva, La Ceiba, Choluteca, and San Lorenzo, areas that  previously had been unaffected. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE  HONDURAS in Spanish 25 April 94 p 4)    Yesterday, the finance and public credit minister and the  president of the Central Bank of Honduras announced a 10-percent  tax on certain luxury items in order to combat a fiscal deficit  that is approximately 12 percent. No date has been set yet for  application of this tax. (San Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish 26  April 94 p 3)</p>

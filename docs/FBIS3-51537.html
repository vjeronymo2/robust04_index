			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio in </F> Guatemala City -- live or recorded]    [Text] People of Guatemala, in response to recent events,  which are an attempt to create anxiety and instability in the  country, and as president of the Republic and the person  responsible for preserving public order, I must inform you of  the following:    1. I will not permit, for any reason or motive, small groups  interested in creating an atmosphere of intimidation through the  escalation of actions that violate the law and the de jure state  to interrupt the effort initiated by the government and people  to set this country on the path which will make it a truly  democratic state.    2. It is evident that the government's and people's efforts  are achieving consolidation, and the reaction of these small  groups is to use terrorism, intimidation, and attacks, among  other methods, against state institutions and organizations, and  what is even worse, against the news media, thereby violating  the sacred right to freedom of expression and the human,  individual, and collective right to inform and be informed.  These extremist, radical groups, composed of sick and  reactionary minds, know they have no valid arguments whatsoever  to interrupt a process which, moreover, is irreversible and will  lead us to the achievement of a different Guatemala.    3. The Guatemalan people have left behind the obscure pages  of their history. We no longer want to pay with human lives as  we regrettably did just a few hours ago. It is necessary for us  to keep in mind that only a few days ago the government of the  Republic and the General Command of the Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity, with the United States as witness, signed  an agreement to resume the peace negotiations, thereby  demonstrating our political resolve and pledge to achieve peace  in 1994.    4. The eminently positive reaction there has been to the  upcoming popular consultation will strengthen state  organizations. This is not advantageous for certain groups whose  position is not precisely institutional, and which have  misinformed and confused the population. They have even taken  advantage of these terrorist acts to create a negative image of  the government and, obviously, to attempt to create  confrontations between state organizations.    5. I will not accept or tolerate such games because the  Executive Branch, representing the Guatemalan people, is trying  to purge Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice. As a  president who is aware of his duties, I have chosen the most  difficult path: the legal and peaceful path. This is why I want  to achieve this goal through a popular consultation instead of  creating a situation which the terrorists are trying to make the  people believe exists.    6. It is the belief of my government, which has inspired the  popular consultation, that it is necessary to build a society  which will accept the existence of a variety of ideas and the  discussion of opposing points of view or, basically, a society  which, within a climate of respect and confidence in the law and  institutions, will accept these elements as a necessity in the  de jure state we are building.    7. It is for this reason that we are determined to preserve  the continuity of this process by adopting the legal and  constitutional measures that circumstances may render necessary,  and to achieve peace and guarantee public order based on the  principle that it is the state's duty to preserve itself.  Therefore, the Executive Branch will protect and maintain  institutional order, and incidents like these will not alter the  people's participation in the public consultation, let alone its  results. Thank you very much.</p>

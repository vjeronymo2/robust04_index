			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / US backs open competition among multimedia groups The US administration yesterday offered telecommunications and information companies a new and simpler regulatory structure in exchange for their help in building an 'information superhighway' to which every hospital, library and classroom would have access. Vice-president Al Gore, in a speech trumpeted by the White House for weeks, threw the administration's weight behind open competition in the emerging field of multimedia information services between telephone and cable television companies. He promised to introduce legislation to encourage private sector investment in a new 'information infrastructure' while ensuring 'universal access' for all Americans to the new services that are expected to develop. 'This administration will not let existing regulatory structures impede or distort the evolution of the communications industry,' Mr Gore told communications and entertainment company executives in Los Angeles. Mr Gore endorsed the principles of legislation already proposed in Congress that would ease the restrictions imposed by the 1982 court judgment which broke up the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly into 'Baby Bell' companies providing local telephone services and a separate AT&amp;T offering long-distance services. Separate bills would allow the seven Bell companies, which since the court-imposed break-up of the AT&amp;T monopoly have operated under tight restrictions, to start manufacturing telecommunications equipment and provide long-distance telephone services. Some of the restrictions on cross-ownership between the telephone and cable television industry sectors would be repealed. To achieve 'regulatory symmetry', the administration will propose regulations that give communications companies greater freedom if they are willing to guarantee 'non-discriminatory access' to their networks for all service providers. This so-called 'Title 7' provision would allow companies offering telephone, television and other services to operate under a unified code, avoiding conflicts between current regulations which contain separate rules for cable providers and telephone service providers. No companies would currently qualify for Title 7's terms, White House officials said. The plan would transfer regulatory power from the courts to the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department. 'Our legislative package will contain provisions designed to ensure that each telephone carrier's networks will be readily accessible to other users,' Mr Gore said.

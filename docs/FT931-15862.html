			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / International Company News: Siemens, Philips end cable venture talks TALKS between Siemens of Germany and Philips of the Netherlands which would have led to joint ventures in telecommunications cables and optical fibres, have been abandoned, the two companies groups said yesterday. The Dutch company blamed falling prices, arguing 'the underlying economics are no longer attractive', but would not be drawn on plans for the future of its two businesses. Siemens said the talks had fallen through because of a variety of reasons. A spokesman said: 'Economic conditions have changed in the 13 months we have been negotiating this deal.' The German company made it clear, however, that it expected its cable business, second in Europe to Alcatel of France, would continue to grow strongly. It had sales of about DM2bn (Dollars 1.2bn) last year, about 30 per cent ahead of the preceding year. 'We have no need to look for partners to fulfil our market goals,' a Siemens spokesman said. 'We have a number of big projects here in Germany and respectable growth in other countries.' Philips' activities in telecommunications cables and optical fibres generate annual turnover of Fl 550m (Dollars 307.2m). A spokesman said turnover growth in the sectors had been flat in 1992, underlining the company's argument that prices were weakening.</p>

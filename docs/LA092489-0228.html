			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> "THE GODS MUST BE CRAZY II" -- In a story in last Sunday's Business section  about entertainment executive Jerry Weintraub, "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" was  included in lists of Weintraub-distributed films that have not generated  significant revenue at the box office. In fact, "The Gods Must Be Crazy II" is  drawing healthy box-office results in Europe but has not yet been released in  the United States.  </P></p>

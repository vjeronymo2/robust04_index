			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (13): Sell-offs gather pace - The banks THE long-awaited overhaul of the Polish banking system moved into higher gear in April with the successful privatisation of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK). The sale to foreign and domestic investors was welcomed by Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the Polish finance minister, as the first big commercial bank privatisation in the whole of central and eastern Europe. Next in line for privatisation is Bank Slaski, the Silesian bank, which like WBK is one of nine former regional branches of the Narodowy Bank Polski (BNP), the central bank, which were hived off in 1988 and have since been groomed for their eventual debut as the core of a revitalised commercial banking system. The past three years have seen a rapid growth in private banks, but most remain small and are finding survival difficult. A few have already failed, the most spectacular being the ART-B bank which left a hole of about Dollars 500m behind it and led to an urgent strengthening of central bank supervisory procedures under a new president, Ms Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz. The central bank showed its concern about the dangers posed by the proliferation of small, under-capitalised private banks when it mounted a prompt lifeboat operation to protect depositors in the First National Bank of Lublin following a two day run on the bank last year. The recent takeover of the small Lodz Development Bank by BIG-Bank, one of the first of the new private banks, was a sign that a consolidation process, encouraged by the monetary authorities, is under way. Last year the nine commercial banks hived off from the national bank, and the six specialised banks such as Bank Handlowy, the foreign trade bank, were again the most profitable banks and those most trusted by depositors. But margins of all banks are coming under pressure. Extensive training and computerisation programmes are raising costs while lower interest rates and a greater concentration on low risk but low-yielding government paper are reducing spreads and therefore income. The biggest problem facing most banks however remains the high level of non-performing loans and bad debts from loss-making enterprises. A recent study by Professor Stanislaw Gomulka of the London School of Economics showed that the bad debt problem is heavily concentrated in 11 per cent of Polish enterprises which account for 61 per cent of total bank debt. Thus far, although most loss-making enterprises in the state sector have sold assets and reduced their labour force, few have been closed, and their debts remain on the books. The World Bank recently approved a Dollars 450m loan to help restructure the banks and up to Dollars 600m is also available from the original Dollars 1bn stabilisation fund provided by western governments in 1990 to support the zloty but never used. Some of these funds will be used to finance the restructuring of Poland's foreign debt, some to provide interest bearing bonds to replace enterprise debt writedowns in bank balance sheets. Providing the banks with fresh capital is also one of the main aims of the bank privatisation programme. The WBK privatisation, with Schroders, the City merchant bank, as advisers in close co-operation with Coopers Lybrand, the accountancy firm, raised 200bn zlotys for the treasury through the public offer of 20 per cent of the shares to small private investors. The small investor tranche was heavily over-subscribed. A further 7.2 per cent was allocated to large investors, both domestic and foreign, while 14.3 per cent of shares was reserved for employees with the treasury retaining 30 per cent. From the WBK point of view the most important element in the privatisation was the 28.5 per cent stake taken by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) through the purchase of new shares. This meant a 210bn zloty (Dollars 12.7m) injection of new capital. Critics of the deal, inside the bank and outside, complain that the offer price of shares was too low, that more shares should have been made available to Poles and that more effort should have been made to find a foreign commercial bank rather than the EBRD as a partner. But the price was agreed before the subsequent general rise in share prices on the Warsaw stock exchange while the treasury took the view that, with several other banks in the privatisation pipeline, it was essential to make the first privatisation a success for small investors. The willingness of the EBRD to step in where foreign commercial banks have proved reluctant to tread reflects the wait-and-see attitude of foreign banks and the relatively limited inflow of equity investment generally into Poland. The expectation is that this reticence will dissipate once Poland secures an agreement on the restructuring of its Dollars 12.1bn debt with the London Club of commercial bank creditors to match the two-stage 50 per cent reduction in its Dollars 33bn Paris Club debt reached in 1991. Citibank of the US and Creditanstalt of Austria have been the first foreign banks to open branches in Poland and some German banks are believed to have bought relatively small packets of shares in Poznan-based WBK which is active in western Poland and has the highest number of Polish-German joint ventures. Several banks have representative offices and US, German, Dutch and French banks are preparing to set up new branches. Meanwhile, the strongest Polish banks are increasing their reserves and raising their capital adequacy ratios. Bank Handlowy, which has lost its former monopoly of foreign trade financing but expects to retain a 60 per cent share of this overall expanding business, added Dollars 150m to its capital base last year after raising net profit to around 5,000bn zlotys (Dollars 312m) from 1,400bn zlotys in 1991, Mr Cesary Stypulkowski, the bank's young US-trained chairman says. Bank Handlowy's higher profitability bucked the general trend to lower profits from narrower spreads, higher costs and greater competition which characterised the bulk of the banking sector. Faced with heavy losses on loans to the fledgling private sector most banks have reduced lending to the risky, but capital starved, private sector. They have opted increasingly to invest deposits in less risky but lower margin government bonds. The long term aim of bank restructuring is to improve the banks' capacity to evaluate risks, raise capital adequacy ratios and increase the banking system's ability to perform its main task. That is to help finance the development of a dynamic private sector whose capacity for future growth will be largely determined by access to affordable loans from competent banks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Sumitomo Bank chief Toshio  Morikawa took over as industry leader Tuesday [26 April],  acknowledging complaints about his own bank and vowing to win  back trust in Japan's banks.    The Sumitomo bank president became chairman of the  Federation  of Bankers Associations of Japan, replacing Tadashi Okuda,  president of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, at the end of his one-year  term.    Morikawa told his first news conference as federation  chairman that he wants a review of the "firewall" regulating the  subsidiaries of banks and brokerages as they move into each  other's turf.    He made no specific proposals but called for development  along the lines of government directives allowing the banking  and securities industries to make their first tentative forays  into each other's business areas.    Banks are allowed into bond underwriting but are barred from  dealing in bonds and remain restricted from stock trading.    Asked about the economy, Morikawa said it is still too early  to declare a recovery, saying, "it will take some time to  confirm that the economy has hit bottom."    Referring to Japan's political turmoil, he said, "I don't  really understand political movements but I hope for political  stability as soon as possible," noting such issues as the  overdue budget for fiscal 1994, which started this month.    He said that as federation head he wants to "aim for closer  involvement between banks, and their customers and society."    In an earlier interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Morikawa  acknowledged that Sumitomo Bank has a "bad image" with the  public, vowing to improve the bank's stature while "regaining  public trust" in the industry itself as it battles the woes  incurred through the speculative excesses of the late 1980s.    Banks must continue writing off the mountain of bad debts  left when loans soured as the value of land and other assets  backing the loans collapsed with the bursting of the speculative  "bubble," Morikawa said.    Japanese banks must also go forward on the issues of risk  management and disclosure, he said.    "Under increased competition through the spate of financial  deregulations, our industry must pin its efforts on taxing its  ingenuity and as a result stimulating the economy," he told  KYODO.    Morikawa rejected criticism that banks are unwilling to lend  to creditworthy borrowers because of the bad-loan overhang.  "There's no such linkage," he said.    "We are strongly willing to boost lending in connection with  bad loans," he said. "Indeed, we must increase our core  earnings to promote the writeoff of bad loans."    Banks are not taking an "unnecessarily strict stance" in  lending, Morikawa said, but are pulling back from the lax  "lending conditions of the so-called bubble boom that deviated  from the normal posture."    Another major headache for banks is the final phase of  liberalization of interest rates, pitting private banks against  the huge postal savings system in the fight for depositors.    Morikawa vowed to continue the federation's fight against  the  postal system's "unreasonable" drawing of customers through  interest rates fixed at higher levels than those of banks.    Rates on government-backed postal deposits should "follow  the  average private rate" and not become the "price leader,"  Morikawa said, urging renegotiation of an April 8 agreement that  temporarily sets ordinary postal deposit rates about 1  percentage point above those offered by banks.    As he assumed the role of the "face" of Japan's overall  banking industry, Morikawa also acknowledged public  dissatisfaction with Sumitomo Bank, which recently ranked third  in a financial magazine's list of banks that leaving bad  impressions with the public.    "I regret and am taking seriously such a bad image as  revealed in various surveys," said Morikawa, the first Sumitomo  chief to head the federation. "We want to clear the negative  image as soon as possible, but frankly, some days and months  will be necessary."    He told KYODO the problem stemmed from Sumitomo "traditions"  of aggressively seeking the top spot in short-term profits while  "neglecting our basic business principle of satisfying  customers."    "But we are not movie stars and are not thinking of creating  an image to attract people," he added.    Morikawa said he hopes his schedule will allow him to attend  an October gathering in Madrid of bankers from around the world,  but he lamented that his new duties will likely further cut into  his few leisure pursuits -- driving to nearby spots like Hakone  and taking time for his "lousy golf game."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a reliable source, a group of 12  unidentified persons opened fire on Nim Kimsam, killing him and  wounding Hun Mav as the two were riding on a motorcycle.    The killing took place in Prek Tuok village, Khporp Ta Nguon  commune, in Kompong Cham Province's Stoeng Trang District.    According to a report by Kompong Cham provincial officials,  Nim Kimsam was en route to his home town to attend his younger  sister's wedding.    No motive for the killing has been provided or affirmed by  any source. Some sources say that Nim Kimsam was an Interior  Ministry bodyguard -- part of Samdech Hun Sen's bodyguard group  -- and that he was gunned down with AK rifles by the  unidentified group of people while riding a motorcycle to visit  friends in his hometown.    It has not yet been determined if Nim Kimsam's murder was  motivated by revenge or something else.    The authorities are investigating to unmask the murderers  and  forward the files to the tribunal.</p>

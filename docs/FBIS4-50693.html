			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Chinese Economic News" column: "Certain Preferential </F> Policies on Enterprises' Income Tax"]    [Text] The Ministry of Finance and the State General  Administration of Taxation issued a notice a few days ago  revoking all preferential enterprise tax policies, except for  those which are strongly related to certain policies, have an  impact on many sectors, and are conducive to economic  development and social stability, which will remain in force  after being scrutinized and defined. The notice stressed that  with immediate effect, no localities and departments have the  authority to draft preferential enterprise tax policies.    Those preferential policies which remain in force and have  been newly defined mainly benefit:    -- Enterprises based in State Council-approved high and new  technological development and production zones and recognized by  the concerned departments as being involved in high and new  technology. These enterprises may enjoy a 15 percent reduction  in tax. High and new technology enterprises located in State  Council-approved high and new technology development and  production zones may enjoy a two-year tax moratorium beginning  with the year the enterprise starts production.    -- Scientific research units and colleges, which may be  provisionally exempted from tax on income earned from  technological transfers, technical training programs, technical  consultation and services, and contracted technical services  commissioned by or provided to industries.    -- Newly founded, independently audited firms or units  involved in consultancy (including consultancy on science and  technology, law, accounting, auditing, taxation), information  industry, and technical services. These firms and units may be  exempted from tax for two years, beginning with the first day  they open for business. Newly founded and independently audited  firms or units involved in transport and post and  telecommunications industries may be exempted from tax in the  first year, beginning with the first day they open for business,  and may enjoy a 50 percent tax reduction in the second year.  Newly founded and independently audited firms or units involved  in public utilities, commerce, material supply, foreign trade,  tourism, warehousing, residents' services, catering services,  and educational, cultural, and public health services may,  subject to approval by the responsible tax authorities, be  exempted from tax in their first year, beginning on the first  day of business. Tax reduction calculations for newly founded  tertiary-production enterprises with diversified trading are  based on their main line of business.    -- Enterprises and non-profitmaking institutions. Income  earned from technological transfers and technical consultancy,  services, and training arising in the course of technological  transfers by these bodies is provisionally exempt from tax if  the net annual amount is less than 300,000 yuan. Any portion  above the 300,000-yuan limit is taxed according to relevant laws.    -- Enterprises hit by typhoons, fires, floods, earthquakes,  and other natural disasters. With approval from the responsible  tax authorities, these enterprises may have their taxes reduced  or waived for one year. Township and town enterprises thus  afflicted may get a 10 percent reduction in taxable income, and  the money thus saved can then be spent on social relief; in this  case, the method of levying 10 percent of taxable income in  advance will be suspended.    The policy of waiving tax on income earned from outside the  borders by newly founded companies working on overseas contracts  will continue to be in force until the end of 1995.    The above preferential policies came into effect on 1 April  1994. Enterprises may continue to enjoy tax reductions  previously granted by the now revoked preferential policies  until the end of their terms.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>   [Text] In a communique issued to the media this afternoon,  the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] accused the  Mozambican Government of maintaining and sustaining what it  described as small groups of armed men in Milange District,  Zambezia Province. Reacting to the accusations, Teodato  Hunguana, assistant government chief negotiator at the  Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] of the General Peace  Accord, said what is currently being noticed in Zambezia  Province, and which concerns the government, is the existence  and activities of an armed movement entitled Rombezia, which  wants to divide the country in two.    Hunguana said both the Zambezia Provincial Government and  the  central government are investigating the existence of this  group. He said the case must not concern just the government but  also Renamo and everyone else, since national unity is at stake.    In a communique this afternoon read by Rahil Khan, spokesman  of the Renamo Information Department, Afonso Dhlakama's movement  points out that the alleged armed groups in Zambezia Province  must be disarmed by the government. The communique said the  armed groups are led directly by Gimo Phiri, the first leader of  the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], which belongs to the  Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] and not Mr. Carlos Reis'  Unamo.    In an interview with Radio Mozambique this afternoon,  Minister Teodato Hunguana was asked to comment on the communique.    [Begin recording] [Hunguana] Well, the only comment I can  make is that in Zambezia Province we are very concerned with the  existence of an armed group called Rombezia which wants to  divide the country. This is one of our main concerns in  Zambezia Province. The other concern is the infiltration into  Zambezia Province of armed Young Pioneers from Malawi. This is  our second major concern.    [Matos] Mr. Minister, how many men does Rombezia have, more  or less?    [Hunguana] Well, we still do not have exact, confirmed  figures, but we have information that there are hundreds of men.    [Matos] And who is their leader, Mr. Minister?    [Hunguana] We do not yet have all the information, but we do  know that the group's objective is to divide the country, thus  endangering national unity. [end recording]    Elsewhere in its communique, Renamo also points out that the  government has transferred about 8,000 troops and members of the  People's National Security Service to the police force.  Consequently, it calls on the government to present their list  officially. The communique also alleges that all these men were  transferred to the police force, along with their weapons, such  as bazookas, AK47's, and tanks. The communique says in order to  calm the people, the government must act in good faith.    Rahil Khan did not present proof for his allegations  regarding the police, pointing out that the time was not ripe.  Minister Teodato Hunguana said Renamo is engaged in yet another  political maneuever by creating phantoms. He said this issue  has already been discussed in depth and resolved in meetings  between the president of the Republic and the Renamo leader who  agreed, among other things, on the presence of an international  police contingent to work with the national police.</p>

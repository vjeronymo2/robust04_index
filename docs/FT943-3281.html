			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Bundesbank 'shifts into neutral': A likely halt in Frankfurt to cuts in interest rates The Bundesbank has decided to stand firm against further cuts in its key interest rates for the time being, with the next move, which may well be delayed until next year, as likely to be up as down. The fortnightly meeting of the German central bank's policy-making council today is not expected to make any changes to monetary policy. Remarks by Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank's deputy president, give the strong impression that the discount and Lombard rates - 4.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively - are set to stay put for some months. The same may also apply to the repurchase (or 'repo') rate, which has been fixed at 4.85 per cent since late July. Making clear that the central bank still holds fast to its money supply target, although its M3 goal has little chance of being reached this year, he said it was important to allay concern in bond markets about German inflation. The D-Mark strengthened on his comments. 'We have no reason to swerve from our stability-oriented policy,' he said in Frankfurt on Tuesday night. The latest strengthening of the economy had occurred amid interest rate conditions previously thought to be too stringent, but 'this shows that they were not too stringent', he said. Thus, he added, 'There is no reason in such a situation to take steps that could raise fears that the Bundesbank is setting the rudder in a direction that would be understood as expansionary.' He also dismissed any suggestion that the Bundesbank could try to pacify markets by setting its next securities repurchase rate - the bank refinancing transactions through which it steers money markets - at 4.80 per cent instead of 4.85 per cent, the level at which it yesterday announced a further tender. 'This would provoke the question - 'why 4.80 instead of 4.85 per cent?' This would be difficult as it would have to be justified and it could not be on the basis of developments in the money supply.' The last cut in rates was in May, when the discount and Lombard rates came down by half a percentage point. That cut was made to help move the liabilities of banks away from short-term deposits (included in M3, the broad monetary aggregate) into longer-term funds. This reason no longer applied, said Mr Gaddum. The latest M3 data showed a slowdown in growth, though the rate of increase was still 9.8 per cent in August, well above the target range of between 4 and 6 per cent for 1994. Thus, said Mr Gaddum, the M3 trend was 'still not satisfactory'. Some economists in Frankfurt charge the Bundesbank with having strayed too far from its traditional adherence to money supply objectives. They say any future moves in interest rates should be upwards. The Bundesbank would probably choose the first quarter of next year to decide when to tighten, said Mr Thomas Mayer, Goldman Sachs' Frankfurt-based economist. 'A further cut cannot be ruled out, but it is very unlikely.' Mr Gaddum's comment showed, he added, that 'the Bundesbank has shifted its gears into neutral'. Other members of the Bundesbank's seven-man directorate - the core of its policy-making council - also feel there is no need for further rate cuts after those in May helped decrease the annualised rate of M3 growth from an alarming 15.4 per cent in March. At the same time, there should be no need to raise interest rates to curb credit growth either, they argue. Loans to finance housing and construction, previously stimulated by the impending removal of tax breaks, are growing more slowly. Industry demand for credits will rise as the economy recovers, but the effect on credit expansion should be moderated by companies' improved cash flow. Some economists also argue, on the basis of revisions to economic statistics for the previous two years, that economic overheating after the post-unification surge in growth was greater than thought. So last year's downturn merely brought the economy back on to its longer-term trend. Correspondingly, there is no significant economic slack, particularly after the unexpectedly large jump of 1 per cent in gross domestic product during the second quarter of 1994. These economists expect that the Bundesbank - with some dissenting voices from the regional governors on the council - will regard this as another reason not to lower interest rates further. They expect it to incline towards trying to bring inflation down from the August rate of 3 per cent towards its goal of 2 per cent, particularly in view of the 0.2 per cent rise in wholesale prices in August over July, announced yesterday. Mr Gaddum spoke sternly and robustly about the Bundesbank's commitment to curbing prices and pursuing money supply goals. 'M3 is still the most important indicator - not the only one, but the most important one,' he said.</p>

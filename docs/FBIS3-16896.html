			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F> Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky]    [Text] Armenia favors a peaceful solution to the regional  conflict through peace talks involving Azerbaijan,  Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Russia as well as European  countries and the U.S., Deputy Speaker of Parliament Ara Saakyan  told Interfax. However, he said that unconditional cease-fire  should precede any such talks.    Saakyan said that unlike Azerbaijan which insists on the  withdrawal of Armenian forces from occupied Azeri lands as a  condition for cease-fire, Nagorno-Karabakh demands an end to the  fighting and definition of its status first.    In his words, Yerevan is laying great hopes on Russia's  peace  effort in the region.    In the meantime, the continued differences between Yerevan  and Baku had prevented the CIS interparliamentary assembly  meeting in St. Petersburg over the weekend from adopting an  appeal on CIS states not to resort to transport or energy  blockade against each other.    Leader of the Azeri parliamentary delegation Afiyaddin  Jalilov spoke of 20 percent of Azeri territory being annexed by  Karabakh Armenians calling to include into the final paper a  provision for Armenian pullout and the return of more than a  million Azeri refugees to their homes.</p>

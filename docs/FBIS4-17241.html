In September of the  same year, the initiative group of the communist movement began  its activities. Organizational work was conducted in Tbilisi in  September and October and in other towns and rayons in November  and December.    At its constituent conference held in Tbilisi in February  1992, the Georgian Workers' Socialist Party was formed on the  basis of the Georgian Communist Party, the "Stalin" Society, and  the Georgian Union of Communists. [passage omitted]    On 10 April 1994, a regular plenum of the Georgian Workers'  Socialist Party was held. There were two questions on the  agenda: Introducing changes to the name of the party and  organizational [passage indistinct]    The plenum decreed:    1. To replace the word "Socialist" in the party's name by  "Communist" and to rename the party the Georgian Communist Party.    2. The plenum recognized it as expedient to reduce the size  of both the bureau and the secretariat. The bureau was reduced  to 15 members and the secretariat to five. [passage omitted]    Following the April plenum, the Georgian Workers' Socialist  Party nominated a group of comrades. They convened a  constituent conference and announced the creation of the Union  of Communists. They elected comrade Sergo Rigvava as the union's  first secretary, Karlo Gardapkhadze as second secretary, and  Mikheil Chachukashvili as secretary. The Union of Communists  was registered in the Ministry of Justice in January 1994.    In January 1994, the Georgian Workers' Socialist Party held  a  plenum at which, at the request and on the decision of the  absolute majority of the party's members, the name of the party  was again changed. It was now decided to remove the word  "Workers'" from the party's name and call it: the Georgian  Communist Party.    The rules of the Georgian Communist Party were published in  the first edition of KOMMUNISTI (19 March 1994).    The Georgian Communist Party has been legalized. The  registration of the party's members and the acceptance of new  members is currently underway. At the same time, work has begun  on preparing the Georgian Communist Party plenum that should  unite all parties with a socialist orientation under the banner  of the Georgian Communist Party.    As promised, the KOMMUNISTI newspaper is ready to render a  service to all parties with a socialist orientation and publish  important information on their activities that has been approved  by them.

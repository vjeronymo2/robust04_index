			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. MCKERNAN AND REP. SNOWE WED IN MAINE  </P> <P> Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. and Maine's only congresswoman, Olympia J. Snowe,  exchanged marriage vows Friday in a private ceremony attended by about 100  friends and relatives.  </P> <P> "It was wonderful," Snowe said as the newlyweds talked briefly with reporters  outside the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity. Snowe is of Greek  descent.  </P> <P> "We walked around the table four times -- we did it so well, we did it an extra  time," McKernan said, jokingly referring to the ceremonial walk that is part of  the traditional wedding ritual.  </P> <P> No governor and member of Congress have ever married while both were in office,  according to records checked by the Associated Press.  </P> <P> The ceremony in Maine's second-largest city, adjacent to Snowe's hometown of  Auburn, consummated a romance the two have quietly maintained for a decade.  </P> <P> The two met as Republican members of the Maine House of Representatives and  served together as the state's two representatives in the U.S. House in the  early 1980s.  </P> <P> McKernan, 40, was divorced from his first wife in 1978. Snowe, 42, was widowed  in 1973 when her first husband was killed in a car crash. The governor has an  18-year-old son.  </P> <P> The couple planned to fly on a friend's plane to New York City for a honeymoon  weekend. After that, they will travel to Washington, where McKernan will attend  a national governors' conference and Snowe will tend to her congressional  duties.  </P> <P> About 7,500 people have been invited to a March 4 reception at the Augusta  Civic Center; the tab will be covered by leftover funds from Snowe's last  campaign.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> COLD HITS DEEP SOUTH; FLORIDA GETS SNOW  </P> <P> Bitter cold swept into the Deep South, dropping snow on Dixie and plunging  temperatures below freezing as far south as Florida. The National Weather  Service said the cold wave stretched from northern Minnesota and New England to  central Texas and the Florida Panhandle. Snow fell in northern Florida and a  quarter-inch was reported at Demopolis, Ala. Freeze warnings were posted over  northern and east-central Florida, and advisories were posted across Georgia  for record-breaking cold and below-zero wind chills. The weather service said  low temperature records would be broken or tied over much of Arkansas also. In  Tennessee, nearly 2 feet of snow fell in the Great Smoky Mountains, closing the  heavily traveled Highway 441. In Memphis, the temperature fell to 17 degrees,  breaking a record that had stood for a century.  </P></p>

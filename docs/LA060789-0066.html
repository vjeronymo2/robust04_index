			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, BHUTTO AGREE TO SEEK AFGHAN PEACE;  </P> <P> PAKISTANI LEADER, IN U.S., DENIES REBEL MILITARY VICTORY IS GOAL  </P> <P> President Bush, after meeting in private for nearly an hour with Pakistani  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, pledged Tuesday that the United States will  "explore any serious avenue" to a political solution to the bloody military  stalemate in war-torn Afghanistan.  </P> <P> In a separate statement during an official White House ceremony after their  meeting, Bhutto stressed that her nation also "remains committed to a political  solution of the Afghan problem," principally because "Pakistan's commitment to  peace and democracy are fundamental."  </P> <P> The statements of the two leaders came after several months of military  failures by the Afghan resistance, which has been financed and armed by the  United States and Pakistan. The issue highlighted a day of intensive meetings  between Bhutto and several U.S. Cabinet officials on subjects ranging from  nuclear bombs and F-16 jet fighters to heroin and trade tariffs.  </P> <P> Senior Pakistani officials said Bhutto, who is increasingly dubious about the  Afghan rebels' ability to win the war militarily, went into the meetings with  several specific proposals for a possible political settlement. The conflict  has claimed more than 1 million lives and left more than 3 million Afghans in  refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan.  </P> <P> Pakistani and U.S. officials refused to comment on the specific options, but  Bhutto expressed her nation's strong concern about the situation after the  White House session.  </P> <P> Although the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February has  brought a "welcome change" in the country, she said, "the continued fighting  and prolonged presence of over 3.5 million Afghan refugees pose serious threats  to the peace and stability of the region."  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times before leaving on her five-day U.S. visit, which  ends Saturday, Bhutto said she would focus her efforts here on trying "to  dispel the notion" that Pakistan wants the rebels to achieve a military victory  over the Afghan government forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Army General Transferred  </P> <P> Earlier, Bhutto transferred the chief of her military intelligence service, an  army general who was widely seen as a hawk in the conflict.  </P> <P> "The Afghan policy is constantly under review because, for Pakistan, it is an  issue that impinges very deeply," Bhutto said in the interview.  </P> <P> There was no hint Tuesday, though, that the continuing arms shipments to the  rebels will cease, and senior officials from both countries said Tuesday night  that it is essential to maintain military presure on the Afghan regime while  they formulate a political settlement. A CIA-financed arms pipeline has  funneled $2 billion in weapons to the rebels since the Soviets invaded  Afghanistan in 1979 to support the Kabul government.  </P> <P> One senior Bush Administration official told reporters that there had been no  significant shift in the two countries' Afghan policy, stressing that Bush  continues to call the current Soviet-backed government of Afghan President  Najibullah an "illegitimate regime."  </P> <P> In another key area of bilateral concern, though, Bhutto did get a concrete  commitment: Pakistan's renewed campaign to curb heroin production in a nation  that now supplies about half the heroin sold on the streets of America.  </P> <P> The State Department pledged $1.5 million in new aid to help finance a  $2.5-million Pakistani strike force that would be trained to go after what one  Pakistani narcotics official estimates to be 500 illegal drug syndicates and  150 laboratories operating in autonomous tribal areas along the border with  Afghanistan.  </P> <P> The Pakistanis had requested a total of $8 million in new U.S. aid for the  strike force, but one narcotics official said "at least this is a start."  </P> <P> Both the prime minister and Bush stressed in their official statements that the  heroin issue, which Bush called "a scourge," figured prominently in their  talks. They added that other key issues discussed included Pakistan's request  to purchase 60 sophisticated F-16 fighter jets to add to its current fleet of  40 -- a proposal that most analysts said will be approved -- and Pakistan's  controversial nuclear program, which several key U.S. officials believe is  aimed at developing a nuclear weapon.  </P> <P> After a luncheon meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Bhutto  reiterated her often-repeated line that Pakistan's nuclear program is strictly  peaceful. Bush said after their meeting that Bhutto "assured me that Pakistan's  nuclear program is committed to peaceful purposes."  </P> <P> If the President fails to certify to Congress that Pakistan does not possess a  nuclear device, the $621 million in military and economic aid that the  Administration is requesting for Pakistan next year will be lost.  </P> <P> Bush added: "I underlined my Administration's commitment to discourage  proliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, in the South  Asia region and around the world."  </P> <P> Although substantive policy issues were discussed in the sessions, the official  statements by both leaders were dominated by expressions of lavish praise and  mutual appreciation.  </P> <P> Several Pakistani and U.S. analysts said the rhetoric was meant to demonstrate  that the United States is committed to the democratic government of Bhutto, who  came to power in elections last year, at a time when her opposition at home  remains fierce.  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Taking the risk out of travelling - Bethan Hutton investigates holiday insurance policies and finds that not all are the same PLOUGHING through the small print of travel insurance policies might be off-putting when planning a holiday, but it is not safe to assume that all policies are the same. If your shiny new camcorder is stolen on its first outing abroad, you could find yourself with the option of claiming under three or four different policies. Travel insurance is the most obvious but there is also your home contents policy (if you have all-risks cover) and automatic, short-term cover if you bought the camera with a credit card. If it is stolen from your vehicle, you might also have a claim under your car insurance. If, however, you decide on impulse to go scuba diving one day during your holiday, and are unlucky enough to injure your foot on a coral reef, you might not be covered at all. Most travel insurance covers theft of possessions, but it often excludes injuries received during activities considered dangerous, such as diving or mountain climbing, unless you have made special arrangements. Before you can choose a travel policy, you need to know where you are going, what you will be doing there, what you will be taking with you, and for what you are insured already. Unlike all-risks household insurance, travel insurance is unlikely to provide new-for-old cover for your possessions. There could be a relatively low limit for individual items, which could mean that your expensive watch (or even designer luggage) is best left at home. Look through your existing (non-travel) policies to see what is covered. If, for example, your all-risks cover excludes the part of the world to which you are travelling, you need a travel policy giving adequate cover for everything you take. Some insurers give a discount on their travel premiums if you opt out of baggage insurance because you feel your home contents policy provides enough all-risks cover for that. National &amp; Provincial, for one, charges 20 per cent less. Medical expenses are probably the most important element of travel insurance. An E111 form, available from the post office, entitles you to reciprocal medical care in Europe. This reduces the cost of treatment but will not necessarily make it free - and it certainly will not pay for emergency repatriation by air ambulance. A recent report in Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, recommended having at least Pounds 250,000 worth of medical cover for trips in Europe, and Pounds 1m for the US and elsewhere. Most policies have a maximum at least this high, but check to be sure. If you have an existing medical condition, be sure to read the small print before buying a policy. Pre-existing conditions are covered by most but you might need to tell the insurer and confirm you are not travelling against medical advice. Older people with a taste for adventure may have a hard time finding suitable holiday insurance. Plenty of policies for travel within Europe have no age limit, but premiums often double for people over 65 travelling to the US or elsewhere. Thomas Cook, though, has no age limits on any policy: an 80-year-old pays the same as a two-year-old. If you are planning a package holiday, it is worth investigating various types of travel insurance before booking. You could be pressed by the travel agent to accept the tour operator's own policy, which might not be the best for your circumstances. Do not sign up unless you are sure it is suitable. Some people think they need only pay for their holiday by credit card to be covered fully. Unfortunately, it is not quite that simple. Free travel accident cover is provided by Barclays when its Visa, MasterCard or Premier clients pay for their holidays with the card - but this applies only while they are travelling, not to accidents elsewhere. Possessions are covered only if they were bought with the card fewer than 100 days before. Annual insurance policies, which cover you for unlimited numbers of trips lasting less than two or three months, have become more common - and more affordable - recently. If you go abroad more than once a year, they are definitely worth considering, particularly if you go skiing or travel with your family. First Direct's (0345-100100) annual world-wide policy for two adults and two children costs Pounds 99, and covers unlimited skiing within the limit of 90 days a trip. Insurance for the same group for a two-week holiday in the US is likely to cost at least Pounds 80. If you do not intend to holiday outside Europe, Frizzell (0202-292333) offers a comprehensive annual policy for Pounds 48.15 per adult. Terrorist attacks, or riots in a previously idyllic holiday spot, are every tourist's nightmare. If, say, you had been injured in the Florence car bombing last month, some insurers would have paid up. Some, though, exclude acts of terrorism so check the small print. Others may pay, but at their own discretion. If a civil war or rioting breaks out in your destination before you leave home, call your insurer to check if your policy is still valid. If the foreign office advises against travelling to an area, this could be enough cause to cancel the holiday and make a claim. If your idea of a good holiday is diving, mountaineering, white-water rafting or bungee jumping, you might need to contact one of the companies offering specialist activity holiday insurance. Crispin Speers (071-480-5083), for instance, will cover activities such as hang-gliding and abseiling for a Pounds 10 extension to its standard policies. More dangerous activities will be considered individually. Accident and General's (071-512-0022) ActivityGuard provides three levels of cover, depending on the degree of danger.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUAL TRAVEL INSURANCE POLICIES - WORLD-WIDE COVER  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Individual  Family??

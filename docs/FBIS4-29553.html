			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Projected `Emergency Security Legislative Arrangements' </F> Opposed in Japan" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- A meeting of Japanese  figures for thinking of the "emergency security legislative  arrangements" and the Korean question took place in Tokyo on  June 10.    Professor Motofumi Asai of Meiji Gakuin University in his  report at the meeting titled "On the `Emergency Security  Legislative Arrangements' and the Korean Question" said Japan's  preparation of the "legislative arrangements" is a political  plot aimed at turning itself into a military power, which  involves "troop dispatch overseas" of its "Self-Defence Forces".  He added that Japan has been increasing tensions by whipping up  the clamour about "a nuclear threat" from the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea in a bid to put it into effect.    Jiro Suzuki, an honorary professor of Tokyo Metropolitan  University, made a report titled "On the Human Rights of Koreans  in Japan and Discriminations Against Them". He said "sanctions"  have been taken in Japan in the form of crackdown on Koreans in  Japan, while politicians are crying for the "emergency security  legislative arrangements" and "sanctions" against the DPRK.    An appeal opposing the "emergency security legislative  arrangements" and calling for a peaceful solution of the Korean  question was adopted at the meeting.    Saying the Japanese Government authorities' preparation of  the "legislative arrangements", choosing the DPRK as an  imaginary "enemy", is an extremely dangerous anti-peace,  anti-democratic move, the appeal strongly urged them to give up  the preparation and strictly control criminal acts against  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Arts (Openings): Vienna Wednesday's performance of Richard Strauss's 'Elektra' is certain to be an emotional occasion. It marks the belated start of the season at the State Opera, which has been shut for technical alterations since the summer. It also marks Christa Ludwig's official farewell to the stage. Ludwig, who sings Klytemnestra, began her career in 1946 and is regarded as one of the most distinguished opera singers of the postwar era.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Ireland's only steel mill to close A liquidator is to be appointed to loss-making state-owned Irish Steel after directors recommended the closure of its Cork-based steel plant - Ireland's only steel mill - causing the loss of 520 jobs. Mr Ruairi Quinn, minister for enterprise and employment, accepted the board's advice to call in the liquidator after meeting Mr Pat Dineen, Irish Steel chairman, and Mr Leslie Buckley, acting chief executive, last night. The closure follows the failure of the company to win agreement from its craft unions on a survival plan which has been backed by the board, the government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other Irish Steel workers.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Industrial action vote at Smiths UNIONS at Smiths Crisps are balloting on industrial action after the company's decision to abandon national bargaining and all national union agreements in favour of plant-level pay and agreements. Mr Brian Revell, an official of the TGWU general union, said the decision reflected the 'anti-union instincts' of Pepsico Food International, the US food group which bought Smiths three years ago. He said it was probably the prelude to derecognition of unions by the company. Mr Tim Raven, operations director of Smiths Crisps, denied any plan to derecognise unions but hinted that it might become an issue if the unions disrupted the attempt to decentralise bargaining. The other unions at Smiths - the GMB and Usdaw - are also holding a ballot. The result will be known on June 19.</p>

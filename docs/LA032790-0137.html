			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TURKISH MARKET SOARS, EVEN ON THE STREET;  </P> <P> STOCKS: THE EXCHANGE BEGAN ACCELERATING LAST AUGUST AFTER TURKEY FULLY OPENED  ITS EXCHANGE TO FOREIGNERS. SINCE THEN, IT CONTINUES TO RISE.  </P> <P> A sack of stock certificates lies half-empty in a dingy coffee house opposite  Istanbul's Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> "Stocks? Like tomatoes you know, I sell them like tomatoes," said the shabbily  dressed "bagger" -- one of many unofficial traders who buy and sell stocks out  on the street.  </P> <P> The bizarre street trading that goes side by side with the official stock  market would shock Western brokers.  </P> <P> But enthusiasm for Turkish stocks has spread fast since Istanbul's once-sleepy  stock exchange took off last year, growing faster than any other equity market  in the world.  </P> <P> The official stock index rose by more than 1,000%, according to a survey by the  International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank.  </P> <P> Out on the streets, in what is known as the "coffeehouse exchange," baggers buy  stocks through brokers and then resell them to eager investors, sometimes at a  10% premium.  </P> <P> The coffeehouse trading is not official, but it is legal. The baggers -- part  of a vast and varied network of street merchants who hussle Turkey's alleys --  trade long after the exchange shuts at midday.  </P> <P> An Anatolian peasant, his worldly cash wealth wrapped in a newspaper, makes his  way through the shoving crowd to the bagger. Stocks quickly change hands on top  of a car trunk.  </P> <P> Hundreds of Turks crowd the muddy back alleys behind the exchange, overjoyed by  a rally that began accelerating last August after Turkey fully opened its  exchange to foreigners.  </P> <P> The market index of 50 primary companies hit a record high of 4,195 on Feb. 9,  against 373.93 at the end of 1988.  </P> <P> The 50-share index then eased to 3,797.14 by Feb. 19, but traders anticipate  that further buying will lift it up again soon.  </P> <P> The base of 100 was computed in 1986.  </P> <P> Last year's rise was almost five times that of inflation-plagued Argentina,  where equities yielded the second highest worldwide return, and eight times  that of Thailand, which took third spot.  </P> <P> "The Turkish stock market has performed way above every other market," said one  international investment banker who asked not to be named. "Its long-term  prospects are bright."  </P> <P> Average daily trading value, which hovered near $85,000 just a year ago, has  soared to $30 million this month -- above that of Portugal, Greece, the  Philippines and Chile, but still tiny to with Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia.  </P> <P> The boom is being fed by foreign cash as well as by local investors, who win  meager returns on the traditional Turkish standbys of gold and foreign  currencies.  </P> <P> Among early outside investors were Morgan Stanley Asset Management and Salomon  Brothers, which last December launched an $84-million Turkish Investment Fund.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the closed-end mutual fund was off 12.5 cents at $13.875 on the New  York Stock Exchange, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 45 points at  2,590.  </P> <P> "People have seen the great potentials of emerging markets," said Giles Vardey  of Salomon Brothers. "We have a big interest in country funds, including the  Turkish Fund."  </P> <P> Other funds, institutional players and wealthy individuals followed suit, and  the exchange's foreign relations director, Ismail Kovaci, said more large banks  and securities houses were planning to invest in Turkey.  </P> <P> Heavy demand outnumbered the volume of stocks put on the market by Turkish  companies. Most companies are family-owned and prefer to retain the bulk of  their stock to keep control of the company.  </P> <P> Although high stock prices have encouraged some private Turkish companies to  open up to the public, few others are expected to copy them in the short term.  </P> <P> "In countries like ours, most companies have a passion for possession," said  broker Yener Kaya. "We can see a mentality of the feudal landowner even in  Turkey's very big holdings."  </P> <P> Kaya's clients range from the top five holdings of Turkey to a drummer of the  old gypsy suburb of Istanbul.  </P> <P> In his office, potential investors line the walls, squatting on the floor.  </P> <P> The government plans to cash in on the stock boom and will sell chunks of  stocks from Turkey's multibillion-dollar privatization program to raise money.  </P> <P> Officials say stocks from state-owned petrochemicals giant Petkim and public  bank and textiles conglomerate Sumerbank will be issued soon.  </P></p>

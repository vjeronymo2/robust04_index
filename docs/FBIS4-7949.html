			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev </F> by Lieutenant Colonel Georgi Vuchev; place and date not given:  "The United States Is Helping To Strengthen Bulgarian Defense"]    [Excerpts] [Vuchev] Mr. Noev, you headed a group from the  Defense Ministry that spent more than one week on a working  visit to the United States under the Bulgarian-U.S. military  cooperation plan. What were the chief aims of this visit?    [Noev] I was accompanied on the U.S. trip by Krasimira  Boneva, chief of the Information and Cultural Relations  Department, and by Captain First Rank Tsvyatko Donchev, head of  the Defense Ministry Press Service, and the visit was financed  by the U.S. Information Agency. Our U.S. visit had two main  aspects: to become acquainted with the practices used at the  U.S. Department of Defense in the field of information and  public relations, and also to have meetings with U.S. Defense  Department officials. [passage omitted]    In the course of our discussions it was reaffirmed that the  relations between the United States and Bulgaria in the military  field are in complete conformity with the development of  bilateral relations as a whole. I would even say that they are  continuously improving and entering a qualitatively new stage.  [passage omitted]    [Vuchev] During your meetings, was sufficient attention paid  to the situation in our region and Europe?    [Noev] Naturally, we did cover these topics quite  comprehensively. We confirmed that our practical positions  coincided on all main issues. Of course, there were some  nuances, such as in connection with the UN resolution on adding  a military contingent from the Republic of Turkey to the  peacekeeping forces in Bosnia. In essence, this resolution was  adopted during and following my meetings. However, even before  it was made and especially after it was made public, we ensured  that the U.S. side clearly understood that Bulgaria is far from  enthusiastic about this decision. In fact, it has turned out  that for the second time (the first was Resolution 730 on the  sanctions], when an issue of strategic importance for the  conflict in the former Yugoslavia was being decided, not only  was Bulgaria's view not taken into account, but a decision was  passed that conflicted with our fundamental interests. I wish  to make it clear that we have nothing against any state taking  part and appreciate the UN's difficulties in obtaining troops  for Bosnia. However, at the same time we stressed that there is  no change in our position of opposing the participation of the  armed forces of states in the region, or of states that display  an active interest in joining this specific operation.    During the roundtable meeting at the National Defense  University it was mentioned that the main characteristics of the  Bulgarian contribution to the international efforts to find a  solution to the Yugoslav crisis are the clarity, principled  nature, and predictability of our conduct. We consider that our  participation, as a permanent value in the complex equation of a  future peace settlement, should considerably assist the efforts  to solve the equation. However, when such a policy leads to  disregard for Bulgaria's interests, we should evidently draw the  appropriate conclusions. [passage omitted]</p>

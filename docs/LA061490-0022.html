			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU ASKED ABOUT: WHEREFORES OF WHEY'S NUTRITIONAL VALUE  </P> <P> Question: Can you give me some information about the food value of whey? I have  been dripping nonfat yogurt to make a cheese as a substitute for butter on  bread. The extracted whey makes a pleasant enough drink, but I want to know  what may be lost to those in my family who don't drink it.  </P> <P> Answer: "Nutritive Value of American Foods -- In Common Units," U.S. Department  of Agriculture Handbook No. 456, states one cup of fluid whey contains 64  calories, 2.2 grams protein, 0.7 grams fat, 12.5 grams carbohydrate, 125  milligrams calcium, 130 milligrams phosphorus, 0.2 milligrams iron, 0  milligrams sodium, 0 milligrams potassium, 20 international units Vitamin A,  0.07 milligrams thiamine, 0.34 milligrams riboflavin, 0.2 milligrams niacin and  0 milligrams ascorbic acid.  </P> <P> Q: Could you please tell me where I can purchase a tea cozy?  </P> <P> A: Two suggestions: Tudor House, 411 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica, (213)  451-4107, and Tottenham Court, 12206 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818)  761-6560.  </P> <P> Q: Please explain why when I add cream to a dish to make a sauce it often  curdles. Sometimes I substitute half and half -- is that the problem? Or is it  related to the temperature at which the dish is being cooked?  </P> <P> A: Temperature is certainly important. When you add cream to any dish cooked on  top of the stove, it will curdle if the mixture is permitted to boil. Always  heat dishes containing cream over a low heat, stirring often.  </P> <P> A major cause of curdling in cooking milk products is cooking over too high a  heat and for too long a time, according to authors Sylvia Rosenthal and Fran  Shinagel in "How Cooking Works" (Macmillan, 1981). They go on to say: "There is  also a danger of curdling if you add a milk product to an acid food. But if you  reverse the process and add the acid food slowly to the milk, you prevent  curdling."  </P> <P>  Address questions on food preparation to You Asked About ..., Food Section,  The Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles, Calif. 90053.

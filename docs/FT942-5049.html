			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / People: Manchester school head to lead UK teacher training Education secretary John Patten is hoping one of English education's leading traditionalists will run teacher-training in England and Wales. Yesterday, he named his candidate to chair the Teacher Training Authority, a new quango which will start work in September if the education bill currently in the Commons passes into law. Geoffrey Parker, 61, retires at the end of this term as High Master (headmaster) of Manchester Grammar School, one of the country's most prestigious centres of academic excellence. The appointment makes sense as Parker is certainly untainted by any suggestion of the educational establishment's alleged 'political correctness', which the new quango is intended to stamp out. Instead, MGS has continued happily to admit that it is elitist, rigorously selecting its boys and then working them very hard. The advent of A-level league tables in the past few years has confirmed it as one of the top ten independent schools in the UK. However, Parker, a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, denies accusations that he runs an 'exam factory', answering with the names 'Atherton' and 'Crawley'; both England's current cricket captain, and his possible successor are recent graduates of Manchester Grammar. The school plays as hard as it works. Parker's appointment, which is part-time, need not provoke the left-wing establishment, as he has never taken a high political profile, and has publicly defended links between schools and university education departments. However, one disgruntled teachers' union official suggested that a career teaching 'the brightest sons of the North-West' is no preparation for the job of training young teachers to work effectively in deprived inner-city comprehensives. That task may be rather more difficult.</p>

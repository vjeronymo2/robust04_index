			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Chief resigns as Shanks &amp; McEwan warns on profits Shares in Shanks &amp; McEwan fell sharply yesterday after the Glasgow-based waste contractor issued another profits warning, instigated an urgent strategic review and announced that its chief executive, Mr Roger Hewitt, had left the group following a disagreement on future policy. The shares, which have dropped from a peak of 237p last January, closed 15p lower yesterday at 97p after the group warned that it faced extremely difficult trading conditions and said results for the third quarter 'have continued to disappoint'. Mr Hewitt's departure is understood to have followed a meeting of the group's non-executive directors in late December after a number of investors expressed concerns about the recent performance of the group and a lack of confidence in its management. Analysts, who were not surprised by the announcement, said Mr Hewitt's position had become almost untenable following a string of disappointing results, profit warnings and the departure of the group's previous chairman and finance director. Mr Hewitt, who joined the group in 1985 and had been the chief architect of its rapid growth, was employed on a service contract and Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said his compensation was 'the subject of negotiation'. Mr Waddell will assume the responsibilities of chief executive until Mr Hewitt's successor is appointed. Yesterday he warned that second-half pre-tax profits would 'not measure up' to market expectations. Analysts had been expecting second-half pre-tax profits of about Pounds 6m. The chairman said the restructuring programme announced at the interim stage was in place but warned that the resulting estimated Pounds 5m annual cost savings would not be felt until the 1994/95 financial year. He blamed the disappointing third quarter performance on three separate 'one-off' technical problems with kilns at the group's Pontypool and Fawley incineration plants, coupled with lower hazardous waste volumes and squeezed margins at its southern waste services operations in Bedfordshire. He said the strategic review is expected to take about 6 weeks and is being undertaken 'to give us confidence that we are as well positioned as we can be'.</p>

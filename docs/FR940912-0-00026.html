			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Statutory Authority and Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 5.17(a)(8) of the Farm Credit Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1971, as amended (1971 Act), 12 U.S.C. 2252(a)(8), the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is authorized to ``Regulate the preparation by System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions and the dissemination to stockholders and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors of information on the financial condition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations of such institutions. *&blank;*&blank;*'' On February 4,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, the FCA proposed regulations for a new part 630,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disclosure to Investors in Systemwide and Consolidated Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Debt Obligations of the Farm Credit System, to govern the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System's preparation and reporting of Systemwide financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to investors. (59 FR 5341) In general, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations reflected the current division of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities among the institutions participating in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System Disclosure Program, and included requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosures similar to those contained in the Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statements currently published by the System. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions participating in the System Disclosure Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were designated as the ``disclosure entities'' in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, in recognition of their shared responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for disclosure of Systemwide financial information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors and the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion of the Final Rule and Summary of Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA is adopting part 630 largely as proposed. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule includes changes and clarifications to address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received on the proposed rule. As in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, the final regulations (1) Require the System to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish annual and quarterly reports to investors;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) delineate responsibilities relating to the preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the report; (3) reinforce internal controls over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systemwide financial disclosure; and (4) establish reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for the report to ensure that relevant information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning the combined financial condition and results of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations of the System is disclosed to investors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential investors. The final rule will prevent any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistency between Systemwide disclosure to investors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA regulations governing accounting and reporting standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and individual System institution disclosure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shareholders. These new FCA regulations will apply to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information currently contained in the System's Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statements and press releases that contain Systemwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial information. The final rule also implements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 514 of the Farm Credit Banks and Associations Safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Soundness Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;552 (1992 Act), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires adequate disclosure to investors of financial and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict-of-interest information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations will ensure that timely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate Systemwide financial information continues to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosed to investors and the public to assist them in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making informed decisions regarding FCS debt obligations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System institutions. This is consistent with the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board's regulatory policy to ``Protect the public, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investors, and the customer/shareholders of the System in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to create an environment whereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customer/shareholders and investors can take advantage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the System's strength and rely on its future viability with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidence.'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FCA Board Policy Statement on Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Philosophy, 59 FR 32189, June 22, 1994)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA received six comment letters on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations during the comment period, which expired on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 20, 1994. One letter was submitted by the Farm Credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council (FCC) on behalf of its membership. The FCC comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were the product of input from a number of sources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including System banks, the System's Accounting Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Work Group, and the Funding Corporation. The FCC recognized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and concurred with the FCA's efforts to ensure that timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and accurate Systemwide financial information continues to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be disclosed to investors and potential investors in FCS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debt securities. Noting the System's general support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations, the FCC submitted comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several provisions of the proposed regulations in the body  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of its letter and provided technical comments on other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in an attached appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit Bank of Texas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (FCBT), and the Farm Credit Bank of Baltimore (FCBB) each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted a letter addressing specific issues. The Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation commented concerning its access to FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examination Reports of System banks and associations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCBT addressed the same issue in its letter. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCBT urged that the FCA prohibit directors of System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions from serving on the System Audit Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While endorsing the comments submitted by the FCC, the FCBB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urged that the FCA clarify, for purposes of Systemwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure, the treatment of the FCBB's wholly-owned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidiary, the Farm Credit Finance Corporation of Puerto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (AICPA) and Price Waterhouse, the external auditor currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged to provide an opinion on the Systemwide combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial statements, also commented on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Both of these commenters suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for an accountant's opinion on supplemental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information be clarified. The AICPA also commented on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues concerning the definition of ``material,'' the due  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dates of the reports to investors, and the requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing a letter with the FCA explaining the preferability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an accounting change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

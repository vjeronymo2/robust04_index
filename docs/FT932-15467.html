			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / James Capel aims to stay on a fairway: UK stockbroker's spell in the rough For James Capel, 1992 was going to be a banner year. Over-expansion at the end of the 1980s had been followed by a round of cost-cutting: by the end of last year, staff numbers were more than 1,000 below their peak. Profits were going to reach levels not seen since the UK-based broker became part of the Hongkong Bank group in 1986. It was not to be. An eastern European venture capital fund, launched by Capel in New York at the end of 1989, came back to haunt the broker in 1992. The entire DM48m (around Pounds 16m at the time it was launched) invested in the fund, New Europe Hotels, appears now to have been lost and Capel - which had two directors on the fund's board - has compensated investors for their losses. The saga ended last week with the resignations of three senior executives, including Mr James Fergusson, managing director. The New Europe Hotels wipe-out owes much to one large bad investment: a DM20m stake in the Gut Altentann golf course near Salzburg, home of the Austrian Open championship. The plan was to develop a hotel at the course. That project was later shelved, due in part to difficulties with planning permission - though Capel may recover part of its investment. Other investments by the fund, created primarily to invest in western-standard hotels in eastern Europe, are thought to have been very small, though the fund spent millions on legal and other advice connected with potential hotel developments, and on its own operating costs. The UK broker, which launched the fund through its New York office, opted to pay compensation rather than fight angry investors through the courts. Not to do so, it feared, could have led to large legal fees and a loss of goodwill among investment clients - Capel's greatest asset. Mr Bernard Asher, the HSBC director who became Capel's chairman two years ago, says the New Europe Hotels saga was the result of over-ambition. It was 'well outside the parameters of what we were meant to be doing' in New York. Capel's business should revolve around selling equities to its high-quality institutional customer base, not using its distribution strength to sponsor low-quality transactions which have been rejected by other investment banks, he adds. The effect on the broker's 1992 results was devastating. Operating profits, before special charges, seemed likely to reach close to Pounds 30m - a return of more than 20 per cent on the broker's capital of Pounds 128m. The reported figure was cut to only Pounds 7.5m by New Europe and a series of charges related to redundancies and the effects of the City of London bomb which forced Capel out of its offices last March, just as the stock market was jumping after the UK general election. The senior management changes forced by last week's resignations are the latest moves to give a new face to the broker's top management since Mr Asher moved in to exercise more direct control by Hongkong Bank two years ago. Mr Peter Letley, another Hongkong Bank appointee and Capel's finance director since 1988, became deputy chairman earlier this month. Mr David Dugdale, a former deputy chairman and senior executive who had already taken on a non-executive role, took early retirement in February. Mr Mike Geering, director of research, left for Mercury Asset Management late last year. Senior Capel executives say the move does not imply a change of direction, but that after six years in the job it was time for change. Capel prefers to point to the continuity in its senior management. This includes the appointment last week of the 36-year-old Mr Robert Benton as managing director. A former equity salesman who joined Capel 11 years ago, Mr Benton comes from the traditional heart of Capel's business, as head of UK institutional broking. Getting Capel back into the black has taken some hefty pruning. Like others, the broker expanded rapidly after the Big Bang reforms of 1986, driven by its perceived need for a worldwide equity distribution network. In the year before Mr Asher arrived, staff numbers were cut by 300, but they still stood at 2,300. On a comparable basis - without the HSBC-owned Wardley-Thomson brought into the group last year - they are now 1,480. A move into France, where it acquired the stockbroker Dufour Lacarriere Pouget, was typical of the over-expansion. Having bought a retail stockbroker also engaged in bond trading, Capel tried to turn the business into an institutional stockbroker with a strong derivative trading operation. It has now been cut right back, leaving just a team handling equity distribution. Staff in France rose from more than 200 at the start of the decade before falling back to under 40 now. Other overseas adventures have not involved acquisitions and have been less painful. For example, Capel did not experience the losses in Japan that hit some foreign brokers during the market doldrums of 1992. The pruning has left what Mr Asher calls 'a specialised international securities house' with a business built around research-based agency broking. It also has limited securities trading operations, so that they help its institutional clients to execute their business rather than trade for the firm's own account. This means Capel does not need large financial resources. The capital employed in the business, now Pounds 128m, has fallen as the broker has repaid loan capital to its parent. That in turn has brought down its interest costs, helping to bolster profits. Will Capel eventually be subsumed into a larger HSBC investment banking operation, built out of the Wardley and Samuel Montagu businesses as well as the UK broker? Mr Asher is now chairman of all three, having taken over at the Midland-owned Montagu two weeks ago. He says no such changes are planned: 'I have to be much more pragmatic than that. We are not an integrated US investment house, and should not posture as one.' He points out, for example, that Capel works closely with a number of merchant banks in London. 'That relationship is good and strong, and I'm not about to disturb that.' Nevertheless, Mr Asher - and Capel's senior executives - hope that Samuel Montagu will become a source of new corporate transactions to feed the broker's distribution arm. Getting the balance right will be the biggest test of the coming few years. If Capel can put experiences like New Europe Hotels behind it, it could emerge as one of the most profitable London-based securities houses. But given its history since the mid-1980s, that may not be something HSBC's shareholders would bet on.</p>

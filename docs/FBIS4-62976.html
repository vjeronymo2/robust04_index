			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva and </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku 18 May TASS -- Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry  has released a statement explaining that Azerbaijan did not sign  the protocol on ceasefire and the disengagement of the warring  parties in the zone of conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan,  the main clauses of which had been agreed at the meeting of the  defence ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia on 16 May,  because of separate shortfalls in the document.    The statement stresses that expert groups in every country,  party to the agreement, continue to work on the document. The  press service of the Azeri Defence Ministry does not rule out  that a trilateral meeting of the defence ministers will meet in  Moscow again after this work is completed.</p>

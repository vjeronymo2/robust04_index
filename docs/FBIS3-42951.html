			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Portnikov: "Power of Individuals or the </F> Face of Power?: Sketches for Political Portraits"]    [Text] My article "The Federation Council: Face of the  Federation or the Power of Individuals," which was presented by  the editorial office as an attempt at a political portrait of  the then leaders of the former Soviet republics, appeared in  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Truly historic changes have occurred since  that time both in our lives and in the biographies of the  politicians introduced in that publication: The Soviet Union has  disappeared, its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, has departed  politics, and new independent states, which have formed the CIS,  have appeared. But many of the leaders of that time have held on  to power, albeit in a new capacity. And whereas previously we  asked whether the familiar "face of power" in the Soviet Union  would not become the power of individuals, now this question  itself is different: Can the power of individuals in the  post-Soviet space be composed of a "face of power" not united  under a communal roof but capable of consulting, reaching  agreement, and seeking and finding real compromises in the  tangled relations between the new independent states?  <H6>  Yeltsin </H6>   The election of Boris Yeltsin as the first chairman of the  CIS may, of course, be considered up to a certain point a purely  symbolic gesture and a display of support on the part of his  colleagues. His function can in no way be compared with the  chairmanship of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Federation Council or  even in the far more independent USSR State Council. But in a  whole number of instances--we recall the economic situation in  Ukraine, the war in Georgia, the Dniester conflict in Moldova,  the Karabakh confrontation of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the  collapse of the "new-type ruble zone" for Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan--the influence of the Russian leadership on the  affairs of countries of the Commonwealth has all but exceeded  the influence of the former Soviet leadership on the  possibilities of the Union republics. For this reason Yeltsin's  chairmanship does not today appear purely incidental. But  Russia's policy in relation to the former Soviet republics  remains sufficiently unpredictable. Russian leaders--primarily  the president--are constantly torn between political necessity  and economic expediency. On the one hand there is evidence of a  desire to preserve the entire former Soviet space as a "zone of  influence," on the other, the measures of economic stimulation,  necessary in these cases, of countries in no hurry over their  reforms are beginning to objectively contradict the interests of  the Russian economic reform. The most striking example here was  Russia's refusal to remit to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan cash in  new-denomination rubles after the accords on the creation of a  new-type ruble zone had been signed. The situation in which  Russia had found itself was precisely described at that time by  Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev: "As an economist, I can  understand the ministers of economics or finance of Russia. But  they should confer with the people responsible for Russia's  geopolitical interests."    Boris Yeltsin is one such person. But he has to take account  not only of the logic constructs of the economic structures but  also the desires of the power structures, which submit to no  political logic--the president is too dependent on them in  domestic policy to go against them in foreign policy, in the  "near abroad" particularly. I would recall if only the assault  on Sukhumi, which impressed the world, by Abkhaz formations,  which not only were not stopped by the military of Russia--the  guarantor of the fulfillment of the well-known Georgian-Abkhaz  agreements which disarmed the Georgian Army--but were in fact  supported by the former. Even, possibly, contrary to the wishes  of a president of Russia unduly preoccupied at this time with  his confrontation with the Supreme Soviet.    Now Boris Yeltsin has once again found himself faced with  the  need to make a choice in his "Commonwealth" policy. The success  of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party at the parliamentary elections  demonstrated pretty well the kind of success revanchist  sentiments are enjoying in Russian society.    And the president also is facing the obvious temptation not  so much to follow in the wake of Zhirinovskiy's views as to  justify all of Russia's stern actions in relation to countries  of the CIS by the existence of the chauvinist phenomenon. Some  recent statements of the president's closest advisers, including  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, show that this could be a  perfectly acceptable direction in foreign policy. And then the  sole "lever" of influencing Russian policy left to Boris  Yeltsin's colleagues would be the telephone. Or, at best,  personal contacts. After all, thus far all problems between  Russia and the CIS countries have been resolved only at  presidential level--a pretty good illustration of the  abnormality of these relations, frozen, as it were, at the level  of the old fissures in Gorbachev's Federation Council and  incapable yet of switching to the level of normal interstate  relations.  <H6>  Nazarbayev </H6>   The president of Kazakhstan, whose nonparticipation in the  celebrated Belovezha meeting is still explained variously by the  leaders of the former Soviet republics, has become the main  spokesman, virtually, for integration ideas in the CIS. It was  Nazarbayev who proposed and decisively supported the creation of  coordinating bodies of the Commonwealth and the economic union  of its members. But the president of Kazakhstan has  simultaneously endeavored insistently to build a truly sovereign  and real state in a republic with a more than complex ethnic  makeup (the most complex in the former Union, probably, not  counting tiny Latvia, which is protected as yet against possible  demographic problems by the rules of international law). The  building of Kazakhstani statehood has required as an essential  condition the tolerant attitude of the Russian leadership toward  this complex historical experiment against the former's own  will: after all, Kazakhstan was the last of the former Soviet  republics to proclaim independence, and its president  consistently supported, as long as this was possible, the  preservation and reform of the Union. But when Kazakhstani  statehood came to be suffused with real political and economic  content and the country began to take the first independent  steps in foreign policy, a cooling suddenly ensued in  Kazakhstani-Russian relations--and hardly through the fault of  Almaty. The refusal to transfer rubles in cash, charges of an  attempt to create an alternative economic union of  Turkic-speaking countries, the endeavor of certain Russian  politicians--from both government circles and the opposition--to  act the part of defenders of the Russian-speaking  population--all this also influenced, of course, Nursultan  Nazarbayev's positions in respect to the CIS. In any event,  reports of Kazakhstan's promotion of initiatives at the Ashgabat  meeting have remained unconfirmed, but the president of this  republic engaged in heavy diplomatic activity, taking advantage  of the last "summit" for productive bilateral contacts, with his  recent "antipode" in the Commonwealth--Leonid  Kravchuk--included. A charming and strong politician, Nazarbayev  can today, without putting his popularity in the republic  particularly at risk, distance himself from Russia somewhat,  offering society certain alternative paths of development and  alternative partners even. But these steps of Kazakhstan could  be more a reaction to Moscow's misunderstanding of Almaty's  aspiration to build equal relations protected against  speculation on the most painful topic for Kazakhstan--the  possibility of interethnic misunderstanding. It should be  mentioned also that the Kazakhstan president's distancing of  himself somewhat from Russia could help him in the struggle for  influence in the Central Asia region, where Almaty's positions  have been weakened somewhat--compared with those of Tashkent--in  connection with the Tajik events. In addition, on the eve of  parliamentary elections such a policy could reduce the chances  of Nazarbayev's opponents from Kazakh national parties, who are  accusing him of failing to understand Kazakhstan's true  interests.  <H6>  Kravchuk </H6>   Whereas until recently the presidents of Russia and  Kazakhstan were considered the main proponents of the  integration line in the CIS, the president of Ukraine was  described, as a rule, as a supporter of a different approach to  the Commonwealth, as the most felicitous instrument for the  "divorce" of the former Soviet republics. But time has adjusted  both the position of Yeltsin and Nazarbayev and the position of  Kravchuk: The CIS could not either be a practicable instrument  for the integration of its members or secure for them a normal  divorce. The distance at which this country or the other stands  from the Commonwealth was more a political section than a  measure of true integration or disintegration desires. And it is  striking here that the strong political position of the  president of Ukraine has not been founded on real economic  possibilities, which has led in Russian-Ukrainian relations, for  example, to humiliating concessions, which President Kravchuk  himself has called "kneeling."    The attitude of the president of Ukraine toward the CIS is  conditioned primarily by the state of the relations of Ukraine  and Russia, and these relations depend directly on the ailing,  unreformed Ukrainian economy. On the eve of early parliamentary  and presidential elections in the country it is the economic  crisis which has propelled to the forefront the question of  stable Ukrainian statehood. For President Kravchuk himself--as  for Ukraine also, for that matter--the best option at the  present time would appear to be the abandonment of presidential  elections after the parliamentary elections with a strengthening  of the vertical line of the executive. But Leonid Kravchuk could  achieve this cancellation only with the start of a real, even if  not all that significant, change in the economy or, on the other  hand, with an extraordinary exacerbation of the situation. Both  versions are hardly realistic, and it may be assumed, therefore,  that the Ukrainian president will simply attempt to find a  common language with the new parliament, and the composition of  this parliament will determine his tactics in relations with  Russia and the CIS as a whole. The only thing that should not be  expected from Kravchuk is the fulfillment of the cherished dream  of certain radical Russian politicians from the "revanche  party"--a change of the blue and yellow flag for a white one.  Leonid Kravchuk has invested too much in his image as the  architect of new Ukrainian independence to retreat from it. The  combination of the success of this political image and the  economic apathy is altogether, most likely, the determining  phenomenon of the "sovereign-communist" success, which is not  typical of just Kravchuk alone.  <H6>  Shushkevich </H6>   An architect of the CIS and until the day before yesterday  chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich  had since the first months of the Commonwealth's existence,  virtually, been in a dual position. On the one hand, against the  background of the other leaders of the former Soviet republics  Shushkevich appeared to be the politician who most aspired to  preserve Union integration and even some special relationship  with Russia. But at the same time Shushkevich aspired also to  "preserve character," ensuring for the proclaimed Belorussian  sovereignty if only an attributive existence. And it was here  that Shushkevich encountered in his own republic the opposition  of the "economic party" headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich, and it is Kebich's policy, not that of Shushkevich,  which has of late gained the support of the majority of members  of parliament, what is more. And Shushkevich--not president but  chairman of the Supreme Soviet--had to come to terms with this  trend, which has already led to his dismissal from office.  Meanwhile, the struggle for power in Minsk and the hope of the  executive that closer cooperation with Russia will make it  possible not to reform the republic's economy have led to  Belarus' loss of its advantageous mediating role in the CIS.  <H6>  Karimov </H6>   During the events in Tajikistan Islam Karimov, who  intervened  in the conflict decisively and facilitated the accession to  power of the present Tajik leadership headed by Emomali  Rakhmanov, succeeded in showing that his claims to leadership in  the region may not be simply declarative. But it is indicative  that Karimov has subsequently tried to distance himself from the  Tajik conflict, demonstrating hereby that his decisive steps may  alternate with quite cautious tactics. This is connected to some  extent with the fact that the Uzbek economy, which is living  merely with the expectation of possible energy dividends, cannot  allow itself a free sail and to some extent with the president's  concerns for a strengthening of his own power, which does not  contemplate lengthy involvement in so dangerous a conflict as  the Tajik conflict. In addition, left by Russia without cash in  rubles, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, traditional rivals, have  simply been forced to draw closer to one another, and Karimov  has inquired in earnest about the prospects of regional  integration: Tajikistan and Turkmenistan will hardly be active  participants, but a commonwealth of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and  Kyrgyzstan could produce tangible geopolitical results. At the  same time it has to be recalled that observers were expecting of  the experienced and cautious Karimov greater flexibility in  domestic policy, considering that there was little that in fact  threatened the power of the president of Uzbekistan. But Islam  Karimov has preferred to rule his country quite strictly,  obviously believing that the stability that has been achieved is  the best proof of the soundness of the tactics for which he has  opted. But it is hard to judge as yet how durable stability in  any republic of Central Asia will be and to what extent  presidential power can hold back uncontrollable social  processes, especially if they have support from abroad.  <H6>  Shevardnadze </H6>   One of the best known and most consummate politicians on the  territory of the former Union, Eduard Shevardnadze has found  himself the head of a country paralyzed by sporadic civil war,  interethnic conflicts, and the amateurish leadership of Georgia  by the predecessors and associates of Gorbachev's foreign  minister. Of course, the situation in which Georgia finds itself  has been the main obstacle to the application of Shevardnadze's  diplomatic capabilities, especially since--on account of the  relative independence of many of the players in the Russian  political arena--the policy of the Georgian leader oriented  toward a search for honest and mutually acceptable accords with  Russia has as yet proven bankrupt. A politician of any other  rank could hardly have retained power after the loss of Sukhumi,  but Shevardnadze succeeded under these conditions in offering  stereotypes of political consciousness and leading Georgia into  the CIS. The Ashgabat meeting was essentially the Georgian  leader's debut in the Commonwealth, but Eduard Shevardnadze  succeeded at this "summit" even in demonstrating that he will  hardly be a passive observer here: Shevardnadze's interlocutors  in the Turkmen capital, who subsequently met among themselves,  included Leonid Kravchuk and Nursultan Nazarbayev, Geydar  Aliyev, Islam Karimov.... Despite his country's calamitous  situation, Shevardnadze is prepared, it would seem, to employ if  only his personal possibilities for a change in the  apportionment of forces in the Commonwealth which could help  Georgia consolidate its positions in the post-Soviet space.  <H6>  Aliyev </H6>   The return to power in Azerbaijan of Geydar Aliyev is a no  less fascinating story than the political biography of Eduard  Shevardnadze. And one further example of the fact that  representatives of the old Soviet school who went through the  "fire and water" of the Brezhnev Politburo even can give the  representatives of the national movements who campaigned for the  independence of the former Soviet republics far more actively  than the party secretaries a 100-point lead. Eduard  Shevardnadze, of course, showed his capabilities as a politician  not so much as head of the Communist Party of Georgia Central  Committee but as... foreign minister of the USSR and in the  exercise of foreign policy perestroyka. But Geydar Aliyev also,  after his departure from the office of first vice premier of the  Soviet Union, demonstrated his political capabilities, heading  the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. As  the head of Nakhichevan, an enclave situated between Turkey and  an Armenia essentially at war with Azerbaijan, Aliyev was able  to prevent hostilities on his territory, find a common language  with Ankara, which sympathized with his political antagonist  President Elchibey, and even to establish contacts with Yerevan.  But once in Baku, Aliyev, like Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, came in  for a difficult inheritance: A country with pretty good  political possibilities had found itself threatened with  military defeat, and it was simply essential that the new  president show himself to be a far more moderate and  peace-loving politician than his predecessor. Aliyev is  endeavoring--and he will continue this policy--to wrest the  foreign policy initiative from Yerevan, drawing closer to  Russia--and Azerbaijan's return to the CIS was a feature of this  rapprochement. But the Azerbaijan leader's Russian partners  asked, it would seem, too high a price for assistance to Baku,  and for this reason Aliyev has had to make use of his  long-standing contacts and the disagreements in the Russian  leadership. It is possible that the fate of the Azerbaijan  leader will depend, for all that, not on success at the  negotiating table but on military victories, and the forces  outside of Azerbaijan that would like to preserve Geydar Aliyev  must make efforts for the appearance of such victories.  <H6>  Ter-Petrosyan </H6>   The Armenian president remains today the sole leader  throughout the post-Soviet space (not counting Estonia and, to  some extent, Latvia) who was able to come to power from an  informal democratic structure and, in addition, to keep his  office and remain quite an authoritative leader, albeit one who  has been experiencing certain difficulties as of late. This may  to some extent be explained by the dire situation in which  warring Armenia has found itself (but this is at the same time  fertile ground for a frequent change of leaders as well) and  also, to some extent, by the economically powerful "power party"  which has formed around the president, but mainly by the  outstanding diplomatic talent of Ter-Petrosyan, who has been  able to so correct the initially anti-Moscow course of Armenian  geopolitical strategy that he has easily and imperceptibly made  Armenia the main base of Russia's interests in the Transcaucasus  region--a role that has subsequently and with less success been  sought by the Shevardnadze-headed Georgia and the Aliyev-led  Azerbaijan. It was this policy that enabled Yerevan to change  the correlation of forces in the Karabakh conflict (and there  was simultaneously a change of power in Baku also, which reduced  somewhat Turkey's influence on the situation in the region) and  which at the same time has not in the least prevented  constitutional development in Armenia--a country divided by  borders. Of course, this successful conduct of foreign policy  matters is smoothing over somewhat in the eyes of the public the  economic disarray--it is usually ascribed to circumstances, not  the president. But Levon Ter-Petrosyan will soon once again be  encountering a situation where Russia is attempting to help both  Armenia and Azerbaijan. And all too much here will depend on  Yerevan itself, its economic and military potential, and the  level of its influence on the leadership of Russia.  <H6>  Snegur </H6>   Like many other former Soviet republics, Moldova was faced  with the threat of a paralysis of power, which led to the  announcement of early parliamentary elections. Under these  conditions President Mircea Snegur, whose positions had been  somewhat shaken, once again becomes the sole realistic guarantor  not only of the continuity of power but also of the state  integrity of Moldova: In any event, the presidential elections  were held on a larger territory than that on which the  parliamentary elections will be held.    In addition, for the first time the president of Moldova,  Mircea Snegur, was elected by a parliament representing the  entire population of the republic, which is today in fact  divided into three parts. The president's position is being  improved also by the radicals from the Christian Democratic  People's Front of Moldova demanding the republic's immediate  affiliation to Romania. Thus Snegur occupies a certain  intermediate, even center, position between the radicals in  Chisinau and the separatist leaders in Tiraspol justifying the  preservation of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldavian Republic  on territory controlled by Russian troops by the possibility of  affiliation to Romania. But after the parliamentary elections,  the president's positions could once again be in jeopardy: The  new corps of deputies could perfectly well nominate from their  ranks politicians who cleave to views similar to his, but who  are not burdened by the legacy of confrontation with the  rebellious regions of the republic. The return to Moldova's  political life of its former leader Petru Lucinschi, who was  elected chairman of the republic's parliament, is the best  example of this. The president of Moldova's chance of retaining  his authority will depend directly on a settlement of the  Dniester conflict, which, in turn, will depend on relations with  Russia and Moldova's role in the CIS (although the republic's  parliament has yet to ratify the agreement on the formation of  the Commonwealth, and this will have to be done by the new corps  of deputies: Chisinau is meanwhile occupying a cautious-neutral  position in relation to the CIS structures). It should be  recalled also that the situation in Moldova and the  possibilities of President Snegur have been influenced as of  late by a new, "extra-Commonwealth" factor too: Moscow's search  for "new old" spheres of influence in East Europe could force  the Russian leaders to decide on certain concessions to  Romania--and one such concession could be a Dniester settlement.  <H6>  Niyazov </H6>   Undisputed diplomatic talent and an ability to sensitively  catch current political winds helped the president of  Turkmenistan not only establish full and uncontested control  over the republic--none of his CIS colleagues can rival the  extent of his powers, and even the highest representative body  is essentially appointed by Niyazov--but also to mothball social  and political processes in Turkmenistan, preventing not Kyrgyz  pluralism but even the Uzbek "representative" opposition.  Turkmenistan has remained the sole former Soviet republic that  has no opposition (except, perhaps, at the "dissident" level of  the 1970's) and where the population might think that the  president has succeeded by way of the abandonment of "democratic  experiments" in securing for Turkmenistan political and economic  stability expressed in control over social life and the  preservation of the ration-card distribution of basic  necessities. The niche of communist ideology was rapidly  occupied by the "ideology of presidential authority": Niyazov is  called Turkmenbashi, "Father of the Turkmen," and monuments to  and large-scale portraits of the president, after whom the city  formerly called Krasnovodsk, streets, schools, agricultural  enterprises, and plants have been named, have appeared  throughout the republic. The president's contributions and the  nationwide love for him are reported daily by the Turkmen press  and Turkmenistan radio and television. Saparmurad Niyazov is,  meanwhile, making skillful use of the attraction not only of his  own population but of the leadership of Russia also to  stability: While remaining at a distance from the CIS and not  participating in the work of a number of structures of the  Commonwealth, Turkmenistan nonetheless maintains a special  relationship with Russia and was even the first former Soviet  republic to which President Yeltsin paid an official visit.  Strict control over the republic is permitting President Niyazov  to easily consent to Russian initiatives which could prove  dangerous and even insulting to his president colleagues who do  not have such command over the wishes of each citizen of theirs:  Thus Turkmenistan is as yet the sole republic of the former  Union to have signed a dual-citizenship agreement with Russia.  At the same time Niyazov is actively seeking alternative paths  for economic development outside of the CIS, endeavoring to  develop contacts with Turkmenistan's neighbors in the East. But  the absence of serious economic reforms preventing real use  being made of the profits from the sale of natural gas could  make the Turkmen leadership more dependent on Russia than  President Niyazov would like.  <H6>  Akayev </H6>   Of all the presidents of countries of the Central Asia  region, Askar Akayev is as yet in the most difficult and  vulnerable position. A former president of the republic's  Academy of Sciences, who became head of Kyrgyzstan in defiance,  seemingly, of the logic of the development of the region (and,  possibly, thanks also to the weakness of the then leadership  headed by Absamat Masaliyev), Akayev simply had to come across  as a supporter of an approach--pluralist--to the relations of  power and society which was entirely different from that of  neighboring countries. At the same time a hierarchy of regional  elites traditional for Central Asia has been preserved in  Kyrgyzstan, the Communist Party, which was banned earlier, has  been revived, and a profound crisis has been observed within the  power party itself, which has been expressed, in particular, in  a change of prime minister of the republic and the resignation  of Vice President Feliks Kulov, one of the country's most  popular politicians. Askar Akayev's decision to hold a  referendum on confidence in the president testifies to a desire  for a radical solution of this crisis. But even should Akayev  succeed, it will hardly be possible to get through the period of  economic difficulties without recourse, if not to authoritarian  methods of government, then at least to elements of an  authoritarian approach. Specially since the cooling in relations  between Moscow and Almaty is creating additional difficulties  for Bishkek, which has traditionally been oriented toward these  two capitals, and making Akayev even more dependent on the  development trends of the countries of Central Asia.  <H6>  Rakhmonov </H6>   Emomali Rakhmonov, chairman of the Supreme Council of  Tajikistan, can hardly look forward to a lengthy political  biography. And it is not only a question here of the traditions  of the new Tajikistan, which has already replaced several  leaders, as of the nonindependence of the accession to power of  Emomali Rakhmonov, which was a consequence of the bloody civil  war and the manifest interest of a whole number of outside  forces in such an outcome. But Rakhmonov is opposed not only by  members of the opposition whom he vanquished but has not  subjugated and who are being held in check thus far by the  presence in Tajikistan and on its borders of the Russian Army.  Profound contradictions are lacerating also the "party of  victors" itself, which has proven to be extremely heterogeneous.  Initially the nomenklatura from Leninabad and Kulyab, which had  returned to power, tried to get rid of the field commanders who  aspired to command it: The culmination of this termination of  combatants who had played their part was the surprise death of  Sangak Safarov, leader of the People's Front and former  criminal. The new round of contradictions--between  representatives of Leninabad, who had traditionally governed in  Soviet Tajikistan, and the new leaders from Kulyab, whose  protege Rakhmonov is--ended in the dismissal of the experienced  Leninabader premier Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov. But a further  strengthening of the Kulyabis is fraught with the danger of a  new blowup of the situation in the republic, a change in the  correlation of political forces, and even the loss of some of  the outside support essential to the present bosses of Dushanbe.  Because there has once again come to be a Leninabader in the  premier's chair, and for this reason Emomali Rakhmonov, the  leader of a country with a paralyzed economy, finances  controlled by the central component of Russia, and an army  subordinate to Moscow, can hardly feel confident.    Such, in brief, might be notes in the margins of the  political biographies of the people today determining the  development of the situation in the former Soviet republics. Of  course, it is impossible to encompass the entire post-Union  space, it has both "external" and "internal" dimensions  incorporating, in addition, a whole number of leaders also. The  "external" dimension means the leaders of the Baltic countries,  which have already distanced themselves from their Union  neighbors: Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis and Valdis  Birkavs, and Lennart Meri and Mart Laar. It means the leaders of  self-proclaimed formations, by no means neophytes on the  post-Soviet political stage, such as the leaders of Karabakh,  Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester region, or Vladislav  Ardzinba, chairman of the parliament of Abkhazia, and Torez  Kulumbegov, head of South Ossetia. We could also recall here  Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, but we would hereby be  moving not only toward the borders of Russia but also toward the  boundaries of the "internal" dimension: the leaders of the  Russian republics that participated in the work of Gorbachev's  Federation Council have been eliminated from activity in the  CIS. But the role of these leaders in the political life of  Russia has by no means diminished but has, rather, increased  since that time. Today their activity--that of the presidents of  Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev, Bashkortostan, Murtaza Rakhimov,  Yakutia, Mikhail Nikolayev, Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov,  Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, Kabardino-Balkaria, Valeriy Kokov,  and Mari El, Valeriy Zotin, the chairmen of the parliaments of  Karelia, Viktor Stepanov, and Mordvinia, Nikolay Biryukov, the  president of North Ossetia, Anarbek Galazov, and  others--requires a separate publication. And this is  characteristic not only of Russia, incidentally. It is  sufficient to recall, for example, Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of  the Crimean Parliament, or Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the  parliament of Ajaria, and the role performed in the life of  Azerbaijan by its present president Geydar Aliyev in the office  of chairman of the parliament of Nakhichevan in order to see how  multidimensional is the process of disintegration of the Soviet  Union and to see for oneself the incompleteness of this process.  But we will meanwhile plot the present situation recorded  recently by the 12 portraits hung outside the residence of the  president of Turkmenistan.</p>

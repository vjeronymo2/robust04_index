			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts It is difficult to see yesterday's gilts auction as anything but disappointing. The scant cover hardly bodes well, especially following the modest level of government funding in recent months. Expectations were hardly high following Tuesday's cut in interest rates. Market-makers caught with short positions had to cover themselves immediately. They scaled back their auction bids as a result, but investors might equally be forgiven for being worried about lending to a government capable of such unpredictable behaviour. After all, the rate cut appears a politically-inspired, hasty decision taken without much thought to the exchange rate. The pull of lower short-term rates has so far been strong enough to keep even long-dated gilts on an even keel, but the pressure of government funding on institutional cash flow has hardly been felt. This week might give some taste of things to come; in addition to yesterday's Pounds 2.5bn auction - and tap issues amounting to Pounds 550m announced in the afternoon  -institutions have to pay over Pounds 1bn in instalments on earlier purchases of gilt-edged stock. Even that may not unsettle the market while it believes Mr Lamont will pull a rabbit from his hat on budget day. Following the latest rate cut, the chancellor looks less likely to deliver the kind of tight package which might curb the PSBR. Some relaxation of the full funding rule is possible. If Mr Lamont is worried about the response to yesterday's auction, he may be all the more inclined to act.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A cautionary double act The bankers and merchants of the City of London witnessed another outbreak of prudence at the Lord Mayor's Mansion House dinner this week. The chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, warned that there would be no tax cuts before government borrowing was under control, and no return to boom and bust. For his part the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, declared that interest rates would have to rise in due course to moderate the pace of expansion. Yet the markets remain largely unconvinced by this prudential double act. While short-dated gilts fell the following day in response to the interest rate warning, long gilts, which might be expected to take cheer from declarations of fiscal and monetary rectitude, also went into retreat. Cautionary rhetoric will not be enough, it seems, to make a big dent in the cost of servicing a Pounds 38bn borrowing requirement, equivalent to 5 1/2 per cent of GDP. Actions, not words, nor indeed a surfeit of bonds, are what investors want to see. At first sight, threats of a rise in short-term rates might seem premature. As Mr George himself pointed out, though GDP is growing at the rate of 2 3/4 per cent, the economy is still operating below capacity. Retail prices on the official measure of underlying inflation have increased by only 2 1/2 per cent on the year, or 1 3/4 per cent if indirect tax increases are excluded. And the latest economic data offer further good news on the inflationary front. The biggest recent worry has been the 4 per cent increase in earnings recorded in the year to March. This week's figures for the year to April showed a reassuringly slower increase of 3 3/4 per cent. Growth in retail sales, meantime, appears to have levelled off in May. Also striking, and possibly with a bearing on the retail sales picture, is the sluggish behaviour of the housing market. House sales By historic standards houses are now cheap in relation to earnings. Prices have unquestionably picked up over the past 12 months, as has the volume of transactions; and there have been quite sharp increases in prices in the parts of London where City professionals, whose bonuses helped inflate the March earnings figures, like to live. Yet a survey of 4,000 estate agents indicated this week that the volume of house sales across the country was down 12.4 per cent last month compared with May 1993. This the agents attribute to two causes: the chancellor's tax increases and the deterrent effect on first-time buyers of higher fixed-rate mortgages. Both suggestions make some sense. The amount people spend on housing is heavily dependent on what they can borrow. The maximum permitted borrowing is related to their ability to service the mortgage debt. Because post-tax earnings have been reduced since April, and mortgage tax relief has also been reduced, purchasing power in the housing market has taken an understandable knock. Midland Global Markets estimates that the cash loss from the chancellor's fiscal tightening for a household with an average mortgage is equivalent to a 1 3/4 per cent rise in mortgage rates. Surprisingly buoyant Meanwhile the cost of fixed-rate mortgages offered by the larger building societies has gone from just under 7 per cent to well over 9 per cent. This has encouraged some potential buyers to delay their purchase. And indeed the whole housing market is still operating in slow motion when compared with previous economic cycles because the housing ladder has broken down. There are still well over a million people with negative equity in their homes. When this is combined with the impact of the recent increase in gilt prices on the cost of fixed-rate borrowing it is hardly surprising that the volume of transactions is slowing down. If anything, the surprise is that consumption in the UK, which is heavily related to activity in the housing market, has been so buoyant in recent months. In effect the British economy is becoming a little more like its continental European counterparts, where long-term rates of interest have a greater impact on the level of economic activity and where housing markets are less prone to boom and bust cycles. It also appears that the gilt market is one jump ahead of the Bank of England and the Treasury in restraining the pace of expansion. That is not to say that Mr George will not need to raise short-term interest rates before long. The gilt market's scepticism about policy rests on the well-tested assumption that reduced taxes and lower mortgage rates win elections for the Tories. If the prudential double act is ever to convince, Messrs George and Clarke will probably have to raise short rates in order to bring long rates down. As in the US, the timing of the electoral cycle would point to a rise sooner rather than later. This indelicate reasoning will not be recorded in the published minutes of their conversations. But it is a safe bet that Mr George will soon be making the case for an early rise in order to bring the gilt market round.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Unemployment figures may hurt confidence UNEMPLOYMENT is traditionally a lagging indicator of economic activity, but yesterday's news that the seasonally adjusted jobless total increased by 60,800 in December could turn out to be an important pointer to future economic policy and trends. Last month's jobless rise was higher than the 55,900 increase of January a year ago, which, when announced in February last year, was the main constituent of a 'black Thursday' of dire economic data that rattled the confidence of the Conservative government as it prepared for the general election. The concern with the December jobless increase is less that it will upset the government than that it will deal a potentially lethal blow to business and consumer confidence just as these indicators were beginning to hint at recovery. The Treasury said that last month's jump in unemployment did not suggest that economic activity was still falling. Officials said it was typical of an economy emerging from recession that there should be some bad figures as well as good. But the view among economists in the City was that the jobless figures, together with November's decline in industrial production, contained the risk of a downward spiral of declining confidence and activity that would nip any signs of recovery in the bud. The monthly rise in unemployment accelerated markedly in the final quarter of last year and there are signs that it could continue at a high level. Ms Sally Wilkinson, a UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank, said a notable aspect of the jobless figures was that 'no one was coming off the register', suggesting that demand for labour is very weak. Another adverse sign is the gap between the increase of 422,000 in seasonally adjusted unemployment last year and the far bigger decline of 877,000 in the workforce in employment in the 12 months to September last year. The December figures could be a sign that many of the people who lost their jobs last year are only now beginning to claim unemployment benefit. Yesterday's news, following the disappointing retail sales figures for December earlier this week, prompted a reappraisal in the City of the government's next policy moves. Last weekend, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, indicated that he would not rush to cut bank base rates from 7 per cent, largely because he has limited scope to keep underlying inflation in the government's band of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. The 24.6 point jump in the FTSE-100 index yesterday showed that the City is looking for an early base rate cut of at least 1 percentage point, followed perhaps by a further cut to 5 per cent later in the year. The bleak news about the real economy will also have a bearing on the discussions in the Treasury and Number 10 about the March budget. A further batch of poor figures in a month's time would make it difficult for the government to contemplate a tax-raising budget in March to curb the growing public-sector deficit. Without an improvement in the economy, Mr Lamont could face a dilemma. Speculation about lower interest rates depressed sterling yesterday. Some economists fear that if the pound's weakness continues, underlying inflation could creep through the top of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range. In a worst-case scenario, the chancellor could find himself having to judge the respective merits of a rise in interest rates to curb inflation and a cut in rates to inject life into the economy.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Peace is the issue in 'widow election': Mervyn de Silva previews a Sri Lanka poll blighted by assassination Efforts to resolve Sri Lanka's 11-year civil war have emerged as the single most important issue in the country's presidential election today in which the two main contenders are the widows of assassinated politicians. Mrs Srima Dissanayake, the opposition United National Party candidate, has taken the place of her husband, Gamini, killed by a suicide bomber, thought to have been a Tamil, a fortnight ago. She is challenging Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the populist prime minister and dominant force in the left-of-centre People's Alliance coalition which came to power after parliamentary elections in August ended 17 years of UNP rule. Mrs Kumaratunga, whose husband was killed by a leftist assassin in 1988, is most likely to win the contest, propelling her into the most powerful post in the land as Sri Lanka's first woman president. Both women have promised peace but have sharply differed on how to end the revolt in the 3.2m Tamil minority community which has killed more than 30,000 people and which costs nearly Dollars 1m a day. Mrs Kumaratunga's People's Alliance government, elected partly on a 'peace dividend' platform, put in train confidence building measures with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northern Jaffna peninsula. It relaxed the economic embargo, restored electricity and opened a safe travel route from the peninsula to the mainland. It also sent a delegation to the north for talks with the rebels. A second round was called off after Mr Dissanayake's assassination. Mrs Dissanayake has accused the government of planning a sell-out of majority Sinhalese interests and ceding territory to the Tamils. She wants the rebels to lay down their arms before negotiating peace with them, and has accused the government of bending over backwards to please the Tigers by not naming them as suspects in the killing of her husband. 'A vote for Chandrika is a vote for LTTE,' posters around the island proclaim. The People's Alliance peace moves have led to the release of some prisoners, mainly policemen held by the LTTE. But the LTTE has insisted that some heavily fortified army camps should be dismantled and a ceasefire declared. The army was strongly opposed to the LTTE demands. Furthermore, Mrs Kumaratunga has angered the high command by saying that poor soldiers were keen on peace while the senior officers were opposed to the idea. Together with the police, the army is a large vote bank. Public servants and servicemen voted by post yesterday and the result could be a clue to the mood of the armed forces, now an important factor in the island's politics. Whether or not the island's military is behind her, Mrs Kumaratunga can, however, rely on the island's minorities. Most Tamils, Moslems and Indian Tamil plantation workers are firmly behind her as she continues to reap the benefits of popular moves to slash flour and fertiliser prices and raise public sector workers' salaries.</p>

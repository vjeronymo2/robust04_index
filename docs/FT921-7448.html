			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Letter: PM's view of reasons for recession 'will not wash' Sir, As you reported (Parliament and politics, February 19 and 20), the prime minister and other government ministers continue to try to blame the recession on world conditions. This will not wash. In March 1991, both the governor of the Bank of England and the chancellor of the exchequer admitted to the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee that the British recession was 'home grown'. In answer to a question from me, the governor said: 'The recession here is in response to what was undeniably an excessive growth in previous years and what might be called unilateral correction by us.' Next day, the chancellor told the committee: 'I do not think there is a worldwide recession as there was in the early 1980s. I think it is absolutely true that the main cause and origin of the recession is a response to the very fast growth - which exceeded the underlying growth of capacity.' It may be true there is now a slow down in some countries, especially Germany, which could affect British exports. Corrective fiscal action by the British government is therefore all the more necessary. As the Treasury select committee said in its report on the Autumn Statement, 'discretionary increases in public expenditure are justified at this stage in the cycle'.

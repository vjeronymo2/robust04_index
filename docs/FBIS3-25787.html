In the  new year, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front  subject themselves to and serve the overall needs of "seizing  opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside  world, promoting economic development, and maintaining social  stability." They must provide correct guidance for public  opinion; take a clear-cut stand in support of reform; have a  good understanding of and publicize the party's principles and  policies; and make full, correct, and timely reports on economic  development as a whole. The principle of doing solid work,  telling the truth, bringing the initiative of the masses into  full play, and achieving actual gains should be carried out to  promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  They should regard it as their duty to maintain social  stability and help solve any ideological and perceptual problems  which might arise in the course of reform by providing clear and  timely explanations.    First, Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the tremendous progress  comrades on the propaganda and ideological front have achieved  over the years in serving reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive while under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line. He urged them to  continue playing a still greater role in reform and development.    Zhu Rongji briefed the conference on China's economic  situation in 1993. He said: The year 1993 saw China implement  in an all-round manner the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and march triumphantly along the course of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics charted by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping. Over the past year, industrial development has  increased its pace; economic returns of enterprises have  improved; new progress has been made in the development of the  rural economy; and production of grains and edible oil has  reached new highs. We have increased efforts and greatly  accelerated construction of key projects; the consumer goods  market has been brisk; and the people's standard of living has  risen continuously. In connection with the conspicuous  contradictions and problems which have arisen in the first half  of 1993 as a result of rapid economic growth, the Central  Committee took the resolute step of strengthening and improving  macroeconomic regulation and control, thus swiftly halting the  tendency of over extension of credit, over supply of currency,  and the rapid drop in the exchange rate of the Renminbi.  Consequently, order in the banking and circulation sectors has  improved markedly. The policy of macroeconomic regulation and  control has yielded positive results.    Zhu Rongji said: Now is the most opportune time for  deepening reform. First, the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics has struck root in the hearts of the  people after a decade or so of reform. Following the  publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches in  1992 and the triumphant convocation of the 14th CPC National  Congress, our party, has broken the ideological bonds of whether  our reform is capitalist or socialist by clearly defining the  goals of socialist market economic reforms, thereby emancipating  our minds and making it possible for us to be free of fear and  restraint in formulating a fairly forward-looking and stable  reform program to tackle the salient economic problems facing us  today by following the general law of market economy, drawing on  the successful experience of developed countries, and proceeding  from the realities of China. Second, the CPC Central Committee  and the State Council have accumulated a wealth of experience in  reform in the past decade or so. In implementing reform, we  have gone through many difficulties, have experienced success as  well setbacks, and have learned some lessons. The current  reform program -- its principles and framework have been studied  for years -- embodies the experience of many years of practice.  A majority consensus has emerged in theoretical circles after  repeated discussion and analysis. Third, after the publication  of the important speeches made by Comrade Xiaoping in 1992, the  momentum of China's economic development has been very good.  Political and business circles abroad are unanimous in their  optimism about China's economic development, and foreign capital  has been flowing into China at a rate never before seen. In  regard to problems which occurred on the way forward, the  Central Committee has taken a range of measures aimed at  strengthening and improving macro-economic regulation and  control to tackle them. These measures have yielded positive  results, and we have gained more experience in how to promptly  and appropriately deal with expected problems in the course of  implementing reforms. By pooling the wisdom of the entire  membership, the party at the Third Plenary Session of its 14th  CPC Central Committee worked out a basic framework of socialist  market economy, thus laying the ideological foundation for  implementing the current reform policies.    Zhu Rongji stressed: The current rare historical  opportunities should be firmly seized and highly valued in order  to firmly advance the reforms we deliberated and wanted to  implement for years but could not because conditions were not  correct. If we fail to seize this opportunity to overcome the  numerous difficulties in structural reform, then we will not be  able to maintain sustained, rapid, and sound economic  development and will not able to accomplish the second-step  strategic objective of national socioeconomic development.    Zhu Rongji added: The preparatory work for the reform  program for this year is quite adequate. Under the leadership  of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the  nucleus, the reform program was worked out by two task forces  composed of talents and backbone personnel from various sectors  who had conducted long, careful, and painstaking research and  who have canvassed the views of all quarters. We have taken  into full account the formidable difficulty and complexity which  the current reform entails. It goes without saying that no  pre-designed reform program is perfect; all we can do is  constantly put it into practice, constantly sum up experience,  and constantly make readjustments in the course of reform. As  Comrade Xiaoping said: "The entire party and the nation must be  told that it is a hard task. There are no perfect policies or  methods. Facing us will be new situations and problems; we have  to create experience on our own." "This requires us to be bold  yet careful in every step we take, to sum up experience in a  timely fashion, make readjustments as problems arise, and adapt  according to the actual conditions." So long as we act  according to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speeches, we will  certainly be able to make reform a success.    Zhu Rongji pointed out: Currently, the main risk does not  lie in reform itself, but in the overexpansion of investment in  fixed assets which has gone beyond the capacity of the nation to  build on the investment. The agricultural problem remains  outstanding. Some comrades are keen on launching new projects;  on expanding the scale of construction; and on vying with one  another in chalking up faster growth rates, in displaying  wealth, and in creating high consumption. However, they are not  interested in improving economic returns, in practicing  economics, in moving from the red ink into the black, and in  improving management. They are not keen about promoting  agriculture, improving the vegetable supply, developing the  market, keeping prices under control, or taking care of the  well-being of the broad masses. This situation must be changed.    Zhu Rongji said: Reform and development in 1994 entails  heavy work. The people are concerned about it, and the world is  looking at us. Whether or not we can effectively carry out this  key battle of reform is a rigorous test. We must show great  determination in decreasing the scale of investment in fixed  assets, and must continue stabilizing and developing the rural  economy. Comrade Xiaoping said in 1988: "For reform to  succeed, it must be carried out under organized leadership and  in a measured manner, otherwise everyone will go his own way and  there will be chaos. What a terrible thing that would be!."  "If the CPC Central Committee and State Council do not have  authority, then the situation will be out of control. "  "Macro-control must be based on what the central committee says  will hold." Leading comrades at all levels and all party  members must further unify their understanding, march in unison,  work vigorously, and help each other to make the country  prosperous. Party committees and governments at all levels must  pay still more attention to reform, and principal leading cadres  must stand in the forefront of carrying out the reform program.    In conclusion, Zhu Rongji said: We are convinced that under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, and under the correct  leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as the nucleus, we will successfully implement the decision  adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the reform program formulated at the Central  Economic Work Conference through the common efforts of the  entire party and whole nation, and will achieve still greater  advances in economic development this year.    Leading comrades present at the conference were Li Lanqing,  Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, and Ren Jianxin. Ding  Guangen presided over the conference.</p>

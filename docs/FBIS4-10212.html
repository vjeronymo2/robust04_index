			<p>BFN     [Text] There is already emotion within the Coordinating  Committee for National Mobilization [CCMN] after the decision of  the Conference of Presidents not to receive the members of this  committee. Hubert De Ronceray calls President Monde's  allegations spectacular.    [Begin De Ronceray recording, in Creole] You must be  careful.  You must not give much importance to certain spectacular  statements. I call them spectacular statements because there are  people who want to show that... [pauses] They are attributing  much importance to themselves whereas what is being settled here  is something very serious. It is about an imperiled country.  Our contacts have shown us that many people within the  parliament, both in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, take  the matter very seriously. So, if there are other people who  are providing entertainment, who are making somewhat noisy  statements, we think it is because they want to attribute  importance to themselves. But we are more than convinced that  something serious will result from this resolution. [end  recording]</p>

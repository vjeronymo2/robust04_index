			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / German employers' high wage offers may hearten strikers EMPLOYERS in eastern Germany are offering temporary wage increases as high as 26 per cent, in defiance of recommendations of a 9 per cent rise by the national steel and engineering employers' associations. The pay rises, which may apply only to April pay packets, are likely to encourage IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, to continue with a wave of warning strikes throughout eastern Germany's steel, electrical and metal industry. The strikes, called on Thursday, are in protest against the decision by Gesamtmetall, the electrical and metal employers' association, and Arbeitgeber-verband Stahl, the steel employers' association, to break contracts agreed in March 1991 with IG Metall. The contracts were designed to bring eastern German wages up to western German levels by April 1994. The eastern German metal and electrical sectors were due for a pay increase of 26 per cent on April 1 and the steel sector a 21 per cent rise. But the employers said they could not afford the increases in view of low productivity in eastern Germany and the recession in western Germany. The temporary offer by Opel, Volkswagen, and Daimler, which have plants or suppliers in eastern Germany, is probably aimed at preventing further stoppages. Yesterday, IG Metall described the Volkswagen pay offer as a 'pseudo-pay increase'. In other sectors of the economy, KWO Kabel, owned by BICC, the British-based cable manufacturer, has already offered an annual pay increase of 15 per cent. Lufthansa, the German national airline, is negotiating to bring the wages of its 500 eastern German employees to 82 per cent of western German levels. IG Metall officials yesterday said they would continue with the strikes. 'Eastern German fringe benefits are far lower than their western German counterparts,' said Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin. A steel worker in eastern Germany earns DM1,762 (Pounds 722) a month before tax, works a 40-hour week and has 24 days' annual holiday. In contrast, from April 1, a western German steel worker of the same rank, earns DM2,694 a month, works a 36-hour week and has 30 days of annual leave.</p>

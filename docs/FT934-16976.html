			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Segni seeks new reformist accord MR Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement in Italy, called at the weekend for a new pact among Italy's reformist forces, after his split from Democratic Alliance, writes Robert Graham in Rome. His departure from AD, a loose political grouping, was formalised on Friday and has opened the way for a fresh arrangement of the alliances at the centre of Italian politics. Speaking at a rally near Catania in Sicily, Mr Segni said he was seeking to form 'a broad pact for national renewal' that would focus on a full constitutional overhaul. As the political parties prepare for municipal elections in many major cities next month, Mr Segni has cut free to stake his claim to lead the centre. The former Christian Democrat made clear at the weekend that he wanted to act as an alternative to Mr Umberto Bossi's populist Lombard League on the right and to Mr Achille Occhetto's Party of the Democrat Left (PDS). Mr Segni's divorce was provoked by his refusal to see the AD ally with the PDS. He feared the movement would be manipulated in the former communists' desire for power. He is now free to move back towards his former colleagues in the Christian Democrat Party. Many observers felt that his departure from it in March was temporary. Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the party secretary, has made no secret of his desire to see Mr Segni back in the fold.</p>

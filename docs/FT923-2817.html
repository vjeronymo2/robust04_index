			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Jobs: The only useful way to be outstanding - Whatever employers say about seeking 'character', the best bet is to keep to the safe profile IF any secret service chiefs around the world are looking for English-speaking agents, they might care to contact headhunter John McManus. He says a lot of the people he interviews these days strike him as being ideal for such work. The reason is that once they've gone out of the door, he can no longer remember what they look like. Who is to blame for same is of course a moot point. After all, even recruitment consultants are not proof against the ravages of age, including amnesia. For his part, 57-year-old Mr McManus insists that, as far as he can recall, his memory is as good as ever. A more probable explanation for the increased forgettability of candidates, he thinks, is that the herd-instinct has been strengthened by the recession. With so many people chasing so few openings, they are averse to the risk of seeming to stand out as unusual, preferring the shelter of the safe profile. 'It's paradoxical, because the more unexceptionably qualified candidates there are around, the more vital it is to be exceptional,' he adds. 'But daft though it be, that's what I see as happening.' Alas, if his explanation is right, he and his fellow executive-recruiters can expect to see candidates become still more forgettable over the next year or two - at least in Britain. That much seems clear from the response to my appeal eight weeks ago for hard evidence about so-called 'de-layering' by employers, which is reputedly abolishing managerial jobs wholesale and probably for ever. While most of the replies were anecdotal, and even they reported little such activity in continental Europe, the British Institute of Management produced figures. They came from a survey it had just made in conjunction with Manpower UK of the heads of 163 big employers in Britain. It turned out that, since 1985, about two thirds of them had cut their managerial staff by at least one whole layer. Moreover, two in every five planned to do the same again by 1996. By contrast, a mere 3 per cent were expecting to employ more managers in any way whatsoever. Hence it would appear that the chances of getting taken on for a management job will increasingly depend on bucking the herd-instinct and presenting oneself as exceptional. Unfortunately, however, that is something which is far easier to theorise about than it is to put into practice successfully. Indeed, there are good reasons to believe that the percentage game rests with the safe profile. For a start, there are many ways of being unusual, and the odds are against hitting on the right choice for any given occasion. The problem is not only that recruiters' prejudices are such that an outstanding trait which appeals to one is apt to repel a second. There's a still greater chance of just failing to sway them either one way or the other. For instance, John McManus says the most memorable candidates he has seen in the past year were three who turned up in bow ties. None of them got the job. Even stronger support for the safe profile lies in research published four years ago by the Institute of Manpower Studies. It indicated that most recruiters in Britain, and especially the majority with no training in interviewing, approach the task defensively. Instead of setting out to choose the right candidate, they are primarily concerned to avoid picking the wrong one. Save for such eccentricities as being related to the company chairman, unusual traits are liable to provoke rejection. All of which points to a drab dilemma for ambitious managers. The percentage game is to match each likely opening with an un-exceptionable application, then support it when so invited with a characterless performance at interview, and wait for the law of averages to deliver. The snag is that, in an age of de-layering, the candidates may well be dead before their turn comes round. Yet what can they safely do to accelerate their acceptance? Happily, there is a way of being exceptional that is not only safe, but productive. Or so we're told, at least, by theologian-cum-psychologist Max Eggert, who surrounds his one-day-week as a part-time priest with work as an outplacement consultant. He has just produced a book* on being interviewed, which besides being among the shortest of the many on the topic the Jobs column has read these past two decades, seems the most pertinent. His thesis is that the only useful way of standing out from the similarly qualified herd is to be that remarkable rarity, the thoroughly adept interviewee. True, such expertise will be swiftly twigged by the equally rare expert interviewers. But far from being antagonised by it, he says, they'll tend to respond warmly to the unusual chance to show their own mettle. Meanwhile, on encountering the much commoner defensive amateurs, a skilful interviewee can achieve the same effect by 'helping them' through their struggles, not least by feeding their anxious hunger for proofs of a safeness nobody - particularly not their superiors - could doubt. Simply because that is usually the recruiter's main criterion, * The perfect interview. Century Business, Pounds 5.99. however, usefully exceptional candidates make sure to appear quite the opposite of outstanding in other ways. For example, recalling headhunter McManus's eye for points of dress, here is the book's advice on how to identify what to wear: 'It is easy to get information on corporate style. First, visit the firm about lunchtime a few days before the interview and notice what people are wearing in terms of style, colour and accessories. 'The other source of infor-mation is the company's Annual Report which these days features an obligatory picture of members of the board.' A further safeguard against emitting unsafe signals is to remember that crucial meetings tend to provoke a state of 'high arousal' which can unsteady your physical movements. So if you as a candidate are offered a coffee, however much you want one, say no. The odds are that your shaking hands will at best slurp it into the saucer. (As that warning doesn't apply only to interviews of job-seeking kind, I wish I'd heard it long ago. Many a time, when vainly trying to still my cup-clattering mitt, I've seen the eminence opposite clearly drawing the obvious conclusion from the bibulous image of my trade.) Moreover, just as sins you don't have can be a danger, so can blessings which you do. One of the most dangerous is a talent for detecting and pointing out irrationalities in things other people say. 'Never argue with job interviewers, no matter how charmingly,' the book advises. The sole exception comes at the last stage of the process, pay-haggling, and even then it is best to stick to a tested format. One Max Eggert recommends is the procedure by which Brooklyn opticians sell spectacles. It goes: The lenses in these glasses are very reasonable - a mere Dollars 40 . . . Each . . . That includes the standard frame, but this particular one costs Dollars 120 . . . If you want it in gold, that's another Dollars 50, although real rolled gold is Dollars 150 . . . We can deliver in four weeks instead of the normal six months, at a small service charge of Dollars 50.</p>

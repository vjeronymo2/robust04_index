			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Afloat on the tides of a recession - Nick Garnett meets a man who reacted to redundancy by buying a company STATISTICAL tables of the unemployed are littered with countless senior managers pushed on to the street by company restructuring and recession. But recession also spells shrunken asset values and the opportunity of acquiring tiny production businesses at low cost. Chris Ward found himself out of work in the middle of 1990 when he was made redundant from his job as managing director of the UK domestic products division of the Hicksons group. Six months on and Ward was a boat builder, the owner of a tiny yard near the Norfolk Broads making cruisers, motor yachts and catamarans and fitting out lifeboats and other vessels. It cost him Pounds 79,000 to buy. It is hardly Swan Hunter but it gives 40-year-old Ward a new perspective on life. 'What you have is freedom to design your own strategy for the business and implement that unencumbered by boardroom politics. I like being involved with boats but had no experience of running a boat-building business.' The downside of paltry asset values, though, is feeble demand. 'It's a bad time to be in any business. It makes the potential new boat buyer very wary, not because they have lost money in the recession but because they are hanging on to it in case their own business gets into trouble.' Ward has felt it necessary to inject a further Pounds 35,000 of his own money, mainly to cover part of the cost of building a particular style of motor yacht as the yard's own product which is yet to find a buyer. He has been a keen sailor for a long time; his own sailing yacht is moored in the marina at Ipswich where he lives. 'I started looking for a business connected with the marine industry,' he said. An advert caught his eye in Yachting Monthly, for a yard in one of those dreary places near Lowestoft, an hour's drive away. The owner wanted Pounds 50,000 cash, a further Pounds 50,000 over five years. A one-off cash price was eventually agreed. Ward coughed up Pounds 50,000 immediately; the balance of Pounds 29,000 was supplied by National Westminster bank without a visit to the yard, but with Ward's business prospectus. What Ward got for his money was a company, Crown Fletcher (he renamed it Crown Fletcher Boat Builders), with a boat-making name since 1906, a building housing five boat bays on a 21 year lease, equipment like bandsaws and steam machinery to bend wood into shape, and a workforce of six craftsmen and an apprentice. The business, he says, generated a turnover of Pounds 250,000 in the last year before he bought it, though over Pounds 100,000 of this derived from buying-in, then using, raw materials. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 12,000. He bought the yard in January last year. Since then it has turned over Pounds 203,000 and made a profit of Pounds 18,000. The yard can build complete wooden vessels from the keel upwards, usually using Columbian pine, teak and mahogany, as well as fitting out fibreglass vessels whose hulls are supplied from outside. Ward has so far taken out no salary and has pumped in that further Pounds 35,000. It has been hard work. He leaves home at 6.30 am and returns in the evening. 'I bought the yard because it had a good level of skills, access directly from the sea, and from Oulton Broads through a lock, and because it had a record of supplying and refitting lifeboats.' The company came with a 62-year-old foreman who helped Ward find his sea legs in costing jobs. Ward also had a stroke of luck when John Perryman, a professional boat designer and naval architect once employed by Crown Fletcher, offered his services, bringing two orders in his back pocket. 'When I bought the yard it didn't have a designer,' Ward says. 'It was doing a lot on subcontract. I probably could have used a third party designer but it makes you more competitive having someone on the premises. For some vessels we can design it, price it and do a bill of specification in four days. Without John's skills we would have struggled to break into the new boat build market.' Since Ward bought the company, Crown Fletcher has built a 60-seat catamaran for Pounds 70,000, using a fibreglass hull, and is part way through a 41 foot all-wooden traditional Broads cruiser, sold for well over Pounds 100,000. It has also refitted two large lifeboats. Ward is trying to switch the yard towards more wooden boat building and refit work and away from buying-in fibreglass hulls. Boat building is a competitive industry, much more so now the market for new boats has slid by more than 30 per cent. 'Almost every job comes from competitive tendering,' Ward says. 'Normally the buyer goes for the cheapest yard. Over the long term that is not good because it is mainly marginal profits.' Trying to circumnavigate this problem, Ward acquired a fibreglass mould and produced a hull for what will be the yard's own product, a 32 foot motor yacht. 'Part of our strategy is to develop something of our own to get out of all this competitive tendering.' This vessel though, which is part finished and with a price tag of Pounds 105,000, has no buyer yet, and is absorbing some of Ward's personal cash. Avoiding the odd sour contract is also tricky. 'We had a Pounds 60,000 job in the yard before Christmas to repair a burnt-out fishing boat, but the owner's bank foreclosed on the proceeds of the insurance policy. So we had sewn up four months work for two people and found ourselves without that job through no fault of our own. We got our costs back, but that was small compared with Pounds 60,000.' Ward has found that company and family are entwined when running a new venture. 'After the recession my expectation is that the yard will provide a good living. But like all business ventures, you have to put a lot in to get a lot out. What you need is a totally committed wife who understands all the risks when you take on a venture.'

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Complex web of Saudi interests Hanging over a door in Mr Jonathan Aitken's Westminster house are a ceremonial sword and dagger, a gift to him from King Khalid of Saudi Arabia before he was appointed chief secretary to the Treasury. The gift symbolises the extensive and complex range of Saudi-connected business interests Mr Aitken built up before he joined the government, beginning with his time in the early 1970s as managing director of the Middle Eastern operations of the property and banking group Slater Walker, which collapsed in 1975. After Mr Aitken disclosed on Wednesday night that he too had been interviewed by Sir Robin Butler in the cabinet secretary's probe of alleged ministerial improprieties, his extensive business interests have fallen under the spotlight. His most prominent role has been as chairman of Aitken Hume, the fund management and banking group he set up with his cousin Timothy in 1981. Four years after its formation the group paid Pounds 16.5m for Sentinel Insurance Company, a life assurance group. About 60 per cent of Sentinel's shares were held by accountants Price Waterhouse as liquidator for the Israel-British Bank (London) which collapsed in 1974 with its Israeli parent company, the Israeli-British Bank of Tel Aviv, with a combined deficit of about Pounds 60m. The remaining shares in Sentinel were largely held by relatives of Mr Harry Landy, chairman of the Israel-British Bank and of Sentinel. Mr Landy was also a director of a Lonrho subsidiary during the House of Fraser battle. Following Aitken Humes's purchase of Sentinel, Mr Wafic Said, a wealthy Syrian-born businessman, became a major shareholder in the company. Mr Aitken's declaration in the register of MPs' interests for 1989 listed a number of business interests. At the time he declared his chairmanship of Aitken Hume, a directorship of Al Bilad (UK) Limited, a directorship of TV-am, a directorship of Beaverbrook Investments and a directorship of BMARC (the British Manufacturer and Research Company), which was a subsidiary of the now defunct arms company, Astra. Al Bilad (UK) Ltd is described in the register as a subsidiary of a foreign parent company which receives payments from contracts with Saudi Arabian royal family interests and government agencies. In March 1988 Mr Aitken's Saudi connections forced him to resign from the board of TV-am when it emerged that he had failed to disclose a Saudi royal family interest in Beaverbrook Investments, the company through which he held his position. In the House of Commons he has shown some interest in the House of Fraser affair. During a House of Commons debate on publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report on the House of Fraser in April 1989, Mr Aitken asked Mr Anthony Newton, then minister of trade and industry, to confirm that Lord Young, the trade and industry Secretary, 'has an unfettered discretion to publish the report'. He asked if it was 'wise for Lord Young to rely yesterday in the House of Lords on the statement that the prosecuting authorities would have to stop their inquiries if the report was published'. He concluded by stating: 'Are we not in some confusion and in danger of entering into a second 'Carry On, Spycatcher' saga?'</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Brazilian state sales resume BRAZIL'S privatisation programme has resumed after a four-month suspension. The government stake in petrochemicals company Poliolefinas was sold on Friday at the minimum price of Dollars 86.1m to Odebrecht, one of Brazil's leading construction groups. The sale was seen as a clear indication that President Itamar Franco's government is serious about modernisation and reducing the deficit. There is still considerable opposition in Brazil to privatisation. A legal battle on Friday caused a five and a half hour delay before Poliolefinas could go under the hammer. The government is expected to face serious difficulties over the next auction: that of the Rio-based National Steel Company, scheduled for April 2. The company is regarded as a symbol of Brazil's industrial might. Rio's governor intends to oppose the sale. Mr Eliseu Resende, finance minister, says the government will impose 'strict vigilance' over prices by strengthening the Price Monitoring Department though it will not reintroduce controls.</p>

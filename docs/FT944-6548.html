			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / JAL says Y176bn currency losses will not hit earnings Japan Airlines said yesterday its earnings would be unaffected by estimated losses on 1985 forward currency buying contracts totalling Y176.3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) by the end of this accounting year. The size of the figure, unconfirmed by JAL, caused a 4 per cent drop to Y681 in the share price, although analysts have long known that the airline is working its way through a huge pile of currency losses caused by the dollar's sharp fall against the yen. JAL said the losses had already been accounted for in past and future aircraft depreciation charges. While unable to confirm the exact loss, calculated by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper from currency contract records, JAL said it was based on correct data, covering the decade to March 1995. Last month JAL announced Y43.9bn of unrealised currency losses for the two years until March 1997. It was JAL's first such announcement, a consequence of a change in Japanese disclosure rules to give investors more information about companies' currency exposure. Others to have disclosed currency losses in their half-year reports include All Nippon Airways, with a Y10.7bn shortfall - also on forward dollar buying contracts - and 10 companies in the construction and electronics sectors. JAL's currency shortfall comes from forward contracts to buy dollars for yen, at rates agreed in the mid 1980s, when the dollar was worth more. JAL needs to buy dollars every year, because it pays more than Dollars 1bn annually for fuel and aircraft, but earns most of its revenue in yen. Forward contracts allow it to calculate in advance the full yen cost of buying aircraft, even at the risk of a costly miscalculation. The company used to take out long term futures contracts, running up to 10 years ahead, to fund its aircraft buying programme. Alarmed by the growing currency losses. Mr Susumu Yamaji, the president, earlier this year asked his finance department to buy dollars on shorter and less risky forward contracts. JAL reported a turnround with a Y20.6bn recurring profit on its operations for the six months to September and is expected by equity analysts to make a small profit for the full year, turning the corner after three years of losses.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington sells insulation arm to Owens-Corning Pilkington has taken another step in reducing its debt and refocusing on its core glass business through the Pounds 73.3m sale of Pilkington Insulation to Owens-Corning, the US fibreglass group. The disposal had been expected, but analysts said Pilkington had achieved a good price for a company with net assets of Pounds 50m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m. Owens-Corning will also assume Pounds 7m of financial leases. Pilkington Insulation manufactures and sells rock wool and fibreglass for the building and industrial insulation market in the UK, and has a large share of a relatively mature market. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said: 'We didn't own the technology, and we were restricted to the UK market, which is growing slowly.' He estimated that the market would continue to grow at between 2 cent and 3 per cent a year. However, it provides a strategic entry to the UK market for Owens-Corning, which has already established a substantial presence in continental Europe. Pilkington Insulation will be renamed Owens-Corning Building Products (UK). Mr Warren Knowlton, who will head the business, said: 'The deal gives us a 50 per cent share of a large market, excellent sales and manufacturing capability, and the ability to leverage our existing technology in the future'. Owens-Corning is capitalised at Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) with insulation as one of its core businesses. Mr Knowlton said it would continue to expand the UK business, which should secure jobs for the 900 employees at Pilkington Insulation. The sale of the company continues a chain of divestments by Pilkington to fulfil its stated aim of reducing gearing from a mid-1993 peak of close to 90 per cent to 50 per cent by March next year. Last September it sold Sola, its spectacle lens business, for Pounds 200m and it has announced plans to sell off 49 per cent of its Australian operations through a flotation. The latest disposal will reduce gearing by about 8 per cent. Analysts expect a number of other trading and service companies could be sold over the next year. Pilkington is due to announce its full year results on Thursday.</p>

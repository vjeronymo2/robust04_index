			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Books: High on concept, low on meaning THE RE-ENCHANTMENT OF ART by Suzi Gablik Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 12.95, 191 pages SERIOUS ART by John Passmore Duckworth Pounds 29.95, 301 pages SUZI Gablik's new book is a passionate plea for making modern art relevant to the way we live. The appeal is timely, since most modern art this century, in its high-minded and high-handed way, has done its best to alienate its audience. An example is the sculptor Richard Serra, who in 1981 erected his monumental steel structure Tilted Arc in the middle of downtown Manhattan. Suddenly confronted by a 120ft long, 12ft high, 73 ton leaning curve of welded steel, local workers objected. After three days of public hearings and a 1300-signature petition, Tilted Arc was removed. 'What the Tilted Arc controversy forces us to consider,' Gablik says, 'is whether art that is based on notions of pure freedom and radical autonomy - without regard for the relations we have to other people, the community, or any other consideration except the pursuit of art - can contribute to a sense of the common good.' Gablik endorses the view that much modern art mirrors the meaninglessness of society, its addictive consumption and its lack of any 'great integrating vision'. Drawing on feminist theory, environmentalism and 'new age' rethinking about the myths and symbols underpinning our spiritual life, she proposes a new agenda for art with an updated version of Vasari's Lives to match. There is Fern Shaffer, for instance, who, like an ancient shaman, performs solstice rituals to re-acquaint his audience with the rhythms of the universe; the Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, who makes sculptures with what he finds - leaves, flowers, snow - which melt or blow away within a day (a success in Japan, where he says it is in the nature of the Japanese not to question the value of something which is not going to last); Dominique Mazeud, whose art consists of clearing debris from the Rio Grande River; and Beth Sartz, whose sound-and-vision work, Gablik says, had the effect of making many people 'even lay down in front of the paintings to receive healing'. You are bound not to agree with all that Gablik says. Her bias against industrialisation can be seen as Luddite, even inhuman. Her language (cosmic energy flows, soul-consciousness) can seem a mystery. Her enthusiasm for conceptual art, like her criticism of modernism, is perhaps too obviously written from within the American art tradition. Surely representational art, a still-life by Chardin or a landscape by Cezanne, can seem as ecologically sound and as wedded to the values of trust and compassion, as her other examples? Herein lies the crux, for Gablik is woefully thin on how a work of art communicates its meaning. A Henry Moore sculpture can move many people without their claiming to understand it; many of the works Gablik admires makes sense only when they are accompanied by a full-length manifesto. Is that art or agitprop? Gablik makes a good case for re-appreciating art as artisanship (Morris and Ruskin would approve), but where does 'useful' art end, in redesigning New York City's dustcarts or performing a counselling service for the Sanitation Department's employees? Though combining sense with nonsense, Gablik goes a long way to revitalising the voice of art within the conversation of mankind. This is more than can be said of high priests of modernism such as Andy Warhol, who preached only fashionable ennui, or indeed of John Passmore, Professor of the History of Ideas at Canberra University. Like an over-educated schoolboy, Passmore spends 292 pages poking fun at high-falutin' notions of serious art. Clive James, an equally sceptical but far funnier antipodean, would have kicked the subject into touch in five minutes. Passmore, though, is that other familiar phenomenon, a Great Australian Windbag and, to judge from this laboured piece of waggery, a pretty self-conceited one at that.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CYPRESS GIRLS' BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW'S LATE BURST FINISHES GAHR  </P> <P> Ocean View High School waited until the last quarter to break away from Gahr in  the Cypress tournament championship game, emerging with a 44-38 victory.  </P> <P> It could have been easier if the Seahawks (10-0) had come up with their  strategy earlier: feed Jenny Sullivan the ball.  </P> <P> Sullivan, Ocean View's 6-foot-2 center, scored a career-high 33 points,  including all of the Seahawks' 13 points in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "Jenny is always a dominant defensive player," Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin  said. "Now she knows how to dominate both (offense and defense)."  </P> <P> Ocean View took a 13-8 lead in the first quarter, but Gahr roared back in the  second, took advantage of the Seahawks' nine turnovers and entered halftime  with a two-point lead, 21-19.  </P> <P> Martin told his team to change its offense in the third quarter, and it fed the  ball to Sullivan, who scored 10 points as the teams tied three times, at 23-23,  25-25 and 27-27.  </P> <P> "The fatigue factor is what gets us in these tournaments," Martin said. "We  came off the full-court press in the second half because of it."  </P> <P> With Sullivan consistently managing to get open under the basket, Ocean View  held a 44-32 lead at one point in the fourth quarter, but Gahr scored six  unanswered points in the game's final two minutes.  </P> <P> In other Cypress tournament games:  </P> <P> Cypress 58, Marina 54 -- Although Christa Yorke scored a game-high 21 points  for Marina, Cypress came away with the third-place game.  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 48, Foothill 33 -- Jennifer Rohrig scored 18 points to lead  Mission Viejo (8-3) in the fifth-place game.  </P> <P> Valencia 47, Kennedy 44 -- Sig Lo made two free throws with 30 seconds left to  clinch the victory for Valencia (4-4) in the consolation championship.  </P></p>

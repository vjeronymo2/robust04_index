			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Akimov] </F>   [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 10 June TASS -- The municipal  council of Leninsk, a satallite town of the Baykonur cosmodrome,  is concerned over the future of this rocket-launching complex.  The Kazakh newspaper EKSPRESS-K reports that the council had  backed the appeal of a group of its members to the Kazakh  Supreme Soviet, expressing alarmed in connection with the  absence of a mechanism to implement the Kazakh-Russian agreement  on the main principles and terms for the use of the cosmodrome.    A resolution, adopted in this connection, notes that the  slowness of the governments of the two countries in implementing  the achieved agreements places the population of the town in a  very difficult predicament. The financing of its infrastructure  was slashed. People were virtually freezing in the production  premises and in their apartments last winter. The cosmodrome  facilities could not be used, because this is not allowed during  very cold periods.    The session's resolution was forwarded to corresponding  committees and commissions of the Kazakh and Russian Parliaments.</p>

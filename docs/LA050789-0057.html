			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA BEACH ACCESS KEY TO FLAP  </P> <P> What a surprise! Douglas Badt, manager of the private Sand and Sea Club, was  quoted in Times Staff Writer Alan Citron's article on April 30 saying,  "Everyone wants the beach to stay as it is." Badt and his elite members wish to  keep things as they are -- they have had exclusive access to a beach site for  which they pay the city of Santa Monica next to nothing.  </P> <P> Badt and his members . . . are suddenly outraged that a hotel will block access  to the beach.  </P> <P> Badt is currently funding an initiative drive aptly named "Save Our Beach".  Save our beach for whom? For the 200 or so wealthy members of the Sand and Sea  Club? No, thank you.  </P> <P> Last year, the Santa Monica City Council, under pressure from the state of  California, which owns the property, chose a new mixed-use plan for the club  site. The goal was to dramatically improve access for all beach-goers, while  generating substantial revenues for the bankrupt Beach Fund. The Beach Fund  pays for the upkeep and improvement of all Santa Monica beaches.  </P> <P> The city chose Michael McCarty to build a hotel and community center on the  Sand and Sea site. As a Pico Neighborhood activist, I was one of numerous  representatives from community organizations throughout Santa Monica to help  design the community center. It will include community meeting space, a staging  area for public events, a low-priced cafe, a children's park, a marine and art  learning center, and most importantly, year-round beach access for all of the  public. A 148-room hotel at the site will pay for these public uses and will  restore the Beach Fund.  </P> <P> Badt's initiative takes advantage of people's concerns about overdevelopment  while actually preserving the private privileges of a few. The city's plan  opens public access to the beach and deserves our support.  </P> <P> DIANNE GLINOS  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

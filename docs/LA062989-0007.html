			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS FLAG BURNING AS PROTEST  </P> <P> The Supreme Court decision to support the freedom of expression and speech  inherent in the burning of the American flag is clearly going to swell your  mail bins, and mostly, I suspect with the outcries of the enraged, including  most "leaders" in Washington.  </P> <P> The most ludicrous complaint will be that this somehow demeans the sacrifices  made by those who "died for our flag." Nonsense! One, hopefully, doesn't die  for a symbol. The right to have that symbol? Of course. The principle for which  that symbol stands? Most assuredly. But not for the simple, albeit beautiful  piece of cloth.  </P> <P> It is ironic, in fact, that the desire of the seeming majority of our citizens  to allow prosecution of flag burners would cheapen and violate part of our Bill  of Rights, probably the most important single set of principles that has made  our country so great.  </P> <P> And, no, I could not, would not, participate in such an act; neither I, nor any  of those justices who voted to uphold the basic freedom in this issue, support  or condone the burning of our flag: We support the right to do so.  </P> <P> A simple, but true allegory: My father, Robert R. Rissman, was a partner in the  '50s and '60s law firm of Wirin, Rissman, and Okrand, the legal representatives  for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (before it became  fashionable to be card-carrying members!). A.L. Wirin, as the senior partner,  fought for and won the right for a local neo-Nazi spokesman to utilize public  school facilities to spew out his vitriolic messages: As long as he stopped  short of inciting to riot, it is his right to publicize his point of view,  however offensive it might be to most of us. But to express his personal  distaste for the content of that meeting, leading the parade of picketing  protesters outside the meeting he worked to ensure would convene, was Wirin  himself: "I support your right to speak; I can't stand the ideas you wish to  spread" -- principle personified.  </P> <P> If we bemoan the decline of morality in too many our public figures (with  sorrowful examples from the political and religious right and left), let's take  pride in and have hope from such acts of principle by our high court,  epitomizing what this country is truly about.  </P> <P> EDWARD M. RISSMAN  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P></p>

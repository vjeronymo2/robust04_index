			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Matter of course, not eccentric Sir, I read your newspaper's article (January 25) about Yanase, a Japanese car dealer which makes staff use public transport to get to work, with much interest. The article presented the policy as unusual and even eccentric. However, I take it as a matter of course. In Japan for a long time many office workers have been told by their employers to use trains and buses in big cities. Yanase was a special case because the workers were allowed to drive into the city centre. The only reason was that they dealt in cars. The article also included a comment from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. It thought it was more important to improve the transport infrastructure. This response is quite understandable. Car manufacturers are always sited outside cities in the countryside. For workers in these factories there is no alternative but to use their own cars. For city centre workers, however, using public transport is the rule rather than an eccentric exception. Masamitsu Igaki, c/o Linguarama, 1 Elm Court, Arden Street, Stratford upon Avon</p>

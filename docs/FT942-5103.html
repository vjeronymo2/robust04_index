			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / SPD vows to stop squabbling Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) yesterday admitted that the wind had gone out of its campaign to win the October elections but vowed it would close ranks for the last leg. Mr Rudolf Scharping, its leader, said that the party had been unable to achieve a 'significant lead' in recent months, a setback which he blamed on internal squabbles. 'Everyone has finally sworn to end this process,' he said after a meeting between the party leadership and SPD members from all 16 Lander governments. A series of recent opinion polls have shown Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union pulling level with or overtaking the SPD, bolstered by signs of an economic recovery and stronger support in eastern Germany. Going back on earlier comments, the SPD also said that 'for technical reasons' it would keep the so-called 'solidarity surcharge' - a 7.5 per cent tax to finance investment in eastern Germany - until 1996. The party had earlier said the surcharge would be scrapped and replaced with a 10 per cent charge on single people earning over DM60,000 annually. This will now be introduced in 1996.</p>

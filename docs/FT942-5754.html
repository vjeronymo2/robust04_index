			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Outsiders hit by a strain of Euro-fever: Hugh Carnegy and Ian Rodger find referendums in the air in applicant states - European Elections Euro-election fever is definitely in the air in Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the four European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries whose governments hope to join the European Union at the beginning of next year. But these outsiders looking in at the elections to the European parliament are only bit players, for the moment, in the story. Their attention, instead, is firmly focused on the campaigns for the referendum votes to be held in each of the four on whether to join the EU. This is particularly so in Austria, where the referendum will be on June 12, the same day as the EU parliamentary vote. The streets of Vienna, are decked out with posters hoisted by the two sides in the fervent referendum contest. The debate turns on issues vital to Austrians, such as the country's neutrality, its environment and the survival of its mountain farmers. The gap between the Yes and No camps has narrowed, with a poll earlier this week showing Yes on 48 per cent, its lead cut to just two percentage points. In the three Nordic countries, the referendums are not due until autumn. Finland will vote on October 16, Sweden on November 13 and Norway on November 28. In Sweden, the vote will be preceded by a general election on September 13. But in all three nations, the EU debate is already well under way. Television and radio debates on the issue are frequent, newspapers are full of the story and it is a subject of lively private discussion. While the Efta countries are preoccupied with their own referendum campaigns, the outcome of the European parliamentary elections could have an influence on how those campaigns develop. This has already happened in Austria, where the referendum date was deliberately set to coincide with the parliamentary vote among existing members. The country's mainstream political leaders, united in their desire for a Yes vote, were concerned to make the conditions surrounding the referendum as favourable as possible for a positive result. That led them initially to choose to hold the referendum in June, so that the issues involved would not become confused with those in a national election that must be held later in the year. They initially favoured June 19 or June 26, giving them as much time as possible for passing the enabling legislation and rallying support to the pro-Europe cause. But it was felt that an unsavoury outcome to the European parliamentary elections on June 12, such as the election of fascists to the Strasbourg assembly, could put many Austrians off Europe entirely. So the referendum was brought forward. A similar fear among EU supporters of a boost to the No camp from the European elections exists in the three northern countries, where most government and opposition party leaderships are, as in Austria, in favour of membership. In Finland, the Yes campaign remains firmly in the lead - with latest polls showing a margin of 46 per cent in favour to 25 per cent against, with the balance undecided. But in Sweden and in Norway, the No vote has sustained a significant lead despite slipping somewhat after the applicant countries completed their accession agreements with Brussels in March. Latest polls in Sweden put the No camp ahead at 42 per cent, with the Yes vote slipping since April to 31 per cent. In Norway, excluding undecided voters, the No side is holding steady, with about 57 per cent support against, 43 per cent for the Yes camp. The worry for the social democratic and conservative leaderships in Stockholm and Oslo is that the long-standing No ascendancy could be further cemented if the European elections show extremists gaining strength - and a blaze of publicity - in Strasbourg. Equally, a low turnout would deepen the impression in the Nordic countries that the existing citizens of the EU are less than enthusiastic about the union - notwithstanding the FT opinion poll this week which showed a large majority of EU voters in favour of entry by the Efta four. These are unlikely to be decisive factors in themselves. In Finland, Norway and Sweden, the debate about EU membership turns on more fundamental questions about political and economic sovereignty. But the problem for the Yes campaigns in all three countries is the lack of momentum they have so far been able to generate. Having already got most of the trade benefits of Union membership through the completion last year of the European Economic Area agreement between Efta and the EU, the argument for the long-term need to participate in the EU's political structures has been undermined by the seemingly endless internal problems besetting the Union. No sooner had the Nordic and Austrian governments proclaimed the success of their accession negotiations in March than their enthusiasm was punctured by the row that followed in the EU over the distribution of voting rights in Union decision-making after enlargement. This was particularly painful for the right-centre Swedish government of Mr Carl Bildt, which was put in the miserable position of having to explain the stubborn resistance to change by its supposed close ally, the British conservative government. Mr Bildt and his Finnish and Norwegian counterparts, Mr Esko Aho and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, will be hoping the European elections will not throw up any further hurdles in their already obstacle-strewn paths. They will also be praying that on the same day the Austrians will vote Yes to set the ball rolling in their direction. So far, the No campaigns in the north have made little reference to Austria. But if Austria rejects membership, parallels will undoubtedly quickly be drawn between the four nations, with their small populations, their traditions of independence and their tough farming conditions. 'Oh yes,' exclaimed Ms Eva-Britt Svensson, leader of the Swedish 'No to the EU' organisation this week. 'An Austrian No would be a big boost for us.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------                NEXT STEPS TOWARDS A WIDER EUROPE  ------------------------------------------------------------------ SWEDEN                                FINLAND  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Referendum: Nov 13, 1994              Referendum: Oct 16, 1994 Latest polls                          Latest polls For                31 percent         For             46 percent Against            42 percent         Against         25 percent  ------------------------------------------------------------------ NORWAY                                AUSTRIA  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Referendum: Nov 28, 1994              Referendum: June 12, 1994 Latest polls (excluding undecided)    Latest polls For                43 percent         For             48 percent Against            57 percent         Against         46 percent  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Syrian gunners and their Lebanese Druze allies unleashed a hail of fire on  Christian ports and neighborhoods in and around Beirut. Security officials said  Syrian troops used rocket launchers and cannon to pound several Christian  residential areas and ports north of Beirut. They said Druze gunners in  mountains southeast of Beirut also bombarded the harbors. Forces of the  Christian army commander, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, retaliated by shelling Syrian  and Lebanese artillery positions between apartment buildings on the seafront in  Muslim West Beirut, they said. Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Saudi  Arabia, Morocco and Algeria arrived in Damascus for talks with Syrian leaders  on ways to end the fighting.  </P></p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Merger of accountancy bodies inevitable Sir, Your article, 'An institutional fracture in need of repair' (Accountancy Column, October 6), on the rationalisation of the accounting profession misses the point. It would be obvious to a Martian that the six bickering representative organisations ought to be merged into a single influential professional body. However, the main obstacle to this is the widely held belief that the members of the three chartered institutes will not vote for a merger - even when watered down as in the proposals recommended by the working party, chaired by David Bishop of KPMG Peat Marwick. And the reason they will not vote to merge is the general perception that the title 'chartered accountant' carries more status and earning power than the titles from the other bodies. There is a desire for some to be seen as more equal than others. Faced with such intransigence it would be folly for the other bodies to formulate plans for the improvement of the profession based upon the highly improbable premise of a merger. The other bodies cannot address this obstacle in the short term and the only practical approach is to plan round it and to make alternative proposals such as those formulated by Anthea Rose and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. Common sense will eventually triumph - you are either a qualified accountant or you are not - so merger is inevitable, whether by intervention or consensus. But I am not sure I will see it in my professional lifetime. While it remains impossible to achieve it at one step, the only option is to embark on the first of a series of small steps - and on that basis I support the proposal for a General Accounting Council.

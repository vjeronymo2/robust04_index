			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Societies urged to pay out dividends Building societies were yesterday encouraged by their regulator to use their surpluses to give dividends, better services and better prices to their members. Ms Rosalind Gilmore, who chairs the Building Societies Commission, said that with the housing market recovering and provisions for bad and doubtful debts falling, she could see no reason why societies should not narrow their margins or reward members in other ways. Addressing the Building Societies Association annual conference in Birmingham, she also said the commission had bowed to opinion within the sector on aspects of draft guidance on lending policy and on corporate governance. While she suggested that societies might need to develop better ideas about how to be accountable to their members, in general her speech was a strong endorsement of mutuality as a form of organisation. Against the background of the impending publication later this month of the first results from the Treasury's review of building society legislation, she also underscored the government's commitment to mutual ownership. In particular, she said the comment by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that mutuality had a part to play in the financial sector of the 1990s, though directed towards friendly societies, was equally true of building societies. Ms Gilmore said the capital strength of the sector had been built up in difficult circumstances. In today's more favourable market conditions, societies should consider other uses for their surpluses. Members' preferences should drive what form the benefits took, she said. Nineteen of the 20 largest societies for which 1993 results are available recorded an average increase in pre-tax profits of just over 50 per cent compared with 1992. Provisions fell by an average of 18 per cent. Ms Gilmore acknowledged the force of industry objections to aspects of the proposed guidance on lending, and said that the proposal to set an indicative limit of 20 per cent of a society's balance sheet for its exposure to fixed rate lending would be dropped. Instead, the commission is to discuss with each society its own limit for fixed-rate lending, which will vary according to the sophistication of its treasury operation. The prudential note on corporate governance is expected to be published in the summer, in a different form from the original version which caused dismay among societies. Much of the advice will remain, but will be incorporated into a code of 'best practice' rather than included in the note itself. Prudential notes are binding on societies in a way that other forms of guidance are not.</p>

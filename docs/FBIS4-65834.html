			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrew Grice and Michael Prescott report: "Tory Right </F> Claims Supporters are on Strike Against Major"]    [Text] John Major's hopes of maintaining Conservative  party unity during the European election campaign were shattered  last night when Tory rightwingers gave a warning that the  party's natural supporters were "on strike" against the  government's performance.    The right-wing Conservative Way Forward group, which has  Lady  Thatcher as its president, said economic recovery was not  improving the government's fortunes. Its statement came two  days before Major launches the Tory European election manifesto.  "Political benefit from economic improvement will continue to  elude us as long as ministers remain out of touch with public  opinion," the group said. It demanded "leadership of a very high  order" during the European campaign, which ends on June 9,  noting the Tories had suffered a "disaster" in this month's  council elections.    "Our natural supporters focused their gaze on national  government and failed to find inspiration. Effectively, Tory  supporters are on strike," the group said in its magazine.    Major will try to rally his party tomorrow by accusing  Labour  and the Liberal Democrats of supporting federalist policies.  "We will fight for the kind of Europe we want -- not a European  superstate but a Europe of nation states," Major writes in a  foreword to the manifesto, leaked to THE SUNDAY TIMES. "We  believe it is for nations to build Europe, not for Europe to  attempt to supercede nations."    While emphasising that Britain's national interest lies in  Europe, Major says: "We want less interference from Brussels,  not more." Labour and the Lib Dems [Liberal Democrat Party]  "would submerge Britain in a socialist superstate".    The 56-page manifesto, entitled A Strong Britain in a Strong  Europe, promises the government will preserve Britain's "vital  national interests" by using its veto to block unnecessary EC  integration. Hinting at a two- speed Europe, it calls for  "flexibility" as new members join the EC.    The manifesto says the decision on whether to join a single  European currency will be for the British parliament. There  will be no re-entry into the European exchange-rate mechanism  (ERM) "in the foreseeable future."    Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, refused to predict  that  the Tories would gain seats, which he did before the recent  council elections. "We have a winning message. What we have to  do is get that message over and get our voters out," he said.    The Labour manifesto launched tomorrow, anticipates the Tory  attack over increasing EC powers. A draft giving greater powers  for the European parliament was amended to emphasise that the  party would retain Britain's veto over economic issues, foreign  policy, EC integration and "other key areas of national  interest." Labour has watered down its commitment to a 35-hour  working week. The draft manifesto said changes "might involve a  substantial cut in working time." The final version says they  "might involve reductions in working time".    The Labour programme, A New European Future, says: "Britain  has the chance to change direction on Europe, moving us from the  margins -- where the government resists co-operation, alienates  allies and opts out of progress -- into the centre where Britain  can help to o shape and direct Europe."    The Lib Dems, who will pledge a referendum on further EC  integration in their manifesto tomorrow yesterday accused the  Tories of breaking the promises they made in the last Euro  campaign five years ago.</p>

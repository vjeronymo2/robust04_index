			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Feb 01, BNS -- A group of Lithuanian  experts dealing with visa and transit problems left for Minsk  Tuesday [1 February], to discuss the introduction of visa  requirements and the opening of new border crossings with  Belarussian officials.    Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the group, said the two-day  talks  in the Belarusian capital will be mainly devoted to visa  requirements for the CIS that will come into effect March 1.    Bulovas said he intends to hold several "semi-official"  meetings in the Belarusian parliament and the Foreign Ministry.  State border delimitation and the problem of the Adutiskis  railroad station may be touched upon during these meetings, he  said.    As previously reported, Lithuanian and Belarusian premiers  signed an agreement last September saying that the Adutiskis  station belongs to Lithuania, but some Belarussian lawmakers  recently began to question the lawfulness of the decision and  demand to revoke it.    Kazys Bobelis, chairman of the Lithuanian parliament's  Foreign Affairs Committee, said it is necessary to determine  border between Lithuania and Belarus as soon as possible and to  start developing neighborly and trade relations.    Commenting on the replacement of the Belarusian head of  state, Bobelis told Lithuanian radio Tuesday that a victory was  won by politicians who advocate closer relations with Russia and  whose policy is most likely to differ from that of the previous  leadership of the parliament.</p>

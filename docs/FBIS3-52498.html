In the eastern district of  Kabul, Golboddin forces allied with Dostam troops are reported  to be advancing on Qila Zaman about 3 km from the capital Kabul.  The fighting has left several hundred dead or wounded and  thousands homeless. The International Committee of the Red Cross  in Kabul said essential supplies have become scarce.    Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's reaction on the  Afghanistan situation.    [Begin Asif Ali recording] We are all actually very very  disturbed at what is happening there, because precious Muslim  blood is being shed. That is what becomes even more painful to  us. I was about to leave for Afghanistan today, but for this  fighting that has erupted there. I am still prepared to go and  I have conveyed to Afghan Government and brother Afghan leaders  that if they want us and even under these conditions, I am  prepared to go to Afghanistan and make an offer of our good  offices so that the fighting can end and the bloodshed can end.  Because, the people of Afghanistan, they deserve to get peace  in that country now. [sentence as heard] [end recording]</p>

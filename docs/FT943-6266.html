			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Commerce data take Dow up again Wall Street The stock market's surprising rally stayed alive yesterday as share prices tended to move higher in spite of a receding bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 17.80 stronger at 3,898.85, building on last week's powerful 125-point advance. The Standard &amp;Poor's 500 added 0.79 at 474.59, while rises on the Big Board outnumbered declines by 1,230 to 897. New York SE volume was a moderate 266m shares. The American SE composite gained 1.90 at 451.46 and the Nasdaq composite inched 0.27 forward to 764.21. Early on, modest gains by bonds and a further improvement by the dollar provided a supportive backdrop for stocks. The catalyst was welcome news from the Commerce Department that July personal income had risen 0.5 per cent from the previous month's figure, while personal consumption had edged 0.2 per cent higher. Both figures were consistent with the prevailing view that the economy was growing at a manageable pace. By mid-morning, however, the dollar reversed direction. Bonds followed suit in thin, summertime activity. Although these developments caused stocks to stumble at times during the session, a majority held on to finish with encouraging gains. Still, many of the cyclical issues which had led the blue chips last week paused yesterday. Caterpillar was unchanged at Dollars 115 5/8 and General Motors dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 51 3/8 . But International Paper remained strong, leading a generally buoyant paper and pulp sector with a gain of Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 74 5/8 . Elsewhere in the group, Stone Container climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 5/8 and Georgia Pacific put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 72 7/8 . McDonald's was marked up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 on favourable press comment about the company's growth prospects. Merger and acquisition news figured prominently in the activity. ITT dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 81 7/8 after agreeing to pay a premium price for Viacom's Madison Square Garden businesses. Its partner, Cablevision, added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 58, while Viacom held at Dollars 38 1/4 . The pharmaceuticals industry appeared to be poised for further consolidation follow-ing Marion Merrell Dow's announcement that it was exploring a possible sale of the company. Dow Chemical, its majority owner, jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 73 7/8 on the news, while MMD was raised Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 24 1/8 . On the Nasdaq, Nextel tumbled Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 25 1/4 . Investors were surprised by the unravelling of its agreement to build a wireless communications network with MCI and Comcast. Canada Toronto gained further ground in moderate trade as advancing gold and transportation issues helped to fuel an afternoon rally. The TSE 300 index ended 28.00 higher at 4,332.43 and rises led falls by 404 to 340 after volume of 57.3m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-group indices made headway, with transportation climbing 2.4 per cent. The golds sector strengthened 2.0 per cent as the price of bullion in New York gained USDollars 3.70 at USDollars 387.15 an ounce. Real estate had the day's biggest decline, 1.8 per cent. Brazil Sao Paulo closed 2.1 per cent up in mild trade after equity prices bounced back from early losses on renewed confidence about the government's ongoing economic plan. Traders said optimism ahead of upcoming inflation figures, which are expected to show August inflation at around 2 per cent, against the 5.46 per cent posted yesterday by the government's official IPC-R index, provided underpinning. The Bovespa index gained a net 1,087 at 53,230. Volume totalled RDollars 289.8m (Dollars 323.9m).</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Why Italians enjoy whisky galore - A man who turned millions on to malt IT MIGHT seem bizarre to sell a bottle of malt whisky costing thousands of pounds in Milan but, believe it or not, Italy and Milan in particular - is full of whisky maniacs. Walk through the streets of the nation's commercial capital and you will stumble across shops boasting collections that make most of Britain's look insignificant. One of the best is Donini in the Galleria San Babila (tel: 760-00461, fax 781413) which is run by the Marangione family and tries to stock every malt released on the market. Nor are the prices excessive: recently, Emanuele Marangione had to withdraw some 40-year-old Macallan from sale because Japanese businessmen were buying it and selling their booty for a considerable profit when they arrived home. It is perhaps significant that Armando Giovinetti's first job in the drinks business was with Emanuele's father, Guiseppe. Giovinetti, who is credited with turning millions of Italians on to malt, started unpromisingly. In the 1950s, he drifted away from his studies in Rome and made a living sweeping the floors of an hotel. His professional life began when he peddled a concoction called Gin Rosa. Once he had left the Marangiones he graduated to selling small amounts of whisky, a drink introduced to Italy after the war by GIs, which was seen as a fashionable alternative to grappa. With the profits he saved enough to make his first visit to Scotland and its distilleries in the mid 1950s. He was too small an operator then to take on a brand, so he looked for a distillery which could offer him a significant part of its production. Scotland he remembers as a primitive place then: Inverness airport boasted little more than a hut selling tea and biscuits. However, he found the people and the landscape highly attractive. He found what he was looking for at Glen Grant on Speyside. He liked the style of the 'Directors' Reserve', which was run off into new barrels and he along with a young solicitor called Hugh Metcalfe, decided on a modest punt of 2,000 cases of five-year-old malt. This was three years before the Grants of Glenfiddich decided to launch their malt whisky. Giovinetti thought he could turn malt into big business. He played on whisky's image as a tough-guy's drink beloved of the heroes of Hollywood films who drank neither wine nor grappa. Besides, he reasoned, whisky was cleaner than grappa which all too often showed traces of methyl alcohol under analysis. While malt whisky's cleanliness was pointed out to the medical profession. Giovinetti had Glen Grant bottled in miniatures and sent samples to doctors telling them of its uses as a throat medicine. The doctors duly recommended it to their patients - marketing that would not be tolerated today. Sales of Glen Grant soared to the 200,000 case mark by 1980 and today they are nearer 500,000. Success of this sort attracted the attention of multi-national companies and, by the end of the 1970s, Seagrams had moved in to buy Glen Grant at what Giovinetti feels was an inflated price. At first Giovinetti stayed on with Seagrams as European president, latterly he was shifted into the position of consultant. In 1983 he decided to get out and would have retired had it not been for his son, Fabio Massimo, who was just leaving an American university and wanted to sell whisky. At about that time Giovinetti was approached by his old friend Hugh Metcalfe, then working for The Macallan. The Macallan was a style of whisky which Giovinetti felt the Italians would take to. He formed an agency business around The Macallan together with Bollinger champagne and Janneau Armagnac (which he now owns). Eventually, it was decided to launch a seven-year-old malt unique to the Italian market. Giovinetti's nose for the Italian market did not let him down. The 'mellow' style of the Macallan seven-year-old was perfect as a long drink with ice for the new whisky drinker. Macallan now sells 60,000 cases a year despite costing L25,000 (Pounds 11) a bottle compared to L15,000 for Glen Grant or L10,000 for a top blended whisky such as J &amp; B. It is now the eighth best selling whisky on the market, a considerable achievement in a country which is very discerning when it comes to malt: the Italians buy 50 per cent more malt whisky than the British. It is this connoisseurship which makes Italy so speciaI: 'This is the country where malt whisky is best known,' says Giovinetti, which is precisely why Macallan-Glenlivet decided to auction its last 12 bottles of 60-year-old malt in Milan.</p>

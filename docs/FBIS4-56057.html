			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 26 (TANJUG) -- U.S. State Department  spokesman Mike McCurry said on Wednesday [25 May] that the  Bosnian Muslims and Serbs were testing the resolve of the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and of NATO as regards the Sarajevo  and Gorazde exclusion zones and added that the United States was  concerned when any of the sides violated the zones. This is the  first time that the U.S. has officially admitted that the  Bosnian Muslim army is using the exclusion zones for launching  attacks and provocations.    Commenting a statement by Bosnian Muslim leader Alija  Izetbegovic that his government would ask Washington to take a  definite stand on the European proposal for the territorial  division in Bosnia-Herzegovina before making its own decision on  the issue, McCurry said that Izetbegovic was familiar with the  U.S. stand on the proposed peace settlement. Foreign ministers  of the United States, Russia and the European Union called on  the Bosnian warring sides on May 13 in Geneva to agree to a  four-month truce, during which they would divide the territory  according to the E.U. formula: 49 per cent of the territory for  the Serbs and 51 per cent for the Muslim-Croat federation.    McCurry said that, in its diplomatic contacts on all levels,  Washington had informed the Muslim leadership not only of the  division formula but also of the U.S. readiness to actively  participate in maintaining peace once the warring sides reached  a peace agreement through dialogue. The Bosnian Muslims and  Croats came to Wednesday's peace talks on Bosnia in Talloires,  France, with the demand for 58 per cent of the territory.</p>

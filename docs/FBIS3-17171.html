Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs told a  briefing that the government would make an official announcement  next Tuesday.    At the recent round of the bilateral talks the two sides  initialed the drafts of three out of four documents -- the main  treaty setting the withdrawal date of August 31, 1994;  agreements on the social protection of servicemen during the  troop withdrawal; and on pensioners of the Russian Defense  Ministry living in Latvia. In the draft agreement on the status  of the Russian radar station in Skrunda, according to which the  strategic base may continue for 5.5 years to come, the provision  on the lease payment remains uncoordinated.    At the briefing Birkavs admitted that Latvia is proposed to  agree to a compromise under pressure of the presence of the  Russian troops. The prime Minister noted that the signing of an  agreement will be advantageous for Latvia. First, Russia will  assume international commitments to withdraw troops before the  end of summer, while representatives of international  authoritative organizations will monitor the radar dismantling.    If the treaty is not signed, Latvia will be internationally  isolated since it will acquire an image as an unreliable  partner. No doubt, in this case the Russian troop withdrawal  will be suspended and would be unlikely to be completed this  year, said Birkavs.    He believes the documents may be signed later in April in  Moscow at the meeting of presidents Boris Yeltsin and Guntis  Ulmanis.</p>

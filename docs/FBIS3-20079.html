			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: "We </F> Are Not Junior Partners"]    [Text] In Russia and in the West, a vigorous debate is in  progress on the chances for Russian-U.S. partnership. Can the  two superpowers really become equal partners? Some observers  consider the question to be at least premature. Others are  already prophesying a new form of rivalry. I think both those  positions are wrong. We Russian democrats who are behind this  policy have encountered tough political -- even armed --  resistance. Unfortunately, during these turbulent days, there  were times when we were neither understood by our friends and  allies in the West nor did we receive sufficient support from  them. Even in the current critical situation -- we in Moscow  need every conceivable assistance -- we hear threats of curbing  economic cooperation from the West.    Such threats are provocative and senseless. Behind those  threats, there seems to be a manic desire to recognize the  United States alone as a world power. However, if the United  States wants to solve every problem in the world alone, it will  overreach itself.    Incidentally, despite the difficult situation in which it  finds itself, Russia remains a superpower, not only because of  the arsenal of nuclear weapons that it possesses, but also  because of its raw materials, technical know-how, and strategic  position. The principles of "strategic partnership" that were  formulated in Vancouver in 1993 and in Moscow in 1994 remain as  important as ever. Those lofty declarations of intent must be  translated into concrete facts.    Instead, reactionary forces are seeking to create myths. For  example, it is asserted that Russia is condemned to having a  totalitarian regime forever and will always pursue a  confrontational course vis-a-vis the rest of the world. Such  myths can easily become reality, if the the treaties that our  presidents have signed are not observed.    Some politicians in Washington and elsewhere only want to  assign Russia the role of a junior partner. In their view, a  "good Russian" is always an obedient Russia, never a leader.  What should Russian democrats think about the new chauvinist  tones that can be heard from Washington? Russia cannot accept a  subordinate role in world politics. That would be unjustified  and politically dangerous. Nationalist extremists and other  reactionaries would soon profit from the acceptance of such a  role. They are really trying to do that already.    If we do not shortly begin to develop a strategy and  appropriate mechanisms for a mature relationship with a  realistic basis (can we venture to use the German term  "realpolitik" to describe it?), the Russian and U.S. prophets of  catastrophe will exploit the current situation in the way they  want. Both countries would only lose out as a result.</p>

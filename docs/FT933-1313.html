			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Low banana prices behind fall at Geest A SHARP drop in the price of bananas in Europe was the main factor behind a largely anticipated pre-tax decline at Geest, the fresh produce and prepared food group, in the 26 weeks to July 3. The fall, from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 3.56m came from turnover down from Pounds 359m to Pounds 333m. The interim dividend is held at 3.7p, uncovered at this stage by earnings per share down at 3.6p (15.3p). Mr David Sugden, chief executive, said this reflected the board's confidence that the downturn was temporary and happened in a period of transition. Full-year earnings would easily cover the total dividend, he said. Explaining the pre-tax fall, Mr Sugden said that the expected new European banana regime, which had been due to be introduced on January 1, was delayed until July 1, and that even then there had been some slowness in the granting of licences. The new regime was now achieving its aim of stabilising prices and enabling European companies to viably compete with multinationals like Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte, Mr Sugden said. He estimated that Geest's total EC market share would rise from 7 per cent to between 12 and 14 per cent. Group banana sales by volume grew by 40 per cent. In sterling terms banana sales rose only 7 per cent, though turnover in the whole fresh produce division fell to Pounds 276.5m (Pounds 285.2m). Operating profits were Pounds 1.13m (Pounds 11.2m). On the prepared food side sales on continuing activities grew to Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 38.5m) while operating profits edged ahead to Pounds 3.28m (Pounds 3.21m). Group operating profits were Pounds 3.34m (Pounds 14m). Interest receivable fell to Pounds 255,000 (Pounds 1.29m). Debt at July 3 was Pounds 32.4m.</p>

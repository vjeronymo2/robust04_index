			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / EC delays part of Ecu2.2bn Greek loan GREECE will not receive the second instalment of an Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.58bn) EC loan, due next month, before May or June, officials said yesterday, Kerin Hope reports from Athens. Payment of the Ecu500m tranche will be delayed until the Community approves a new five-year convergence plan, to be drawn up by Greek economic planners with EC technical assistance. The delay is not expected to affect Greece's borrowing position as foreign exchange reserves are at almost record levels.</p>

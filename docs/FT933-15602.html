			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Full speed ahead on Gatt THE TOKYO summit is already different from its three immediate predecessors. In 1990, 1991 and again in 1992, leaders of the Group of Seven main industrial countries promised to make every effort to complete the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations, but then made themselves ridiculous by failing to deliver what they had promised. This time, their principal trade negotiators were told to reach agreement beforehand. While the summit now has rather little useful left to do, it has already proved its worth merely as a catalyst. Final agreement on the Uruguay round has not yet been reached. But it is increasingly difficult to believe that negotiators will not reach that goal. Not only have they achieved much already, but they have also grown accustomed to reaching agreement even on sensitive issues, while none of them wishes to bear the blame for failure. They are, in short, condemned to succeed. But what sort of success might it be? From the draft final act of the multilateral trade negotiations (the so-called Dunkel draft) of December 1991, the November 1992 'Blair House agreement' on agriculture between the EC and the US and the outlines of the market access agreement in manufactures revealed yesterday, the answer is rather a good one. At the heart of the agreement between Canada, the European Community, Japan and the US are: elimination of tariffs (known as 'zero-for-zero') in eight sectors, including pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, steel and spirits; cuts of up to 50 per cent in tariffs covering products whose current tariffs are above 15 per cent; and reductions averaging at least a third in tariffs on other products, including scientific equipment, paper and electronics. Vexed question Even this agreement needs to be cemented by further negotiation. One vexed question is what offers will be forthcoming from participants in the Uruguay round, other than the big four. The latter, particularly the US, might even insist that every participant in the round adopt zero tariffs wherever they intend to do so. Such a demand could be a round-breaker. Yet another contentious demand would be for general liberalisation of textiles and clothing. Equally important would be reaching a 'multilateral steel agreement', a necessary condition for elimination of tariffs on steel. Negotiations for liberalisation of trade in services are far from complete. Similarly, final agreement has not yet been reached in agriculture, with French anxieties unassuaged and both Japan and South Korea continuing to insist they will not liberalise their imports of rice. Tighter control Some, notably the French government, also argue that US unilateral actions against allegedly subsidised imports should be brought under tighter control. US imports of steel are the immediate casus belli. Although US unilateralism is indeed a concern, this is not a relevant example of the problem. The US has an unquestionable right to take such action under the Gatt. It is absurd for the French, who support similar EC actions against alleged cases of dumping, to pretend otherwise. What remains to be achieved is indeed contentious. But what has been completed already is just as contentious and more important. Economists might question the wisdom of proposals that are likely to widen the dispersion of tariff rates. What matters rather more is that negotiators have accepted the principle of tariff elimination, which can readily be extended in future. The fact that a deal has been reached matters even more. Some argued that no agreement would be better than a 'bad agreement', by which was meant less complete a package than some participants desired. This was a weak argument, but the agreement now within reach is a good one by any standard. For the sake both of the world economy and of peaceful international relations, participants must now put every effort into climbing the last few hundred metres. Reaching the end of the Uruguay round negotiations would not solve the world's economic problems. But it would help. It would also demonstrate the ability of world leaders to address those problems co-operatively. Failure must now be regarded as not merely unforgiveable, but unthinkable.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / A country split along its deepest fault line: Religious riots are shaking India's stability and threaten the secular foundations of the state Just before dawn today Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister, moved to wrest control of the ruined mosque in Ayodhya, in northern India, from Hindu militants who had reduced it to rubble when they took it over at the weekend. Paramilitary police were used to dislodge the militants. First reports said no shots were fired. However, the apparent ease with which the authorities regained control did not dispel fears of further bloodshed. The reimposition of the rule of law in the wake of yesterday's nationwide riots - which caused hundreds of deaths - is, however, less of a challenge than that faced by Mr Rao in restoring India's shattered political stability. The weekend storming of the mosque has shaken India along its deepest fault line - the division between Hindus and Moslems. The ability of the two faiths to co-exist has been the greatest triumph of Indian democracy. Not for nothing did the ruling Congress (I) party describe the demolition of the ancient shrine as 'one of the greatest challenges India has faced since independence'. Some commentators saw the takeover as a more serious threat to political stability than even the assassinations of Mrs Indira Gandhi and Mr Rajiv Gandhi because the two former prime ministers had died at the hands of easily identifiable political enemies - Sikh and Tamil terrorists. The mosque's destruction stirs much deeper passions dating back at least as far as the 16th century when Moslem invaders conquered northern India. There was an almost primeval anger in the eyes of the young fanatics as they assaulted the mosque on Sunday, their faces daubed in paint and carrying tridents, symbols of Ram, the oldest god of Hinduism. Certainly, in the heat of the moment, hyperbole is easy. It is also easy to forget the troubles that independent India has overcome - including partition and two wars with Pakistan, the arch-enemy. India's Moslems had the sense to keep their heads down then - and were rewarded by tolerance from the Hindu majority. India, with its 850m people and decentralised political structure, can absorb great shocks. But a tradition of tolerance did not prevent Sunday's assault at Ayodhya. Nor will it easily defuse the tensions it has created. To tackle the crisis, Mr Rao and other political leaders must deal with its causes. The upsurge of tensions over Ayodhya is primarily due to the political rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing militant party, which has grown rapidly since its formation in the mid-1980s to become the largest opposition party. The BJP was founded by militant Hindu activist groups with a long and sometimes violent past, including the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. These activists sensed a growing disillusion with the ruling Congress (I) party's self-avowed secularism, under which the interests of different religions are balanced for the sake of national unity. Secularism had been a powerful force during the fight to build post-independent India. But with the independence struggle now a distant memory, it has grown sterile. So the militants launched an ill-defined but emotionally powerful mission of turning India into a Hindu state. To give substance to this aim the militant leaders chose an issue with the widest appeal - a campaign to reclaim Ayodhya, a holy town where a mosque was built in the 16th century on the reputed site of a temple marking Ram's birthplace. Thus political opportunism revived a long dormant dispute. Successive national governments tried to stave off confrontation by referring the arguments about the mosque to India's courts. But pressure mounted as the BJP increased its presence in parliament and won control of four provincial state governments - one of which was Uttar Pradesh, which includes Ayodhya. Simultaneously, the BJP stirred its supporters by mounting huge rallies at Ayodhya in October 1991, July 1992 and again last weekend. Mr Rao prevaricated. Instead of surrounding the mosque with enough police and troops to defend it, he relied on the BJP's promises to control its supporters. This worked before. But this time the BJP's inability to control its radical wing meant the policy failed. Mr Rao's immediate task was to re-establish control of the site. He was also preparing last night to bow to Moslem demands to ban the BJP's activist support groups, though not the party itself. Mr Rao has taken a first step by imposing direct rule on Uttar Pradesh. But many MPs, including some in his own party, doubt whether the prime minister, with his reputation for indecisiveness, is the man for the job. As Mr Jaipal Reddy, of the opposition Janata Dal party, said: 'We can't trust him to fight fascism.' Some Congress (I) MPs would like to replace Mr Rao with Mr Arjun Singh, the human resources minister, who has stated his opposition to appeasing the BJP. Whatever happens to Mr Rao, it is unlikely that the crisis will upset Congress's control of the government, not least because the BJP is in no position to offer itself as a successor and other parties are too small. However, the survival of Congress rule will do nothing to address deeper uncertainties about India's future. The assault will damage India's fragile relations with Pakistan and Bangladesh. It will also tarnish India's image as the world's largest democracy and its claims to moral leadership in the developing world. But these concerns pale in comparison with domestic considerations. In the past 18 months, India has gone some way to modernise its economy by opening long-restricted links with the outside world. Mr Lewis Preston, the president of the World Bank, himself praised India's progress on a recent visit. Increasingly, western companies are seeking to develop interest in tapping India's markets. But political stability is a prerequisite for long-term investment, particularly for overseas companies. The argument that Kashmir and even Punjab - provinces affected by terrorist violence - are isolated exceptions to India's general stability carries weight. But India's 120m-strong Moslem population - the second largest in the world after Indonesia's - forms such a sizeable group that what happens in Ayodhya matters everywhere. Curfews were imposed yesterday in New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta - the three largest business centres. Nationwide protest strikes are due to be held today. India is still a long way from civil war and even from prolonged, general, violent unrest. Indeed, there were some hopes in Delhi last night that the government could take advantage of the BJP's manifest disarray to rally the moderate majority which politicians of all parties believe still dominates India. But the failure to rally such support before last weekend is one from which India may take a long time to recover.</p>

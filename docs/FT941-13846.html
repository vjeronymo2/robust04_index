			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / France goes on the defence offensive: The quiet revolution which sees Paris breaking away from its go-it-alone tradition France is rapidly adopting a more international approach to defence, in a revolution quieter in tone than the changes wrought to its commercial policy by the Gatt world trade negotiations but more far-reaching in substance. Indeed, French officials now fear that their European allies are taking too parochial a view of the continent's security needs, in Bosnia and elsewhere. This is a far cry from the go-it-alone tendency that has characterised French defence policy for a generation since President de Gaulle pulled France out of Nato's integrated military command in 1966. The catalyst for the new policy was this month's Nato summit, which crystallised the post-cold war shift of responsibility for European defence from the US towards Europe. The new policy will be enshrined in a French defence white paper due to be published next month, as the doctrinal basis for the country's 1995-2000 defence programme to be presented to parliament later this year. 'The best Nato summit ever, from France's viewpoint,' was how a senior Elysee official summed up the Brussels meeting. The summit endorsed the Maastricht treaty's concept of a European defence identity. It agreed that Nato assets could be used by the Western European Union defence organisation in purely European operations and proposed the setting up of 'combined joint task forces'. This piece of military gobbledygook is designed as political cover for bringing into Nato planning a France that refuses formally to re-enter the alliance's regular integrated command. 'We cannot put the 1966 decision in question,' Mr Francois Leotard, France's defence minister, said wryly. 'It is now part of our military/cultural heritage.' But France's satisfaction at Nato's green light for European defence is tempered by its gnawing worry at the sharp decline of interest among many European countries on matters military. Mr Leotard asked recently whether 'the concept of defence which is taking root in northern Europe' - neutrality in Scandinavia, and lack of interest in countries like Germany and the Netherlands - 'does not threaten to lead the whole of Europe into inaction, then to disappearance'. The decline can be measured in defence budgets. A senior French official notes, with as much anxiety about German and British defence cuts as pride in France's sustained spending, that 'of the 1994 military equipment budgets of the nine WEU countries, France accounts for 42 per cent of the total.' Despite all their past investment on defence, a majority of the French people still do not seem anxious to cash in their peace dividend on the ending of the cold war. Indeed, the forthcoming white paper will tell them that their security is still at risk - though from different dangers which require closer co-operation with fellow Europeans. A current draft of the white paper, the first for 20 years, argues that 'defence of France's vital interests can be envisaged with Britain and Germany', that this co-operation can include discussions on nuclear weapons, and that France's military action will be increasingly directed at prevention of direct/indirect threats to its wider strategic interests, short of full-scale war. As a result, Mr Leotard argues that the French themselves must learn to think 'geo-strategically', as Americans have long done, and that 'having been a net importer (from the US) of security during the cold war, Europe must now have the capacity to export security.' This, says the white paper draft, involves remedying France's weaknesses in intelligence gathering, force projection and logistic back-up. 'These weaknesses were acceptable, even deliberate in an earlier period. . . but they are glaring and hardly tolerable when the international situation and our political commitments require long-range intervention by our forces.' In all arms programmes, as well as force deployments, France must co-operate more with its European partners, the paper says, while not letting its overall military spending fall below 3.1 per cent of national output. Much of the white paper just elevates to the level of principle what France has recently been doing in practice - setting up the Eurocorps and moving towards Nato inside Europe, and contributing in Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia more troops to UN peacekeeping than any other country. But will France's famous national consensus on defence hold if this defence is defined in more international terms? Defence policy has been popular in France precisely because it has been relatively self-centred and because allies have been regarded in the last (nuclear) resort as unreliable. Will French soldiers really be any readier than others to fight for ill-defined causes in Europe's name? Similarly, high French budgets have been accepted precisely because, in the words of a top French officer, 'more than 90 per cent is spent at home - a form of industrial policy'. Are French taxpayers ready to see more of their money spent on German or British weapons? These are the contradictions that France's new co-operative stance on defence will bring.</p>

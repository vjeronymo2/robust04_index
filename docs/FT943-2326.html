			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Roche switches work from Scotland Roche, the Swiss drugs group, has switched an important chemical project from its plant at Dalry in Ayrshire to one in France, James Buxton writes. The switch was made even though construction at Dalry was well advanced and output was due to start next year. The project, to produce carotenoids - naturally occurring colourants - was a significant part of Pounds 93m five-year investment programme by Roche at the plant, one of the world's biggest manufacturing units for vitamin C. Construction of the building will continue. Up to 70 of the plant's 740 employees may lose their jobs next year - when the project was intended to start output - because of the change. Roche decided last week to switch the carotenoid project to a newly completed plant at Village Neuf in Alsace, across the French border from Roche's headquarters in Basle, Switzerland. Because there is no longer a market for the intended output of the Village Neuf plant, it was decided to fill the gap with the project originally intended for Dalry.</p>

The party of officials is expected to  return to Port Moresby next week with the report on the incident  for the provincial affairs and village services minister, John  Nikare.    The environment minister and member of Parliament for (South  Fly), Perry Zeipi, claims that Indonesian troops torched (Kwa),  but the allegation was being dismissed by Jakarta.    Other reports at present being examined by Mr. Nikare  suggest  that guerrillas associated with the Free Papua Movement, OPM  [Papua Freedom Operation], may have been responsible for the  destruction of the village.    The investigating team now in the Western Province is  scheduled to have talks with (Kwa) villagers before returning to  the capital.</p>

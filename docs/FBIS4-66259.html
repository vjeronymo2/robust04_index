			<p>CSO     [Summary] At present, Sichuan Province has 52 million hogs  in stock, sows number 4,200,000, piglets 8,400,000, and porkers  39,400,000, decreases of 4.3 percent, 8.7 percent, 9.7 percent,  and 3.4 percent from the same period in 1993. Reasons for the  decline are:    1. Grain output declined in 1993, and the market price of  grain increased. At present, the price of corn in rural markets  is 1.00 yuan per kilogram, and mixed feed is 0.96 yuan per  kilogram, increases of 20.5 percent and 21.5 percent  respectively over the same period in 1993. The cost of raising  hogs exceeds profits.    2. According to some counties, in general 30 percent of the  rural labor in one county has left to find work outside Sichuan.  In some counties rural households not raising hogs account for  about 65 percent of total households.    3. At present the slaughter of hogs and circulation links  are out of control. Careless slaughter has resulted in sales of  diseased pork on the market, and the spread of epidemic disease  throughout Sichuan, which severely affects the stability and  development of hog output.    At present the procurement price of hogs is 4.50 yuan per  kilogram, and the price of hogs entering factories is 4.90 yuan  per kilogram, increases of 33.9 percent and 49.4 percent over  the same period in 1993.    It is estimated that in the first quarter of 1994 Sichuan  will procure 2,100,000 hogs, sell 800,000, and ship 1,400,000  hogs to other provinces, decreases of 15.2 percent, 18.4  percent, and 28.3 percent from the same period in 1993.</p>

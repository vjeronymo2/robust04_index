			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Procordia falls 20% in first term PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group, yesterday blamed lower Swedish tobacco sales, losses from hotels and one-off lease settlement costs for a 20 per cent fall in first-quarter profits. Profits after financial items fell to SKr893m from SKr1.12bn in the same 1991 period, disappointing stock market expectations. The B shares fell Skr4 to close at SKr169. Sales were virtually static at SKr9.55bn (Dollars 1.3bn), although on a pro-forma basis they rose 10 per cent. Income from ongoing operations fell 4 per cent to SKr963m from SKr1.01bn. The group said a 20 per cent fall in Swedish tobacco sales in the first quarter was a significant reason for the downturn - the result of hoarding prior to an increase in tobacco tax at the end of last year. It saw an increase in one-off costs to SKr83m from SKr3m, largely because of an early settlement of a lease. It incurred a SKr150m deficit from its share of losses in the Sara Travel and Hotel group, in which it holds 46.4 per cent. On the plus side, the group benefited from currency gains totalling SKr180m. The weaker Swedish currency had a particularly positive impact on Kabi Pharmacia, which increased sales by 16 per cent to SKr3.95bn from SKr3.40bn and lifted lifted operating income to SKr779m from SKr746m. Sales growth was particularly marked in the UK and Spain, although prices were generally under heavy pressure. Last week, Kabi finalised a deal to buy the Italian pharmaceutical group Erbamont in a deal worth up to Dollars 1.3bn. Procordia's second-biggest unit, United Brands, lifed sales by 47 per cent to SKr1.96bn from SKr1.33bn, but operating income slumped 43 per cent to SKr118m from SKr207m. The fall came in spite of the inclusion of Swedish Match, which the group acquired last August, and reflected the drop in income from tobacco.</p>

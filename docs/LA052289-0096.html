			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> HARVARD STUDENT RAZO SAYS HE CONFESSED CRIME WHILE ON DRUGS  </P> <P> Jose Razo, the Harvard University student accused of a dozen armed robberies in  1987, told a hushed courtroom in Santa Ana this morning that he feigned  confessions to the crimes because he was high on drugs and believed that he was  Jesus Christ.  </P> <P> Razo, 22, an honors student and athlete, became the first defense witness in  his trial in Orange County Superior Court.  </P> <P> His attorney, John Barnett, earlier told jurors that the defense would counter  Razo's confessions by showing that he had been using the mind-altering drug  PCP. The defense attorney also told jurors that Razo was fascinated with the  criminal mind, which he had studied at college.  </P> <P> When called to the stand, Razo was asked why he first called La Habra police, a  contact that eventually led to his confession. Razo said he had been using  drugs and "I felt I was Christ. I felt I had the ability to ask for anything I  wanted."  </P></p>

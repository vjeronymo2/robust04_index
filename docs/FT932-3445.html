			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / UK Gilts: Bank's offering fails to discourage demand THE announcement on Friday by the Bank of England that Pounds 700m of bonds will be on sale from today failed to puncture generally good demand for gilts from overseas investors. While the short end of the yield curve suffered a little as an imminent cut in base rates appeared to diminish, continental European and US institutions were seen as moderate buyers of gilts as sterling suffered little fall-out from fresh signs of UK political instability. There was some support for gilt purchases from indications that Conservative ministers were preparing for tough action to hold back public spending. Such moves could in time curb the rising public sector borrowing requirement and push up gilt prices. During the week, yields fell along the curve, by around 10 basis points at the 20-year area and by somewhat less for securities maturing in the next five years. The Bank said it would sell Pounds 700m of the 8.75 per cent Treasury stock due 2017. This is part of the massive effort by the UK authorities to fund the PSBR, expected to be Pounds 50bn this financial year. Taking into account some over-funding last year, and other factors, this is expected to necessitate gilt sales of around Pounds 40bn. While such a large stock of bonds will almost certainly depress prices along the gilt curve, there is some support for the notion that inflationary pressures are not too much of a problem for the foreseeable future. This is reflected in the market expectations about the the latest figures for the retail prices index due this Thursday. In the year to last month, according to the City consensus, the increase in the RPI will turn out to be just 1.4 per cent, as opposed to the 1.3 per cent year on year rise recorded in April. Expectations are that the year on year increase in the RPI, excluding mortgage costs, will turn out to be 2.9 per cent, the same as in the year to May. Last week, Mr Eddie George, who will soon be governor of the Bank of England, went out of his way to cast doubt on ideas that inflation in the UK was beaten. He said this certainly was not the view of the gilt market, with 10-year yields at around 8 per cent as opposed to base rates of 6 per cent. With a strong warning against any new reductions in short-term borrowing costs, Mr George's speech pushed up yields a little at the short end of the gilt curve. This was on the basis that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, would be likely to take heed of the governor designate in any new ruminations about interest rate changes. However, Mr George's strictures about inflation settled investors in longer-term securities. Many of them reckon the new governor will be in a better position to use his influence over interest-rate decisions than was Lord Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor whose term of office ends in two weeks. The repercussions in the gilt market from the broadside at government policy by Mr Norman Lamont, the ex-chancellor, in the Commons last week were extremely limited. As one market observer put it, the general atmosphere of fragility surrounding the government is already reflected in stock prices and Mr Lamont's comments did little to alter the situation. There was general lack of interest in the deposed chancellor's comments that for over two years he had tried to persuade Mr John Major of the necessity of making the Bank of England independent in monetary policy. This was seen as largely an academic affair, even though it was one small step along the road towards taking interest rate decisions out of the hands of politicians. One person closely acquainted with the Bank's operations said: 'There's not a snowball's chance in hell of the Bank being made independent in the next two to three years.' Gilts were given something of a boost by the investor selling last week of the D-Mark which helped other currencies, particularly sterling. Also, the leaking of government plans to look closely at ways of constraining rises in social security spending, which accounts for about a third of all government spending, helped to put a floor under gilt prices.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / International Company News: Chrysler debt rating restored CHRYSLER, the US carmaker, yesterday reached a significant milestone on its path back to financial health when Moody's Investors Service, the credit information agency, restored its debt to investment grade status after 31 months in the speculative category. The upgrading concerns some Dollars 13bn of borrowings. Moody's is one of the two leading credit rating agencies. Its upgrade should allow Chrysler Financial, the group's financial services business, to raise money on somewhat finer terms, although the debt market is already pricing the subsidiary's borrowings at close to investment status. However, Chrysler also needs an investment grade rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading agency, to achieve a significant reduction in interest costs on some of its other borrowings. S&amp;P announced in June it was reviewing the company for a possible upgrade to investment status. However, Mr Scott Sprinzen, an S&amp;P analyst, said yesterday the agency would not finish its review until Chrysler had completed this autumn's negotiations with the United Auto Workers on a new labour contract. Chrysler fell to junk bond status early in 1991 when it was entering a severe motor industry recession with a weak product line-up and strained balance sheet. Many analysts questioned whether it could survive as an independent company. Over the past 18 months it has clawed its way back to financial health, thanks to asset sales, cost-cutting and a range of hot-selling new products. Moody's, which raised Chrysler's senior debt two notches to Baa3 from Ba2, said the ratings remained under review for a possible further upgrade. This would depend partly on the outcome of the labour negotiations. It said yesterday's action 'recognised the improving trends in Chrysler's operating performance' and the potential for 'further earnings and cashflow advances which will strengthen the company's balance sheet and debt-protection measurements'. Meanwhile, Chrysler yesterday unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show a new range of small cars, writes Kevin Done. Called the Neon, the range has set new standards in the US industry for efficiency in development and engineering. The Neon was developed in 31 months, from design approval to first production, Mr Robert Lutz, Chrysler president, said. He said development time had been cut from the 40 to 48 months required by most carmakers in Europe and North America. Chrysler has also cut significantly, to only Dollars 1.3bn, the investment needed for the Neon project. Production of the range, which is set to transform Chrysler's presence in the US small car market, will begin in November.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wei (6392 4850)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 8 Jun (XINHUA) -- The copyright  management departments of Guangdong Province are taking vigorous  measures to incorporate the import, production, and sale of  copyrighted laser audio and video products into regular  management to protect the legitimate rights and profits of  copyright owners.    To harshly crack down on the piracy of laser audio and video  products, Guangdong Province has screened the markets of laser  audio and video products many times this year. A total of over  140,000 illegal compact discs, 1,322 laser discs, and over  100,000 audiotapes and videotapes were seized on 19 April alone.  On 21 April, relevant departments openly destroyed some 63,000  pieces of laser audio and video products.    The Copyright Department of the Guangdong Copyright Bureau  recently revealed: Screening the market is only one of  Guangdong's moves for protecting copyrights. The more important  matter lies in strengthening the management of importing,  sampling, and producing laser audio and video products. Three  measures for strengthening their management are currently being  taken:    -- Incorporting units engaged in duplicating into under  management. The Audio and Video Management Department of  Guangdong Provincial Press and Publications Bureau has conducted  an overall investigation of the 23 production lines in the  province and has put on file the quality, scales, and types of  products of enterprises concerned as well as their ownership of  copyrights, laying a good foundation for carrying out various  management measures.    -- Setting up a copyright examination system. The provincial  copyright bureau recently worked out the "Interim Procedures of  Guangdong Province for Registering the Copyrights of Compact  Discs," which stipulates that an enterprise must present a  letter of authorization, a power of attorney, and other valid  written documents concerning the copyright to the copyright  department for examination whenever it wants to put one compact  disc on the production line, and may start producing it after  passing examination and receiving approval.    -- Introducing a licensing system for wholesalers and  retailers. Strict examinations and control must be conducted  over primary and secondary wholesalers; retailers must apply for  permits before obtaining business licenses, and the permits  shall be examined every year.</p>

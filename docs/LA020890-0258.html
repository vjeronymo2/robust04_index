			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> EVANGELICALS GAIN LATINO FOLLOWERS  </P> <P> Like most Latinos who came to worship in the chilly Santa Ana warehouse, Angie  Martinez told a story of a life transformed.  </P> <P> After she accepted God into her heart, she said the painful struggle of a  single, working-class mother vanished. She was able to forgive the husband who  deserted her and her two children. She could look forward to her 10-hour-a-day  job as an electronics assembler.  </P> <P> On this Saturday night, Martinez glanced at the men and women who had been  waving their arms in surrender to God, beating tambourines in time to lively  Latin music and offering emotional testimony in Spanish.  </P> <P> "I saw the joy and happiness here," said Martinez, a former Roman Catholic. "I  want to worship like this."  </P> <P> She said she hoped to persuade the rest of her family, all Catholics, to join  her at the Centro Cristiano, one of 40 Spanish-language evangelical  congregations in Orange County.  </P> <P> Martinez's story is common in Southern California, where besieged Catholic  leaders are now being forced to grapple with the realities of a rapidly  transforming flock. A steady influx of Latino immigrants has sparked a battle  for their souls that church leaders say will last throughout the 1990s.  </P> <P> The struggle has become a national issue, pitting the Roman Catholic Church  against evangelical Christian groups competing with increasing success for  Latino converts.  </P> <P> Sociologist-priest Andrew Greeley has concluded from recent data that about 23%  of all Latinos in the United States are Protestant, and that the movement of  Latinos away from Catholicism -- which traditionally has included virtually the  entire Latino population -- has been accelerating. About 60,000 Latinos join  Pentecostal and fundamentalist Protestant churches nationwide each year,  Greeley found.  </P> <P> Church officials are particularly concerned about the defection among Catholic  immigrants, but also worry about losing Latinos who have lived here all their  lives. "Numerically we are behind," concedes Louis Velasquez, associate  director of Hispanic Ministry for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Velasquez estimates about 70% of the 3.4-million Latinos in the sprawling  three-county archdiocese are Catholic compared to about 85% in the early 1970s.  Worse, he said, is that probably no more than 20% of Southern California  Catholic Latinos attend Mass regularly.  </P> <P> The local Protestant Latino churches that are growing the most rapidly are  charismatic, said Carlos Piar, lecturer in religious studies at Cal State Long  Beach.  </P> <P> Immigrants find spirited services, lively music and lay leadership in those  churches. "There's none of the staid organ hymns, Gregorian chants type of  thing," said Piar, former pastor of the Spanish-language Emanuel Baptist Church  in Fullerton.  </P> <P> In the United States, churches often serve as informal halfway houses for  immigrants, Piar said.  </P> <P> The Evangelical Covenant Church in downtown Los Angeles, for instance, is 60%  Salvadoran, 30% Guatemalan and 10% Mexican, Piar said. "You go to Santa Ana,  churches are 80% Mexican, 10% Central American and maybe a few Ecuadoreans and  Puerto Ricans mixed in."  </P> <P> As the rivalry between Catholics and evangelicals grows, it evokes anxiety and  accusations.  </P> <P> Catholics complain that their competitors' "anti-Catholic" tactics have torn  Latinos from their roots.  </P> <P> Many evangelical and Pentecostal groups take "a very emotional approach to the  whole thing," said Father Luis Valbuena, pastor of the huge Holy Family  Catholic Church in Wilmington, where nine of 11 Sunday Masses are in Spanish.  "You and Christ; Christ and you. Does that mean your neighbor doesn't count?  They aren't related to other things in the community . . . That is a very false  gospel they are preaching."  </P> <P> But Protestant evangelicals such as Daniel de Leon, pastor of Templo Calvario  in Santa Ana, say they are only responding to needs the Catholic Church has  left unfilled.  </P> <P> "A little sheep, if not fed by the shepherd, will go looking somewhere else for  food," said De Leon, whose 3,000-member church is one of the largest Latino  evangelical churches in the country. His church had just 100 members in 1976.  </P> <P> With a $1-million annual budget, Templo Calvario has opened 40 missions  associated with the Assemblies of God in Latin America and two in the United  States.  </P> <P> De Leon says he hopes to expand his congregation to 6,000 during the 1990s and  establish 15 new churches in the United States. The first one, Templo Calvario  in Riverside, opened for services on Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The last survey of Latino Protestant churches in Southern California was in  1985, and showed 687 congregations in Los Angeles County and 80 in Orange  County. Those figures have increased about 10% each year since, said Clifton  Holland, president of In-depth Evangelism Associates, a nonprofit research  organization.  </P> <P> The Protestants' success is forcing Southern California Catholic leaders to  re-examine their own strategies.  </P> <P> Although there are 200 Latino priests in the Los Angeles archdiocese plus  another 351 who are bilingual and "function" in Spanish, it's far too few, says  Velasquez, the Latino ministry specialist.  </P> <P> "I have a gut-level feeling that if we had 100 new Hispanic seminarians  tomorrow morning, we wouldn't have enough priests for the year 2000. And they  must also learn the Hispanic culture and customs," he added.  </P> <P> Diocesan priests in Los Angeles and Orange counties have been required since  1987 to learn Spanish before being ordained at St. John's Seminary in  Camarillo.  </P> <P> But considering the continued shortage of priests of all ethnicities, the  greatest hope is the Latino people themselves, church leaders say.  </P> <P> A variety of lay movements, called comunidades de base, or neighborhood  communities, are taking hold in parishes such as the 5,000-family Epiphany  Church in South El Monte.  </P> <P> Small neighborhood territories, composed of 50 to 100 households each, are  being organized throughout the parish and meet in parishioners' homes, with  some groups speaking English and the rest Spanish, said Father Joseph Greeley,  Epiphany's pastor.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the comunidades de base is to spread the gospel of Jesus, as  well as to create that sense of belonging . . . that the church is in the  neighborhood," Greeley said. "And this happens in person-to-person contact.  This happens in leadership formation."  </P> <P> One such program at Epiphany that closely mirrors a technique of Pentecostal  Protestants is a charismatic-style prayer and training meeting to equip Latino  lay people to lead weekend spiritual retreats.  </P> <P> Auxiliary Bishop Juan Arzube, head of the archdiocese's San Gabriel region,  agrees that personal contact is the best way for Catholics to meet the  challenge of Protestant proselytizing.  </P> <P> Catholics arrive here from Latin America and they come to Mass and "are lost in  the crowd," Arzube said. "If they had belonged to a small group in the barrio,  then they would at least know people when they went to church on Sunday."  </P></p>

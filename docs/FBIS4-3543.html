			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, April 22 (XINHUA) -- The Chengdu Aero  Instrument and Meter Corporation (CAIMC) will deliver 1,306  MD-90 Central Air Data Computers (CADC) to the Honeywell  Corporation of the United States by 2006.    Lin Yunfeng, general manager of the company based in the  capital of Sichuan Province, said that these computers will be  installed in MD-90 aircraft to be built by the McDonnell Douglas  Company.    He said the computers were designed jointly by the Chengdu  company and the Honeywell Corporation, one of the largest aero  electronics enterprises in the U.S., and built by the former.    The Chinese partner has installed the first computer  assembly  line, which produced five samples in 1993.    Over the past two years, the American partner has sent  experts here to inspect product quality, he said.    The MD-90 is one of McDonnell Douglas's newest types of  aircraft, Lin Yunfeng said, adding that its use of Chinese-built  parts shows that Sino-U.S. cooperation has paid off.    He said that his company and the Honeywell Corporation have  begun negotiation on other cooperative projects.    A Japanese electronics corporation initially wanted to sell  its products to the Chengdu company. But after visiting the  MD-90 CADC assembly line, executives of the Japanese company  decided to buy computers from the latter. "Negotiations for the  deal are now under way," said Lin.    He said that his company is rated as a key enterprise for  producing China's aeronautics equipment, with engineers and  technicians accounting for 30 percent of its workforce.</p>

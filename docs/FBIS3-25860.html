However, raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation  on the ropes is something that may happen eventually, observers  here said.    Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, at today's hearing  of the congressional joint economic committee, pointed to  "latent instabilities" on prices and suggested lowing interest  rates to contain them.    In response, President Bill Clinton said the only thing he  agreed to was "there is no evidence that inflation is coming  back", and "there is no need" to raise interest rates,  especially the long-term ones.    It is not difficult to understand why the White House is so  concerned about the mere mentioning of interest rates. Last  year, the interest rates dipped to historic lows, propelling the  economic boom.    The revival was partly driven by interest-sensitive sectors,  like house construction, consumer spending on big-ticket items  and business investment, which climbed by 15 percent in the  fourth quarter of 1993.    Home sales, stimulated by mortgage rates, the lowest in more  than 25 years, bolstered purchases of furniture and appliances,  while firms increased outlays on equipment and commercial real  estate recovered from depression.    Consumer prices index, meanwhile, edged down to a paltry 2.7  percent last year, the smallest reading since the early 1970s.  The recovery is hailed as a model expansion with no  inflationary growth.    However, as Chairman Greenspan saw it, these are not good  indicators for "emerging troubles". "Higher price inflation  tends to surface rather late in the business cycle," he said.  "They are rarely visible until relatively far advanced."    "The challenge of monetary policy is to detect such latent  instabilities in time to contain them," the chairman stressed,  pointing to the weak labor market and the scant signs of  improvement in exports.    Since 1987, Greenspan has been the chairman of the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve systems, which contains 12  regional banks and has some controls over short-term interest  rates.    The President, with no right to influence the independent  decisions of FED, has power to name one of FED's governors but  cannot remove any of them.    Short-term interest rate is represented by the federal fund  rate, which is the interest banks charge each other on overnight  loans. The rate has been staying at three percent for more than  a year.    Credit tightening will also has impact on long-term interest  rates, such as the 10-year and 30-year treasury bonds and  conventional mortgage rates, which have been around six to seven  percent.    With the recession in 1990-91, the Federal Reserve has cut  short- term interest rates to record lows to spur bank lending  since 1989. The FED refused to raise interest rates which might  choke off growth.    With the economy growing at a robust 5.9 percent in the last  quarter of 1993, many observers have already noted that the  central bank might act soon to raise interest rates and hold  inflationary pressure in check.    The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet later  this week and will submit its crucial report on interest rates  late next month. Greenspan's speech today served to set the  stage for future actions.    "We want the economy to grow in a very stable, solid way,  and  obviously, low interest rates are critical to that. We've got  to keep interest rates down so that people can afford to borrow  money," said President Clinton.</p>

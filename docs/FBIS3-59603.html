Billerbeck: "The Danger of Data Theft"] </F>   [Text]  <H3>  Systems Forum: What is the Data Security Situation in  Germany? </H3> <H5>  Experts Criticize a Lack of Awareness of the Problem. </H5>   In Germany, there is a lack of awareness of the problem of  data security. This was the conclusion of a panel discussion on  the occasion of the Systems Computer Fair in Munich. The group  of experts were unanimous primarily in saying that there cannot  be complete security against data theft.    The title of the panel discussion on the occasion of the  Systems Fair was chosen to be provocative: "The absolute  worst-case scenario caused by data theft." The discussion lasted  about one hour. However, there was quick evidence that the  problem of data security in German government offices and  companies cannot be given high enough importance. This is  because our entire society is dependent to a large extent on the  availability of advanced information technology. That is  precisely the problem, said Prof. Klaus Brunnstein from the  University of Hamburg. "We need this technology but it cannot be  made 100 percent secure."    With the increasing complexity of data processing solutions  and the trend toward variegated services, the effects of  breakdowns in the technology become more and more painful. This  involves not only the theft of important data but also simple  breakdowns of hardware and software. According to Brunnstein,  "Hardware errors make up a greater percentage of the problems in  EDP than we generally believe." The famous viruses account for a  maximum of 25&percnt; of such problems.    Regarding data theft, the scientist from Hamburg sees the  greatest risk potential in system administrators. These are the  individuals responsible for managing EDP systems in companies  and government offices. In their role as experts, the systems  administrators are usually only poorly monitored and could thus  easily access all important data.    Peter Schikora is the director of the FastComtec company. He  sees the absolute worst-case scenario for information technology  happening in the near future. He cites reports which see the  Telekom division of the Federal Post Office suffering damages to  the extent of 20 million Deutsche marks per week through the  manipulations of hackers. In industry, data on research and  development projects worth millions are passed back and forth  over virtually unsecured data lines while appropriate security  measures would only cost about 150,000 Deutsche marks. "However,  data protection is obviously too expensive," according to  Schikora, "primarily because the original copy of the stolen  data is still available even after the theft."    To tackle the problem, management also needs to be  sensitized. Prof. Alfred Bullesbach is the data protection  officer at Debis, a subsidiary of Daimler Benz. He says, "Data  protection is a management task." In the final analysis, if the  available information technology is to be used, the appropriate  awareness for the dangers and strategies to defend against these  dangers must be developed.    The virus expert from Hamburg, Brunnstein, also sees a  considerable lack of information on the part of the police and  the criminal prosecution authorities. Very few policemen,  judges, or prosecutors are capable of properly evaluating and  classifying criminal offenses in conjunction with EDP systems.  Appropriate training is urgently needed in this area.    Brunnstein also sees another problem. "Our companies invest  about two to five percent of their DP budgets in data security.  However, this investment is usually directed toward the central  computer and only rarely toward the PC networks in the company."  However, it is precisely these networks that face the greatest  danger.    Brunnstein classifies computers into three categories. The  first category is "inflexible but secure." These are computers  that, for example, also permit monitoring of the administrator  and therefore provide a high degree of security. The second  category is flexible but not secure. In Brunnstein's opinion,  this category includes all PCs running under the operating  systems MS- DOS ("Not an operating system, but free housekeeping  software," says Brunnstein.), Mac-OS and Unix. Brunnstein puts  the newer systems of Windows NT, OS/2 and the most recent  network systems into a third category. These systems have good  approaches to security but they have not been proven in actual  practice.</p>

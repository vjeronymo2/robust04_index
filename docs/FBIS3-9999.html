			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] In Port-au-Prince we are moving toward the  possible formation of an ad hoc government. According to Senator  Bernard Sansaricq, the conditions have been met for the  establishment of such a government. Sen. Sensaricq, in a Radio  Metropole interview, cited Article 111 of the Constitution to  put an end to the vacuum created by the resignation of the  Robert Malval government. According to Bernard Sansaricq, all  institutions agree on the necessity of forming an ad hoc  government. He nevertheless spoke of divergences on the choice  of personalities to comprise this government.    [Begin recording] [Sansaricq] "The country has been at the  point of death for two and a half months, even longer than that.  But for two months, specifically, there has been no management  from the executive. So far, President Aristide has refused to  appoint a new prime minister. The Senate of the Republic  especially.... [changes thought] We cannot wait around for the  president to perhaps have a dream one night, then say the next  morning: Well, I am going to appoint a prime minister in Haiti.  No, there must be.... [changes thought] We are joint holders of  the national sovereignty. We must do something and we are going  to do something in compliance with Article 111 of the  Constitution, which reads as follows: The legislative power  makes laws on all subjects of public interest.    "One does not have the right to hinder a nation as this one  has been hindered. One does not have the right.... President  Aristide should really understand that after the resignation of  the prime minister, he was duty-bound to immediately appoint  another prime minister and to submit his name to parliament for  ratification. He did not do it.    ``One can see there is an omnilevel entanglement. [passage  omitted] Things must be taken in hand. This is why the Senate of  the Republic, the new office of the Senate of the Republic, has  taken the matter in hand. We declared as early as 21 February  that we would sit, permanently. We wish to force the  institutions to follow us and together, to form a government of  public safety that will be a very provisional ad hoc government  until we can decide whether we are going to implement Art. 148  or Art. 149. But we cannot let this country drift, we cannot let  the people die [corrects himself] we cannot let the country  continue to die, as has been the case. [passage omitted]    ``I think we are going to find the support necessary to  accomplish the formation of an ad hoc temporary government. I  again use the word, `temporary,' until we can decide to  implement Art. 148 or 149 of the Constitution. [passage omitted]  I believe there are lucid forces in this country. The Committee  of Action for National Reconciliation is one of these forces  that gathered 48 organizations together to support these ideas.  They also agree with the establishment of an ad hoc government.  I believe this global idea is more or less accepted by all  institutions in Haiti.''    [Reporter Clarens Renois] "Did you discuss this idea with  the  Army, with General Cedras?"    [Sansaricq] "Personally, I did not. But I know others who  did  discuss it with the Army."    [Renois] "Would the Army today agree to support an ad hoc  government?" [Sansaricq] "I think the Army is very aware that  the situation is very serious and that we must end up in the  formation of a new government. I cannot speak on behalf of the  Haitian Army and I do not want to speak on behalf of the Haitian  Army. I want to speak on behalf of the Senate of the Republic.  Of course, we are in consultation and we will remain in  consultation with the Armed Forces and all public forces in this  country. I must tell you that everybody agrees that we must  reach something." [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

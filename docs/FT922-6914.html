			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (4): Parliament comes back to life - Politics / A change in mood YOU MIGHT think, looking at the political scene in Turkey, that nothing much has really changed. The politicians have the same old faces. The issues are little different from a decade ago. Even the excuses sound familiar. But Turkey is experiencing an important change in mood. Amid signs of increasing political violence, and a deteriorating economy, parliament - so long ignored under the previous government - is enjoying a renewed lease of life. The 450-seat National Assembly is today the most eclectic gathering of Turkish political opinion in the country's history. In all, there are six parties representing every strand, from radicals of the Kurdish minority to Islamic fundamentalists and extreme nationalists on both the right and left wing. In many countries, such a fiery political cocktail would be a recipe for disaster. In Turkey a consensus has emerged, with a coalition government of conservative and social democratic parties pushing ahead with what promises to be the most thoroughgoing reform programme since Ataturk founded the republic in the 1920s. The man responsible is Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister and leader of the right-of-centre True Path party, DYP. He knows only too well the vicissitudes of Turkish politics. Six times prime minister before, he was twice ousted by the military, the last occasion being in 1980. The prime minister's bid to restore the effectiveness of parliament is something of a personal crusade. More practically, it allows him to ignore the constant jibes of President Turgut Ozal who has repeatedly used his office for partisan political purposes in a bid to undermine the growing public support for his long-time rival. This uneasy cohabitation with President Ozal casts a deep shadow over Turkish politics. But Mr Demirel has provided the president with just enough rope to hang himself, by dangling the threat of a series of corruption files, where official impropriety is alleged. The prime minister's tactics are in some ways merely reflect the situation that he does not have a sufficient majority to unseat the president by changing the constitution. But many colleagues believe this measured approach to Turkey's problems underlines Mr Demirel's determination not to rock the political boat. At 68, Mr Demirel wants to lay to rest his turbulent reputation and secure an honourable place in Turkey's history. The real question is whether he can match his enthusiasm with the necessary urgency to push badly needed legislation through the house. The result of the election in October, while reconfirming the strength of the conservative vote in Turkish politics, did not provide Mr Demirel with the outright majority he wanted. True Path emerged as the country's largest party, winning widespread support particularly in the small towns of the Aegean and central Anatolia. But the outgoing Motherland party, ANAP, also did better than expected, polling strongly in the big cities where it successfully harnessed the votes of the business community with its image of a modern western-oriented Turkey. The election result also underlined the demise of the left in Turkey with the Social Democratic Populists, the main left-of-centre party, only too happy to accept Mr Demirel's offer to form a coalition. The party has still not resolved its leadership crisis, with Mr Deniz Baykal making a series of so far abortive bids to replace Mr Erdal Inonu, the SHP leader. Local elections on June 7 in many parts of Turkey are expected to reinforce these trends. A strong swing to the DYP might even persuade the prime minister to go to the country in the autumn in search of a clear mandate. It is too early to claim what is happening is the renaissance of Turkish democracy, as the government suggests. But parliamentary sessions now receive extensive television coverage. The deputies have probably never worked so hard. Indeed, the legislative timetable is now so congested that the speaker has had to shelve plans for an early recess. The politicians may find themselves confined to smoky committee rooms well into the summer months. To visit one of the many state ministers who share offices in the old prime ministry in Ankara's Kizilay district is to run the gauntlet of a throng of farmers, relatives and free loaders, all waiting for jobs and other official largesse. Mr Demirel indulges the electorate with regular audiences in the prime ministry where, if you can brave the military police on the door, any Turk can make his point to the prime minister - a custom which seems to have more in common with the consensus-building traditions of Arab politics. Another feature of the new parliament is the return of a number of familiar faces from Turkey's turbulent political past. Mr Bulent Ecevit, the former socialist prime minister, regained his seat in the mining town of Zongludak. Mr Alpaslan Turkes, leader of extreme right-wing Turkish Labour party is also back. The happy triumvirate is made up by Mr Necmettin Erbakan, the Islamic leader who espouses, among other things, an Islamic common market and an Islamic Nato. There are newer faces too, including the attractive radical Kurdish deputy, Mrs Leyla Zana, who created such a stir when giving her oath of allegiance at the opening of parliament wearing a headband in tricolour of the banned Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, which is fighting an increasingly violent separatist war in Turkey's south-east region. She was one of 22 radical Kurdish deputies who stood on the Social Democratic ticket - 18 of whom have now resigned. In the shifting sands of Turkish party politics, some of the other recent alliances are already coming unstuck. Mr Erbakan and Mr Turkes, bedfellows during the election, have already gone their separate ways. The landscape could soon be changed further if parliament approves a draft bill submitted in April which would lift the restrictions on political parties banned following the 1980 military coup. That would allow these political groups to lay claim to extensive property impounded under the military order. There is talk of reconstituting the centre-left Republican's People's Party, founded by Ataturk. There has even been some debate about allowing a Kurdish party - a suggestion first made by Mr Mesut Yilmaz, leader of ANAP.</p>

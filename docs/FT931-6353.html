			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: The Magic Fundoshi - Theatre This triptych of short Japanese plays were written in Kyogen style by Donald Richie, the British authority on Japanese film, during his 50 years in Japan. Kyogen drama, as Richie has written, is 'satyr-play, anti-masque; it is Pyramus and Thisbe to Noh's Theseus and Hippolyta.' And all three of these are miniature comedies in nicely bawdy vein. Perfect Servants is like an erotic joke by Marivaux; The Magic Fundoshi is like a dirty rewrite of The Emperor's New Clothes; and The Misplaced Goddess is like a Whitehall farce set in a temple. They are, however, acted here with laborious cuteness and zero finesse. I am sure that Glen Goei and Stephen Night, who co-direct, know far more about Japan than I; but this, surely, is Japan for tourists. David Tse, Adrian Pang, Danile York and Andrew Mallett perform with an archness that implies that (a) 'We're being Japanese, and refined, and quaint' (b) 'You couldn't take any of this seriously, it's too silly' (c) 'But aren't we a hoot'. Everything smacked of schoolboy theatricals. I think I laughed once, but have forgotten when. Not when the Lady Chibusa (Mallett) reads Hello magazine, anyway. Acted with more authority, these plays could probably be enchanting. (Alas, there is always an audience to cherish crummy nudge-nudge acting, and the audience at Hammersmith's Lyric Studio chortles merrily.) Richie has a comic gift, which only falters in the climax of The Misplaced Goddess. The real goddess appears, and tells off these men for underestimating women - an apotheosis evidently intended as a feminist dea ex machina idea. But its feminism is expressed with such pc deadness that it seems to have been written by a machina for a machina, with no serious dea or idea in its head. At the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, W6, until March 20</p>

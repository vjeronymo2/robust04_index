			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Swiss say No to UN force role The Swiss have once again shown their aversion to foreign involvement, with 57.3 per cent of voters rejecting in a referendum a government proposal that they provide troops for United Nations peacekeeping operations. Only 42.7 per cent, or 898,925 people, were in favour - a much lower number than expected. Yesterday's vote comes after referendum decisions in 1986 to avoid UN membership and in 1992 to stay out of the European Economic Area. Earlier this year, Swiss voters irritated neighbouring European governments by voting to prohibit transit lorries from their alpine passes from 2004. The overwhelming rejection of involvement in UN peacekeeping therefore marked the third time in eight years that the Swiss had turned their backs on the rest of the world and opted to continue what one television commentator described as 'splendid isolation'. There had been signs in the run-up to yesterday's vote that European countries were no longer willing to accept Switzerland's lack of international solidarity passively. Last week, Mr Matthias Wissmann, the German transport minister, acknowledged that the referendum had no direct relation to European transport discussions, which have been jolted by the decision in February to ban lorry transit traffic from the Alps. The connection was 'more atmospheric', Mr Wissmann said. With a Yes vote, Switzerland would signal it sought not only to win advantages from international relations but also to carry the burdens. The proposal to create a troop of 600 volunteer blue helmet troops was rejected in all but the French-speaking cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel, Geneva and Jura, opening the potential for a renewal of tensions between French-speaking Swiss and the others. The four-party coalition government and parliament last year agreed to amend the constitution to allow for the dispatch of peacekeepers. Opponents claimed that Switzerland's neutrality would be compromised by participation in peacekeeping and that blue helmet troops were ineffective and a waste of money. The cost of the peacekeeping contribution was estimated at SFr100m (Pounds 47m) per year. In another referendum vote yesterday, the Swiss rejected a proposal to make it easier for children of immigrants to become citizens.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yueh Shan (1471 1472): "The Sino-U.S. </F> `Agreement' on the Release of Wang Juntao"]    [Text] Communist China quietly "sent" Wang Juntao, a  vanguard of the democracy movement, to the United States without  letting the Beijing people know. He has been "released on bail  for medical treatment" in the United States. If the people of  Beijing were to find out about it, they would certainly find it  strange.    People will at once associate this event with the question  of  the U.S. most-favored-nation trading status. Have human rights  been linked with trade once again?    A rumor has shown that the people's guesswork has not been  completely off the mark. During U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's visit to China in the middle of March, it was said  that the four commitments concerning the release of Wang Juntao  made between the Chinese and U.S. sides were as follows:    1. Special judicial arrangements will be made by China for  Wang Juntao, and, after his release on bail, he will be allowed  to go to the United States for medical treatment;    2. The U.S. departments concerned should undertake the  responsibility that, during the period of receiving medical  treatment in the United States, Wang Juntao cannot get involved  in activities opposing the Chinese Government;    3. Wang Juntao will be allowed to return to China after his  recovery;    4. Wang Juntao's wife Hou Xiaotian will have no difficulty  in returning to China.    A cadre, a friend of mine, "leaked this secret" to me and  told me that it was accurate information, but I think it can  also be termed a "rumor."</p>

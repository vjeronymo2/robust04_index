			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone said  on 21 March that an eventual negotiation between NAFTA --  comprising Mexico, the United States, and Canada -- and Mercosur  [Common Market of the South] should be conducted at the bloc  level instead of the bilateral level.    According to Scavone, Paraguay upholds that negotiations  should be conducted through economic blocs. Scavone thus  responded to reports from Argentina -- one of the Mercosur  members along with Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay -- stating that  it is allegedly negotiating its entrance into NAFTA.    Asked what will be done if it is confirmed that Argentina is  negotiating its entrance into NAFTA at the bilateral level,  Scavone said something will be done in this regard and Paraguay  may submit a claim within Mercosur.    Argentina's alleged request to enter NAFTA was one of the  mandatory issues discussed by those who attended the lecture  David Rockefeller gave on 21 March at the Business  Administration School (EDAN).    In this regard, Rockefeller said Chile is "at the top of the  list" but Argentina may be a firm candidate in view of  "impressive changes" implemented in the last few years.    Scavone stated that the integration theory presupposes the  achievement of a series of agreements on several issues. He  said: "It was fairly easy to achieve the elimination of customs  tariffs. But issues such as the establishment of a single  customs tariff demand the simultaneous compatibility of  macroeconomic policies. This is what Dr. Rockefeller said."    Rockefeller said the socioeconomic development of each  individual country also guarantees the success of any economic  bloc.</p>

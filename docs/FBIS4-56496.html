			<p>BFN     [Text] On 3 May, the National Coalition [CN] met at 1500 at  the Villa Saint-Louis Hotel where they passed a resolution after  several rounds. The CN asks in the resolution... [pauses] they  say they condemn the interference in Haitian affairs of foreign  countries under the pretext of defending democracy and human  rights.    Second [as heard], the coalition advises that it  energetically rejects any foreign military intervention by the  United States or other countries in Haitian territory.    Third, they say they are in solidarity with all [words  indistinct] while acknowledging the need to work toward reforms  to be made in the country.    Fourth, the coalition reaffirms its resistance against  foreign invaders (?and is) sounding the trumpet to prevent  (?them) from walking on Haitian soil.    Fifth, the CN calls on all staunch Haitian citizens to work  to put the Haitian nation back on his feet so it can once again  find its place among the nations as the beacon of the black  world.    Sixth, they ask the Haitian parliament to issue a verdict as  a matter of urgency and in a precise and categorical manner  against military intervention and the members' presence of the  UN/OAS Civilian Mission in Haiti.    Seventh, they ask the Haitian Armed Forces to assume their  responsibilities so as to allow the civilian authorities to  actually take the nation's fate in hand and to accompany the  people on the road to development and democracy.    b) [as heard] They ask the Haitian Army to stop all  terrorist  acts being committed throughout the country against people's  lives and properties so as to avoid the trap set by all the  destabilization professionals. They also ask the Army to  organize, within its constitutional authority, the defense of  the country's territory.    Eighth, in conclusion, the coalition asks the  parliamentarians and the other powers in the country to  consciously and independently make the decisions that are  essential today so a head of state and a competent and  responsible government -- inspired by Article 149 of the  (?Constitution) -- can be appointed at the head of the country.  They also ask that the deterioration process of the country set  in motion by the international community reach an end. The CN  resolution was passed by vote on 3 May at the Villa Saint-Louis  Hotel.</p>

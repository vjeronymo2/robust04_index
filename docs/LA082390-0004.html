			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLINGING TO THE VINE;  </P> <P> TOMATO GROWERS HAVE LEARNED TO SPECIALIZE TO SURVIVE  </P> <P> In coming weeks, consumers will continue to find vine-ripened North County  tomatoes plentiful at their grocery stores and roadside produce stands.  Although tomatoes are produced year-round, this is the natural harvest season.  </P> <P> Even though shoppers should have little trouble finding good tomatoes, North  County growers in recent years have been committing less and less acreage to  the crop. Competition among local growers, from Mexican producers and, more  recently, from land developers, has caused many farmers to roll back tomato  production.  </P> <P> Still, tomatoes were a $33-million crop in San Diego County last year. To cope  with the changing market, many growers are limiting their crops to specialty  tomatoes, such as Romas, that are gaining favor among local consumers.  </P> <P> Alan Yasukochi of Valley Heights Farms in Oceanside is a third-generation  farmer who has seen his tomato acreage decrease from 800 to 150 over the past  decade.  </P> <P> "Labor and water costs have gone up so much that we can't compete anymore," he  said.  </P> <P> Yasukochi specializes in Romas, the medium-size, firm-fleshed plum tomatoes  grown mainly for canning, as well as the ever-popular cherry tomato. He  believes the small fruits have the best flavor.  </P> <P> Andrea Peterson of Peterson Specialty Produce in Fallbrook agrees with  Yasukochi on the market slump: "Growing commercial tomatoes is the pits," she  said. "The bottom has really fallen out of the tomato market in North County."  </P> <P> Peterson said she is surviving because she produces only organically grown  fruit, which is now in great demand. She keeps pests at bay by spraying her  plants with Safer brand soap or Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that kills  leaf-eating caterpillars. Both methods are recommended by California Certified  Organic Farmers.  </P> <P> "Organic tomatoes are more expensive to produce, but we get a better price for  them," Peterson said. "Actually, smaller operations like mine, bound for the  specialty market, are doing better than the larger ones."  </P> <P> Peterson's acre of organic tomatoes includes small yellow pears, delicate  yellow ovals (which are "very sweet") and currant-size reds and yellows,  favored by restaurant chefs.  </P> <P> "We grow things that are pretty hardy since we're organic," she said. One of  her favorites is the large Lemon Boy, a sweet, juicy, low-acid variety.  </P> <P> Both Peterson and Yasukochi ship only vine-ripened tomatoes. Most grocery store  tomatoes are picked early, then given an application of ethylene, a natural gas  emitted by tomatoes, to induce ripening. Industry specialists hasten to add  that the process does not alter the tomato's flavor.  </P> <P> Most tomato lovers agree that the best-tasting fruit has been vine-ripened,  but, since tomatoes bruise easily during handling, shipping it fully ripe is  difficult.  </P> <P> Tomatoes are ideally suited for the calorie- and cholesterol-conscious. They  contain no cholesterol, and a tomato weighing 150 grams has only 35 calories  but 40% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C, and 20% of Vitamin A.  </P> <P> To savor tomatoes at their peak, do not refrigerate them, the California Tomato  Board says. They will taste best when kept at room temperature (55 to 70 F).  They can be refrigerated for a few days after fully ripe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE TO GET THEM  </P> <P> Among the places in North County to buy fresh-picked tomatoes:  </P> <P> Peterson Specialty Produce. 439-6466. 5910 Camino Baja Cerro, Fallbrook, 92028.

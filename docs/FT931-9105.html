			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Japanese banks urged to write off bad loans THE Bank of Japan is urging Japanese banks to write off non-performing loans, worth possibly several thousand billion yen, in a radical shift of policy towards the banking system's bad loan problem. A senior Bank of Japan official said that if the banks followed its advice some might be forced into net losses for the year ending March 1993. A Japanese bank has not made a loss since the second world war. The move confirms that the financial authorities believe the Japanese financial system is under more strain than at any time since the 1920s and 1930s when several banks collapsed. It is unheard of for a Japanese bank to declare a loss mainly because they have been able to cover their bad loans by drawing on accumulated reserves. The banks' bad loans have now reached such proportions, however, that the Bank of Japan is urging more radical action. In the six months to the end of September, non-performing loans of the top 21 Japanese banks rose 54 per cent to Y12,300bn (Pounds 72bn), largely as a result of the collapse of the property market since 1989. The banks are preparing for the close of their books for the year to the end of March 31. The Bank of Japan official, commenting on Sumitomo Bank's recent decision to write off Y100bn of bad loans, said: 'The Sumitomo decision is very much in the right direction. We want to encourage banks to try to follow suit.' He said some of the most vulnerable banks were opposed to writing off bad loans because the resulting net loss could trigger a collapse in confidence. 'No bank is yet facing a net loss. But it is being discussed and I would say it is even a possibility,' he said. 'We are telling them that, if there is a need to go that far, then they should not be afraid to set off on the march because we will stand behind them.' The banks had never before had to consider such action because they had never faced such bad loans, he said. The official added that the recent cut in the official discount rate was partly aimed at encouraging banks to write off bad loans by allowing them to improve their operating profits.

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley condemns benefits 'scares' GROWTH in expenditure on the social security system had to be consistent with what the country could afford, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told MPs yesterday. He again attacked Labour MPs for 'scaremongering' over the government's spending review and said they were causing needless anxiety among vulnerable groups by suggesting that various benefits were at risk. Emphasising the need to ensure that the benefit system was affordable, Mr Lilley said: 'It cannot indefinitely outstrip the economic means the country has to pay for it. 'If it did so, it would become unsustainable and that would be the greatest betrayal for those in need and would damage the economy,' he said. Mr Lilley said the long-term review now in progress was seeking to ensure 'we have a better but sustainable system which is growing in line with what we can finance'. Opposition MPs demanded to know where cuts were going to be made and Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow social security secretary, suggested that comments made by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, had fuelled anxiety about 'mean-minded changes' affecting housing benefit and other payments. He called on Mr Lilley to slam the door on schemes that would 'spell disaster for some of the most vulnerable in our community'. Mr Lilley assured the House that none of the changes resulting from the long-term review would make vulnerable people worse off.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines on higher oil price prospect Wall Street THE prospect of higher oil prices, following a change in Saudi Arabia's pricing policy, triggered fears of inflation and depressed US equity prices yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 22.56 lower at 3,364.21. Declines led rises by about two-to-one after moderate New York SE volume of about 198m shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.61 to 411.41, while the Nasdaq composite lost 4.65 to 575.65. The pressure on prices started early in the day, following reports in the Wall Street Journal that Saudi Arabia had apparently changed its pricing policy and that crude oil prices might rise by as much as Dollars 3 a barrel later in the year, spurring fears that higher prices might lead to an escalation in inflation. In late trading, the July crude oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange was quoted Dollars 1.06 higher at Dollars 22 a barrel. In addition, sentiment was dampened by an unexpectedly sharp rise in the May consumer confidence index, which further quelled hopes of an immediate interest rate cut. The May index weighed in at 71.6, above the 68 the market had expected. Energy issues dominated big board trading, with some attaining 52-week highs. The activity was spurred by reports that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, had changed its pricing policy and planned to bring it in line with the Opec producers who want higher prices. Since the end of the Gulf war, the sector has suffered because of weak oil and natural gas prices. Exxon forged ahead Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 64, USX-Marathon Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 23 7/8 , Mobil Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 67 and British Petroleum's ADRs Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 60 5/8 . Oil service shares also benefited from the prospect of increased crude prices. Halliburton rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 , Baker Hughes Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 3/4 and Schlumberger Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68 1/2 . The boost for crude oil prices was a blow to the transportation section, the Dow Jones Transportation Average tumbling 15.69 to 1,360.80. AMR, parent of American Airlines, declined Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 , Delta Air Lines Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 7/8 and United Airlines Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 118 3/4 . Merck receded Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 . The company recently implemented a three-for-one stock split. It has declared a regular 23-cent quarterly dividend on the split shares. General Motors and Ford lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 and Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 respectively. GM reported mid-May US car sales of 94,323, up from 82,312 a year earlier. US truck sales rose to 51,790 from 43,233. Ford's mid-May car and truck sales also improved from the previous year. Canada TORONTO gained ground yesterday and closed at the day's best after oil futures shot higher on Opec's decision to freeze output at second quarter levels. Gold shares climbed on expectations that strengthening crude oil prices will spur inflation. The TSE 300 composite index rose 12 points to 3,382.3 and advances outscored declines by 308 to 263 after volume of 25.1m shares valued at CDollars 271.7m. Imperial Oil led the energy group, rising CDollars 2 1/8 to CDollars 44 3/8 on volume of 196,000 shares as the sector's index climbed 2.2 per cent.</p>

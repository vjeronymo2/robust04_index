			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mirror agrees to call a halt to memoirs extracts THE Daily Mirror last night agreed not to publish further extracts from Lady Thatcher's memoirs, The Downing Street Years. The newspaper, which has been publishing extracts from the book each morning this week, said it had agreed to call a 'truce' after being threatened with an injunction restraining further publication for breach of copyright. Sir David Napley, Lady Thatcher's solicitor, said the paper had also agreed not to repeat any quotations from the book. The newspaper said: 'We've had all the best bits. There isn't really much more to tell.' Sir David said: 'Following on Lady Thatcher informing the Daily Mirror of her intention to seek an injunction to restrain the further unlawful publication of her book, the Daily Mirror has undertaken to her not to publish any further material or to repeat any quotations from the book which they have already published and not to pass any such information to a third party.' He said the Mirror's undertaking was 'realistic' particularly in light of comments made by the Court of Appeal on Wednesday that it would be unfortunate if the law was unable to prevent such publication of unlawfully obtained material. He stressed that the Mirror would still be free to use information from the book and to comment on it. Lady Thatcher is considering whether to take any further action for damages against the Mirror. Her successful action follows three failed attempts by The Sunday Times, which is due to begin serialising the book this Sunday, to halt publication by seeking an injunction for breach of confidence. Mr David Banks, the Mirror's editor, said he was happy to call it a truce. 'The Daily Mirror has set the agenda for the Tory conference and for all of Britain. We are happy for the British public, having been presented with all the facts, to make up their own minds. 'That's the role of the press in a democratic society,' he added.</p>

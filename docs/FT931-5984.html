			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: S Korean vehicle makers struggle as costs rise SOUTH Korea's five main motor vehicle producers reported mixed, but generally worse, results for 1992 in spite of some increases in sales. The drop in earnings re-flected higher costs as manufacturers offered low-interest consumer loans to revive sluggish domestic demand. They also had increased costs associated with the production and marketing of several new car models. Hyundai Motor, the biggest Korean motor company, said net profits fell by 23 per cent to Won41.6bn (Dollars 52m), although sales rose by 8.5 per cent to Won6,079bn. Sales and profits were harmed in the last two months of 1992 as employees became involved in the presidential campaign of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder, causing sales activity to slacken. Hyundai was able to balance sluggish sales in South Korea and the US, traditionally its largest foreign market, by increasing exports to Europe, which became its biggest overseas customer last year. Kia Motors reported a 5.7 per cent decline in net profits to Won14.95bn as sales rose by 20 per cent to Won3,282bn. Earnings were depressed by costs involved with the introduction of the Potentia luxury car and the medium-range Sephia. It also had heavy investment spending in expanding production at its Asan Bay facility. Daewoo Motors, which is unlisted, continued to post losses. Its deficit shrank to Won90bn from Won146.7bn in 1991. Sales increased by 6.5 per cent to Won1,700bn. Asia Motors, which is a specialised manufacturer of commercial vehicles and affiliated with Kia Motors, suffered a 29 per cent fall in profits to Won7.4bn as demand weakened because of a downturn in the construction industry. Sales remained almost unchanged at Won970bn. Ssangyong Motor slipped into a deficit of Won8.75bn after registering a profit of Won9.38bn in 1991. Sales also fell by 15 per cent to Won340.8bn. The reverse was largely caused by increased competition in the market for the four-wheel drive vehicles, which Ssangyong monopolised until last year with its Korando model. The introduction of the Galloper by Hyundai Precision, a manufacturer of rolling stock and containers, sharply reduced Ssangyong's market share.</p>

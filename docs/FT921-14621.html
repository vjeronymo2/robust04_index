			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Landlords threaten retailer with bankruptcy FIVE OF Canada's largest shopping mall landlords have threatened to force Grafton-Fraser, a leading clothing retail group, into bankruptcy following a court order protecting Grafton from its creditors. The action reflects the growing strains between retailers and landlords throughout North America caused by the protracted slump in consumer spending. According to one Toronto real estate expert, shopping centres are facing growing demands from hard-pressed tenants to renegotiate or delay rent payments. Grafton, which is suffering heavy losses, was granted a court order last month protecting it from its creditors while it restructures its business. The company is closing 107 of its 241 stores. An action by the landlords seeking to overturn the court order and put Grafton into bankruptcy is scheduled to be heard on January 23. Grafton is continuing to pay rent on its stores. But a senior executive of one of the landlord companies expressed concern yesterday at the growing tendency among retailers to use a restructuring as an opportunity to 'cherry pick' among shopping mall locations. The landlords fear that retailers will, in this way, seriously undermine the viability of some marginally profitable shopping centres. He noted that some landlords borrowed heavily and provided generous inducements to persuade retailers to move into new malls during the mid and late-1980s. The landlords making the application against Grafton include Cambridge Shopping Centres, Cadillac Fairview, Marathon Realty and Trilea Centres. Mr John Hick, Grafton's president said the company would strongly resist the landlords' move. He said that if the landlords succeeded with their motion, any possibility of a restructuring to save jobs and stores would be lost.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Noncombat activities of the ARNG when engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. sec. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709, provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An employee whose injury or death is incident to service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A claimant dissatisfied with an administrative settlement under this subpart as the result of activities of the NG of a State, Commonwealth, or Territory is not entitled to judicial relief in an action against the United States. Whether he or she has a legal cause of action or may file an administrative claim against such political entity depends upon controlling local law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims arising out of the activities of the ARNG when performing duties at the call of the governor of a State maintaining the unit are not cognizable under this subpart or any other law, regulation, or appropriation available to the Army for the payment of claims. Such claims should be returned or referred to the authorities of the State, for whatever action they choose to take and claimants should be informed of the return or referral. Care should be taken to determine the status of the unit; members at the time the claims incident occurred, particularly in civil emergencies as units called by the governor, are sometimes ``federalized'' during the call-up. If the unit was federalized at the time the claims incident occurred, the claim will be cognizable under subparts C, D and F or other subparts pertaining to the Active Army. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.94 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Tort claims.

Sections 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 will be processed under the FTCA (subpart D). Such claims arising before 29 December 1981 will, except as modified herein, be processed and settled in accordance with the provisions of subpart C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Noncombat activities. A claim incident to the noncombat activities of the ARNG while engaged in duty or training under 32 U.S.C. Sections 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 may be settled under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Subrogated claims.

The report will contain the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Date of incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Place of incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Nature of incident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Names and organizations of ARNG personnel involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Names of potential claimants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) A brief description of any damage, loss, or destruction of private property and any injuries or death of potential claimants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.98 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) When required. An investigation is required as indicated in &sect;536.15 except when claims are regularly paid by local sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) By whom made. Area offices, or claims processing offices designated by them, are responsible for the investigation of claims occurring within their assigned geographic areas. The state adjutant general will designate an official or office as point of contact for Army claims personnel and will furnish necessary personnel to conduct or assist in investigations subject to the availability of funds and personnel. (See &sect;536.7(h)). The use of ARNG personnel when available, is authorized. Attention is directed to &sect;536.19(b) that requires the use of information from other investigations made previously, particularly military and civilian police reports, reports of survey, line of duty investigations, and collateral air crash investigations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Conduct of investigation. The investigation will be conducted in accordance with subpart B, except that a sample scope of employment format will be added, together with a copy of the orders authorizing the performance of duty by the tortfeasor. Also, where a State has waived immunity or has some other means for paying claims, as through legislative committee or insurance, the claims officer's report will contain a statement as to the nature of the remedy against the State, the extent of insurance coverage, and the status of any claim made. If there is no remedy against the State and no insurance coverage, the claims officer's report will so indicate. If a regular procedure has been established for the processing of claims for a particular jurisdiction as by agreement between local authorities and an appropriate Army headquarters or USARCS, this requirement is waived. Finally, injury should be made as to any existing or anticipated claim or lawsuit against or by the driver of the ARNG vehicle or insurer. If a claim or lawsuit has been filed, further inquiry should be made as to probable outcome. This could be accomplished by discussion with the driver and an examination of the driver's insurance policy, which, if obtained, should be included in the file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.99 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims in which there is a State source of recovery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Where there is a remedy against the State, as a result of either waiver of sovereign immunity or liability insurance coverage, the following procedures apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Where the State is insured, direct contact with State or ARNG officials rather than the insurer is desirable. Regular procedures will be established and followed wherever possible. Such procedures should be agreed on by both local authorities and the appropriate claims authorities subject to concurrence by Commander, USARCS. Such procedures will be designed to ensure that local authorities and U.S. authorities do not issue conflicting instructions for processing claims, and whenever possible, and in accordance with governing local and Federal law, a mutual arrangement for disposition of such claims as in paragraph (c) of this section is worked out. Amounts recovered or recoverable by claimant from any insurer (other than claimant's insurer who has obtained no subrogated interest against the United States) will be deducted from the amount otherwise payable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If there is a remedy against the State or its insurer, the claimant may be advised of that remedy. If the payment by the State or its insurer does not fully compensate claimant, an additional payment may be made. If liability is clear and claimant settles with the State or its insurer for less than the maximum amount recoverable, the difference between the maximum amount recoverable and the settlement normally will be deducted from the payment by the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If the State or its insurer desires to pay less than their maximum jurisdiction or policy limit on a basis of 50 percent or more of the actual value of the entire claim, any payment made by the United States must be made directly to the claimant. This can be accomplished by either having the United States pay the entire claim and have the State or its insurer reimburse its portion to the United States, or by having each party pay its agreed share directly to the claimant. If the State or its insurer desires to pay less than 50 percent of the actual value of the claim, the procedure set forth in paragraph (d) of this section will be followed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

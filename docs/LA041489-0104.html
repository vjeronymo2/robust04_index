			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> EDS Wins Round in Court: Electronic Data Systems Corp., a unit of General  Motors, said it won a permanent injunction preventing H. Ross Perot, its  founder and former chairman, from even thinking of going into business to make  a profit until the end of the year. The injunction, issued in Virginia by  Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge William Plummer, prevents Perot from  engaging in, or even "contemplating," any for-profit business before Dec. 1.  EDS said the court also ruled that Perot did not have special rights to hire  EDS employees indefinitely as Perot had claimed. The judge ruled instead that  such hiring rights will terminate Dec. 1, 1991, and the pool of EDS employees  involved to those employed on Dec. 1, 1986. GM acquired EDS, a data processing  company, from Perot for $2.5 billion in 1984.  </P></p>

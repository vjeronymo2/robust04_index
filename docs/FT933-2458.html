			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / International Company News: Accor in talks over Air France hotel deal ACCOR, the French hotel and tourism group, is holding talks with Air France, the state-owned airline, concerning a merger of its Sofitel hotels operation with the airline's Meridien hotel chain. Accor said it had long been interested in merging the groups to create a strong international luxury hotel group. The plan has received impetus from Air France's announcement this week that it wanted to sell the Meridien hotel chain as part of a package of economy measures. The airline announced an ambitious strategy to reduce losses and cut costs by about FFr5bn (Dollars 893m) by the end of next year. It named several assets, including the Meridien hotels, in which it holds a 57 per cent stake, as candidates for disposal. Accor stressed yesterday it did not want to buy the Meridien hotel chain. With net debts of about FFr16bn at the end of last year, the company is constrained in making acquisitions. Instead, it envisages a new company pooling the Sofitel and Meridien hotels. According to such a scheme, Air France would receive payment from other investors in the new hotel group. A combination of Meridien and Sofitel would create a chain of about 140 hotels.</p>

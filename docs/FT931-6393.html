			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Gilts sales may force PSBR changes HEAVY purchasing of gilt-edged securities by banks and building societies in January will increase pressure on the government to alter the rules by which it finances the public sector borrowing requirement, Emma Tucker writes. Official money supply figures from the Bank of England show that gilts sales to banks and building societies in January totalled Pounds 2.84bn  - more than three quarters of gilts sales in January. Sales to the non-bank private sector were just under Pounds 500m. The 'full-fund' rule means that the government does not recognise gilts sold to UK banks and building societies as contributing to the funding of the PSBR. This forces it to sell an equivalent amount to the non-bank sector. The banking sector has tended to show little interest in UK government stock. But the sharp fall in inflation and interest rates could increase the attraction of gilts to them.</p>

Ivakhnyuk, O.E. Babkin, and N.F. Fedorov, </F> Saint Petersburg Technology Institute; UDC 661.183]    [Abstract] The process of synthesizing sorbents and  chromatographic carriers based on ultradisperse powders not only  permits wide variation of the pore structure and surface  properties but also makes it possible to create materials with  actively sorbing surface pores. Packing and fixing ultradisperse  particles in the form of granules and/or products makes it  possible to obtain sorbents with uniform pores (i.e., with a  narrow distribution of meso- and macropores). Grafting compounds  with specified chemical properties to the surface of sorbents  with uniform pores is, for example, necessary for immobilizing  enzymes for chromatographic separation. The effectiveness of  this technique may be seen by comparing the characteristics of  starting and hydroxylated mesoporous carbon sorbent based on  commercial-grade carbon. Hydroxyl groups located on the surface  of carbon sorbents may also be used effectively to graft other  functional groups such as amino groups, which may in turn serve  as centers for immobilizing biologically active compounds.  Sorbents based on ultradisperse powders may be produced by 1)  creating primary transport porosity in the molding stage and 2)  using heat treatment to develop meso- and macroporosity with a  narrow distribution of pores from the standpoint of equivalent  radii (with the pore volume and pore radius being determined by  the diameter of the starting ultradisperse particles, molding  pressure, amount of binder, and sintering temperature). Sorbents  synthesized in this manner have a well-developed porosity (0.50  cm[.sup]3[/]/cm[.sup]3[/], no micropores, and a narrow  distribution of pores from the standpoint of equivalent radii.  Additional thermochemical treatment in the form of  high-temperature chlorination (or vapor-gas activation of carbon  sorbents) may then be used to develop the volume of adsorbing  micro- and supermicropores while maintaining transport porosity.  In this way it is possible to synthesize adsorbents with a  bipore structure from ultradisperse powders of materials that  are not themselves active sorbents, such as metal carbides or  metalloids. High-temperature chlorination of carbides or  carbonitrides makes it possible, thanks to layer-by-layer  reaction, to create a porous actively sorbing carbon layer. Such  absorbents have proved to significantly reduce the time required  for chromatographic analysis without in any way diminishing the  separative power under one and the same set of conditions.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P.J. Muller and De Wet Potgieter] </F>   [Text] South Africa's next minister of defense could be an  arch-communist. Rumors are rife that Ronnie Kasrils, chief of  the ANC's [African National Congress] espionage division, is  currently being regarded by the ANC as the number one contender  for the defense portfolio when a cabinet of national unity gets  drawn up after the elections.    Kasrils, member of the South African Communist Party's  Central Committee as well as the ANC's Executive Committee,  played a significant role in the ANC's terror onslaught against  the republic. He also orchestrated the ANC's protest against the  government of the Ciskei, which culminated in a bloodbath at its  capital, Bisho.    RAPPORT has been told that he is currently enjoying more  support in prominent ANC circles than General Bantu Holomisa of  the Transkei, who has for a while been a front runner for this  portfolio. General Holomisa, a confidant of Nelson Mandela, is  believed to be currently regarded as someone with too much of a  political "past." APLA's [Azanian People's Liberation Army]  murder gangs have for the past three years been launching terror  strikes from the Transkei. His support of APLA has gained  General Holomisa personal popularity among certain ANC  supporters, but there is fear that the Defense Force will not  accept his presence as minister.    Kasrils is a member of the Transitional Executive Council's  subcouncil for defense and is being regarded in ANC ranks as one  of the experts in the field of defense. It is believed that he  could make a success of the position and win the support of the  officers.  <H5>  Flattery About Him </H5>   From a survey conducted by RAPPORT in Defense Force circles,  it would seem that he is acceptable to at least some officers.  Senior officers spoke flatteringly about him after last week's  Air Force Day ceremonies. His positive comments about the Air  Force are believed to have assured him a few more friends among  Air Force officers.    But in the Army, from whose ranks the last four Defense  Force  chiefs had been appointed, Kasrils's presence could cause  tensions. The general staff recently warned President F.W. de  Klerk and his cabinet that the majority of officers will perhaps  not support the government in the event of conflict with  right-wing elements in the country.  <H5>  Open Rebellion </H5>   The question is whether the appointment of a communist and  former "enemy" as minister of defense will not perhaps result in  an open rebellion within the Defense Force. Especially if a new  government would decide to disband the local white commandos.  <H5>  Modise Not Named </H5>   It is obvious that Mr. Joe Modise, commander of MK [Umkhonto  we Sizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC Military Wing], has not  been named as a candidate for the defense portflolio. Mr.  Modise is the most senior "military man" in the ANC, but  represents the "Transvaal" element within the organization. For  a long time there has been tension between him and the  Xhosa-speaking sector inside the ANC.    General Gabriel Ramushwana, former military dictator of  Venda, who was recently appointed as commander of the national  peace force now being trained near Bloemfontein, is being  regarded as a logical successor to General Georg Meiring as  chief of the Defense Force. Until last week, he was still on the  ANC list of election candidates.</p>

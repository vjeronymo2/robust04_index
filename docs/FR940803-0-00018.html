A 15 percent ceiling would restrict certain categories of credit and adversely affect the financial condition of a number of federal credit unions. At the same time, prevailing market rates and economic conditions do not justify a rate higher than the current 18 percent ceiling. Accordingly, the Board hereby continues an 18 percent federal credit union loan rate ceiling for the period from September 9, 1994 through March 8, 1996. Loans and line of credit balances existing prior to May 15, 1987, may continue to bear their contractual rate of interest, not to exceed 21 percent. The Board is prepared to reconsider the 18 percent ceiling at any time should changes in economic conditions warrant. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> September 9, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia, 22314&hyph;3428. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Lindsay L.

It also authorized the Board to set a higher limit, after consultation with Congress, the Department of the Treasury, and other federal financial agencies, for a period not to exceed 18 months, if the Board should determine that: (i) money market interest rates have risen over the preceding 6 months: and (ii) prevailing interest rate levels threaten the safety and soundness of individual credit unions as evidenced by adverse trends in growth, liquidity, capital, and earnings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 3, 1980, the Board determined that the foregoing conditions had been met. Accordingly, the Board raised the loan ceiling for 9 months to 21 percent. In the unstable environment of the first half of the 1980s, the Board extended the 21 percent ceiling four times. On March 11, 1987, the Board lowered the loan rate ceiling from 21 percent to 18 percent effective May 15, 1987. This action was taken in an environment of falling market interest rates from 1980 to early 1987. The ceiling has remained at 18 percent to the present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board felt, and continues to feel, that the 18 percent ceiling will fully accommodate an inflow of liquidity into the system, preserve flexibility in the system so that credit unions can react to any adverse economic developments, and will ensure that any increase in the cost of funds would not impinge on earnings of federal credit unions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board would prefer not to set loan interest rate ceilings for federal credit unions. In the final analysis, the market sets the rates. The Board supports free lending markets and the ability of federal credit union boards of directors to establish ban rates that reflect current market conditions and the interests of credit union members. Congress has, however, imposed loan rate ceilings since 1934. In 1979, Congress set the ceiling at 15 percent but authorized the Board to set a ceiling in excess of 15 percent if the Board can justify it. The following analysis justifies a ceiling above 15 percent, but at the same time does not support a ceiling above the current 18 percent. The Board is prepared to reconsider this action at any time should changes in economic conditions warrant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Justification for a Ceiling No Higher Than 18 Percent <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Money Market Interest Rates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Both long and short rates have increased significantly in the last few months. Table 1 gives information on past interest rates. There is a general consensus among economists that money market rates will continue to rise as economic growth accelerates. Implied forward rates, the money market's best guess about where interest rates are going, are significantly higher over the next year. By the time this rule becomes effective, money markets will have experienced 6 months of rising rates. The Board is ready to revisit this issue should this expectation not be confirmed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Liquidity, Capital, Earnings, and Growth and Individual Credit Unions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For at least 1,477 credit unions, market conditions call for rates on unsecured loans to be above 15 percent. For some of these credit unions, three factors combine to require interest rate charges above 15 percent in order to maintain liquidity, capital, earnings, and growth. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

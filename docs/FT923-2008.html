			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Foreign furore downgrades domestic data - Wall Street WHILE Europe has lurched from currency crisis to crisis this week, Wall Street has watched with baffled, and slightly superior, fascination. It has not, of course, been entirely immune to the ructions overseas. New York's currency trading desks have been frantic - especially in the afternoon sessions. 'It's absolutely crazy,' yelled one Merrill Lynch trader on Wednesday afternoon. But, for the most part, Wall Street's interest in the currency mayhem can be summed up in two questions. First, does this mean lower interest rates in key European countries which, in turn, might speed another domestic easing by the Federal Reserve? And will the chaos affect economic growth rates in Europe - which, again, might have a knock-on effect for US manufacturers ? At the beginning of the week, the answers looked simple. The cut in German interest rates was read as unequivocably positive for the US economy. Wall Street traders were already betting on another lowering of domestic interest rates by the Fed, after the latest data on producer prices gave no hint of an inflationary problem. Lower German rates would merely make the Fed's task a little easier. And, reasoned investors, the German interest rate cut might also stimulate European economies, helping the fortunes of US companies with large overseas markets. Share prices duly soared on fairly heavy buying by both institutional customers and private investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day more than 70 points higher. Such euphoria did not last long. By Tuesday, Wall Street had realised that the modest German cuts were unlikely to spur a more widespread reduction in European interest rates, at least in the short term. Disappointed, the Dow gave up almost 50 points. Then, on Wednesday, traders grappled to make sense of the British moves to defend sterling, and currency's subsequent suspension from the exchange rate mechanism. In the confusion, the Dow itself eased only modestly, but many of the American depositary shares of European companies encountered sharper mark-downs. There matters rested for the rest of the week. Faced with all the uncertainties in Europe ahead of the French Maastricht vote, and a 'triple witching' on Friday - when options and futures on stock indices expire on the same day - investors were disinclined to do anything. Given the week's overseas focus, domestic data largely was overlooked. Not that the latest round of economic statistics revealed much that was new. The poor performance of the retail sector during August had already been evident in returns from the major department store chains, and the official 0.5 per cent fall in retail sales last month was merely confirmation. The store chains had been quick to blame the relatively late Labor Day weekend - which, they claimed, delayed some of the back-to-school spending. Still, the overall slip in sales last month is the biggest drop since March. At the very least, it smacks of minimal consumer confidence. Similarly, news of an 0.3 per cent increase in consumer prices in August brought no gasps of alarm. Higher food prices, notably for fruit and vegetables, accounted for part of the rise while the smaller 0.2 per cent increase in the 'core' rate (which excludes food and energy) was unchanged from the previous three months. Finally, on Thursday, the industrial output figures showed a decline of 0.5 per cent in August. That resulted, in part, from the disruption caused by Hurricane Andrew and the labour dispute at one General Motors facility which caused other plants operated by the car manufacturer to shut-down. But the obvious lack of economic momentum was reinforced by a separate Commerce Department report which showed that businesses increased stocks by just 0.1 per cent last month. Normally, a significant rebuilding of stocks, is one of the early signs of economic recovery. Even individual stocks had difficulty in grabbing much of the limelight. Federal Express, the biggest overnight package delivery firm, garnered some attention on Wednesday after revealing a sharp drop in first-quarter profits caused by weak domestic demand and fierce discounting tactics. Its shares slumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 and, by Friday, had slipped to Dollars 36 1/2 . Procter &amp; Gamble, the large consumer goods producer, fared better when it announced that it was pulling out of the 100 per cent fruit juice market by discontinuing or selling brands. P&amp;G shares gained  3/8 to Dollars 48 3/4 . But, for once, Wall Street was almost a backwater. Monday      3376.22 + 70.52 Tuesday     3327.32 - 48.90 Wednesday   3319.21 -  8.11 Thursday    3315.70 -  3.51 Friday      3327.04 + 11.35</p>

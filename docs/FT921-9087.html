			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian jute producer breaks ranks AN INDIAN jute mill operator has broken ranks with the rest of the industry to end a work stoppage; and others are set to follow its lead. Abandoning the long-established tradition of letting the Indian Jute Mills Association negotiate wage agreements on behalf of the industry, Delta Jute and Industries has signed an interim agreement with the trade unions for the reopening of its mill, which produces mainly high value jute items for export. In its eagerness to resume production, Delta has conceded the wage demands of trade unions. As long as the rest of the industry remains strike-bound, the company will have no problem in paying the higher wages as the prices of jute goods have rocketed following the suspension of production by 54 mills in West Bengal 16 days ago. Disturbed by Delta's move, however, Mr Bharat Jalan, chairman of IJMA, has announced that the remaining 27 member mills are now free to conduct negotiation with the unions and arrive at settlements. Emboldened by the Delta initiative, seven other units have already made settlement offers. The consensus in the industry is that Delta will find the interim settlement a big burden whenever the strike in the industry ends. In the traditional jute mill industry, according to Mr Jalan, wages constitute as much as 40 per cent of the total cost of production of jute goods. If the economic demands of the unions were conceded wages would have a share of 55 per cent of production total costs, striking at the industry's viability.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MIM to build zinc smelter in Japan MIM, THE Australian mining and metals group, yesterday said it had completed a joint venture deal to build a Y50bn (Pounds 216m) zinc and lead smelter in Japan with three of its biggest Japanese customers. MIM said it would own 30 per cent of the smelter, to be built at Hachinohe, in the Aomori prefecture. Nippon Mining will own 48.5 per cent, Mitsui Mining and Smelting 18.5 per cent and Mitsubishi Materials 3 per cent. The smelter is MIM's first large investment in East Asia, where it forecasts long-term growth for zinc products. The plant will be operated by Hachinohe Smelting, which is part-owned by Nippon and Mitsui. Mr Norm Fussell, MIM managing director, said the joint venture would strengthen the group's relationship with the three Japanese companies, which are significant purchasers of zinc concentrate from its Australian mines. 'Japan is the region's biggest single zinc market, and other markets can be supplied conveniently from there. Increasing demand for differentiated zinc products can be more effectively met from a plant located close to the customers,' Mr Fussell said. The Hachinohe plant will have an annual production capacity of 120,000 tonnes of zinc and 60,000 tonnes of lead. It will smelt metal for the joint venture partners in proportion to their shareholdings. The plant will use the energy-efficient Imperial Smelting Process, which is capable of treating most feedstocks, including low-grade and bulk concentrates and recycled material. Hachinohe Smelting, which operates a similar smelter on the same site, is regarded as a highly efficient producer. MIM has been discussing the smelter project with the Japanese companies for some time as part of its strategy of focussing on the major zinc consuming regions of North America, Europe and East Asia. Asian demand for zinc has been sluggish in the last year as a result of recessions in the region's export markets in North America and Europe. However, the joint venture partners said they were confident that demand would recover in the medium to long term in response to growth in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and China. They said there were also signs that a shortage of smelting capacity was emerging as production from new mines increased. The smelter is expected to begin production in late 1994. MIM has significant interests in the downstream zinc business in Europe through shareholdings in a number of German companies, including Duisburg, a zinc smelter, and Hutten-werke Tempelhof Verwaltungs, a zinc alloy producer. It also owns 22.5 per cent of Cominco, the Canadian producer, which accounts for 10 per cent of world zinc production, including the huge Red Dog mine in Alaska and the world's largest zinc refinery in British Columbia. In Australia, MIM produces copper, lead, silver and zinc from its Mount Isa and Hilton mines in Queensland. It also operates several coal mines, and has a major interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea. MIM blamed low prices and coal production problems for a 76 per cent fall in interim net operating profits to ADollars 16m in the six months to December. The group says it is on target to achieve a reduction of ADollars 100m a year in operating costs at Mount Isa, where the workforce has been reduced by 700 to 4,360 over the past year.</p>

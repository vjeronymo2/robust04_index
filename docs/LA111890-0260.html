			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC RIM ARTS;  </P> <P> TOKYO POP TURNING JAPANESE;  </P> <P> MADONNA AND M.C. HAMMER STILL RULE, BUT THE YOUNG AND THE HIP ARE LISTENING TO  A NEW JAPANESE ROOTS ROCK, AND ADOPTING THE URGENCY OF RAP MUSIC TO EXPLORE  THEIR COUNTRY'S OWN SOCIAL ILLS  </P> <P> As night falls on this city of 11 million, the electronic billboards flicker  into life, illuminating Day-Glo flying saucers and cups that scroll across  giant screens, advertising a host of Japanese products. It is rush hour, and  the subway disgorges waves of businessmen headed for bouts of ritual-like  drinking.  </P> <P> But the youths milling in front of the Cay Club seem oblivious to their  Blade-Runner-like surroundings. Wearing happi coats, ponytails and leather  sandals, they are too intent on getting through the club doors to see Shang  Shang Typhoon, a band that is igniting a modest cultural revolution here by  mixing a campy, self-consciously Asian singing style with updated folk songs.  </P> <P> "Today in Japan we have many rock and roll, punk, heavy metal and reggae bands,  but this is original Japanese music with a message," says 32-year-old Yoshida  Tabo, voicing an enthusiasm shared by many in the crowd. "I feel their Japanese  spirit. We've been waiting for this music for a long time."  </P> <P> After two generations of copying the Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Rotten  and Guns N' Roses, young Japanese are for the first time delving into their own  cultural roots for popular musical inspiration.  </P> <P> The last year has seen the emergence of a handful of bands that temper rock 'n'  roll with traditional Japanese melodies and instruments such as the  three-string, banjo-like shamisen and the shakuhachi bamboo flute. Some also  resurrect the high-pitched Minyo singing style and Enka, the twangy Japanese  country ballads from Okinawa. The result is a music that is as rootsy to the  Japanese as Little Feat and the Grateful Dead are to Americans.  </P> <P> The Japanese are also putting their own stamp on rap music, that uniquely  American phenomenon of the inner city, using it to explore issues relevant to  their island nation. In Tokyo, such musicians as Tycoon Tosh and MC Kan are  redefining rap, singing in mixed English and Japanese while sampling Japanese  pop songs, Japanese TV jingles and Japanese movie sound tracks.  </P> <P> This rap movement, which Japanese record companies say is growing steadily, is  spearheaded by Major Force, an independent hip-hop label started by five  musicians, including a former Kodo drummer and an ex-punk rocker.  </P> <P> In roots music, the resurgence is led by bands like Tama, Shang Shang Typhoon,  the Bo-Gumbos, Okinawan favorite Shoukichi Kina and Champluse, the Rinken Band  and Qujila.  </P> <P> "I like the sounds of the Japanese language," reflects 33-year-old Yasuo  Sugibayashi, the lead singer and co-founder of Qujila (a play on the Japanese  word for whale), a band that alternates between a swirling, romantic lyricism  and a syncopated beat.  </P> <P> "Many bands sing in Japanese-English," he said, referring to a trend in which  English words are pronounced with Japanese flourishes, "and that doesn't sound  good for me, I want to sing in real Japanese. Maybe the lines of nations will  disappear someday, but language is eternal. I want to preserve our language."  </P> <P> Japanese record executives, who still place the bulk of their promotional yen  behind Japanese power pop and Western-imitation rock bands, have been caught  off-guard.  </P> <P> "Shang Shang Typhoon is taking off so quickly that even their management isn't  sure how to market them," says Bobbie Sato, a marketing coordinator at  Epic/Sony Records. The band, whose two female vocalists wear gauzy veils,  balloon pants and lots of bracelets, dance delicately with fans and bow deeply  to the crowd after each song. Their music blends strains of Okinawan, Chinese  classical, Thai dance and Japanese pop music, to name a few.  </P> <P> An album released in late July, which includes several tracks mixed in Paris by  world music producer Martin Messonier, has already sold 50,000 copies.  </P> <P> While that is a pittance compared to Japanese "idol" stars whose spun-sugar  cute looks and bubble-gum pop records sell millions of copies, Shang Shang  Typhoon's new traditionalism mirrors the change in sensibilities among small  but influential groups of Japanese young people who are rejecting the West and  turning East in their search for cultural identity.  </P> <P> "Western culture has been very strong until now, but it is fading away and we  feel a new energy coming from the East," says Reiko Yukawa, a Japanese rock  journalist and music promoter in Tokyo. "There is a very strong energy from  Asia in these groups. We're not sure what it is but we're like a centipede,  inching toward it."  </P> <P>  Acid House?  </P> <P>  I'm talking about Acid Rain.  </P> <P>  When we built a nuclear power station  </P> <P>  On the earthquake island  </P> <P>  Fact is simple it's so dangerous  </P> <P>  They say it's safe but it's ridiculous  </P> <P>  Even a little child can understand  </P> <P>  It's not only a Japanese problem  </P> <P>  24 hours later it's a worldwide problem.  </P> <P>  -- "China Syndrome"  </P> <P> by Japanese rap artist  </P> <P> Tycoon Tosh  </P> <P> It's Hip Hop night at Gold, a cavernous, three-story club that is the hottest  club in Tokyo this fall, and Major Force mix-master MC Kan is moving smoothly  from the Jungle Brothers to MC Hammer to Intelligent Hoodlum. When he lays on  "The Power" by Snap, the floor goes wild.  </P> <P> Hip Japanese kids have hopped all over hip-hop culture, which they learn about  from music videos and films like "Wild Style" and "Colors." At Yoyogi Park each  Sunday, the enlightened set up shop with a generator, stereo equipment and  their U.S. import records, dancing and scratching to the same sounds you'd hear  at any L.A. club. And soon it won't be make-believe: The Los Angeles-based  hip-hop club United Nations is expected to open a branch in Tokyo this fall.  </P> <P> At Yoyogi Park and Japanese clubs, it's not unusual to see Afrika medallions,  L.A. Raiders caps worn backward, bold striped shirts, overalls with one strap  hanging off the shoulder, dreadlocks and hair carving. For good measure, a  hip-hopper flashes a gang sign at a photographer.  </P> <P> But rap and its concerns seem utterly divorced from its original context in  homogenous, high-tech and low-crime Tokyo. What do the Japanese know about the  bleak reality of America's ghettoes? Or families that sleep in their bathtubs  to avoid stray bullets from feuding gangs? What do they think about the racist  comment made recently by their justice minister, who likened prostitutes to  blacks, saying that both groups ruin a neighborhood when they move in?  </P> <P> "The U.S. says Public Enemy is big so it became big here in Japan," says Isaac  Sakanishi, who produces a music video show for Japanese TV. "But if you ask  Japanese if they understand the lyrics, they don't. The things that Public  Enemy is singing about are so outside their experience."  </P> <P> More progressive labels like Major Force are moving beyond American rap to  forge a uniquely Japanese style. And Major Force rappers are beginning to rap  about Japanese issues.  </P> <P> "Japan as No. 1 GNP is getting higher," sings Tycoon Tosh. "Really means  nothing just rich and poor/ Drink sake after 5 throwing up everywhere / Kam  </P> <P> pai ("here's to") the Big Business."  </P> <P> While these lyrics may never dislodge MC Hammer from the top of the rap charts,  it does show that the Japanese are trying to establish their own identity.  </P> <P> "Five years ago, we were just copying you. Now we're becoming very original,"  says Tosh, whose Major Force logo bears the motto "Strong Force From the  Orient. May the Force Be With You."  </P> <P> Tosh is a one-man music phenomenon. In 1977, he founded the Plastics, one of  Japan's only punk bands ever to find fame abroad. In the late '70s and early  '80s, the quirky Plastics, who he says "mixed punk with Kraftwerk," toured  England and the United States with the Talking Heads and the B-52s. In the mid-  and late '80s, Tosh explored world music, house and dance mixes at his own  Tokyo club, Pithecanthropus erectus.  </P> <P> Today, the Major Force posse includes MC Kan and his crew Tiny Panx ("Punk  Inc."), a female rap duo called the Orchids, Tycoon Tosh and his Terminator  Troops, ragamuffin artist Chappie (who played Harlem's Apollo Theater in New  York last year) and Sexy TKO, billed as "after hours homeboys homegirls  lovemaking sexy music." For the last two years, the posse has headed to the New  Music Seminar in New York to debut its newest sounds.  </P> <P> The Tokyo sound machine has its work cut out for it at home. Tosh says it's  hard to rap in Japanese -- there aren't many rhyming words. And while Major  Force artists have achieved a small cult following among some London DJs, Tosh  says most Japanese kids today still prefer American rap to Tokyo home-grown.  </P> <P> Eventually, predicts one cynical Major Force aficionado, Japanese kids who  follow London and U.S. alternative music scenes almost fanatically will hear  about Major Force artists from the West. At that point, Japanese-generated  hip-hop will find a larger audience at home.  </P> <P> For now though, the Major Force label is saying it loud: I'm Japanese and I'm  proud.  </P> <P> "We gotta have a label that can out-put our contribution toward the new music  movements," Tosh says, "and not simply consume Western in-put."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> "Japanese are treated by their school system and their superiors in the way a  landscape gardener treats a hedge; protruding bits of the personality are  regularly snipped off."  </P> <P>  -- Karel van Wolferen in  </P> <P> "The Enigma of Japanese Power"  </P> <P> Despite its outward social harmony, Japan can be an oppressive and alienating  place for those who don't fit in. Deep undercurrents of anger and frustration  pulse below the surface and explode occasionally. Last month, for instance,  disenfranchised youths and day laborers in a seedy district of Osaka staged  several days of rioting that led to burning, looting, 55 arrests and 186  injuries.  </P> <P> Those who follow youth culture say a backlash is growing against the conformist  Japanese culture and its 15-hour workdays. While it's unclear how large their  ranks are, young people are beginning to drop out of their over-programmed  society, working odd jobs for spare cash, tripling up in tiny apartments and  spending their free time making music and hanging out. The Japanese call them  "freeters."  </P> <P> "Now we have many, many freeters over 25 and 30 years of age," says Yukawa, who  has chronicled the music scene in Japan for more than 30 years. "They don't  want to work hard and join a good company."  </P> <P> While many freeters will probably live out their fantasies for a few years,  then swap their tinted locks and rebel gear for short hair and a business suit,  new ones take their place. The freeter phenomenon fuels the estimated 10,000  bands that play at hundreds of "Live Houses" throughout Tokyo each night.  </P> <P> There is a pervasive sense, when talking to young, self-aware Japanese today,  that they are held in check by society as surely as young Eastern Europeans and  Soviets until recently were denied self-expression by their governments. While  the punk movement certainly isn't new to Japan, the wistful search for identity  has introduced a new dimension, one that roots bands such as Shang Shang  Typhoon may be able to tap into: Despite their embrace of Western trends and  musical styles, freeters seem to be searching for something that Western music  can't provide.  </P> <P> "Japanese young people today have too much cultural information, too much  money," says Sakanishi, who hires freeters as extras for his music videos. "We  have nothing happening here. We're too satisfied. And satisfaction makes people  stupid."  </P> <P> Many creative people believe the antidote lies in rediscovering their Japanese  heritage. "We've got to keep looking for our roots," Tycoon Tosh says. "I think  young bands should be more like Shang Shang Typhoon or Tama. It's better than  copying the Rolling Stones."  </P> <P> Concerned Japanese say it's time for Japan to pay better attention to world  issues. And one topic that resonates loudly in this nation that reveres homes  and items made of wood is the destruction of the Amazon rain forest.  </P> <P> In the song "Greenhouse Effect," Tycoon Tosh examines his culpability as a  Japanese consumer:  </P> <P>  "I went to the noodle shop  </P> <P>  I use disposable chopsticks, stick, tick  </P> <P>  Wondering where it came from  </P> <P>  You know, it came from New Guinea, it came from the Amazon  </P> <P>  Oh no, red zone, the rain forest is dying, crying, cuz somebody's buying  </P> <P>  Economic animal in the rain forest."  </P> <P>  Japan is looking east for its inspiration, to Asia. Japan is tired of copying  the West. One hears that over and over again today when talking to artists,  designers and musicians.  </P> <P> "I'd like to remind people that there is a traditional culture," says Shang  Shang Typhoon guitarist Kohryu, which means "Red Dragon." "We're trying to  raise Japanese consciousness."  </P> <P> Or consider Elephant Kashimashi, whose 22-year-old lead singer wails in an  anguished, post-punk style. Kashimashi writes in a style of poetic, old  Japanese that dates back 400 years and isn't even spoken any longer:  </P> <P>  The wind of this world is so heavy  </P> <P>  But I go on fighting  </P> <P>  The lonely wind of this ephemeral world  </P> <P>  Begins telling on me  </P> <P>  It begins penetrating my skin  </P> <P>  And it's hard for me to look so composed  </P> <P>  But we should be free men. Right?  </P> <P> </P> <P> With Japan's militaristic history, the resurgence of strong cultural awareness  brings up specters of nationalism. When asked about this however, most of the  rap and roots artists working today say their goal is just the opposite: They  want internationalism and a reckoning with Japan's role in World War II.  </P> <P> "In education here, we never teach the kids what we did to other Asian people  during the war, and that's a big problem," says Motoharu Sano, a 33-year-old  rock star with a social conscience whose records sell 300,000 copies each. "If  you pretend not to notice what is happening in the world, there will be new  violence."  </P> <P> Sano, who has written a song for a record he hopes to make with Sean and Yoko  Ono next year called "Asian Flowers," alludes to his conflicting feelings about  Japan's aggressive military actions during World War II in a song called  "Shame":  </P> <P>  "Coercion  </P> <P>  Plunder  </P> <P>  Ouster  </P> <P>  Malice  </P> <P>  Domination  </P> <P>  It's a shame  </P> <P>  It is wrong  </P> <P>  Or it's not wrong  </P> <P>  Don't wanna hurt anybody  </P> <P>  Don't wanna be hurt by anybody."  </P> <P>  The 10-year musical evolution of the band Qujila also mirrors this  soul-searching. A decade ago, the band played Western-style rock. Then they  moved to acoustic and Japanese folk music. Later they got into funk and reggae.  Now their music is a pastiche of them all.  </P> <P> "We had been suffering a lack of identity in our music so we started playing  old Japanese-style folk songs and pre-World War II Japanese popular songs,"  says Qujila bassist Kioto Tanahashi, 33. "It was exotic for us. We called it  'rehabilly' music."  </P> <P> Qujila guitarist and lead singer Sugibayashi says their inspiration came from  childhood lullabies and Japanese mythology.  </P> <P> "I want to see spirits in our city," he says. "I want to use TV and video to  create a new folklore. Old but new spirits live in our cities and our TVs and  of course in our music."  </P> <P> Sugibayashi sits, with almost preternatural calm, sipping green tea in a  recording studio. He wears a purple and black striped shirt, baggy red pants  that tie at the ankles and shamrock green topsiders. Shyly, he smiles.  </P> <P> "When we were younger, we wanted to be like Americans and we fought against our  spiritual heritage," Sugibayashi says. "At that time, it was a big deal to take  a trip to a foreign country. Now it's very easy to take a trip abroad but it's  much more difficult to take a spiritual trip, a trip inside.  </P> <P> "We've been given many presents from Western culture," he says quietly. "Now  it's our turn to give something back."  </P></p>

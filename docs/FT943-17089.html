			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Donor nations pledge Dollars 6bn aid to India India's donor countries yesterday pledged Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) for the financial year 1994-95 to meet India's 'continued need of high-quality, long-term development assistance' for projects in areas such as education, family planning, nutrition, rural works, and control of endemic diseases. However, donors and financial institutions meeting in Paris at the annual two-day India Development Forum, chaired by the World Bank, urged India to strengthen its fiscal discipline, without which they fear the country would not be able to reap the full benefits of reform. Echoing the concerns of other donors, Mr Joseph Wood, vice-president (Asia) of the World Bank, who presided over the meeting, warned that the 'sharp deterioration of India's fiscal performance in 1993-94 threatens the future stability of the economy, reduces fiscal flexibility, and undermines the credibility of the overall structural reform programme.' The aid package is lower than last year's figure of Dollars 7.4bn and Dollars 7.2bn in 1992-93, though pledges of concessional aid (comprising grants and interest-free loans) are up to 43 per cent from 28 per cent last year. The Indian government has not sought a fast-disbursing assistance component this year because of its improved balance of payments position. The decision is in line with India's new strategy of becoming a 'discerning and discriminating borrower of quality assistance to maximise soft loans,' according to an official. 'India has made a conscious decision to restrict commercial borrowing and to concentrate on project disbursement and improving portfolio management,' said Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, finance secretary, and head of the Indian delegation. Japan continues to be India's largest bilateral donor, with a commitment of Dollars 1.2bn this year, its largest ever to India. Bilateral sources accounted for Dollars 2.4bn this year, as against last year's Dollars 3.2bn. The Japanese package covers 12 projects in sectors such as power, environment, and road building. The World Bank continues to be the largest source of multilateral pledges, accounting for Dollars 3.5bn of the total of Dollars 3.6bn. The International Development Association, the soft-lending arm of the World Bank, will today pledge Dollars 3.5bn worth of assistance for development projects.</p>

In the declaration approved at the meeting, participants  demand expanding the jurisdiction of local government and a new  territorial-administrative arrangement in Slovakia.  Representatives of the Hungarian minority are asking for either  one territorial-administrative unit stretching from Bratislava  to Kosice or three separate units. Either variant would give  ethnic Hungarians a significant majority in those regions.    Meeting participants also demanded that the rights of the  Hungarian minority be anchored in the Slovak Constitution,  stating that they consider the use of Hungarian as an official  language everywhere that Hungarians make up at least one-tenth  of the population to be vital for the development of the  Hungarian community.    A 1991 census in Slovakia found that more than 600,000  Hungarians -- 11.5 percent of the population -- live in  Slovakia. They are represented in 522 towns and villages.  Almost 98 percent of all ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia live in  the region along Slovakia's southern border, where they make up  close to 70 percent of the population.</p>

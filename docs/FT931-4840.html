			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reduced call charges trim Italcable to L130bn ITALCABLE, the Italian state-controlled international telecommunications utility, reported a slight fall in net profits to L130.3bn (Dollars 82.7m) last year from L132.7bn in 1991. The decrease, which comes in spite of a 16.6 per cent surge in turnover to almost L790bn, stems largely from the progressive reductions in Italy's very high charges for international telephone traffic. The price cuts stimulated a 26.3 per cent rise in international telephone traffic last year, in spite of the recession. The company, which said it was satisfied with the results, particularly in view of the higher financial charges it had faced in 1992, will pay an unchanged dividend of L230 for ordinary shares and L250 a share for savings stock. Italcable said the volume of directly-dialled international calls had risen 56 per cent last year due to of improved marketing, improved quality and tariff cuts. The increase in data transmissions had been held to 13 per cent by growing competition under liberalisation laws, and the company planned substantial tariff cuts.</p>

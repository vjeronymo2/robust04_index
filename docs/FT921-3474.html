			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar up but sterling totters THE DOLLAR pushed upwards after surprisingly strong US retail sales figures yesterday afternoon, but climbed less quickly than analysts had expected, writes Neil Buckley. Sterling, meanwhile, had a very shaky day as political nervousness gripped the markets. It was down more than a pfennig against the D-Mark and a cent against the dollar, with the sterling index sliding from 90.3 to 89.7. The dollar climbed more than 1 1/2 pfennigs in late European trade after US retail sales figures for February rose by 1.3 per cent, compared with the 0.7 per cent expected. This was from a January base that was revised upwards to a 2.1 per cent increase, rather than the 0.6 per cent first reported. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said: 'The strength of the figures suggests the dollar will rise even further. I am surprised the immediate reaction was not stronger.' A 20,000 rise in the US weekly jobless claims to 459,000 was largely ignored by the market, as the dollar advanced to DM1.6735 from a DM1.6655/65 start. It also appreciated to Y134.20 from Y133.55. Dealers said a big sell order sitting at DM1.6740 may have slowed the US currency's rise, with a few speculators, including a major Middle East operator, deciding to take profits. But most felt the dollar was still firmly on an upward trend, and would soon breach the DM1.68 and Y135 barriers. In late Asian trading it had remained strong, and broke the Y134 barrier for the first time in six months. It finished at Y134.00 and DM1.6690. Dealers said the market was trading on sentiment, and ignoring the rather haphazard attempts at intervention by the Bank of Japan the day before. Attempts by Mr Yasushi Mieno, BoJ governor, to dampen speculation about an imminent Japanese interest rate cut, by saying the bank's monetary policy remained unchanged, had little effect. In the EMS, both sterling and the peseta moved downwards against the D-Mark, with disappointing Spanish inflation figures ruling out a Bank of Spain rate reduction. The pound dropped more than a pfennig to DM2.8578/85, against DM2.8715/20 on Wednesday. As it was close to its effective floor against the top-placed peseta, it tended to drag the Spanish currency down with it. It briefly dropped below its floor following the London close. Sterling weakened against the dollar to Dollars 1.7104, from Dollars 1.7240 on Wednesday. In New York it ended a little better at Dollars 1.7130. Mr Lyons commented: 'The combination of a poorly received Budget and electoral uncertainty has produced a very weak sterling. 'It looks vulnerable, and in the next few weeks it will be driven not by economic factors but by the opinion polls.' Dealers warned that good showings by the Labour party in this weekend's opinion polls could see the Bank of England having to underpin sterling.</p>

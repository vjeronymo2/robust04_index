			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Jessups warns of loss and replaces director Jessups, the Essex-based motor dealer, said yesterday that it expected to report a loss for the 16 months to December 31 and also announced a board restructuring under which the managing director has been replaced. The shares fell 20p to 96p. The results, expected to be released on March 9, will show that trading in the motor dealerships in the last four months of 1993 was significantly below target and although vehicle leasing operations performed well, an overall loss resulted. The disappointing showing has led to a board restructuring under which Mr Ron Joseph has been replaced as managing director by Mr Stan Thompson, managing director of the vehicle leasing operations. In addition Mr Ian Harris, who joined the group recently from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, has been appointed finance director. Mr John Ganney will remain on the board and will continue as company secretary. In the 12 months to August 31 Jessups increased pre-tax profits to Pounds 707,000 (Pounds 506,000). The company said yesterday that trading so far in the current year had been promising.</p>

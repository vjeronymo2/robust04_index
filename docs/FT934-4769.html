			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Difficult education issue side-stepped Sir, Your report on the expansion of student numbers in UK higher education does not provide an accurate account of its funding implications for the universities ('Student population reaches 1m', November 23). There is no sense in which the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals regards the current level of higher education funding as 'adequate'. There has been a severe squeeze in the unit of funding over the past few years, with increased resources falling far short of the rapid growth in student numbers. Among the most obvious consequences of this squeeze are a marked decline in the relative pay position of academic staff, a serious maintenance backlog and a general decline in the quality of the student experience. The fall in the unit of funding continues with the announcement on Tuesday that further annual 'efficiency gains' of 4 per cent will be imposed in the next two financial years. Constraints on public expenditure have also resulted in the government's decision to cap the student intake at present levels for a three year period. However, on the basis of international comparisons, there is certainly no reason for complacency about current levels of participation in UK higher education. Without further sustained expansion, the aspirations of many potential students, including those coming up through the still-expanding further education sector, are unlikely to be met. Increasing participation in higher education from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the 18-19 age group would require additional funds in excess of Pounds 1bn a year. Further resources would also be needed to compensate for years of under-investment. In present circumstances, funding at these levels might well require a direct contribution from the beneficiaries of higher education towards the cost of their tuition. The CVCP regrets that the government has stepped away from this difficult issue in its Budget announcement and appears to be content to rest on what has been achieved so far.

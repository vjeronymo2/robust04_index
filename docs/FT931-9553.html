			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / South African pact may lead to power-sharing A LANDMARK agreement in South Africa which could lead to a power-sharing government of national unity has been reached between Pretoria and the African National Congress. The outline pact on the country's constitutional future - concluded after protracted talks - allows multi-party constitutional talks to resume within a fortnight after a nine-month hiatus. The agreement follows the ANC's decision late last year to postpone pushing for majority rule in favour of power-sharing. It represents the most important step in the country's peace process since the release of Mr Nelson Mandela in 1990 and the all-white referendum last year which endorsed President F W de Klerk's negotiating strategy. At the end of this month, groups from across the political spectrum will meet to try to establish a new multi-party negotiating forum to replace the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) which collapsed in acrimony last May. The ANC and the government will go to these talks with a joint stand on crucial constitutional issues, including agreement that a power-sharing 'government of national unity' should rule South Africa for five years after the first multi-racial elections, due to be held next April. However, many hurdles need to be overcome before this agreement can be implemented: the ANC's negotiating team must get the endorsement of the organisation's policy-making national executive committee; government negotiators must get approval from the cabinet; and, even more critically, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and other political groups from right and left must approve the deal, or be overruled with a risk of violence. The government and Inkatha will meet for three days of bilateral negotiations next week. Agreement between the ANC and the ruling National party, the two main political groupings, is the first step to a solution. Negotiators from both sides stressed that, though details had not been agreed on many crucial matters, the main stumbling blocks to formal agreement had been removed during a three-day meeting which ended yesterday in Cape Town. The two sides reached broad agreement on devolution of power to regional governments (though detailed agreement may yet prove difficult), and agreed that consensus in detail should be reached on this issue before a constituent assembly is elected - a key National party demand. The National party also agreed to be flexible on the issue of power-sharing under a permanent constitution. Yesterday's deal involves a five-year 'sunset clause' during which white and black will share power in a multi-party cabinet.</p>

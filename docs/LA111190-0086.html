			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SMART SQUAD;  </P> <P> LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN; THE DUTY OF GENIUS BY RAY MONK (THE FREE PRESS, A DIVISION  OF MACMILLAN: $29.95; 654 PP.)  </P> <P> The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein may be the most famous obscure intellectual  of the century. It's hard to imagine a more unwilling celebrity than this  profoundly serious man who shunned publicity and devoted his life to the  pursuit of clarity. Since his death in 1951, however, he has emerged as one of  the best known and least comprehended contemporary thinkers.  </P> <P> He's the "Mad Genius" as sent by Central (European) Casting, the savior of  British philosophy or its trivializer. He is passionate, tormented,  misunderstood, a man so singular that virtually everyone who ever knew him,  from Bertrand Russell to the man who delivered peat to his cottage in Ireland,  remembered and wrote about him. He reminded one student of "the Norse God  Baldur, blue-eyed and fair-haired, with a beauty that had nothing sensual about  it." Others were less enthusiastic. One young boy told his diary: "Witkinstein  (sic) is an impossible person everytime you say anything he says 'No No that's  not the point.' "  </P> <P> He was equally hard on himself, a master of self-laceration who often  contemplated suicide. Though baptized a Catholic, he was of Jewish descent, a  heritage he sometimes blamed for his moral and mental inadequacies in language  reminiscent of "Mein Kampf." (Curiously, Hitler and Wittgenstein attended the  same school for a year; there's no evidence that they met.)  </P> <P> Though he wrote constantly, he revised constantly too; most of his work has  been posthumously published, and generates hundreds of scholarly books and  articles each year. A recent bibliography lists nearly 6,000 items.  </P> <P> Outside the academy, Wittgenstein is a cultural presence to many who know him  only as a name, or the inspiration for a sizable body of music, art and  writing. His words have been rendered in dance and neon; there's even a poem  about his lecturing style. He's a character in several novels and is mentioned  in plays, on public television and by Woody Allen.  </P> <P> For those who want to learn more about his fascinating figure, Ray Monk's  thoughtful and accessible biography, intended for the general reader,  encompasses the life and work in a single narrative, illuminating the values  implicit in both.  </P> <P> The book's subtitle, "The Duty of Genius," is taken from Otto Weininger's "Sex  and Character," which Monk believes is the source of many of Wittgenstein's  attitudes toward life and love. Weininger, a misogynist and anti-Semite,  believed it was man's duty to conquer the flesh and to discover and realize his  genius -- or to kill himself. A Jew and a homosexual, Weininger shot himself at  23, in the house where Beethoven, his hero, died. Suicide greatly increased  both Weininger's moral prestige and the sales of his book, which Wittgenstein  read as an adolescent.  </P> <P> Though Monk's is not the authorized biography, he enjoyed the complete  cooperation of Wittgenstein's literary executors, who permitted him to quote  from previously unpublished material, including diary entries written by  Wittgenstein in code about his homosexuality, which has been the subject of an  unseemly, irresistible debate. Much of Monk's research will be new to even avid  readers of Wittgensteiniana; those unacquainted with Wittgenstein's philosophy  will find Monk's explanations helpful and unforbidding, if not exactly a piece  of Sacher torte.  </P> <P>  Wittgenstein was born in Vienna in 1889, the eighth child of an extremely  rich, cultivated and ill-fated family. His father was a steel magnate on the  order of Andrew Carnegie, his mother a musically gifted patron of the arts.  Three of the brothers committed suicide; the fourth, Paul, continued his career  as a concert pianist despite the loss of an arm in World War I.  </P> <P> The world is fin de siecle Vienna, the city Karl Kraus called "the research  laboratory for world destruction"; the birthplace of Nazism and Zionism; the  Vienna of Sigmund Freud, Arnold Shoenberg and Adolph Loos. Like these  contemporaries, Wittgenstein broke away from the historical outlook in his  field: His linguistic analysis is a radical departure in philosophy, analogous  to psychoanalysis in psychiatry, atonality in music and functionalism in  design.  </P> <P> Wittgenstein's originality seemed especially pronounced in the alien culture of  England, where he spent much of his working life. He went to Manchester as a  young man to study engineering, then took up aeronautics and, finally,  mathematical logic at Cambridge with Bertrand Russell, who introduced him to G.  E. Moore, John Maynard Keynes and other Apostles of Bloomsbury.  </P> <P> At the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein enlisted in the Austrian  artillery, hoping to die or to change his life. He fought on the Russian front,  was decorated for bravery and taken prisoner in Italy. When he was captured, he  had with him the manuscript of the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," the only  one of his books published in his lifetime, a work as magisterial as its title  suggests, and best understood (if at all) in the context of Wittgenstein's war  experience. Here Monk's approach is particularly apt, revealing, as  Wittgenstein insisted, that "the point of the book is ethical."  </P> <P> So was the point of Wittgenstein's life, which shows the strong ethical views  that the "Tractatus" says cannot be spoken of, only made manifest. He sought a  life of Christian virtue as conceived by Tolstoy, and seems to have taken the  ideals of poverty, chastity and duty more seriously than his mentor. He  relinquished his fortune to his sisters and brother and lived very simply, in  barely furnished rooms, once telling a friend: "I don't care what I eat as long  as it's the same thing every day." Since sex and love were incompatible, he was  tortured by sexual guilt over even fantasized transgressions.  </P> <P> He grew to see philosophy as his duty, and devoted his life to it after he  returned to England in 1929 and began the work which culminated in the  "Philosophical Investigations," the most polished and influential of the later  books.  </P> <P> Here Wittgenstein rejects the classical view of philosophy as the attempt to  answer ultimate questions. Philosophical problems, he writes, are not about  matters of ultimate (or any kind of) fact; they arise from linguistic  misunderstandings, from mistakes in logical grammar. The job of the  philosopher, as he sees it, is to "command a clear view of the use of our  words." Philosophy is not a theory, but an activity, "a battle against the  bewitchment of our intelligence by language."  </P> <P> Consider a question like "What is time?" Because it is similar in form to "What  is dew?," it misleads us into looking for something we can point to or  describe, as we would the dew. Thus the endless philosophical theories about  the nature of time. The Wittgensteinian philosopher resists the "craving of  generality." Instead of theorizing about time, he minutely examines how the  word is used (how we teach it to children, for example), and is no longer  puzzled. He can teach it, he can measure it, he can be on it. The meaning of  time is not some mysterious metaphysical something, it is, roughly, its use in  the language.  </P> <P> Philosophy is a therapeutic enterprise, Wittgenstein believed, a set of related  techniques for dispelling linguistic confusions. This approach seemed  exhilarating and effective to many philosophers; others, including Bertrand  Russell, condemned it as a cop-out, a refusal to think seriously.  </P> <P> The controversy persists. In "The Legacy of Wittgenstein," Anthony Kenny  suggests that "Wittgensteinian philosophy as opposed to Wittgensteinian  scholarship has not made progress, and some of the philosophical gains we owe  to (him) seem in danger of being lost."  </P> <P> During his lifetime, Wittgenstein was a cult figure in philosophy. In his  lectures, he struggled visibly with his thoughts, which often were expressed in  imaginative questions and aphorisms. His gestures and intonations were  distinctive and much imitated; he feared, perhaps rightly, that his influence  was destructive to his students. To him, the profession of philosophy was "a  living death," but all he was fit for; he urged his students to take up  something useful, like medicine or manual labor, especially if they were  serious philosophers. (He himself worked as a gardener in a monastery, and as a  hospital orderly in London during World War II.) Philosophy was worthless  unless it helped you to live a morally better life.  </P> <P> Wittgenstein did not permit "tourists" at his lectures, and the chances are,  that's you. Monk is considerably more hospitable, yet travelers should expect a  fairly rigorous journey. Nevertheless, the book is engrossing, especially if  read in conjunction with Wittgenstein himself. In Monk's comprehensive account,  certain features of Wittgenstein's thought seem remarkably current. He is  deeply suspicious of science and scientism, more interested in differences than  in similarities, against abstraction and for contextual interpretation. And  always, spirit prevails.  </P> <P> So what if he's tough. There are worse ways to spend the fin de siecle.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MYSTERY FLIGHT'S PILOT SAYS HE CAN'T REMEMBER GUNSHOT TO ABDOMEN  </P> <P> Lawyer Thomas Root told federal investigators Saturday that he had no idea how  he suffered the bullet wound to his abdomen that doctors discovered after he  was pulled from the Atlantic Ocean at the conclusion of a mysterious six-hour  airborne odyssey.  </P> <P> Root suggested to investigators that he may have suffered from oxygen  deprivation, causing him to lose consciousness during the flight, National  Transportation Safety Board official Andrew Alston told reporters after his  40-minute interview with Root at the Hollywood, Fla., hospital where Root is  recuperating.  </P> <P> But Alston said "inconsistencies" between Root's statements and other available  evidence must be resolved before the agency can determine what occurred during  the attorney's bizarre 800-mile plane trip, which began Thursday morning in  Washington and ended when his Cessna 210 Citation crashed about 14 miles off  the Bahamian island of Eleuthera.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Large Inconsistency'  </P> <P> "We have no reason to disbelieve him at this point," Alston said. "We have some  questions. . . . He doesn't remember a gunshot wound and we see one. That is a  large inconsistency that we hope to resolve."  </P> <P> An FBI agent separately interviewed Root on Saturday at the hospital, where he  is in intensive care and listed in stable condition.  </P> <P> While no new evidence emerged to explain Root's shooting, documents drawn from  official files of the Federal Communications Commission are shedding additional  light on Root's troubled business affairs and those of the Georgia company with  which he has been closely associated, Sonrise Management Services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judge Fears 'Sham'  </P> <P> Applications for FM radio station licenses that were organized by Sonrise "bear  all the indicia of the classic 'sham,' " one FCC law judge wrote in an official  order filed earlier this year. The activities of Sonrise "could turn out to be  a scam on innocent investors," Judge Walter C. Miller wrote.  </P> <P> Root represented the applications before the commission and drew criticism for  missing deadlines and appointments in pursuing them.  </P> <P> The company is being investigated by regulatory officials in North Carolina and  has attracted attention in several other Southeastern states. In addition,  several federal regulatory agencies are examining both Sonrise's operations and  Root's legal practice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Draws Comment  </P> <P> Sonrise's recruitment of radio station investors was widely commented upon  within the tightly knit community of lawyers here who handle license  applications before the FCC, but they were unknown to the general public until  after Root's dramatic plane flight raised questions about a possible suicide  attempt.  </P> <P> Root took off from Washington early Thursday en route to a legal proceeding in  Rocky Mount, N.C. Shortly before arriving there he told air controllers that he  was having trouble breathing, his plane veered off course and began heading  south down the Atlantic Coast. About six hours and 800 miles after his takeoff,  the plane ran out of gas and crashed into the water, at which point Root,  wounded but alive, swam away.  </P> <P> "He's a very lucky guy," his attending surgeon, Dr. Robert Cohen, told the  Miami Herald. "I don't know if he wanted to be lucky. We'll find out sooner or  later."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suicide Attempt Denied  </P> <P> Finding out, however, could be difficult. Root's family members, who have been  visiting him in Hollywood Memorial Hospital, deny police suggestions that the  gunshot wound he suffered two inches above his navel was self-inflicted.  </P> <P> Root told investigators Saturday that he kept a loaded .32-caliber Smith &amp;  Wesson revolver in the glove compartment of his Cessna 210. Family members have  speculated that the gun could have gone off when the plane hit the ocean, but  police say that powder burns on Root's skin indicate that the gun was fired at  close range.  </P> <P> Both the plane and the gun are now at the bottom of the ocean, several thousand  feet down, and officials have no plans to try to raise them. And the NTSB's  Alston said doctors would be unlikely to be able to tell exactly when Root had  been shot, noting that the application of a pressure bandage on the wound  immediately after Root was pulled from the water would make such a  determination difficult.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blood Test Awaited  </P> <P> The safety board does expect blood test results on Monday that may shed light  on Root's suggestion that he suffered oxygen deprivation or the early theory by  some investigators that he had blacked out from carbon monoxide inhalation.  Oxygen deprivation would be unusual at the altitude Root was flying -- 10,000  feet -- investigators said.  </P> <P> Root's mysterious trip has focused attention on his business ventures with  Sonrise, which has organized at least 163 partnerships to apply for licenses to  operate small FM stations across the country, including 16 in California.  </P> <P> Typically, according to a sworn declaration submitted to the FCC earlier this  year by the firm's chairman, Ralph M. Savage, Sonrise would collect about  $90,000 from the investors, with $11,000 of it going to license application  fees and engineers. Sonrise and its salesmen would keep about $47,000 while  Root would take $32,000 for legal fees, Savage wrote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Stations Operating  </P> <P> Sonrise and Root together would have taken in roughly $13 million over the last  two years from investors, according to those figures. None of the investors  have yet won permission to operate an FM station, according to FCC files.  </P> <P> Commission lawyers have questioned whether the partnerships organized by  Sonrise and represented by Root were independent or actually controlled and  directed by Sonrise. Commission rules forbid any single owner from controlling  more than 14 FM stations. In depositions given during commission proceedings  and in interviews with The Times, several investors in Sonrise projects  appeared to have only a passing familiarity with the projects they were  applying for.  </P> <P> Root has repeatedly been chastised by FCC officials for procedural failures. A  year and a half ago, a lawyer opposing Root in a case filed affidavits charging  him with having falsified a document submitted to the agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drug Trade Reports  </P> <P> Separately, several news organizations have reported that federal officials are  investigating whether Root may have been involved in the drug trade, although  little evidence of that has surfaced.  </P> <P> Root's brother, Todd Root of Burlingame, Calif., on Saturday strongly denied an  ABC News report that the Customs Service had placed Root's plane on a  drug-related watch list after it made several trips to the Caribbean. His  brother, Todd Root told reporters, had no involvement in drug trafficking and  had never flown the plane outside the United States.  </P></p>

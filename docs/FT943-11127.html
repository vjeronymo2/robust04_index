			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: Mercedes plans development centre for emission-free trucks - Studies suggest demand for non-polluting vans Mercedes-Benz is to set up a development centre for emission-free commercial vehicles at its Mannheim plant next year. Studies suggested that west European demand for non-polluting vans and other vehicles would be strong enough to justify industrial-scale production by the end of the century, the company said yesterday. Its new urban distribution vehicles, the T1N and TO, were suitable for a direct entry into this new market, it said. They could first be fitted with electric motors and with other emission-free motors when the technology had been perfected. The announcement followed confirmation last week that Mercedes is to take over the bus-making activities of the private Kassbohrer group on undisclosed terms. The centre would ensure the future of the Mannheim plant, Mercedes said at the end of negotiations with employees concerned that the Kassbohrer deal would lead to heavy job losses. No details were available yesterday of any payroll cuts but restructuring of Mercedes' loss-making bus operations is certain to follow the takeover. The company recently announced plans to spin off its European bus divisions next January into a separate company including German operations, currently focused on Mannheim, and at a separate company in Turkey. Kassbohrer's factories in Ulm, Neu-Ulm and Ligny, France, will be rolled into the new operation, provisionally named Eurobus. Mercedes said it expected a marked reduction in development and testing costs, economies from the use of higher volumes of common components and increased capacity utilisation. Analysts said the deal would improve Mercedes' presence in the touring bus market - Kassbohrer's main business - and markets such as Denmark, Spain and Austria. While the takeover settles a long turbulent debate over the future of Kassbohrer, it marks a decisive step in the overdue restructuring of the German bus industry. Sales in Germany are expected to fall 10 per cent to 15 per cent this year, while the total west European market has been stagnant with about 20,000 new registrations annually for the past 10 years. According to Mercedes, its Mannheim works made 3,200 complete buses and 560 chassis last year, turning over DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) with a workforce of 5,400 people. In the Turkish operation, where 2,000 employees built 1,200 units, sales reached DM350m. The Kassbohrer factories turned out 2,300 buses with sales of more than DM1bn.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Tough Yeltsin line on Kuriles PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has told Japanese hosts of next month's Group of Seven summit not to expect any concessions on the four Kurile Islands they want back from Russia. In comments which are likely to be seen by Tokyo as insulting, he said on Saturday he felt 'a certain discomfort' as there would be a meeting with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, and the question of the islands would come up. 'I will not be able to tell him anything new.' Mr Yeltsin, who is expected to discuss aid for Russian economic reforms with G7 leaders in Tokyo, is also likely to touch on bilateral issues in talks with Mr Miyazawa. The trip next month follows the last-minute cancellation of a bilateral visit last autumn and confusing signals about whether he planned a separate visit after the summit. It has also emerged that the shadowy security council, which last year took the decision to cancel the presidential visit to Tokyo, is to be headed by Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, previously head of the Commonwealth of Independent States' unified command. The council is a committee of senior officials that deals with foreign and some domestic affairs, in addition to security. Mr Yeltsin said he had appointed the marshal without consulting other commonwealth states because their plans to set up their own armies meant the unified command no longer had 'much weight'. The marshal was chosen for his military background and because Mr Yeltsin had 'absolute faith' in him, unlike his predecessor, Mr Yuri Skokov, sacked for disloyalty. Dealing with diplomacy closer to home, Mr Yeltsin said he would meet Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on Thursday to discuss problems of fuel supplies to Ukraine and the row over the Black Sea Fleet. 'We had to turn the tap off (energy supplies), then immediately there was this fuss over the Black Sea Fleet,' he said. Moscow could not go on 'giving away energy' to Ukrainian enterprises which were not paying their bills.</p>

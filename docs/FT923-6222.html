			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Bosnia to present plan for autonomy and ethnic rights THE Bosnian government will today present a set of proposals to the London conference aimed at restoring the republic's civil and democratic structures. The plan, unveiled yesterday by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, will be based on a decentralised and secular system, and would grant the three ethnic communities a wide degree of autonomy and ethnic rights. But Mr Silajdzic said his government would not accept any system which would turn Bosnia into ethnically pure cantons. The plan entails establishing at least four regions in Bosnia, with administrative centres in Sarajevo, the capital; Mostar in western Hercegovina (western Bosnia); Banja Luka in the north; and Tuzla in the east. These would be based on full equality of 'citizens and ethnic communities', he said. However, before any such proposals are negotiated, Mr Silajdzic insisted that the fighting and the ethnic cleansing must stop. Failure to end the aggression and ethnic violence in Bosnia will radicalise the political situation throughout Europe, he warned. He also warned that if the international community would 'not offer protection to communities facing genocide, Bosnia should be exempted from the United Nations arms embargo.' 'No one has the right not to intervene to stop aggression, genocide and ethnic cleansing and at the same time deny weapons,' he said. 'We ask for air cover to protect civilians and weapons to defend ourselves on the ground.' Mr Silajdzic's call for the international community either to help Bosnia protect and rebuild its shattered multi-ethnic communities, or to allow it to defend itself, was rejected by Mr Milan Panic, prime minister of the unrecognised rump Yugoslav republic of Serbia and Montenegro. Mr Panic said he condemned nationalist 'madness' and 'ethnic cleansing' and would put forward five 'practical and realisable first steps' to prevent ethnic conflict spreading from Bosnia to Kosovo and other parts of the Balkan peninsula. These included guarantees of safe delivery of relief supplies to Sarajevo, a pledge to stop 'ethnic cleansing', and Red Cross supervision of prison camps.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: UK retailing operation proves to be an uphill struggle for Kingfisher The high street proved to be an uphill struggle for Kingfisher last year, as it revealed lower than expected profits from most of its UK retail divisions in its results yesterday. The most severe difficulties were encountered at Woolworths, which recently saw the departure of its managing director. 'The simple fact is that after a very good first half in toys, Woolworths overbought,' said Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman. The division was forced to cut prices substantially to get rid of stock. Woolworths was further hit by an unexpected collapse in the video consoles and games market, which forced a profits warning from both Kingfisher and its rival, Dixons, earlier this year. Although he would not quantify the extent of the damage inflicted by these events, Sir Geoffrey said it was substantially greater than the Pounds 3.3m decline in profits to Pounds 74.5m. Sales were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 1.3bn. Sir Geoffrey stressed that other lines that Woolworths offered were up to expectations. 'Excluding toys and games, gross profit rose by 10 per cent in the second half,' he said. Superdrug also had a difficult year, with operating profit falling by 9.5 per cent to Pounds 31.5m. However, sales were 5 per cent up at Pounds 617m, with a 2.5 per cent increase in comparable turnover. Sir Geoffrey attributed the profits decline to disruption caused by a shift in focus. In future the division would concentrate on personal care products, moving away from household and grocery ranges. B&amp;Q, the Do-It-Yourself retailer, did better, with profits rising from Pounds 81.1m to Pounds 82m, on sales 10 per cent higher at Pounds 1.15bn. Like-for-like sales were 4 per cent ahead. Sir Geoffrey said the improvement at B&amp;Q proved Kingfisher's strategy of every day low prices was working. Darty, the French electricals retailer acquired last year for Pounds 1bn, had proved resilient in a difficult market, Sir Geoffrey said. Sales for the relevant eight months were down by 2.7 per cent to Pounds 694m, and operating profits 6 per cent lower at Pounds 79.2m. However, the sales performance compared well with the overall decline of 4.3 per cent in the French electricals market, Sir Geoffrey said. Comet's profits fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 16.4m on sales 6 per cent higher at Pounds 526m. A sharp fall in sales in the second half held back the like-for-like advance to 0.7 per cent.</p>

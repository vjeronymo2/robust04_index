			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  failed on Thursday [23 June] to resolve his differences with  Social Democratic Party (SDP) chief Tomiichi Murayama on the  course of the SDP's return to the governing coalition.    Hata repeated his stance in a meeting with Murayama, who  asked him to clarify his earlier remarks indicating the  possibility of disbanding his cabinet so as to lure the SDP back  into the fold, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told  reporters.    Saying Japan needs a powerful government to tackle difficult  problems such as tax and political reforms, Hata reportedly told  Murayama he will entrust the issue of his resignation to the  ongoing talks between the coalition and the SDP.    These talks "have yet to be completed and will be resumed at  11 A.M. [0200 GMT] Tomorrow," Murayama told a separate news  conference.    Murayama declined comment on Hata's suggestion of his  resignation, the key condition for the SDP's return, saying the  talks are still in process.    The SDP chief said the result of negotiations on the SDP's  possible return to power should be known "in a day or two," as  the current Diet session ends next Wednesday and the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) filed a no-confidence  motion against the Hata cabinet.    During the meeting with Murayama at his official residence,  Hata urged the SDP, the main bloc in the government of former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, to rejoin the ruling alliance,  Murayama said.    The SDP walked out of the coalition in late April in protest  at the formation by other major coalition partners of a new  parliamentary group excluding the SDP, forcing Hata to form  Japan's first minority government in 39 years.    The SDP chairman said Hata pressed a demand for the  clarification of the reason for the SDP's withdrawal from the  coalition.    Murayama told Hata the SDP did not leave the coalition in  April because of differences in policies but because of "other  problems," alluding to the formation of a large parliamentary  group excluding the SDP, according to Kumagai.    But Hata and Murayama agreed to watch the progress of the  talks between the coalition parties and the SDP, Murayama and  Kumagai said.    The ruling coalition and the SDP are currently holding talks  toward reaching a policy agreement in forming a new government.  The main point of contention is tax system reform, on which the  two sides are still far apart.    The SDP is opposed to a hike in the current 3 percent  consumption tax in return for large-scale income and residential  tax cuts in 1995 and beyond.    The government is scheduled to chart a final course for a  comprehensive tax system reform by the end of June and act on  necessary legislation by the year's end.    At a press conference shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget  cleared the Diet and the LDP filed a no-confidence motion  against the Hata cabinet, Hata indicated the possibility of  stepping down with his entire cabinet.    Hata told Murayama that the coalition parties have overcome  many difficulties since first coming to power last August and  that he wants to maintain the framework of the coalition,  Kumagai said.    The chief cabinet secretary said Hata and Murayama did not  discuss whether they would meet again. They also did not discuss  a cabinet resignation en masse or how to deal with the  no-confidence motion, Kumagai said.    Meanwhile, the House of Representatives Diet Steering  Committee failed to set a timetable for the lower house to hold  a plenary session to vote on the no-confidence motion.    The LDP, toppled from government last summer for the first  time in 38 years, claimed Hata's minority administration does  not reflect people's views. The LDP demanded the lower chamber  take a floor vote on the no-confidence motion Friday but the  coalition opposed it.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather news lightens gloom on US farms FOR THE first time in weeks meteorologists have good news for American farmers in the drought-stricken south-east and flooded midwest. Sunday brought a healthy rain to the south-east crops and forecasters at the US Department of Agriculture predict the next ten days will bring normal to above normal rainfall. In early trading yesterday soyabean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade sank about 15 cents a bushel to Dollars 7.11. Mr David Asbridge, an analyst with the American Soyabean Association, said he did not expect prices to fall as much as the 30 cents limit, which would shut off trading for the day. Dr Norton Strommen, a USDA meteorologist, said that the rains in the south-east should slow the crop deterioration that had been brought on by unseasonably high temperatures that began in June. Farmers may not be out of the woods yet because long-range forecasts are indicating higher than normal temperatures and lower than normal levels of precipitation. 'I don't see any signs of permanent relief from the drought,' Mr Strommen said. In the midwest rain will not stop entirely, but it should return to levels normal for this time of year. With nearly 16,000 square miles of the best farmland in the US under water and flooding likely to continue even if the rain does let up, the USDA is looking primarily to non-flooded regions where rains slowed or prevented planting and more rain now would damage the crops already in the ground. The rain has been particularly damaging in Iowa, the largest maize-producing state in the nation; Kansas, the biggest producer of wheat; Nebraska; southern Minnesota and western Illinois. In early July USDA lowered estimates of maize and soyabean production to capture losses due to crop abandonment and planting problems, but there is little concern about commodity shortages because of large stocks on hand at the beginning of the harvest and good crops elsewhere in the country. Some agricultural regions, such as the eastern corn (maize) belt, have actually benefited from the rainfall. About 78 per cent of Indian's maize crop and 76 per cent of Ohio's are considered to be in 'good to excellent condition'. Maize is also flourishing in eastern Illinois. The drought in the south-east may affect cotton production, analysts say, but the USDA has not formally lowered crop estimates. The crop was expected to be the biggest since 1937, because of the larger amount of planted acreage reported on June 30, and production was expected to top 17m bales.</p>

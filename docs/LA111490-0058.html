			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 104;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS;  </P> <P> POLITICAL FRONT:  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) called on President Bush to convene a  special session of Congress to seek a "put-up-or-shut-up" vote on possible  military action against Iraq. He was joined by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.),  who said Bush has set America on a "collision course" that will end either with  Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait or with warfare.  </P> <P> The White House rejected the request for a special session, noting that "there  is no war" and therefore no need for a congressional vote.  </P> <P> California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and 21 other House Democrats  said they will file a lawsuit in federal court next week in an effort to keep  the President from launching a military offensive without congressional  approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Military Front:  </P> <P> The Pentagon confirmed that U.S. Marines will conduct their first amphibious  assault exercise in Saudi Arabia this weekend, about 30 miles from the Kuwait  border.  </P> <P> The ceiling for naval reservists called to active duty was raised to 10,000  from 6,300. Pentagon officials indicated that similar increases are likely for  the other military services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Reserve Mobilization:  </P> <P> * Army reserves called up 24,524  </P> <P> * Navy reserves called up 4,616  </P> <P> * Air Force reserves called up 5,278  </P> <P> * Coast Guard reserves called up 511  </P> <P> * Marine reserves called up 1,144  </P> <P> * Total mobilized so far 36,073  </P> <P> * Total authorized 53,750  </P></p>

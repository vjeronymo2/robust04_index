			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Gold returns to earth with a bump THE GOLD market came down to earth with a resounding bump late this week after the speculative balloon that had hoisted the price of the yellow metal to a post-Gulf War high was punctured by reports of Chinese central bank selling. The bulls were still feeding off the foreign exchange turmoil caused by the crisis threatening the European Community's exchange rate mechanism as they pushed the gold price, which had risen by Dollars 15.25 last week, up another Dollars 4 to Dollars 409.75 a troy ounce on Monday morning. The market's buoyancy quickly began to fail however, in that rarified atmosphere and by the end of the day the price was back to Dollars 403.25 an ounce. Subsequent attempts to reinflate the bullish mood failed in the face of lack of support from the New York investment funds and the emphasis switched to consolidation of the earlier break through the Dollars 400-an-ounce barrier. Even that limited ambition had to be abandoned on Thursday, however, when the reported bank of China sale of 193,000 ounces of gold gave the signal for a general sell-off, with Arab and Swiss syndicates in the forefront. Retreat turned into rout as speculators piled on the selling pressure and the London price closed at Dollars 388.25 an ounce, down Dollars 13.25 on the day. The fall continued in after-hours trading, taking the price to Dollars 372, and traders were beginning to consider the technical consequences of a breach of the Dollars 360 support level. Such fears proved misplaced, or perhaps only premature, and by yesterday's morning fixing at the London bullion price had steadied to Dollars 381.90 an ounce. But renewed selling took the price to Dollars 376.50 an ounce at the close and the mood remained nervous as traders looked over their shoulders at the heavy investment fund long positions that were still overhanging the market. Analysts were not unanimously gloomy, however. Some suggested Thursday's fall was no more than a healthy correction after a speedy price rise. If gold could climb back to Dollars 395, the bull market would remain intact, they added. Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles Lambert, said: 'Gold had an Dollars 85 move upwards so a Dollars 25 correction is nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.' If the price held above Dollars 380 for another 24 hours, she suggested, 'the funds will be more likely to take it up than down'. The platinum market had maintained its steady appearance, helped by news that labour talks at South Africa's Impala mine were going to to mediation, until it was sucked into the abyss left by gold's plunge. Thursday's Dollars 17.25 fall wiped out the earlier Dollars 5.40 advance and yesterday's afternoon fix of Dollars 387.75 an ounce was Dollars 25.85 down from a week earlier. Silver also suffered, the London spot price ending at 457.50 cents an ounce, down 80 cents on the week. In strong contrast to the precious metals, the London Commodity Exchange coffee market took on an altogether more healthy complexion this week. Rises in the preceding fortnight had been based largely on growing belief in the Latin American producers' ability to make their scheme to retain 20 per cent of scheduled exports bear fruit in the form of an improved supply/demand balance. That factor continued to underpin sentiment this week, but the main reason for a much more constructive performance was a growing fear of significant frost damage being buffered by coffee crops in the south of Brazil, the biggest producer. After traders heard on Wednesday that a powerful polar air mass was moving towards the coffee growing states of Parana and Sao Paulo the September delivery futures price climbed to a 2 1/2 -year high of Dollars 1,138 a tonne. And technical factors took over the next day, pushing the price to Dollars 1,180 a tonne at one stage. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, a London trading house, explained that the earlier rise had pushed a growing number of options 'into the money' forcing granters to make covering futures purchases at an accelerating rate. In so doing they were, of course, lifting the price still further and obliging themselves to take still more cover. That vicious circle appeared to have been broken yesterday, however, when the price backtracked by Dollars 43 to Dollars 1,114 a tonne, up Dollars 76 on the week. But traders thought further heavy retrenchment was unlikely in view of the continuing risk of frost in Brazil. At the London Metal Exchange technical factors were dominant, with the threat of a supply squeeze still gripping the copper market and a 'chart breakdown' driving zinc prices to six-year lows. The tightness for late September delivery copper showed no sign of easing, despite warnings by the exchange management last week that it was prepared to take action to frustrate suspected manipulation, and the premium against three months metal widened to Dollars 28 a tonne. Meanwhile the three months zinc price plunged yesterday to Dollars 896.50 a tonne, down Dollars 42 on the day and Dollars 44.75 on the week, as yesterday's chart breakdown triggered heavy stop-loss selling and kept buyers at bay. Lead had been the strongest LME contract until it was undermined by the slump in zinc. Three months metal climbed to Dollars 420 a tonne, encouraged by Far East buying interest, before ending at Dollars 409.25 a tonne, up Dollars 4.50.  ------------------------------------------------------ LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------------------ Aluminium          +11,050    to    1,972,500 Copper              +6,275    to      470,600 Lead                +2,150    to      275,700 Nickel                +708    to      102,504 Zinc                +4,250    to      720,900 Tin                   +445    to       21,350  ------------------------------------------------------</p>

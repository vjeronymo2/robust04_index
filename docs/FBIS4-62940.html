			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Yezhov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- "I think we will succeed in  talking our Western partner into granting Russia special status  if it joins the NATO program "Partnership for Peace", Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev told ITAR-TASS after today's  Cabinet meeting.    The Russian defence minister is to fly to Brussels soon to  take part in the NATO Council session.    Grachev said his ministry has prepared specific proposals,  which have been agreed with the Russian Foreign Ministry and  will be handed over to the Russian president for approval today.  If NATO shows interest in the position of Russia, the Russian  defence minister is prepared to formally present its proposals  to the members of the North Atlantic Alliance.    Grachev stressed however that the main objective of his trip  to Brussels was not to discuss Partnership for Peace but to  address the NATO military ministers and other invited defence  ministers from European and some Commonwealth countries and  explain Russia's defence doctrine, including the use of nuclear  arms.</p>

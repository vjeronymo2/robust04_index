			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 27 Apr (MENA)--A responsible source at the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] Information Center has stated that  at 1100 today the 1st Armored Division led by Colonel 'Ali  Muhsin al-Ahmar, stepbrother of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, backed by other brigades brought in from Sanaa, launched  an offensive.    The Yemeni source said that these forces launched a  large-scale offensive with various types of weapons against the  2nd Armored Brigade, deployed in 'Imran, which receives its  orders from the defense minister. The source added that pitched  battles involving the use of heavy weapons are still raging this  afternoon.    The source said that the aggression against the southern  brigade took place directly after President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  delivered a speech in al-Sab'ayn Square in Sanaa today to mark  the 27 April occasion. In his speech, he called for removing  the YSP from power. The source noted that the military  escalation of the situation on this large a scale throughout  Yemen will block the success of the mediation efforts being made  to resolve the crisis peacefully. The YSP holds President Salih  personally, and members of his family who occupy important posts  in the military establishment, as the source put it, responsible  for the grave consequences that may result from this offensive.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: If the shoe fits. . . - Fiction EMILY'S SHOES by Dermot Bolger Viking Pounds 14.99, 266 pages THE LAST MAGICIAN by Janette Turner Hospital Virago Pounds 14.99, 352 pages A FOOL'S ALPHABET by Sebastian Faulks Hutchinson Pounds 13.99, 275 pages UNLIKE more aggressive nutters, the shoe fetishist seems a harmless, easy-going fellow. Michael, the narrator of Emily's Shoes, simply lifts the odd high-heeled pair from shop or jumble sale, takes it home and, as it were, broods over it. Though he sometimes wears women's shoes, he is cagey about it, and ashamed. This obsession goes back to the days when, as a 10-year-old, he loses his mother and is taken in by glamorous Aunt Emily who, like everyone else he loves, forsakes him. Shoes, though it is never spelled out, become all he can cope with, man-made, external, replaceable. They won't die like his parents, or go mad like his childhood sweetheart, or vanish into sex and marriage like Aunt Emily. Michael's adult loneliness in a socially-awkward Dublin of oddities and fakes, supposed miracles, pubs, churches, office blocks and slums, becomes so intense that nothing can pierce it. The story of his botched life is gloomy but aesthetically ebullient because the writing is so strong, so exact, so much the right colour for each moment and episode. The refusal to mourn, to acknowledge pain, to face the past, to release spiritual poisons, has built up a throbbing pus of such horror that only the banal prayer ('Jesus of every pair of women's shoes') seems possible. Anguish, unacknowledged but retrospectively felt, has to be dealt with before a cure of sorts seems possible through dreams and memories. In this way, Michael at last undergoes a sort of self-analysis. The writing is triumphantly successful - bare, passionate, almost understating the almost unstateable. Janette Turner Hospital's The Last Magician has a complicated story spanning about three decades. In its early stages, it tosses names and memories about which only later acquire the necessary weight of feeling, but at the time leave the reader irritatingly in the dark. Yet from the first sentence, which echoes Dante, it has enormous energy and power, both seemingly haphazard at the start, then gradually concentrating on the central event which shapes the lives of everyone involved in the story. This is the accidental death of a beautiful, loveable, mentally-retarded child. In spite of their wild grief and sense of guilt, all the adolescents who saw it can be called in some way responsible, and all are pursued through life by the other's 'great beating wings' of action, despair and memory. This enormously ambitious book invokes not just Dante in its structure (the inferno of subterranean Brisbane, all drugs, brothels and mayhem), but literary figures in the writing itself, Shakespeare, Coleridge, Eliot, Hopkins and others, often half-buried or echoed in a phrase rather than quoted. It seems a pity that some of the main figures from the shared Australian childhood should have become, as adults, famous globe-trotters in television and photography. In the early unfocused parts of the novel, that sort of fame and life-style suggests something pop and bogus. But when real characters emerge, this spurious air vanishes and with less curlicued techniques (you have to work hard to reach them) the novel has enormous punch and visual richness and becomes impressive. Incidents are made into heightened moments of everyday reality. Everyone's appearance becomes intensely memorable. Australia shimmers in a sort of exotic ordinariness. Love and loyalty, strained and sometimes broken, become the measure of everything human, and the mundane, without pretentiousness, is given a new dimension. Extreme and extraordinary, the novel more or less carries off its imagery and justifies its metaphors. Sebastian Faulks' A Fool's Alphabet is, by comparison, tame and bland. It is also pleasant, literate and a good read, a conventionally-told tale in an unconventional narrative form. Calvino (say) might have made much of the device; but an unusual format doesn't in itself produce unusual writing. Twenty-six chapters, labelled from A to Z, are each set in the appropriately-initialled place across half a century: A for Anzio, where the hero, Pietro's father, lands with the Allies from North Africa in 1943 and meets his Italian wife; Z for Zanica, the Italian village where Pietro is conceived; in between, 24 other places around the world. The jerky variety of place and time makes for an unmonotonous but, alas, unmemorable series of vignettes: snapshots from the family album rather than the cumulative reality of a novel.</p>

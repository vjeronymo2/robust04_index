			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER POLLUTION BILL OKD BY PANEL  </P> <P> Legislation that would establish mandatory fines for coastal polluters cleared  an Assembly committee Tuesday after the author made drastic last-minute changes  to appease Los Angeles legislators on the panel.  </P> <P> The Assembly Ways and Means Committee passed by a 13-6 vote a measure by Sen.  Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) that would require local water quality control  boards to impose fines on water polluters.  </P> <P> The bill would mandate fines of at least $100 a day for the duration of a  "harmful" spill and would require boards to publicly justify their actions if  lower fines are levied. Spills resulting from unavoidable circumstances such as  natural disasters would not be subject to fines.  </P> <P> Current law sets only maximum fines against polluters.  </P> <P> "This bill is the result of my frustration with the regional water quality  control boards not being tough enough, or not being tough at all. No penalties  are being imposed at all in certain instances," said Hart.  </P> <P> Hart said after the hearing that he reluctantly eliminated a controversial  provision that would have mandated a minimum fine against polluters of $1 per  gallon of spilled material. He said he made the change to win the votes of Los  Angeles and San Diego Democrats who had been heavily lobbied to defeat the  measure.  </P> <P> "The gallonage (issue) was made very significant due to the heavy lobbying  effort by the sanitation districts," Hart said. "It is now less than half a  loaf, unfortunately, because we were forced to reduce whatever deterrent we had  by more than half."  </P> <P> Sanitation groups, including the Los Angeles County sanitation bureau, and  state oil industry lobbyists had strongly protested the per-gallon fine. They  said such a penalty could potentially result in fines of hundreds of millions  of dollars for spills that often are mostly water.  </P> <P> "Recently one of our large agencies had an 8-million-gallon spill with little  adverse impact," said Mike Dillon of the California Assn. of Sanitary Agencies.  "If this bill had been in effect, the fine would have been $8 million."  </P> <P> Several opponents contended that the present system of cleanups and fines works  well and -- as one said -- "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." But Hart replied,  "If you take a look at Santa Monica Bay and some of the problems we've had with  sewage and pollution, you can see it is broke. We need to send a clear and  strong message to the agencies that are involved in polluting."  </P> <P> The bill now goes to the Assembly floor.  </P></p>

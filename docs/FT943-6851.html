			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Hambro C'wide surprises with loss Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency and financial services chain, surprised the stock market yesterday with the announcement of an interim loss, in spite of increasing house sales and an improved market share. The share price fell 5 1/2 p to 49p, as Hambro revealed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 707,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with a Pounds 13.4m profit. Brokers had expected a profit of Pounds 3m. The figures were depressed by a Pounds 1.8m provision against unrealised losses from its gilt portfolio, reflecting the falling bond market. This compared with a Pounds 1.2m profit from these investments last time. Increased turnover of Pounds 49.2m (Pounds 48.8m) reflected improved house sales. However, the key figure was an unexpected rise in losses from its estate agency division to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 1.73m). Mr Colin Finch, deputy chairman, said: 'Its not surprising in a market which has failed to sustain any recovery in activity.' The estate agencies sold 23,341 houses during the period, and increased market share, against an estimated decline in the market of about 3 per cent. However, staff numbers increased from 2,487 to 2,539, and after three years of freezes, the staff finally achieved a pay increase. The average house price increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 64,700, but increased revenue did not keep track with costs. Life assurance activity declined from Pounds 5.34m to Pounds 1.66m. This reflected the bond losses, and a change in accounting policy, whereby some Pounds 2.75m of additional commission was paid by the life division to the financial products division. Financial Products produced a profit of Pounds 1.06m, compared with a Pounds 1.53m loss, but overall the insurance product division reflected the lack of activity in the estate agencies that sell its products. Losses per share of 0.21p compared with a profit of 3.86p. There is no interim dividend (0.5p). COMMENT The operational gearing of Hambro was demonstrated yesterday, when lower than expected housing sales led brokers to slash profits forecasts from Pounds 10m to Pounds 4m. Few dare pin any forecasts to next year. The agency business needs to sell 50,000 houses a year to break-even, but will be hard pushed to clear 47,000 this year. Once it has overcome that barrier, profits will take off, and the shares are on a p/e of 58, reflecting that possibility. But with management admitting that prospects are extremely uncertain, the shares should only be for the speculator.</p>

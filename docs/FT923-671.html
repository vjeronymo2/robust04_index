			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Economic recovery in US falters: Figures show broad weakness A CROP of economic reports yesterday made grim reading for the Bush administration. Orders for durable goods, personal incomes and home sales all fell last month, underlying the fragility of the sluggish US economic recovery. New orders for durable goods fell 0.1 per cent following a 2.7 per cent decline in July, the Commerce Department said. The weakness was broadly based, with declines in primary metals, industrial machinery and electronics. The overall drop would have been larger but for a 4.2 per cent increase in the volatile transport sector. New orders for non-defence capital goods - regarded as a reliable guide to trends in private investment - fell 3.7 per cent, after a decline of 5.4 per cent in July. Personal income fell 0.5 per cent last month but the figures were heavily distorted by Hurricane Andrew, which reduced rental incomes, damaged crops and cut wages. But for hurricane damage, personal income would have risen by 0.7 per cent last month, officials claimed. Personal consumption spending fell 0.1 per cent last month, before allowing for inflation, underlying the weakness of consumer morale. The housing market also remains sluggish. Sales of existing (as opposed to new) homes fell 3.2 per cent last month, despite a decline in mortgage rates to the lowest levels for 20 years. Analysts remain apprehensive about the outlook for housing despite a report this week of a freakish 10 per cent rise in housing starts last month. Long-term interest rates have begun to rise again in recent weeks, forcing up the cost of mortgages. The Senate yesterday rejected President Bush's plan to allow Americans to direct that 10 per cent of their taxes be used for deficit reduction, AP reports from Washington. Opponents said it could shut down the federal government. The Senate defeated the proposal, advanced by Mr Bush at the Republican convention last month, by 58 to 36. 'This is the magic potion that will destroy the federal government' by requiring a new series of virtually across-the-board spending cuts every year, said Sen Robert C. Byrd. He called the plan 'another brain-dead easy fix that eviscerates our future'. The chief sponsor, Sen Bob Smith, said if all taxpayers accepted Mr Bush's challenge the Dollars 333bn deficit would be eliminated and the budget balanced within five years.</p>

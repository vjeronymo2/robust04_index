			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (12): Tempting carrot for invaders - The Japanese 'spend' on components in Europe will be Pounds 3bn by 2000 MAZDA, Japan's fourth largest car maker, is preparing to announce before the end of this year precisely how and where it will begin car manufacturing in Europe. It will be the seventh - and probably the last - Japanese vehicle maker to do so, joining Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Suzuki and Isuzu. The combined production volumes involved represent important business to those European component makers who have already secured contracts or are competing for the newer projects. Toyota is to start production of Carina saloons at its Pounds 700m Burnaston plant in the UK in December, with engines supplied from a Pounds 140m manufacturing facility in Deeside, north Wales. Burnaston is due to produce 200,000 cars a year by the mid-1990s. By then, EC content should be more than 80 per cent, compared with 60 per cent next year. Many industry observers, pointing to a precedent being set by Nissan, expect Toyota's output to be nearer 400,000 by the end of the decade; Nissan, whose plant at Sunderland is preparing to build a new version of its Micra small car as well as the Primera range, this year unexpectedly announced an expansion of its 220,000 capacity to 300,000 from next year. It has already hinted that output will be 400,000 a year by the end of the decade. Significant developments are also afoot at Nissan Motor Iberica, Nissan's Spanish manufacturing centre, where a new 'multi-passenger vehicle' (MPV), the Serena, is starting production alongside Nissan's Patrol four-wheel-drive vehicle. Yet another 4wd leisure vehicle, developed jointly with Ford, is also to be produced at the plant. By late autumn, Honda's plant at Swindon, Wiltshire, will have gone on stream alongside its engine plant which already produces more than 100,000 engines a year. Swindon is to produce the Synchro medium saloon at an initial rate of 50,000 a year, to be joined by the successor to the smaller Concerto from 1995. Motor industry analyst Professor Garel Rhys, of Cardiff Business School, believes that Honda will be producing double its declared target of 100,000 cars a year by well before the end of the decade. Mitsubishi Motors, Japan's third biggest producer, has created a joint venture with the Dutch government and Sweden's Volvo to produce 200,000 cars a year in the Netherlands by the late 1990s. Suzuki's European manufacturing operations are in Spain, where it builds more than 20,000 SJ and Vitara 4wd leisure vehicles a year. However, it is also setting up a joint venture plant to build its Swift range of small cars in Hungary, with the long-term goal of 100,000 units a year. Not least, IBC Vehicles, a UK-based joint venture between Isuzu and General Motors, is producing light commercial vehicles and the Frontera, a leisure 4wd, with a capacity of 100,000 vehicles a year. Nissan's expansion in the UK will lead to component purchases from European suppliers jumping from Pounds 600m last year to Pounds 850m in 1993, according to Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK). Of this, some Pounds 655m will be spent with 122 UK component suppliers or UK subsidiaries of foreign-owned groups, including a handful of Japanese joint venture concerns. However, that leaves nearly Pounds 200m worth of business being placed directly with Continental suppliers. Suppliers from 11 countries have contracts with the Toyota manufacturing operation, which embraces nearly 170 component makers - whittled down from an original list of 1,850 applicants. More than half of them are based in the UK. Toyota's declared annual spending with European suppliers will be Pounds 700m in full production - but, like Nissan, is likely to move nearer the Pounds 1bn mark on a 400,000 production level. Honda has appointed 136 European and two US suppliers for its Pounds 300m Swindon plant. The 89 UK-based suppliers include most of the industry's biggest names, including BBA's Automotive Products division supplying clutch assemblies and Lucas Automotive parts ranging from brake systems to wiring harnesses. Honda has indicated that spending with European suppliers will be Pounds 500m annually at the 100,000 cars-a-year level, but has also indicated an eventual increase to Pounds 600m-Pounds 800m a year. When all Continent manufacturing activities are included, it is likely that the Japanese component 'spend' in Europe by the end of the decade will be approaching Pounds 3bn. Surely a large enough carrot to entice Japanese component suppliers in waves? Nevertheless, Mr Yukihisa Hirano, Toyota managing director, has explicitly rejected the notion that, over the long term, Japanese component companies will move in to take more of the business, declaring that 'Toyota has never asked any Japanese companies to set up in Europe'. Indeed, according to a study of the European components industry by the Economist Intelligence Unit published earlier this year, Japan's car makers are specifically discouraging Japanese suppliers setting up shop 'as a matter of policy'. In opting for European suppliers, Japan's car makers have no intention of settling for second best and have already proved relentless in their pursuit of cost-cutting. Nevertheless, the symbiotic manner in which, so far at least, they are conducting it with their European suppliers is earning them growing, if sometimes grudging, respect and sympathy within the components industry. Indeed, some component group chiefs have begun to imply that indigenous European car makers could do well to follow the Japanese approach more closely. Senior industry figures like Valeo's chairman, Mr Noel Goutard, and Robert Bosch chief executive Mr Marcus Bierich, are among those protesting that too many European car makers are paying ready lip service to the concept of partnership between themselves and their suppliers, but in practice still placing an excessive financial squeeze on their suppliers. This contrasts with the undisguised enthusiasm some groups are displaying towards the development of their Japanese 'transplant'-based business, and the knock-on effect it is having in terms of improved productivity and quality throughout their other business activities. For example, the Unipart Group of Companies (UGC), the former components and accessories division of the UK's Rover Group, is moving rapidly towards the wholesale adoption of Japanese working practices and attitudes across all divisions of the 4,000-employee company. UGC increased its profits last year in the teeth of one of the most severe UK recessions in history, and chief executive Mr John Neill depicts his Japanese customer as tough but fair on pricing.</p>

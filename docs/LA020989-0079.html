			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE PURSUES PLAN TO BUILD CAMPUS IN JAPAN  </P> <P> Pepperdine University is still pursuing a controversial plan to build a campus  in Japan and expects to sign a contract to build the new college by the end of  next month.  </P> <P> University officials, who were approached by members of a Japanese education  task force more than a year ago, are scheduled to travel to the Orient next  month to complete negotiations to build a small campus in Kumagaya, a Tokyo  suburb. If the contract is signed in March, the campus could be ready to open  as early as the fall of next year.  </P> <P> Although early plans called for the Malibu-based university to build a  $60-million campus in Japan, university Provost William Adrian said the  proposal has been scaled down to $35 million. Adrian said financing continues  to be the biggest stumbling block, adding that the university is trying to get  Japanese investors to bankroll the entire project.  </P> <P> If the deal is completed, Pepperdine would become the first university in the  United States to own and operate a campus in Japan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Optimistic on Outcome  </P> <P> "I'm optimistic that we're going to work it out, but until we sign on the  bottom line, there's always a possibility things could change," Adrian said.  "The group we're working with has indicated a great desire to have a university  in Japan."  </P> <P> The proposal is part of a Japanese program to open up cultural and education  centers for American and Japanese students. The education task force was  established in 1987 by the Japanese government as part of a program to attract  U.S. capital and ease trade friction between the two nations.  </P> <P> However, the program has received much criticism by officials from other U.S.  universities that have been courted by the Japanese. Richard Lariviere,  director of the Center for Asian Studies at the University of Texas, Austin,  said earlier that although the Japanese contingent offered "lots of  enticements," his school rejected the offer because financing was questionable  and the proposal did not have the support of the Japanese Ministry of  Education.  </P> <P> The Japanese education task force has also contacted officials at the  University of Missouri, Southern Illinois University, Boston University and  Bryn Mawr College. Pepperdine is the only school to express strong interest in  the program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officials Tight-Lipped  </P> <P> Pepperdine was chosen because one of the task force members, Keiko Hirabayashi,  attended the university several years ago and recommended it.  </P> <P> University officials have remained tight-lipped about negotiations. One  Pepperdine administrator said that a story in The Times about the proposal last  year nearly caused the Japanese to back out of the deal. He said that, among  other things, the land set aside for the campus went up in price immediately  after the story appeared.  </P> <P> Pepperdine President David Davenport declined a request to be interviewed about  the negotiations.  </P> <P> Financing for the campus would be handled in part by Sumitomo Bank and by  private investors. Pepperdine officials hope the Japanese government will  contribute funding for the campus.  </P> <P> Adrian said plans for the campus include classroom facilities, a dormitory, a  cafeteria, a conference center and recreational facilities. "It won't be a  full-blown college campus," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sophomore Year  </P> <P> Adrian said the university had received assurances from the Japanese Ministry  of Education that the school would be accredited to offer degrees. However, he  said, the university initially would offer only certificate programs for  Japanese students.  </P> <P> Like the university's overseas programs in London and Florence, Italy,  Pepperdine students would be able to attend the Japan campus during their  sophomore year. It would be open to Japanese and Pepperdine students, and  classes will be taught in English.  </P> <P> In an interview last year, Davenport said the school would accommodate between  200 and 500 students.  </P></p>

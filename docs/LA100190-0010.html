			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> The Good, the Bad and the Tuneful: Clint Eastwood is making a record.  </P> <P> The actor sings with Randy Travis on the country star's upcoming album of  duets, which also features Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Conway Twitty, Roy  Rogers, Loretta Lynn, B. B. King, George Jones, Kris Kristofferson, Tammy  Wynette and Merle Haggard. Travis says he has always been an Eastwood fan and  that Clint once suggested they sing together if the right song ever came along.  "We found 'Smokin' the Hive,' " Travis said. "I thought, 'Yeah, that's the  one,' 'cause we wanted something kind of comical." BETH KLEID  </P></p>

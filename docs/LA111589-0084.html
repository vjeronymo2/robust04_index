			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> MIAMI'S LONE BLACK COMMISSIONER WINS  </P> <P> The lone elected black on Miami's City Commission won overwhelming support from  black voters and defeated his Cuban-born challenger in runoff elections. With  all 86 precincts reporting, Miller Dawkins, 64, a two-term incumbent, had  18,245 votes, or 52.7%, to 16,402 votes, or 47.3%, for Joe Carollo. Totals from  ethnic-dominated precincts in this racially tense city showed Dawkins, an  administrator at Miami-Dade Community College, carrying nearly 99% of the black  vote and 75% of the Anglo vote. Carollo carried the Latino vote with 78%.  Dawkins had said he did not believe his was "the black seat" on the commission  but he also said the city's blacks -- who make up about 30% of the voters --  deserved representation on the body. Carollo, 34, a former commissioner, ran  Spanish-language ads saying that "all the Cubans vote for Carollo."  </P></p>

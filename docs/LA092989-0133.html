			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SINGLE LIFE: RUNNING A DATE PAST THE DEPENDENTS GETS TRICKY  </P> <P> You've recently met someone whose company you enjoy; the two of you seem  compatible. You want to include him in all aspects of your life, including your  family life. You would like to meet his kids and vice versa but wonder if the  time is right. How do you decide -- and how do you handle the questions that  children often ask about your single life?  </P> <P> For many singles, it can be tricky to balance parent, child and the person they  are dating.  </P> <P> Ed Reder, founder and president of a county singles club, does not always feel  comfortable introducing his 15-year-old daughter to his dates.  </P> <P> "I think it can scare off not only my date but my daughter," he says. "If a  woman and I hit it off, there will be opportunities later on for  introductions."  </P> <P> As for casual introductions, "if I go to pick up a date and she introduces me  to her child, that's fine, but if she is too eager to involve her kids in our  activities right away, I feel uncomfortable."  </P> <P> Linda Carty, who sells real estate investments and lives in Rancho Santa  Margarita with her 9-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter, has been divorced  nearly three years. At first she was apprehensive about introducing dates to  her children.  </P> <P> "I was uncomfortable because the kids were," she says. "But now, if I know a  lot about the man, I'll introduce them. But when it comes to including him in  our social activities, I wait until I know him a lot better."  </P> <P> James Taylor, 32, is an Irvine-based salesman, divorced six years. During his  three years in the county, he has introduced his 11-year-old son to very few of  his dates.  </P> <P> "I have been seeing someone special for about six months, but until I knew how  we felt about each other, I didn't involve my son in our relationship," he  says.  </P> <P> He believes that it is vital to know how the other person views certain things  before involving the children: "I have to know how this person feels about many  different issues: children, divorce, remarriage. I have to know about her  character before I involve my son."  </P> <P> Linda Morvant, 35, who lives in Laguna Hills with her 10-year-old son and  7-year-old daughter, has been separated for three years. "I haven't been ready  for a big-time relationship," she says, "so most everyone I've dated I've  approached as friendships."  </P> <P> Her son is very receptive to her dating. "His father is contemplating  remarriage, so he wants me to have someone too. He's always got ideas about who  would be good for Mom," she says, laughing.  </P> <P> John Flannery, 34, owns a printing company and lives in Laguna Niguel, where he  spends nearly every weekend with his 4-year-old son. "He meets nearly every  woman I date," Flannery says. "He enjoys their company, and they enjoy him.  It's healthy. Most of them have kids of their own, and it's good to see them  socializing with each other."  </P> <P> Flannery says it's not a major problem for his son when the relationship does  not work out: "My son is at an age where these things don't leave a lasting  impression. For example, one time I dated a woman with a child, and our kids  became friends. When we stopped seeing each other, David missed the kid for a  short time. But kids his age are very resilient, and I would rather he had the  experience than not to have had it. I think overall it has been a very positive  thing for him."  </P> <P> How do these single parents answer the ticklish questions that children ask  about their dating lives?  </P> <P> When Taylor's son wanted to know if his parents were going to get back  together, "I just told him the truth," Taylor says, "that I understood how he  felt, but that, bottom line, it was never going to happen. Then I went on with  my life.  </P> <P> "I included him as often as possible until he became more secure about me as a  single father."  </P> <P> Morvant handled the same situation by letting her daughter know "that I  understood exactly how she felt because I really did -- after all, I was hoping  at one point that we would reconcile too. Validating someone else's feelings  doesn't mean things are going to change; it's just a way of letting someone  know they matter to you."  </P> <P> Carty recalls her daughter's questions about dating. "She was 8 or 9 and wanted  to know why I had to go out at night," she says. "I explained that a child  usually sees their friends after school, during the day, but that parents work  so they have to see their friends usually at night. It was a simple  explanation, but it seemed to satisfy her."  </P> <P> Morvant agrees that simple explanations are best: "When I decided to start  dating, I knew my daughter had some apprehension, so I just told her that I had  met a friend and that we were going to have dinner together to see if we wanted  to keep being friends. I said, 'I may go out with him again or someone else. I  need to make new friends now. You may be with a baby-sitter sometimes.'  </P> <P> "The more platonic it looks to a child, the better for them, I think."  </P> <P> And when a relationship reaches a serious level? "This is something for which  my son would be prepared well in advance," Taylor says. "He would have an  opportunity to watch the relationship develop and grow. If I were going to have  her sleep over, I would have to be in a mutually committed relationship first.  My son would know my feelings for her were very deep and lasting. Anything less  is inappropriate, in my opinion."  </P> <P> All agree that blatant displays of affection are inappropriate and out of place  around kids.  </P> <P> "If someone comes to pick me up for a date," Morvant says, "a kiss and hug is  fine, but I don't like too much of that around my kids. I just don't feel  comfortable, and they don't either."  </P> <P> Finally, all these single parents agree that a common mistake parents make is  to fill up all the empty spaces with their children when they are not dating.  </P> <P> "When you aren't seeing anybody, you may be a bit lonely, so you involve your  kid in everything you do," Taylor says. "Then you meet someone, and boom, it's  no longer just 'Dad and me,' it's the three of us or the kid is left out  completely.  </P> <P> "I think it's very important to make time just for you and your kid together,  without a third person. Being a threesome is fine, but not all of the time,  because when a kid starts to feel ignored, left out, that's when resentments  build and problems begin."  </P></p>

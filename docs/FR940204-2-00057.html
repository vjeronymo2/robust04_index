(Kamine Allegany) for the transportation of 11,100 Dekatherms (Dt) per day of natural gas for use in its 55 Megawatt Cogeneration Plant located in the Town of Hume, New York, under CNG's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;537&hyph;000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is stated that Kamine Allegany is constructing a 55 Megawatt gas-fired cogeneration plant in the Town of Hume, New York. It is further stated that Kamine Allegany's plant will cogenerate steam that will be used by an adjacent greenhouse, and electricity that will be purchased by Rochester Gas and Electric Company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CNG states that Kamine Allegany has made arrangements to transport its 11,100 Dt per day that it needs to fire its cogeneration plant on CNG's interstate pipeline system. In order to deliver Kamine Allegany's gas to the cogeneration plant, CNG must construct a tap, measuring and regulation station, and about 600 feet of 6 inch connecting pipeline. Therefore, CNG is proposing herein to tap into its existing parallel Lines 14 &amp; 24, construct about 600 feet of connecting pipeline to connect with the Kamine Allegany Cogeneration plant, and install a measuring and regulation station, along with various auxiliary installations (gate valve assembly, a filter/separator, a line heater, various valves and yard and station piping, and buildings) at the point of interconnection with Lines 14 &amp; 24.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated cost of the construction here is $600,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, CNG states that it has sufficient system delivery capacity to deliver the existing contract quantities without disadvantaging its existing customers, either sales or transportation. These deliveries to Kamine Allegany for its cogeneration plant will have a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  impact on CNG's system wide peak and annual deliveries, CNG states.

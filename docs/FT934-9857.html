			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / 'Third age' population to rise 9%: Spending power and tastes of older people highlighted CONSUMERS AGED over 50 exhibit different tastes, social values, shopping habits and leisure pursuits from younger people, according to a study by Mintel, the market research company. The number of people in Britain in the over-50 age group will increase by 9 per cent in the 1990s, it says, and those in their early 50s will rise almost a third, as the 'baby boom' generation grows older. As a result, a new group of 'third age' consumers is emerging, which embraces people born during the baby boom. Older consumers eat out and go out drinking more than young ones, rate quality above fashion in clothing, are more cautious about buying on credit and value retailers' efficiency above their friendliness, the study says. The trend is likely to have important economic effects because many 'third age' consumers are affluent. Those aged between 50 and 64 have the highest weekly expenditure in the country - Pounds 124 last year. They also spend more of their income than younger people on food, household goods and motoring, and less on housing, fares and clothing. Their spending plans are less likely than those of younger people to have been affected by recession. The study says, however, that those in the 'third age' divide sharply between white collar and professional people in well-paid jobs, who are cushioned by occupational pensions and early retirement schemes, and manual workers and the long-term unemployed, many of whom suffer real hardship. But many more men than women over 50 say they find life more satisfying than ever before, particularly if they are employed. People aged more than 50 become less concerned with being seen as successful, stylish or streetwise, emphasising instead qualities such as being trustworthy, responsible and sensible. More employed people in their fifties than in their sixties say they look forward to retirement. Third Age Lifestyles, 1993. Mintel, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.</p>

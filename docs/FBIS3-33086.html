			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 15 Feb (AFP) -- The Peruvian opposition on  Tuesday initiated the process whereby Council of Ministers  President Alfonso Bustamante and two other members of the  cabinet will be formally questioned about their approval of a  controversial law that transferred jurisdiction of the case  involving the disappearance and murder of nine students and one  professor, presumably by soldiers in July 1992, to a military  court.    An opposition coordinating board announced on Tuesday  morning  that most of the questions will be directed at Bustamante, who  must clearly establish whether or not there is any truth to the  growing rumors of his resignation from the Council of Ministers.    Another question he must answer is why he failed to sign the  controversial law, which has been viewed by various sectors as a  "coup d'etat" against the Judicial Branch because of its  "unconstitutional" nature, according to Congressman Fernando  Olivera.    The procedures for the questioning have come at a time when  rumors are circulating regarding the possible U.S. withdrawal  from the Support Group seeking Peru's reinstatement in the  international economic system. "There is no official report  concerning a possible suspension of U.S. support," says  Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] Vice President Carlos  Torres.    The local media expressed concern over statements by U.S.  Senator Bob Graham, who said on Monday during an official visit  to Peru that the law's approval "may constitute a reversal of  the pledge to restore democracy and respect human rights."  Nevertheless, Graham said he is confident that the discrepancy  between the two governments will be resolved through dialogue.    The other two ministers who may be questioned are Defense  Minister General Victor Malca, for his alleged political  responsibility in this case, and Justice Minister Fernando Vega,  who signed the law.    Local observers maintain that if there is any truth to the  reports published in just about every Peruvian newspaper to the  effect that Bustamante is resigning, a ministerial crisis may be  brewing and it might break upon President Alberto Fujimori's  return from Colombia. Bustamante is a member of his official  entourage.    In accordance with the controversial law, known as the  jurisdictional dispute law, the Supreme Court resolves  litigation between civilian and military courts. The law was  enacted precisely when a court was hearing the case of the nine  students and one professor from La Cantuta Unversity in Lima,  whose charred remains were discovered in common graves on the  outskirts of Lima last year.    By virtue of the law, the case was settled when three  Supreme  Court justices voted in favor of transferring the case to a  military court and two voted in favor of the common courts, thus  eliminating the need for a decisive vote. In the past the  Supreme Court required a majority of four votes to resolve a  jurisdictional conflict and in the event of a split decision,  another justice would cast the decisive vote.    Opposition congressmen on Tuesday began collecting the 27  signatures required for approval of the ministers' questioning.</p>

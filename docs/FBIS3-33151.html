The discovery was made by  two Huancayo provincial prosecutors accompanied by a detachment  of policemen and soldiers.    The prosecutors conducted the search at the request of  congressman Roger Caceres Velasquez, president of the Democratic  Constituent Congress Human Rights Committee, who received a  report on the massacre from relatives of the missing persons.    The officials made the morbid find at the Paccha annex, in  the heights of El Tambo District, Huancayo Province, some 75 km  west of the city of Huancayo.    The massacre allegedly was carried out by more than 100  peasant patrol members from the Suitucancha and Rangra annexes  using the breech-loading shotguns supplied by President Alberto  Fujimori a few years ago to defend their communities from  terrorist attacks.    The victims were Paccha annex inhabitants with whom the  alleged killers had constant disputes over the ownership of  grasslands and agricultural lots located between the two  communities, which allegedly was the cause of the crime.    According to the testimony of the missing peasants'  relatives, Suitucancha and Rangra peasant patrols on the night  of 27 February 1992 launched a surprise attack against Paccha  peasants, shooting and killing 10 of them.    The killers then threw the bodies of the dead peasants  inside  an abandoned mine located high up a hill in the Paccha area.    On 25 August 1993, a commission named by the Attorney  General's Office guarded by a group of military and police  agents, heeding a complaint by relatives of the dead peasants,  went to the mine to verify the existence of the remains, but  they were attacked by a mob of 150 Suitucancha peasant patrol  members.    Commission members, however, were able to enter the mine and  locate three graves containing the remains of the murdered  peasants, but they could not take anything out because the  peasant patrols attacking them at the time forced them to leave  empty-handed.    On 4 February, Huancayo provincial prosecutors Jean Diaz  Alvarado and Juan Lezama, following a request to finish the  proceeding from congressman Roger Caceres Velasquez, travelled  to the Paccha annex to excavate the remains of the slain  peasants.    The prosecutors, accompanied by 15 Huancayo Criminal  Investigation Commission agents, led by PNP [Peruvian National  Police] Lieutenant Daniel Berrocal, plus 15 soldiers, entered  the mine.    Inside the mine, the officials were surprised to find that  the places where the first commission had located the three  graves were covered by metric tons of rock and soil from the  mine's roof, presumably loosened with dynamite by the murderers  in an attempt to hide the evidence of their crime.    However, thanks to a careful inspection of the mine's  entrance, the officials found the remains of the bones of a  total of 15 people buried there.</p>

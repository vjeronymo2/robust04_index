			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: </F> "Difficulties Ahead"]    [Text] The Foreign Ministry has an almost impossible task  ahead: to defend Brazilian interests without the cooperation of  the Senate, which has been making decisions affecting foreign  policy. In an interdependent world -- regardless of whether we  agree with it -- many domestic policy decisions end up becoming  part of a conflict with other nations, which are sometimes more  powerful than Brazil and can impose conditions during a  negotiating process.    The Senate is currently debating two items that have a  strong  effect on our relations with the United States: 1. The approval  of agreements between Brazil and Argentina and the quadripartite  agreement between Brazil, Argentina, the nuclear agency created  by both governments, and the International Atomic Energy Agency  -- all related to the international supervision of the Brazilian  nuclear program -- and 2., the approval of the law on patents.  The delay in approving the agreements has produced all kinds of  negative effects. Now only a very swift and expeditious Foreign  Ministry action will be able to make the members of the select  nuclear club believe that Brazil does not have a second purpose  in developing its nuclear program. The damage produced by the  delay in approving those agreements affects the image of  Brazilian diplomacy, and wears out our relations with the  nuclear club, but it does not produce immediate damage to the  country's economic interests. The delay in voting on the  intellectual property law has doubly negative effects, as it  affects the image of the country's diplomacy and hurts it  economically.    The Senate seems incapable of realizing that the U.S.  Government -- following U.S. domestic laws and subject, without  the shadow of a doubt, to reasonable pressures -- has designated  the month of February for verifying whether or not the  legislation on intellectual property rights in Brazil  contemplates certain requirements. If the answer is negative,  that country will apply sanctions on Brazilian exports. The  problem for the Brazilian Foreign Ministry -- which at the  beginning of the month will send the Foreign Ministry secretary  general to Washington to attempt, once more, to postpone a  judgment on the question -- is that the U.S. position is  sometimes so oblivious to reality that it is comparable to that  of some Brazilian industrial groups.    These national groups are blind to the fact that the economy  today has a global scope, and that all states do not have equal  power. On the contrary, the new scope accentuates the  differences between states. The Americans, on their part,  appear to be virtually blindfolded in that they fail to realize  that the Brazilian Government also suffers pressures, and must  also take the national interests it represents into account.    What is important to bear in mind, for as long as the  Americans do not make a decision, is that the Senate must act if  it wants to influence foreign policies. You cannot support old  rhetoric and simply refuse to vote on items that are important  for our foreign affairs agenda. You cannot implement policies,  much less foreign policies, by omission -- particularly when on  the other side of the table is a party that wants action, and  can demand it by applying sanctions.</p>

This they do after paying  bribes to Togolese soldiers and other border officials.  According to the reports, the men among the traders are  arrested by the Togolese soldiers after they have entered Togo.  A statement by the ministry said efforts by the Ghana Embassy  in Togo to secure their release are being jeopardized by a  steady stream of arrests. The ministry therefore advises all  Ghanaians, particularly traders, not to put themselves at such  unnecessary risks at this time when the Togolese side of the  common border is closed.</p>

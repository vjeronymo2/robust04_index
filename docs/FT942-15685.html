			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / MoD settles Airwork dispute The Ministry of Defence said yesterday it had settled its latest dispute with Airwork, a military maintenance company based in Birmingham, over the unsatisfactory execution of a contract to upgrade Hercules transport aircraft. It said flaws in the company's work, identified four months ago, had been ironed out and the contract would be properly completed next month, with no extra cost to the ministry. The problem over the Hercules was the second between Airwork and the ministry. The latest dispute is seen as an embarrassment to the government at a time when it is proclaiming the need to increase efficiency by making greater use of civilian contractors.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> ENERGY DEPT. TO LIFT PLUTONIUM SECRECY  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Energy has made an unprecedented decision to release  plutonium production figures covering 1944 to 1960 at the Hanford nuclear  reservation in Richland, Wash. The data had been requested by a panel of  scientists overseeing a study of possible health effects from past radiation  releases at Hanford. Figures on the production of plutonium, a key ingredient  of nuclear weapons, have long been among the nation's most closely guarded  secrets because it was thought they could help an enemy determine the size of  the nation's nuclear stockpile.  </P></p>

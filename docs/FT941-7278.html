			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Observer: Pergau-Tory Banana skins have an irresistible magnetism. Britain's education secretary, John Patten, is supposed to visit Malaysia in April to help push British sales of educational equipment. Yesterday's news from Malaysia suggests it may not be worth his going. Malaysia is, of course, home to the Pergau dam, financed by Pounds 234m in aid from the UK and now being probed by the foreign affairs committee over possible links with a Pounds 1bn arms deal. It would have allowed Patten to diplomatically avoid the National Union of Teachers' annual conference. However, one man who might not be too unhappy if the trip was called off is Sir Tim Lankester, now Patten's permanent secretary. For it was he who, when at the Overseas Development Administration, advised the government not to touch the dam with a barge pole.</p>

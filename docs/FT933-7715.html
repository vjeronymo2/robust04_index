			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Post Office counters benefit fraud with barcode scanners BARCODE SCANNERS are to be mobilised as a high-tech weapon against benefit fraud which costs the government an estimated Pounds 300m a year. The latest anti-fraud campaign, codenamed Alert, is a joint project between the Post Office and the Department of Social Security's benefit agency. The scanners will cost Pounds 150m to install nationwide. Initially, however, they will be tested in 200 London post offices. Mr Mike Francis, head of the benefit agency's fraud branch, said: 'We hope most offices will have the equipment by the end of next year, everywhere except remote places like the Orkneys. You don't get much fraud there.' The benefit books - mainly pension books in the pilot stages - have been redesigned to prevent forgery, carrying individual barcodes which can be read like the price of a loaf of bread at a supermarket checkout. If a book has been reported stolen, or if a genuine cover has been switched to conceal stolen coupons of a higher benefit value, the scanner signals an irregularity to staff, who then confiscate the book. Eventually the Post Office plans to install 20,000 scanners costing Pounds 7,500 each. The authorities will not disclose details of the scanning equipment for security reasons. But they would be similar to the Symbol Technologies machines used by Superdrug, the chemist. 'With a barcode facility, we can put out a red signal which alerts staff to any irregularity,' Mr Francis said. 'The new order books are very hard to fake. A trial run showed that top-of-the-range supermarket equipment will help us save Pounds 5m in the 200 test offices alone. That is not a bad return on a outlay of Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.5m.' There are 900m benefit transactions in the UK each year. The scanners could cut out the need for expensive police operations such as Operation Hammer, which uncovered counterfeit books in south-east London with a face value of Pounds 2.4m. Last year, the DSS recovered Pounds 558m in fraudulent benefit payments, after investigating 270,000 cases.</p>

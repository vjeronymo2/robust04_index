			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT Granada's inability to secure a recommendation for its increased offer leaves LWT's shareholders with a decision they will not relish. The industrial logic for consolidation may be clear. The financial argument is also more compelling. Nevertheless, the big institutional investors, which control most of LWT's stock, will be reluctant to sell out a management that has done such a good job in delivering shareholder value. But any sympathy will be tempered by fear of what will happen to LWT's shares should the bid fail. The media re-rating is unlikely to sustain the shares at the current level. Many shareholders, with stakes in both companies, will also be mindful of the damage that would cause Granada, too. That suggests the offer will succeed, however shame-faced some investors may feel.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Sainsbury advances 19% at midway: Retailer's results boosted by strong growth in volume sales of food J. SAINSBURY'S strongest volume sales growth in foods for five years enabled the UK's biggest retailer to show a faster turn of speed than rival Tesco, and lift interim pre-tax profits by 19.4 per cent to Pounds 391m. But the stock market greeted the news by knocking 3.6 per cent off Sainsbury's share price as some investors were unsettled by the cautious stance on current trading, and took profits after its recent strong rise. Presiding over his first results since taking over from his cousin as chairman, Mr David Sainsbury said the outcome was 'extremely good' given the harsh economic climate and the fall in food price inflation to its lowest level in five years. He attributed the company's continuing resilience to a sharpening of its offering. 'We have seen a decline in the product quality and the standards of service elsewhere, while we are giving better value for money than ever before. Customers are voting with their feet,' he said. In the UK, sales from Sainsbury's food stores, Savacentre hypermarkets and Homebase DIY stores rose 12.8 per cent to Pounds 4.75bn. Like-for-like sales from food stores rose 3.7 per cent - with price inflation averaging 3 per cent - while 14 new superstores accounted for the remainder of the increase in turnover. Nine superstores will open in the second half - each at an average cost of Pounds 25m. The foodstores' operating profits were 18.9 per cent higher at Pounds 361.2m, benefiting from further cost reductions and productivity improvements. But Homebase 'bore the scars' of the price war in the DIY market, lifting profits just 3.1 per cent to Pounds 9.1m. Sainsbury's US subsidiary, Shaw's, was badly hit by recession and saw trading profits fall 16.5 per cent to Dollars 21.4m (Pounds 13m) on near static sales of Dollars 994.7m. Overall, Sainsbury's group sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 5.29bn in the half-year to September 26. Capital expenditure totalled Pounds 384m and added the equivalent of 2,800 jobs over last year. But operating profit per full-time employee rose 10 per cent to Pounds 213 a week as a result of greater operating efficiencies. Sainsbury said Sunday trading continued to prove popular with more than 1m customers a week shopping at its stores. Mr Sainsbury said sales had started well in the second half but the company remained cautious about sales in the run-up to Christmas. Earnings per share were 10.8 per cent higher at 14.99p. The interim dividend was lifted by 12.5 per cent to 2.7p. Sainsbury's shares closed 18p lower at 487p. Lex, Page 22; Tough act to follow, Page 24</p>

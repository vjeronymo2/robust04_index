			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article; ``Donations for Russia: Do They Reach The </F> Designated Recipient?''; first paragraph is TRUD introduction]    [Text]There was a delegation of the Russian Government  Commission on Humanitarian and Scientific-Technical Aid, headed  by A. A. Zhitnikov, its deputy chairman, in the FRG. It  discussed matters of further collaboration, participated in  preparation of a new document that deals with various aspects of  relations between the two countries in this direction. Our Bonn  correspondent, R. Kolchanov, took advantage of this opportunity  to interview A. A. Zhitnikov:  [Question] What is the extent of humanitarian aid and  how large a part is Germany playing in it?  [Answer] Humanitarian aid to Russia is coming from  more than 60 countries. Last year, we received about 500,000  tons of foodstuffs, as well as many drugs and medical equipment  both along government lines and from hundreds of private  organizations. In the first half of this year, the volume of  food aid alone constituted a million tons. Germany's share is  quite appreciable. Let me mention such major organizations as  the German Red Cross and CARE-Deutschland. Of course, we have  expressed our most sincere appreciation to all donors who have  to exert much effort to collect and transport food.  [Question] The aid is intended primarily for the  socially depressed population strata in Russia....  [Answer] According to our estimates, they constitute  30-35 million people: pensioners, invalids, large families,  refugees who have left their homeland because of conflict  situations.  [Question] Humanitarian aid is usually given for a  specific, short period of time, but the factors you have  mentioned will apparentlyprevail, regrettably, for a long time  to come in our country. Shall we seek aid in the future also?  [Answer]In the difficult transitional period that  Russia is experiencing, millions of people are in need of social  support. The government is making an utmost effort to alleviate  their situation, but we do not have enough funds. As of June,  the deficit in the budget earmarked for social programs  constituted about 150 million rubles, and this does not include  health care or expenses related to migration. We are trying to  bridge the gap at the expense of humanitarian aid. For example,  deliveries, in the form of aid, of American grain will enable us  to get about 25 billion rubles to support the needy. In this  regard, we are negotiating with other governments as well. So  that humanitarian aid to Russia is simply a necessity for the  time being.  [Question] Does it really reach the people for whom  it is intended and to a full measure?  [Answer]There are representatives of different  departments, nongovernment organizations and clergy in our  Commission. There are local humanitarian aid headquarters.  Administration heads are personally responsible for its  distribution. In recent years direct contacts are developing,  and we are encouraging this: hospital to hospital, city to city,  and foreign children's institutions to ours.  [Question] Still, there are quite a few reports,  including some in the German mass media, to the effect that some  of the aid is being stolen and sold through speculative entities.  [Answer] Humanitarian aid from foreign countries is  handled in two ways: it is sent directly to the needy, or it is  sold. For example, you cannot deliver grain from door to door,  and the proceeds from it go to pensioners, students and school  lunches. That was the case, for example, with the 155,000 tons  of food received through the Commission of European Communities.  In Moscow, the proceeds from selling it constituted 4.6 billion  rubles and in St. Petersburg, 2.5 billion. The moneys went to  the needy.    We proceeded similarly with the 18,000 tons of American  butter, 100,000 tons of Taiwan rice and several other forms of  humanitarian aid. I should like to stress that, in principle, we  coordinate our actions with the donors who deliver these  products to us. Our aim is to have part of the humanitarian aid  used ``for the future,'' for development of production.  [Question] The Commission does not have its own  shops. Through what channels is such aid implemented?  [Answer] We are making a careful study of the  capabilities of those who express the wish to participate in  handling products received as aid. Sale is categorically  prohibited without the Commission's special permission. The  entire process is reflected in documentation, and we monitor it  through the pertinent departments.  [Question] Nevertheless, one can find products  obviously received in the form of humanitarian aid in numerous  stands loaded with alcoholic beverages and smoking materials.  [Answer] We have checked this repeatedly. We learned  that the products are offered to the stand owners by those who  received them as aid in order to use the proceeds for other,  more needed items. We are much more concerned with the instances  of direct stealing.  [Question] Is there much theft?  [Answer]The losses from theft constituted about 35  million rubles. Of course, this is very sad and outrageous. But  the losses related to selling items of humanitarian aid are much  lower, as compared to the total aid which amounted to about 35  billion rubles last year, than in ordinary trade. It is nonsense  that the commercial structures supposedly get rich from this  aid. Anyone who sells products with our permission sets prices  that are slightly below market prices for speedy sale, and is  compensated only for inevitable expenses, for example, transport.    The Commission, however, does not spend a single ruble of  deductions from humanitarian aid to maintain its staff of 18  people.  [Question] However, you are the target of unfavorable  criticism?  [Answer] I wish to note that humanitarian aid is  often used in Russia as an arena for political battle. What sins  have not been placed upon us! However, recently, a commission of  the Ministry of Finance Control Administration failed to find  any abuses in our performance.  [Question]I should like to hope that soon potentially  wealthy Russia will no longer have to seek help in foreign  countries....  [Answer] We are experiencing a very difficult period,  but there is no turning back. The road ahead toward implementing  reforms, with consideration of present needs and interests of  the socially less protected strata of the population, should  ultimately lead to success.</p>

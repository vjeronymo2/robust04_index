			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Unita is accused of planning partition THE Angolan government yesterday accused the main opposition party Unita of planning to seize the south and partition the country, Reuter reports from Luanda. Governor Baltasar Manuel, of the southern city of Huambo, where former rebel leader Mr Jonas Savimbi retreated after the elections, said Unita was preparing for partition by deploying forces in Huambo and other cities. The government demanded Unita withdraw its forces under international supervision. The ruling MPLA party has reported Unita troop movements in Bie and Moxico provinces east of Huambo, with Unita controlling some towns. Unita has said it is unhappy with parliamentary elections in which the MPLA won 124 seats against 67 for itself. In the capital Luanda, at least two people were killed when Unita men fired on MPLA supporters.</p>

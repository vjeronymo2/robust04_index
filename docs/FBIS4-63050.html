			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report under the "Transport" rubric: </F> "Minister Pleased with Sector's Performance"]    [Text] Russian Federation Transport Minister Vitaliy  Yefimov has held a news conference on the results of his  ministry's work in 1993. In the minister's view, his sector did  well last year -- the decline in sea, river, road, and air  transportation was 28 percent against the overall slump of 35  percent in the national economy as a whole. Mr. Yefimov thought  it necessary to emphasize that "transport workers are not  freeloaders" -- in 1993 transport companies received 300 billion  rubles [R] in subsidies, but paid around R750 billion to the  budget. In 1994, the sector is scheduled to receive another  R1.4 trillion, only to pay R3.5 trillion to the budget. The  minister voiced his hope that once the budget is approved,  "funds required for the sector's functioning and development  will be forthcoming in a more orderly fashion."    Mr. Yefimov pointed out that in 1993 transport workers not  only kept traffic routes in working condition, but also took  efforts to "lay the groundwork for future achievements." For  instance, the ministry plans to present to the Federal Assembly  a number of bills aimed at improving the legal framework of  transportation. In addition, the government will receive a  program tentatively entitled "Russian Roads."    Regarding problems currently facing Russian transport, Mr.  Yefimov pointed to the overall decline in cargo and passenger  traffic. He voiced his regret that enterprises producing  transport facilities are in dire financial straits and cannot  replace Russia's means of transport in the requisite amounts,  but the ministry is trying to solve the problem by attracting  investment from large commercial businesses.</p>

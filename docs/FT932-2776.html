			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Arts: Narcissistic trip through hell - Cinema LES NUITS FAUVES (18) Cyril Collard MATINEE (PG) Joe Dante THE TRIAL (12) David Jones BOXING HELENA (18) Jennifer Chambers Lynch FIRE IN THE SKY (15) Robert Liebermann Cyril Collard screenwrote Les Nuits Fauves, the succes de scandale of the French film year, from his own quasi-autobiographical gay novel. He also directed it and took the starring role of the HIV-positive young (anti)hero. As a grim rounding-off of this one-man show, and its sense of consuming identification between artist and project, Collard himself died of Aids shortly after the film's release. Life and art, let alone death and art, make bewildering bedfellows. When I first saw Les Nuits Fauves at the Berlin Film Festival I thought it - and still do despite the special pleading of real-life tragedy - an exercise in manic narcissism. Here is our handsome, fast-living hero Jean (Collard), a photographer-musician swinging sexually between a teenage girl (Romane Bohringer) and a handsome, thuggish sports player (Carlos Lopez). And here is a Paris vast, kinetic and unruly, as seen by a hand-held camera trying to shake us into empathy with the movie's seismic romantic nihilism. Les Nuits Fauves is an ego trip through a self-willed hell. Doomed to an early death, a young man pursues his last long delirium of pleasure and existential danger (to others as much as himself, since he conceals his HIV status): until after two hours of up-yours bravura, the film's last scene ushers in the deathbed repentance. Collard gazes out at a sunset, and as the surreally speeded orb fizzes below the skyline and then up again we hear his voice-over: 'I may die of Aids. But it's no longer my life. I am in life.' This climactic flood of pantheistic awe is meant to cleanse away two hours of tunnel-vision self-gratification. But nothing, ultimately, can disguise the fact that Les Nuits Fauves is a serenade to solipsism disguised as a story about relationships. The girl's character description could have been scribbled on a cigarette packet: moppet turns into Medea on discovering she may have caught Aids. (She spends the film's second half burning up the telephone line with sulphurous insults). And the sportsman remains an unsolved enigma throughout. Do we see latent guilt in his none-too-latent homophobia, as when he viciously beats up a gay man during an initially mild S-&amp;-M session? Do we see mere brute stupidity? Or do we see . . . ? We see what we want. There are no real characters save Jean in this movie. The people he ranges around himself are neutrons hired to bombard him until dramatic fission is achieved. And though the film sometimes feints at foregrounding the subject of Collard/Jean's egotistic failure of emotional reach - 'You're incapable of loving]' screams the girl - that failure becomes the failure of the movie. It rants and raves; it careers about the land with its hero's video-camera. But the one journey it never makes is into the skin of other characters. The missing dimension of humanity is finally, perversely supplied by the film-maker's own death. Real-life events cannot help affecting our emotional response to art, even if they fail to budge us from our critical verdict. That Collard shared his own hero's anticipated end does not make Les Nuits Fauves a better film, but it gives it a belated, eerie poignancy. A crusade for egomania that seems cruel as fiction becomes almost quixotic as half-fact: a pageant of hubris enacted by an artist who knew that his nemesis was already waiting. The rest of the movie week says hello to the silly season. Blithest silliness - it comments on movie folly rather than perpetrating it - is Joe Dante's Matinee. In the tradition of Dante's Gremlins or Explorers this pours parody, social comment and grand guignol into its aesthetic cocktail-mixer; then gives it a shake and waits for it to froth over. To a Key West, Florida, already gripped by real-life historical panic - the Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962 - comes movie horror merchant Lawrence Woolsey (John Goodman) Mission: to cash in on the anxiety climate by opening his latest shoestring screamer 'Mant.' ('Half man, half ant, all terror]' proclaims the poster). Woolsey's greatest fan is youngster Gene (Simon Fenton), taking his mind off Dad's absence on a blockade ship by helping the shlock-mogul set out his stall of gimmicks. These include: seats wired to shock the audience, man in ant's head roaming cinema, and 'joke' nuclear explosion to round things off. Woolsey is based on that great gimmickmaster William Castle: a man who released everything into the audience from skeletons to electric shocks to increase appreciation of films like The Tingler or Horror Of Haunted Hill. (There are also be touches of Dante's own mentor, Roger 'Buckets Of Blood' Corman). But guessing games can wait till after the film. This slides its merry way from real-life near-apocalypse - Key West was only 90 miles from the epicenter of what many thought might be World War Three - to the sublimations of movie fantasy, via a typical Dante's inferno of gags, ghoulishness and period grace-notes. Boxing Helena, by debut writer-director Jennifer Lynch (David's 24-year-old daughter), and The Trial, directed by David Jones from Harold Pinter's Kafka-based script, were surely mixed up at birth? Why else is Mr Lynch's favourite actor Kyle McLachlan - the chinful wonder of Twin Peaks - not starring in Miss Lynch's movie as the surgeon hero who cuts off the arms and legs of his beloved (Sherilyn Fenn) the better to adore her? Instead Britain's Julian Sands signs on up as the nutty American sawbones; while at the other end of the Western hemisphere McLachlan struggles with an English accent as the German-Czech hero of Kafka's paranoid classic. Why is McLachlan's Joseph K English-brogued? Because this is a Great European Classic co-produced by the BBC. In period-accoutred Prague - crumbly streets, onion domes and only one renegade TV aerial in sight - the likes of Juliet Stevenson, Alfred Molina and Sir Anthony Hopkins purl forth the Pinter-precise prose. And Mr McLachlan flat-rackets back the arias of bewildered indignation. The cinema has now given us two movies of The Trial made at opposite ends of the disaster spectrum. Where Welles's 1963 effort was OTT-baroque, this one is visionless, lifeless and dreamless. It turns the work of a great Middle European fabulist into middlebrow culture fodder. Every Kafka frisson is flattened by declamatory literalism; every dark Kafka joke is trapped in the headlights of the film's stagy overemphasis. Boxing Helena is another potentially startling idea boxed into banality by the mise-en-scene. Boy loves girl; boy quadruply amputates girl; boy lives happily ever after (almost). Tsk] tsk] what will the feminists say? Like most people, they may be too underwhelmed to care. The grand guignol all happens off-screen, leaving the film as tame as a tea party. And with the possible exception of Ms Kim Basinger, who lost Dollars 9m for breaking her alleged pledge to star in this limbless wonder, everyone connected with it seems tuned into another channel. Sands camps and hisses as if doing his 'Be a mad genius' exercises for Ken Russell. Miss Fenn is inexpressive with or without anatomical extensions. And Giacomo Puccini delivers a stream of great arias on the soundtrack, though 'Nessun dorma' hardly describes the state of consciousness prevailing at the Press show. There is always Outer Space. Fire In The Sky is based on the 'true' story of Arizona logger Travis Walton (DB Sweeney) who was snatched into the sky by an alien spaceship. Days later, after what seems to have been a short but nasty interstellar medical examination, he was re-deposited naked on Earth. Sheriff James Garner initiates the enquiry as the film gradually establishes that yes, something strange may have happened; and yes, people could be fooled into believing it given enough loud music (Mark Isham) and splashy special effects (Industrial Light And Magic of Star Wars and ET).</p>

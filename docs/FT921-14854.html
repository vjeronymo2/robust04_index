			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Property and building products hit Hawtin HAWTIN, the Cardiff-based leisure, building products and property group, saw pre-tax profit drop 7 per cent, from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 1.4m, in the year to September 30 1991. The leisure and fitness side, now the largest division, had performed well, said Mr Phillip Dovey, managing director, and its current trading was better than expected helped by recent acquisitions such as Ultrabronz and Aston ocean. However, the property and building materials side took a beating last year and Hawtin was looking to reduce this sector while seeking to expand its leisure and fitness businesses, together swith the associated textiles concern whose output was largely aimed at the leisure industry. Income from rents in the property division was ahead 'substantially,' Mr Dovey said, but there was no profit on property sales. The building products side suffered its worst trading conditions ever, but managed to stay in profit. Earnings slipped to 1.71p (1.75p). The proposed dividend is 0.86p (0.825p).</p>

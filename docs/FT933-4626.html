			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK exporters need more diplomatic back-up Sir, Your Observer column, 'Sundown in the east' (September 1), drew attention to the fact that the UK has far fewer diplomats in the Commonwealth of Independent States than its main commercial competitors. On behalf of British contractors working in international markets, I would like to say that I share the concern of your columnist at what appears to be a dangerously short-sighted approach to important potential markets of strategic significance. In countries such as those of the CIS, where many companies are taking their first tentative steps to build up a network of local knowledge and experience, diplomatic help on the ground is vital. If British contractors are to establish themselves in these new markets, an increase in diplomatic representation is essential. In many of the CIS states, government officials are accustomed to dealing with civil servants and diplomats from other governments and it is important that the UK has representatives of a high standard in place. This must not be done, of course, at the expense of existing representation in other developing areas where a continuation of political and commercial advice is equally important. In 1991 the construction industry generated business worth some Pounds 7.6bn in total exports for the UK, and the recent steps taken by the government to reduce some of the difficulties faced by British exporters are very welcome. These measures have included extending the availability and increasing the extent of cover for export credits and reducing premiums, and launching a major initiative to identify and second export market specialists from industry to the Department of Trade and Industry. It does seem perverse, therefore, for a government that has recently expressed and demonstrated its support for exporters to follow at the same time a policy of limiting diplomatic representation in potentially rewarding markets. Is this a case of the foreign office pursuing its own agenda, or is it simply a matter of Treasury penny pinching? What is obviously required is greater co-operation between Whitehall departments to ensure that adequate representation is present in the CIS states to enable exporters to take advantage of the greater assistance on offer from the Department of Trade and Industry.

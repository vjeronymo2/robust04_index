			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Freire] </F>   [Excerpts] Last Tuesday the director of the Investigations  Police, Nelson Mery, announced the formation of the National  Financial Crimes Office. The reasons the police chief cited are  quite simple. During 1992 the Economic Crimes Brigade received  3,000 investigation orders and, with great efficiency, recovered  818 million pesos. In 1993 the number of investigation orders  issued by the courts did not change much, reaching 3,100. But  over 2.66 billion pesos were recovered. This means that the huge  amounts stolen through fraud had multipled by a factor of at  least three.    Not only did the numbers grow, but so did specialization and  the use of advanced technology to falsify public documents and  instruments, not to mention the new and infrequently reported  cases of computer fraud.    In Mery's report on Tuesday, he said that Bridec [Economic  Crimes Brigade] "is a unit that has shown a great increase in  efficiency during this period. Crimes like robberies with  intimidation or crimes involving bloodshed generally have a much  greater impact on public opinion. But white-collar criminals  cause considerable damages to the state, to development projects  that the state has to finance, and to workers who are victims of  fraud and swindling." [passage omitted]    A few years ago, Bridec operated only in Santiago. Today it  has units in all regional headquarters, the result, a  high-ranking police official said, of "the difficult changes in  the Chilean economy."    Money laundering is always directly related to drugs, but it  is an eminently economic crime, for this "black" money comes not  only from drugs, but also from tax evasion, arms trafficking,  and hundreds of lesser crimes that produce dirty money that  needs to be laundered.    To counter this new scourge while waiting for Parliament to  enact legislation, the Investigations Police began to work on it  a year ago.    Police experts from the Antidrug Brigade and from Bridec who  will be working under the coordination of a team of attorneys  from the State Defense Council have taken courses to upgrade  their skills in England, the United States, Germany, and Italy.    Six officers, including police officers with accounting  degrees, are also in contact with foreign police agents who are  experts in money laundering. They will also have the direct  support of the FBI office that is to be set up in Chile, as well  as of the U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration].    Chile's prospects for preventing economic crimes seem  favorable. This is no place for people who want to pursue their  base designs of swindling their fellow citizens. As Nelson Mery  said, "No matter who they may be, they will end up in jail."  [passage omitted]</p>

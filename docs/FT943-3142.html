			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: AB Ports advances to Pounds 38m - Radical restructuring of port operations helps achieve 29% rise Associated British Ports continued to benefit from the radical restructuring of its port operations, with taxable profits rising 29 per cent on a 7 per cent increase in port revenues. The port operations' workforce has fallen from 9,500 to 1,800 since 1983, and with its reduced and largely fixed cost base, increasing revenues flow comparatively directly into profits. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 amounted to Pounds 38m, up from Pounds 29.4m, despite only a Pounds 1.8m increase in turnover to Pounds 99.4m. Severence costs fell from Pounds 4m to Pounds 800,000, with 30 lay-off's so far this year. However, there were no fixed asset sales, which had provided Pounds 1.5m of profit in 1993. A number of high turnover operations have been closed, but the ports saw total throughput increase by 4 per cent during the period, rising from 53m to 55m tonnes. Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, was up-beat about the performance, saying: 'prospects for the group are excellent, with our ports well placed to take advantage of the upturn in the UK economy and expanding world trade'. The Southampton Container Terminals, jointly owned with P&amp;O Containers, saw a 22 per cent increase in container throughput, and trans-shipment cargo rose 50 per cent, as it took business from other European ports. Profits from port operations rose from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 35.7m, and income from the leasing of port-related property and land increased from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 11.1m. The company has invested consistently in its port and transport facilities, and plans to maintain annual capital expenditure at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. During the period, it invested Pounds 23m. Net borrowings rose to Pounds 349m (Pounds 345m at December 31); however, gearing fell from 52.5 per cent to 51.4 per cent, and uncapitalised interest costs were Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 17.1m). Property investment income rose from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5.8m, in spite of the impact of last year's property sales. Property development profits fell from Pounds 1m to Pounds 600,000, but the sales programme is likely to accelerate over the next one to two years, as ABP refocuses on property adjacent to its port operations. The interim dividend is being increased from 1.75p to 2p, with earnings per share of 7.6p (5.9p). COMMENT First it was obstructive labour practices, and then its dabbling in the property market, but ABP's future is now looking better than ever. With high operational gearing, profits will rapidly outpace a steady recovery in revenues. ABP should continue to win business from the continent and smaller British ports, while trade continues to expand with the growing economy. Analysts are looking for up to Pounds 78m profits for the full year, putting the shares on a premium p/e rating of 17.4. Given the strength of core earnings, and the renewed potential for property profits, there should be more growth to come.</p>

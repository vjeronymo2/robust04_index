			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Chong-chin from Panmunjom] </F>   [Text] This morning, North and South Korea held their  working- level contact for the exchange of special envoys  between the North and South at the House of Peace, in our side  of Panmunjom. They are now discussing the procedure for the  exchange of special envoys.    At today's contact, our side stressed that this year's Team  Spirit exercise will be suspended, and that the third round of  North Korean-U.S. high-level talks will proceed smoothly only if  the exchange of special envoys is held.    Our side stated that it would flexibly accept North Korea's  proposal on procedural matters if North Korea cancels its four  demands, including the cancellation of President Kim Yong-sam's  remarks regarding the nuclear issue that North Korea is  demanding.    In his first remarks, Song Yong-tae, our side's senior  delegate, said: It is regretful that despite the principled  agreement between the two sides regarding the exchange of  special envoys, the practical discussions have not proceeded  because of the North side's demands that have nothing to do with  the contact. He urged the North side to immediately comply with  the discussions of the procedural issues without delaying the  exchange of special envoys under the pretext of unjust demands.    Senior delegate Song Yong-tae pointed out that two of North  Korea's demands -- including the issue of promoting the great  unity of the whole nation proposed by the North side as an  agenda item for the exchange of special envoys during the fifth  North-South working- level contact -- will be met when the  Nuclear Control Joint Committee begins operating and when the  North-South agreement is carried out. Also, he urged the North  side to accept the South side's proposal indicating that the  North side's special envoy should first visit the South, that  the envoy should stay for four nights and five days, and the  exchange of special envoys should be made within 10 days after  the signing of the agreement.</p>

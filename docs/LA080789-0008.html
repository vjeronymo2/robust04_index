			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING RED LIGHTS  </P> <P> Mark Frankel misses one very important point in his column discussing Southern  Californians' habit of ignoring red lights ("Better Red Than Dead on L.A.  Streets," Op-Ed Page, July 28). Most drivers don't think of themselves as  running red lights but rather running yellow lights. To them there's a big  difference. A red light still holds the stigma of breaking the law. But a  yellow light -- nah, that's just beating the odds.  </P> <P> As one who views every yellow light as green, I would like to explain why.  Lights on main thoroughfares are not synchronized. If you manage to get through  one yellow light it could mean a dozen greens ahead of you. On the other hand,  if you stop at a yellow, you will probably hit a red light for the next 10  streets.  </P> <P> Coming from the mean streets of Manhattan 12 years ago, I must say that little  of the courtesy Southern California drivers were known for remains  recognizable. Whatever is good for the driver goes -- even if that means  possibly causing a major accident or killing a pedestrian. Again, as one who  considers yellow lights nothing more than pale greens, I wish it were  different. But unfortunately it won't be until the lights on major  thoroughfares are synchronized and freeways are actually free.  </P> <P> MARLENA BRICKER  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

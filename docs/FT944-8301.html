			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Architecture: Designed to work - Colin Amery discusses the future for offices and factories Major industrial companies often find themselves with an embarrassment of old buildings that have outlived their purpose and would be wasted if they could not be modernised. This is a special problem in Britain, where the first industrial revolution began and where the pace of industrial change quickly outstripped the usefulness of old plant. The changes that automation brought to heavy industry represent only one aspect of the evolution of working patterns in the late 20th century, for advances in computerisation and information technology have only just started to change the way Britons work in offices. The future shape and design of offices and factories is far from clear, and it is to architects that we must look as innovators and leaders of the design revolution. Last week saw the annual Office of the Year award, sponsored by the British Institute of Facilities Management and Du Pont (UK). Memorably, the judges described the office building as the 'all too immovable object' in any company's portfolio of assets. It is clear that the development of office design in Britain has improved considerably even during the recession, and one area of noteworthy improvement has been the involvement of the workforce in the process. Consultation between architect and client is the key to successful design, and it is vital that discussion about the working environment occurs throughout any organisation. Simple facts emerge with startling clarity when architects take the time to ask questions. Underwriters, for example, would be a happier breed if Sir Richard Rogers had let them see out of and open windows in the Lloyd's building in the City of London. Air-conditioning and the regular but scarcely discernible flicker of a flourescent tube often cause headaches or, at the very least, a sense of edgy imprisonment for employees. It is the feeling that office workers have no control over their working environment that causes unhappiness. Architects hate to see the mass of pin-ups and technicolour photographs of children, wives and mistresses that adorns most work-stations. But this reaction is an overly purist one, and indicates a wish to conceal anything that might reveal that life itself is not particularly well designed. It is fascinating that recent surveys by estate agents in London have confirmed what we have known for a long time - that people prefer to be able to open windows, see the world and breathe real air even if it is a bit noisy and polluted. Fashion plays its part: it was not so long ago that office builders and developers were equally convinced that workers preferred the 'deep plan' with sealed windows and little access to views of the outside world. Of course, in reality it is more likely to be the enormous expense of running and maintaining air-conditioning plant that will dictate a return to a more natural and less profligate office environment. The winner of the Office of the Year award, rather surprisingly, was a huge purpose-built complex for Lloyd's Bank: Canons House, on an 11-acre site in the dockland area of Bristol. Nealy 1,500 people work in this building, handling retail banking business. The building was designed by Arup Associates. It has a distinctive classical architectural look on the outside but comprises conventional energy-saving office spaces on the inside. A more interesting proposition was the offices of Hamilton Oil in London, where the company has faced a problem common to many companies - the conversion and upgrading of an existing and inadequate building. Hamilton occupies part of Devonshire House in Piccadilly, a mid-20th century office building. Inside it is a forest of structural columns; outside, there is ancient fenestration that needed replacing. Traffic noise in central London was also a problem in a building that faces on to Piccadilly. Boots, in turn, is a company that should be glowing - in its case for a highly successful and innovative treatment of one of its large industrial plants near Nottingham. One of its factories on the site at Beeston was a pioneer when it opened in 1933. In fact, it was seen by English Heritage as a building of such historical and architectural importance that it gave it that mixed blessing, a Grade I listing. This is an extremely rare distinction for an industrial plant, and acknowledges the importance of the design by Sir Owen Williams, which has been described as 'a milestone in concrete architecture in Britain.' The factory has been in continuous operation since 1933, and was designed to allow a complete production process to flow north to south along the length of the building. Owen Williams' design was highly innovative for the 1930s. The production line dictated the length of the plant, and the need for as much natural light as possible produced the design of a concrete roof with 150,000 glass discs. There are heating tubes in the glass walls to prevent condensation (something that has not yet reached the average British bathroom mirror), and cantilevered roofs offer loading bays as large as 28ft with no supports. Boots is to be commended for successfully carrying out a three-year, Pounds 20m renovation of this listed industrial masterpiece. The company has proved that a building that is well designed for a specific purpose in the first place, and takes account of basic needs for light and air, has a life far beyond that of a property developer's speculative, low-cost offering. The future for the design of places of work depends on the rate of technological change. But the recent office awards, and the experience of Boots, show that companies should look to good designers from the start, because that is the way to ensure long life and flexible usage in return for substantial investment.</p>

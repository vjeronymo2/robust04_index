			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Bold Stand Against US"; all quotation marks </F> as published]    [Text] Is Robin Raphel a resident of India? Or, is she a  spokesperson for Pakistani terrorists? One cannot but help  entertain such doubts going by the authoritative, often  contradictory, statements issued by her. It is totally  unbecoming of a representative of the world's most powerful  country to ape Jack Nicholson, the Joker. Ms. Raphel, by her  intemperate and totally immature utterances is playing havoc  with the destinies of millions of citizens in the subcontinent.  Ms. Raphel feels that a "lot of human rights abuses are still  occurring in Kashmir both on the part of the militants and the  security forces. While recent steps by the Government of India  had increased accountability, the improvement has yet to be  reflected on the ground". Her concern for human rights is most  touching. We too feel concerned at the impunity with which human  rights violations take place in the so-called land of global  democrats, the United States of America. Ms. Raphel's obsession  with matters Asian seem to preclude her understanding of naked  home truths. The Human Rights Watch, an American human rights  organisation, rapped in its report recently the United States  for `non-compliance' with the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights (ICCPR). The report, a joint undertaking of  the major US Constitutional Rights Organisation and the largest  US-based international human rights group, regularly quoted by  the state department when it criticises other countries, was  prompted by the ratification of the ICCPR by the US in 1992, 25  years after its adoption by the United Nations. The Human Rights  Watch executive director, Mr. Kenneth Roth, had this to say:  "The US government regularly condemns human rights abuses in  other countries, but has done little to apply international  human rights law in the country. We issue this report in the  hope of breaking the cynical view of international human rights  law as a source of protection only for those outside the US  borders. This report demonstrates that violations are happening  on the US soil as well".    The report identified nine substantive areas in which the US  `falls short of international standards'. For the benign  education of Ms. Raphel, some of the sticking points of the  report are: the US routinely violates Article 10 of the ICCPR  which requires that all prisoners and detainees be treated with  humanity and respect to the inherent dignity of the human  person; Article 10 is also violated by many of the techniques  and punishments of `super-maximum security' facilities where for  example, prisoners may pass years without breathing outside air  or may be forced to eat their meals like a dog, with hands tied  behind their backs; the anti-discrimination requirement of  Article 26 is violated by the unequal treatment of women  prisoners, who receive fewer recreational, vocational and  educational opportunities than their male counterparts; although  US legal protection against race discrimination is generally  adequate by ICCPR standards, in practice legal safeguards go  largely ignored. Educational segregation and unequal conditions  of schooling persist. Public and private housing are rife with  segregation and discrimination. The report says that it finds  "significant shortcomings in the US record, from the summary  repatriation of Haitian Boat People (refugees fleeing to the US  from Haiti in leaking boats) to the brutal treatment of  prisoners in the US". So much for Ms. Raphel's concern for human  rights! If the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia has  been making a spectacle of herself, the contribution to such  humour has been quite significant from India's leadership. We  have been defensive all through. Any Tom, Dick and Harry can  level accusations against India and get away with it. All that  we seem to do is defend, defend and defend. The inability of the  foreign policy makers to come out of cocooned non-alignment  thinking, and their inability to define India's self-interest  clearly has led even terrorist exporting countries like Pakistan  and habitual offenders of human rights like Iran to mouthings on  human rights. Recognition of this fact, belated though, has come  in the form of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's bold statement to  recast India's defence policy if Pressler Amendment is dropped  against Pakistan. Only the naive and ignorant will be fooled by  the US stand that a one-time waiver of Pressler Amendment is not  harmful. For the United States, the bottomline of Lockheed  Corporation manufacturing the dreaded F-16s is more important  than the welfare of India, Pakistan or its one billion humans.  That is the truth, fair and simple.</p>

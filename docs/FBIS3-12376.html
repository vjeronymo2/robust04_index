[passage omitted]    Military sources in Sanaa have revealed that a number of  soldiers from the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade were ambushed  yesterday morning in the town of Zinjibar, capital of the Abyan  Governorate, by soldiers from the al-Wahdah Brigade and some YSP  militia. They said that "a limited number of al-'Amaliqah  Brigade soldiers were on their way to al-Razi Hospital in the  town of Ja'ar to collect the body of a colleague of theirs  treacherously killed by soldiers from the Madram Brigade camp,  when they were intercepted and fired on by an armed group in  front of the hospital. Brigade member Hazzam 'Ali Musayli was  wounded."    According to other reports, tanks and howitzer artillery  units from the YSP's al-'Anad camp have moved in the direction  of the areas of al-Milah, al-Hubaylayn, and al-Dali' in the  province of Lahij "to occupy the old partition positions and  prepare to besiege the forces of the (northern) 2nd armored  brigade stationed in the area of al-Milah in Lahij."    "Informed sources" in Aden have been quoted as saying that  at  dawn yesterday 12 tanks tightened their siege of the central  security battalion in the Radfan camp in al-Sawlaban (Aden).  They added that "the supply of water and electricity to the  battlion were still cut off on the direct orders of Aden  Governor Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli who ordered  the expulsion of that battalion from Aden to the remote area of  Dar Sa'd." [passage omitted]    According to reports received in Aden from the Abyan  Governorate, forces of the southern al-Wahdah Brigade "continue  to hunt down members of the Islamic Jihad Organization  concentrated in the al-Maraqishah mountains in the directorate  of Mudiyah."    The same reports revealed "the arrest of 85 Islamic Jihad  members of various Arab nationalities who participated in the  armed clashes in the directorate" since last Monday between  forces of the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade and forces of the  southern al-Wahdah Brigade which came from Hadramaut (some 920  km east of Aden). [passage omitted]    AL-HAYAH learned from YSP sources yesterday that the YSP's  Political Bureau has been in "continuous session" since 'Ali  Salim al-Bid's return to Aden the day before yesterday after  brief visits to Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, and Eritrea  after signing the Pledge and Accord Document in the Jordanian  capital last Sunday. The sources said that "al-Bid returned  secretly to Aden after the discovery that there was going to be  yet another attempt by the air defenses of the al-'Amaliqah  Brigade to target his plane as it crossed the Abyan air space."    They also said that shots were fired by al-'Amaliqah forces  on an Ethiopian Airlines plane over Abyan as it was on a regular  weekly flight to Aden International Airport on the morning of  the day before yesterday but it was not hit.

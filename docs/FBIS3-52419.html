			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, Jan 4 (AFP)--Seven leading Palestinian  personalities currently in Tunis to urge the Palestine  Liberation Organisation to be more democratic last month sent  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat a nine-point memorandum of reform  demands.    The following are the nine points of the document, a copy of  which has been obtained by AFP:    1 - Creation of specialized councils for pursuing national  action with regard to Palestinian autonomy and also with the  Arab and international worlds.    2 - Calling on qualified people and experts to form  councils and the planning and executive structures that depend  on them.    3 - Giving priority to professional and political  competence in forming working groups and negotiating committees  and teams, eliminating favouritism and clan loyalties.    4 - Working out a plan of negotiation based on the text of  the (Israeli-Palestinian) declaration of principles and ensuring  complementarity [as received] and coordination among the various  commissions and negotiating groups.    5 - Forming a supreme authority for guiding, directing and  following up the negotiations process (with Israel).    6 - Forming a Palestinian Development and Reconstruction  Council (PECDAR) based on specific criteria so that it should be  credible in the eyes of (the Palestinian) people and the donors  of funds for building the national economic infrastructure.    7 - Finalising the work of the (PLO) legislative committee  charged with drawing up the basic law -- constitution -- of the  national Palestinian authority in a way that brings out its  democratic nature.    8 - Creating as soon as possible a supreme committee  charged with organising a wide national dialogue grouping all  Palestinian tendencies.    9 - Creating a high consultative committee of experts with  a parallel status to that of the PLO Executive Committee, which  has already been weakened by the departure of several of its  members (hostile to the Washington accord).    In this document, the 120 signatories reaffirm their  determination to make the Israeli-Palestinian accord succeed,  and their attachment to the PLO as the sole representative of  the Palestinian people.</p>

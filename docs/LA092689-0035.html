			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  ABC'S 'LIVING DOLLS': BAD ROLE MODEL FOR COMEDY  </P> <P> This is living?  </P> <P> Premiering at 8:30 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, ABC's "Living Dolls" is  the last of the fall season's new comedies, and the least. If ever there was  evidence of the creative cupboard being bare, this is it -- a "Who's the Boss?"  spinoff that imitates "The Facts of Life."  </P> <P> Why don't they ever clone the good ones?  </P> <P> "Living Dolls" was created by Ross Brown (a former writer and supervising  producer on "The Facts of Life") and will regularly air at 8:30 p.m. Saturdays.  </P> <P> Four teen models live in New York with their agent Trish Carlin (Michael  Learned) and her teen son Rick (David Moscow). There's Emily the black one  (Halle Berry) and Martha the naive one (Allison Elliott). There's also Caroline  the vain and self-centered one (Deborah Tucker) and Charlie the street-tough  one (Leah Remini), a la Blair and Jo of "The Facts of Life."  </P> <P> The Jo replica -- tough exterior hides insecurities -- is the center of the  first two episodes. In tonight's, Samantha Micelli (Alyssa Milano of "Who's the  Boss?") stops in to do a story on the agency for her high school paper and  finds her friend, Charlie, having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a  model in training. Charlie walks out in disgust, but returns when she realizes  she is loved.  </P> <P> On the second episode, Charlie gets into trouble by throwing a birthday party  for herself after her mother rejects her. But everything turns out all right  when she realizes she is loved.  </P> <P> The diversity is awesome.  </P> <P> Learned looks like she made a wrong turn and got lost in "Living Dolls" by  mistake. Remini manages to shine a little, making you wonder what she would do  with material written by adults.  </P> <P> "Living Dolls" is bad enough when it tries to be funny, even worse when it  tries not to be funny. As for the latter, it doesn't have to try. HOWARD  ROSENBERG  </P></p>

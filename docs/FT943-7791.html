			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Fashion: The body as billboard and palette - Me and My Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets art consultant Fausto Calderai who dresses to show clients his discretion and taste Imagine Art-World Man: surely a dyed-in-the-wool aesthete? Scrutinising a Donatello bas-relief he is surely a veritable work of art in himself. Perhaps he wears a three-piece suit in dove-grey, shot with lilac? It is cut from a vicuna-mink super 120 cloth and its high waist is undoubtedly styled a little too emphatically. His lavender silk shirt, buttoned in blonde tortoise shell, is fastened at its promiscuous cuffs by links set with Mesopotamian curios. His delicate, mauve-gloved fingers probably lean on a cane carved from a narwhal tusk topped with a hand-painted glass eye. Dream on] Sadly, the average Art-World Man cuts an unmemorable figure. In spite of being surrounded by a richness of aesthetic stimuli, he tends to subscribe to one of two visually bland dress codes: the formulaic conservatism associated with lawyers and civil servants or the thigh-slapping 'wit' of bond dealers and TV personalities who guffaw over loud ties and conversation-piece cufflinks from Tiffany and Cartier. Fausto Calderai, an art consultant in his late 30s, steers between the two. His Anglepoise lamp figure is clad in matt wool and reminds me of the centenary-celebrating images we have recently seen of Aldous Huxley's beautiful attire. Calderai's sartorial efforts are widely acknowledged - last year he was selected as one of the 'exhibits' in the self-laudatory exhibition organised by the Italian fashion body Pitti Immagine, entitled 'One Hundred Years of Italian Male Elegance'. Calderai's style communicates sobriety but not temperance. His slender, dry-wool suits are easy on the eye and apparently unremarkable until closer inspection yields pleasing details. The fine electric-orange thread lighting up the grey cloth of his suit, like a kinetic flicker dancing across a flat grisaille, and the shaved tufts protruding from his plain white cotton shirts, are virtually undetectable as he strides by along Bond Street. You will not catch him wearing a 'daring' Jeremy Paxman tie, or a 'novelty' waistcoat. 'They don't work,' he says emphatically. 'They highlight a part of your body when the whole figure should be a melange which is harmonious to the eye. And if you're tall (more than 6ft 6in) they look ridiculous.' His other pet hate is baggy clothes, on men or women. Calderai runs a Florence-based art consultancy which offers independent valuations. He advises, rather than trades and enhances his scholarly reputation by occasionally writing articles and books on furniture made by architects and artists. His dress is extremely measured, for he regards it as an eloquent communicator to his potential clients. He strives to project a balance between discretion and aesthetics. 'The typical client wants a valuation on house contents which will be split between the heirs, for in Italy we don't have primogeniture. As most of my clients are afraid of academics and wary of dealers, they will turn to consultants.' Compromise between elegance and practicality is his goal. Passing many hours in private homes, rather than public places, he must melt into the setting and take part in their social occasions. One moment he will be crawling on his hands and knees across a parquet floor to inspect the underbelly of a table, the next scaling a step ladder to reach a painting hung high up under the ceiling of a quattrocento palazzo. Roomy pockets are essential for a lens, a measuring tape and a notebook. Dry wools from English mills serve him well as they do not look shiny or creased after a few climbing or crawling sessions, and he prefers their dated mood. He loathes the faddish taste for cashmere - coats, jerseys, socks - which he thinks are both impractical and expensive. He keeps his luggage modest, for 'it would be considered far too vain to turn up at a house with too many suitcases'. Unlike British professional clothing, in Italy it is incorrect and overdressed to wear a dark suit and black shoes in the morning, so Calderai wears dry brown or grey suits, with a matching, high-buttoned waistcoat and brown shoes for the day, and the same suit, with a low-cut waistcoat and black shoes for dinner. Most of Calderai's suits are made to measure by Di Preta whom he considers superior to the better-known Italian tailor Caraceni because he prefers his suits cut relatively close to the body and 'unstructured so they follow you easily. I don't like very structured suits with big shoulders - like' . . . sniff, sniff . . . 'those body guards you see in Los Angeles.' He despises the florid and attention-seeking style of many, typically Italian, art dealers. 'They look like shop window dummies aping London or New York gents,' he says. He allows himself two areas of 'fantasy' - coat linings and cufflinks. Calderai's cufflinks are by and large costume jewellery rather than family heirlooms: characters from Disney, lewd parts of the anatomy by Vivienne Westwood, kitsch from the 1950s. Pride of place goes to a series of silicon cufflinks made by the Spanish artist Joaquin Blanco in the shape of insects. The delicate turn of his ankle is caressed by knee-high socks so fine that you can almost count the freckles up his instep. Calderai is also opinionated about women's wear. Emphatically out is the modern taste for all-black: 'It can't be beautiful if 99 per cent of women look the same. It's a kind of security and they all end up looking like shop assistants which is rather sad.' Other hates are big furs, though he is not an animal rights supporter, flat shoes - 'so sad and unfeminine, don't you think?' - and the fad for going about stocking-less in the city because 'I just think that a woman without stockings doesn't care and looks dirty'. His biggest criticism of Italian women is their taste for too much gold jewellery during the day and 'those awful tailored gilt earrings favoured by so-called smart Americans'. He loves feathers - 'a woman in feathers, wow]' His advice for a young professional man starting out with a limited budget is to seek good quality second-hand clothes and to have one or two well-made classic suits. 'Have very few things. The most difficult lesson when you're young is to stop buying bits and pieces - you need very few things. Only buy what you really love and wear it all the time. I still wear the two suits I had made when I started out - one of them is my favourite.' There they hang, 18 years later, alongside a dozen others in his dressing room which is styled like a faux-Regency shrine to external sensibilities.</p>

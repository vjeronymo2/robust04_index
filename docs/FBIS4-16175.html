			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Chikin report: "Ending on Health. On Last Day of </F> Spanish Visit Boris Nikolayevich Spoke of Bosnia, Civic  Consensus, and His Own Health"]    [Text] Madrid -- Apart from the seven documents signed by  the Russian leadership in Spain, the leadership was also  enriched with theoretical knowledge about the achievement of  civic peace in the country. The fact is that in October 1977,  two years after Franco's death, the so-called "Moncloa Pact" --  an agreement reminiscent of the "Agreement on Civic Peace" that  is in preparation in Russia -- was signed in Spain. In the  document all Spain's political parties, trade unions,  entrepreneurs, and, naturally, its government agreed that it was  time to build democracy peacefully in the country. The 101-page  document was closely studied by the Russian president. Boris  Yeltsin spent several hours with Spanish Premier Gonzalez to  learn all the details of this consensus.    As for the practical application of foreign experience, the  Russian president made the following comment at a press  conference: "We intend to sign the document 28 April and so far  we are not backtracking from that. It is supported by the  leadership of the State Duma and the Federation Council, the  government, most parties and social movements, and so forth. I  think that most will sign on the 28th, and the document will  later be open for signing by those who want to do so."    It so happened that the state visit to Spain was held in the  context of Bosnia. On Tuesday Boris Yeltsin reiterated that the  "decision to carry out bombing raids was irresponsible, and full  responsibility for the possible consequences will lie with those  who made this decision." From Russia's standpoint, the outcome  of the conflict should be settled solely by negotiations. This  is what Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is  currently in the former Yugoslavia, is trying to achieve. The  Russian president stated that, if necessary, he is prepared to  urgently send Foreign Minister Kozyrev there too.    The third and final day of the visit was spent in Barcelona  and was full of different official events. Yeltsin met with  Spanish doctors, whom he again thanked for their brilliant  operation in 1990 after his aircraft's unsuccessful landing in  Barcelona. In general the problem of the Russian president's  health was not sidestepped. The newspapers have been  enthusiastically picking up on this topic. B. Yeltsin said  literally the following on the subject:    "I would like everyone my age to have the same health as I  have. Can someone who always plays a really hard game of tennis  for 90 minutes (and with partners who are masters and  meritorious masters of sport), someone who swims in the Black  Sea in March when the water temperature is four degrees, have  poor health? Someone who works 16-18 hours a day with hardly  any days off.... That's something to be envied.    "The other day I told my doctors -- let's do an all-day  checkup this year, with any journalist present who wants to be.  In any laboratory...they can do blood tests...do anything they  want, you understand, to see how strong I am, how.... And we  can do this all day, so that not only Russia but the entire  world will know what is inside me."</p>

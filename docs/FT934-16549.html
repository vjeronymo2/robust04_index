			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Guilty plea to golf course charges A BANKRUPT Japanese company pleaded guilty, in a US federal court in Nevada yesterday, to four criminal charges involving a fradulent scheme to oversell memberships of a golf course, the Justice Department said, Reuter reports from Washington. It said Ken International, which developed golf courses in Japan and the US, pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and transferring fraudulent proceeds through foreign commerce into the US. The company and its sole shareholder, Mr Ken Mizuno, had conspired with another Japanese company to sell too many memberships at the Ibaragi Country Club in Japan. Although the two companies had advertised that they would sell only 1,830 full memberships in the club, they sold 52,000 memberships, valued at Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m), from 1988 to 1991. Of this amount, Ken International sent Dollars 250m to the US. As part of the plea-bargaining deal entered before a federal judge in Las Vegas, Ken International agreed that it would forfeit assets of Dollars 265m, according to the US Justice Department. According to court papers, Ken International in the US had engaged in numerous financial transactions with the fraudulently obtained money, and had sought to conceal or disguise the source of the funds.</p>

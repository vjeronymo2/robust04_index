			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: PowerGen Companies often fear they will be thought lacking in imagination if they decide to hand back surplus cash to shareholders. The truth is that investors would prefer to have their money back rather than see it frittered away in wasteful ventures. In that sense PowerGen should be applauded for yesterday's share buy-back. It sets an example that others should follow, and not just in the electricity industry where buy-backs show signs of becoming fashionable. Yet PowerGen's move is welcome for more than reasons of principle. Having spent just Pounds 13m on its own shares PowerGen was rewarded with a 5 per cent jump in its price. The market reaction is not as disproportionate as it looks. PowerGen has authority to buy up to 10 per cent of its own capital and the market is assuming that given its modest 15 per cent gearing it will make further purchases. Earnings would be enhanced even at yesterday's higher price. Indeed earnings could rise by around 5 per cent if the company bought back 10 per cent of its capital. That would help offset a lean period next year as PowerGen's UK sales decline with its market share. But even having spent Pounds 400m on its own shares, PowerGen would quickly run up surplus cash again. It would then have to decide whether to come back for more.</p>

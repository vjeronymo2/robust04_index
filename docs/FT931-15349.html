			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Commissioner aims to broaden scope of EC competition policy THE European Community's competition policy will be exercised in a determined, pragmatic and even-handed way 'without ideological preconceptions', the new competition commissioner said yesterday. Strict competition principles will not be the sole guidelines for EC anti-trust and subsidy decisions over the next two years, Mr Karel Van Miert told the Financial Times. Mr Van Miert, a Flemish socialist who took over the portfolio a week ago, indicated he would model EC competition policy on the German and Japanese approaches, taking into account other influences, including industrial, environmental, regional and social pressures. 'I'm inclined to look at the whole picture. Since I've received specific responsibility for competition I will look after that element first. But I will not lose sight of the other considerations and other interests involved,' he said. Mr Van Miert, 50, formerly commissioner for transport and consumer policy, replaced Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's new trade commissioner, who was known as a hardliner on competition policy. The move was quietly welcomed by EC members like France and Italy, which bore the brunt of Sir Leon's campaign against illegal state subsidies. But Mr Van Miert warned yesterday there would be no change to existing rules and pragmatism would not be 'a way of putting off things and being relaxed about (competition)'. Mr Van Miert has already won his free market spurs: as transport commissioner, he pushed through liberalisation of the EC air transport sector, which should bring down European air fares. He said state aids would provide the biggest challenge of his term in office, which will last only two years, assuming the Maastricht treaty is ratified. In the past two years, he has approved state aid to Sabena, the Belgian airline, and Iberia, the Spanish national carrier, on condition that the companies were restructured and government did not inject more subsidies. Mr Van Miert indicated he might be more flexible than his predecessor about the timescale for reducing state subsidies to individual companies, although the objective - to avoid distortions of the EC single market - would be the same. 'I don't share the view that the only credo should be less and less state intervention. But if there is still state intervention it needs to be efficient,' he said.</p>

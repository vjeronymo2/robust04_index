			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Prison officers urged to fight reforms Delegates from the Prison Officers Association were yesterday urged to mount an intensive campaign against government legislation which they fear will neuter their trade union rights. Mr Brian Caton, association vice-chairman, said the government's proposed criminal justice reforms were an attack on the POA's democratic right to represent prison workers and would only perpetuate troubled industrial relations. He said that a rise in lawlessness in jails had coincided with the prison service's drive towards efficiency savings. In the past five years, Mr Caton said, the prisons had witnessed nearly 30,000 assaults by prisoners on staff and fellow inmates, more than 13,000 drug finds, over 200 suicides, 79 hostage incidents and more than 100 riots or protests. He said: 'The cost to the taxpayer of this unchecked lawlessness amounts to Pounds 1bn.' He condemned the criminal justice and public order bill currently going through parliament, which he said did nothing to address the 'horrendous spiral of violence' in prisons. Delegates at a meeting, held at the Trades Union Congress headquarters in London, were told they should lobby their MPs to change the bill. Mr David Evans, POA general secretary, said it 'neuters the right of prison officers to carry out their lawful authority.' Key clauses in the bill make it an offence for anyone to induce a prison officer to withhold his services and for any officer to refuse to perform a duty imposed under prison rules. The association says the law will have 'profound consequences for free collective bargaining' because it will allow the home secretary to regulate pay. It will also enable parts of a prison to be managed separately by different private companies, and require prison officers working in the state sector to transfer to private jails if necessary. The association has already had its right to take industrial action withdrawn because of a court ruling last autumn.</p>

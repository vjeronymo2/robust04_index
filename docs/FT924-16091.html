			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / First ITV network director confirmed ITV CONFIRMED last night that Mr Marcus Plantin, director of programmes at London Weekend Television, is to be ITV's first network director. The senior appointment in the creation of a centralised national ITV network means that Mr Plantin will be responsible for commissioning and scheduling programmes worth more than Pounds 500m a year. Mr Plantin, 46, has a background in popular programmes - The Two Ronnies and The Generation Game at the BBC and Blind Date at LWT - and has been the favourite for some time to work with Mr Andrew Quinn, the chief executive of the ITV Association. He will take up the post in the near future. A significant barrier to the deal was the London ITV company's share option scheme, with which the top layer of management was tied to the company with golden handcuffs before last year's tenders for new ITV licences. If LWT's share price passes a set threshold by the end of next year, a number of executives will become millionaires. It is believed that Mr Plantin would have been included in that pay-out, but he is being bought out of the share option deal for an undisclosed proportion of what he might have received. The buy-out is being funded 50 per cent by the ITV companies and 50 per cent by LWT. 'I would not have accepted the job unless it was a satisfactory deal,' Mr Plantin said, but declined to say how long his contract will run. That suggests that he has driven a hard bargain over the length of contract. 'Clearly to deliver the goods for ITV you will need to have more than two years,' Mr Plantin said. He said his new job was about 'buying the best programmes, the best ideas and overseeing that they are scheduled in the right place to ensure they do the job for ITV.' The appointment was announced just before a presentation to more than 1,000 representatives from advertising agencies and advertisers on the future strategy of ITV. They were told that ITV intended to improve its 41 per cent share of viewing in four-channel homes while raising its proportion of young, upmarket viewers. ITV's audience profile is still downmarket. Mr Quinn also disclosed that 54 per cent of new programmes being commissioned for next year had gone to independent producers, a process that will accelerate the casualisation of the commercial television industry.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Lord Lane a 'scapegoat' for justice failures LORD Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, yesterday spoke of the 'outrage' felt by the judiciary at attempts to make Lord Lane, the outgoing Lord Chief Justice, 'the scapegoat for failures of the criminal justice system'. The Master of the Rolls was addressing more than 60 judges, who together with barristers and solicitors, had crowded Lord Lane's court to pay tribute to him on his retirement after 12 years in office. Lord Donaldson said that for the first time he could break the judiciary's 'Trappist vows' and speak publicly of the admiration and affection in which Lord Lane was held. 'I can give voice to the anger and disgust which we have felt at the campaign of calumny waged against you in recent months,' he said. Lord Lane, 73, came under heavy criticism in the media for his handling of the first appeal of the Birmingham Six, convicted of an IRA bomb attack. His refusal to apologise to the men when they were finally released, or to acknowledge the part courts played in keeping them in prison for 16 years, led to calls from more than 100 MPs for his resignation. His actions were widely seen as a significant factor in the loss of public confidence in the criminal justice system and the judiciary. Lord Donaldson said judges accepted public criticism as an occupational hazard, and when based on fact rather than hindsight this was valuable. 'But what has outraged all of us is the spectacle of attempts to make you the scapegoat for failures of the criminal justice system, the cause of which, however defined, lay outside your control or responsibility. This process has gone far beyond the point at which it could be excused as confusion of thought.' Lord Donaldson said Lord Lane had faced formidable problems when he came into office. Administration of the criminal courts was in disarray, there was widespread criticism of inconsistencies in sentencing and anxieties about the growing prison population. He had tackled all these problems, urging that custodial sentences should not be a day longer than necessary, and had set in train many guideline decisions on sentencing policy. Lord Lane had been a party to many decisions which would continue to shape criminal law for years to come. Most recently he had been involved in modernising the law on rape in marriage. Lord Donaldson added: 'In the eyes of the profession, there are judges and great judges. Your place will be found in the latter category.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Aristide has officially rejected the  legislators' plan voted last week in the Chamber of Deputies.  The president-in-exile considers this plan not in compliance  with the Governors' Island accord signed in New York last July  and even counterproductive to implementation of this accord for  the reestablishment of democracy in Haiti. President Aristide  made these statements on 5 March during a meeting with UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Jean-Bertrand Aristide  talked for more than an hour with Mr. Butrus-Ghali while several  thousand Haitians demonstrated near UN headquarters in support  of the president-in-exile.    In a news conference following talks with the UN secretary  general, the president-in-exile accused the United States of  playing a double game. According to Father Aristide, while  Washington publicly reasserts its willingness to support the  return of democracy to Haiti, it has simultaneously submitted a  draft resolution to the UN Security Council which, he says, is  the other side of the coin. For the president-in-exile, there is  no possible solution outside the framework of the Governors  Island accord.    We refuse to participate in the delay tactics and political  cynicism of the international community, which is ambiguous and  weak, says the president-in-exile, and which lacks the  willingness to implement the process decided on Governors  Island. He acknowledges, however, a firmer commitment from  France and Canada. In an effort to afford a quick, direct  solution to the crisis, President Aristide again asked for the  application of a strict and total embargo. He said that  international military intervention is unnecessary. He demanded  above all the departure of the authors of the coup d'etat before  considering the nomination of a new prime minister and the  installation of a concord government.    According to a high-ranking UN employee who attended the  talks between President Aristide and UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, the president-in-exile appeared at the same time  intransigent and disappointed. This high-ranking employee  indicated that Jean-Bertrand Aristide feels betrayed by the  international community on Governors Island.    In a press release issued after the meeting, the UN  secretary  general stated that the crisis settlement plan voted by the  Haitian legislators constitutes a means of overcoming the  deadlock and achieving implementation of the Governors Island  accord, not the substitution of this accord.    Butrus-Ghali and Jean-Bertrand Aristide promised to continue  to explore the means of solving the crisis. It should be  recalled that on the eve of this meeting between the UN  secretary general and the president-in-exile, the group of the  Four Friends of Haiti submitted to the UN Security Council a new  draft resolution for reinforcing the international sanctions  against Haiti. The draft resolution provides for a total trade  embargo except for food and drugs, the cancellation of  noncommercial flights to and from Haiti, as well as travel  restrictions on the coupists and their relatives abroad. The  Security Council is due to make a decision within 15 days of  this resolution.</p>

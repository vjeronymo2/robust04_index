			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar gains Foreign exchanges were dominated yesterday by rumours surrounding the unscheduled meeting of President Clinton and Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, writes Philip Gawith. The meeting immediately prompted talk of an early tightening of US policy, causing the dollar to strengthen. The US currency finished in London at DM1.6961, more than one-and-a-half pfennigs up on Thursday's close of DM1.68. It was also stronger against sterling closing at Dollars 1.4888 from Dollars 1.4975. It closed marginally higher against the yen, at Y106.035 from Y105.695. Markets were otherwise fairly quiet in the absence of any fresh data to trade off. In Europe the D-Mark finished little changed. Against the French franc it closed in London at FFr3.407 from FFr3.408 on Thursday. It was slightly stronger against the Italian lira closing at L989.3 from L987.7. A White House spokesman said there had been no discussion at the meeting about next week's gathering of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. He also said there had been 'no messages given, and no messages delivered.' Markets, however, were convinced the meeting must have had monetary policy import. Some speculated that Mr Clinton had called the Fed chairman in to emphasise that the Administration does not want higher interest rates. More popular was the view that instead of tightening the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points, the Fed might lift the discount rate by 50 points. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said this would be a 'much more aggressive signal' about policy intentions than a smaller rise in the repo rate. He said the speculation now was that the Fed had got itself into a lose-lose situation. If it does not tighten policy, Mr Greenspan's credibility will be damaged as he will be seen to have bowed to White House pressure. But if he makes a substantial move, this will unsettle markets because it will require a revision about the likely pace of Fed tightening. Rumours about the White House meeting resonated quite strongly in the UK and German interest rate futures markets. The June short sterling future lost four basis points to trade at 94.81 yesterday evening, while the December future was 10 points lower at 94.40. In Germany the moves were slightly less pronounced with the June euromark contract losing a point to 94.51 and the December contract eight points off at 94.91. In both cases the fall in futures prices reflects a market perception that higher US rates will make it more difficult for European countries to cut rates. German call money moved in the opposite direction to the futures, falling to 5.70/5.80 per cent from 5.80/5.85 per cent. Call money is now well below the 5.89/5.90 per cent at which the Bundesbank allocated the bulk of repo's this week. Analysts believe the Bundesbank might now let its repo rate fall as low as 5.80 per cent from the current level of 5.88 per cent. Conditions in the UK discount market were easier yesterday with the Bank of England speedily dispatching a Pounds 1.55bn shortage.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Weather men 'worth Dollars 20bn' Weather forecasts save the world economy some Dollars 20bn-Dollars 40bn a year, the World Meteorological Organisation claimed today. Benefits from meteorological and hydrological services are typically five to 10 times the amount spent of around Dollars 4bn a year, the WMO says, Frances Williams writes from Geneva. Examples presented to an international conference in Geneva, which ends today, include rockets used to combat potentially catastrophic hail in Hungary, typhoon warnings in Vietnam and extensive benefits to farming and aviation. The British Met Office said earlier this week that for Britain alone, weather forecasts save almost Pounds 1bn nationwide.</p>

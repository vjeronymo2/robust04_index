			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Pirelli splits its image in Europe - The Italian group is set to reposition itself in the replacement tyre market Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, has launched a new brand strategy as part of an effort to increase its share of the European replacement tyre market. The move comes in the face of what Carlo Banchieri, deputy chairman of the tyre operation's management board, calls the most difficult conditions in his 30-year experience of the industry. The key change for Pirelli is the introduction of what Banchieri describes as 'second- and third-tier' brands to complement the main Pirelli brand. These will be aimed at owners of Europe's population of cars older than three years, looking for a cheaper deal. The replacement sector is substantially larger than that for original equipment tyres supplied to car and truck makers. It is also the main source of profitability - or in some cases restricting losses - for the industry at a time when Pirelli and other tyre makers are being forced to digest sharp price cuts demanded by vehicle producers. According to Banchieri, catering to the replacement market with subsidiary brands will make it easier to retain the premium pricing and image of the Pirelli brand name. Preserving that image has become increasingly difficult in the replacement market. Pirelli already owns and produces some secondary branded tyres, notably Courier in the UK and Ceat in Italy, but they are mainly national brands. The group's strategic sales and marketing focus have been overwhelmingly on the Pirelli brand. To compete in the cheaper replacement sectors, the company's practice has been to keep in production some Pirelli-branded tyres launched as long as 10 years ago. These are likely already to have been superseded by technically superior products, but they are relatively cheap to produce. One problem with this approach is that the 'old' tyres have to be sold at a discount to more recent offerings, and discounting is detrimental to Pirelli's image. For this reason though the discounts have not been sufficient to give what Banchieri regards as an adequate market share. By developing a pan-European secondary brands strategy, Pirelli is doing no more than recognising that European replacement tyre markets are starting to move towards the North American pattern. In the latter there is not only a profusion of tyre makers' second- or third-tier brands such as Goodyear's Kelly Springfield; large retailing groups and even the big oil companies sell vast quantities of tyres under their own brand names. For example, the world's single biggest retailer of tyres is superstore chain Sears, Roebuck, which sells some 10m a year. A lot of Pirelli tyres are sold through Sears, supplied by its US Armstrong Tire subsidiary. Far from pioneering second- or third-tier brands in Europe, Pirelli is to some extent following the path already taken by rivals such as Michelin with its Kleber brand and Continental with Uniroyal Semperit. More than 20 per cent of Michelin's sales are of 'house' brands. Of German rival Continental's 100-strong product range, only a little more than a half are branded Continental. Banchieri acknowledges that the initiative will probably be confined to the cheaper end of the market. 'I cannot imagine a Porsche with second-level tyres,' he says. But owners of, for example, five- or six-year-old BMWs are targets. Pirelli hopes to increase its share of the European replacement tyre market to around 13 1/2 per cent, from just over 10 per cent. Conversely, says Banchieri, it has been ready to cede some unprofitable business in the original equipment sector. Banchieri says it is also likely to settle at around 13.5 per cent, against 16 per cent a couple of years ago. Between clashes with former employer General Motors, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has just helped Pirelli most of the way there. Unwilling to go along with price-cuts demanded by Volkswagen's mercurial and flamboyant Spanish production and purchasing director, Pirelli has lost its original equipment business with Volkswagen, although ironically it is still supplying its Spanish subsidiary Seat. That means a further 0.3-0.4 percentage points loss of original equipment market share. In another departure from past practice, Pirelli is to cut the time-scale for introducing the complete size range for new generations of tyres from two years to 3-4 months. Traditionally, Pirelli and other manufacturers have synchronised the launch of a tyre with the car for which it was developed, and only in the size range applicable to that car. Other sizes would be phased in over two years. 'This was acceptable at a time when life cycles of the product were long - maybe seven or eight years. But it was not best practice,' says Banchieri. The Pirelli name will be applied only to state-of-the-art products. Existing older ones will be phased out. At least two new Pirelli branded tyres will be introduced each year for the next few years.</p>

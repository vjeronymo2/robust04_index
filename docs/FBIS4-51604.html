			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Too Premature To Wrap Up Nakhon Si Thammarat </F> Case"]    [Text] Yesterday, Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset  announced that a woman was arrested in connection with an  explosion at the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station which  killed three people and injured at least 27 others.    The woman arrested in Narathiwat allegedly confessed to  setting off a grenade in order to kill an unfaithful lover after  arranging to meet him at a noodle stall on the platform of the  Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station. She told police the  grenade had belonged to her ex-husband, a soldier.    Now it seems the authorities have decided to wrap up the  case  and are willing to rule out the possibility that saboteurs  seeking to discredit the government were behind the blast.    It comes as no surprise that this woman has been arrested,  because ever since the blast police officers including national  police chief Pratin Santipraphop have said a "soured love  affair" was behind the bombing. [sentence as published] Army  chief Wimon Wongwanit also said "an affair" was behind the  incident.    Whether the woman has been made a scapegoat or not is  subject  to debate.    Several lawyers have already threatened to file defamation  suits against police officers who had claimed, allegedly without  substantive evidence, that jealousy involving the noodle vendor  was the motive behind the blast. The lawyers are representing  Sutchai Butngam, the vendor who was one of the three killed and  said to be involved in a love triangle.    Citing love triangles as reasons for bomb blasts in Thailand  is nothing new for the police. In February last year, an  ex-soldier was charged with murder after he confessed to sending  a parcel bomb which exploded at the Samsen Noi post office,  killing a postal officer and injuring five others.    The ex-soldier, according to police, intended the parcel  bomb  for a female department store employee after she had decided to  end their relationship in order to marry another man.    The accused parcel bomber later claimed he was tortured by  police into confessing to a crime he did not commit.    There is still a big question mark over whether a failed  love  affair was behind the Nakhon Si Thammarat blast. Political  terrorism should not yet be ruled out as a factor behind last  week's tragic incident.    If Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut or the government  of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai are the targets, then we can  expect to see more bombings. There is little doubt that many  groups are out to discredit the Chuan government and are just  waiting for its collapse so they can get back to business as  usual.    Under no circumstances should we allow certain elements out  to create anarchy in the country to jeopardize our hard-earned  democracy. Intelligence gathering by the police and the Fourth  Army Region based in the South has to be beefed up. As it is  right now, there is a serious gap in the sharing of intelligence  information between the police and military in the South.    Very often, the Fourth Army Region's intelligence network  would be tipped off before certain events occurred. Somehow or  another, for reasons best known to themselves, army intelligence  is often reluctant to let their police counterparts -- who work  with civilians -- in on the information.    When a criminal act keeps repeating itself at a certain  frequency and innocent lives are lost, the authorities in charge  of security have to be more responsible.    There are still many gaps in the Nakhon Si Thammarat bombing  story and, unless there is watertight evidence, the case at this  juncture should not be wrapped up by the authorities in the hope  that the public would conveniently forget about it.</p>

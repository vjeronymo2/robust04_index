			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Lamont tries to change subject THE UK chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, will try to engage his fellow EC finance ministers in matters other than the French referendum on Maastricht and turbulence on foreign exchange markets when they gather for informal weekend discussions in Bath this evening. Current strains in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and the Community's increasingly lacklustre growth prospects can be expected to play a big part in working sessions tomorrow. But the chancellor has also placed on the agenda the EC's relations with non-EMS countries, the trade problems of eastern and central Europe, and his belief that finance ministers should have an expanded role in Community decision-making. As if to emphasise the non-Maastricht element of the talks, the ministers and central bank governors will be joined for lunch tomorrow by Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He is likely to criticise the limited access granted by the EC to exports from eastern and central Europe. However, European monetary officials are uncertain how far such issues will grab the attention of ministers, most of whom are beginning to suffer at first hand the effects of the Bundesbank's high interest rate policy to curb the inflationary pressures of German unification. The European Commission, which is revising its economic forecasts, now expects the European economy will grow by only around 1.25 per cent this year and next, against earlier expectations of annual growth of about 2 per cent. Although the ministers will refrain from overt 'German bashing' at the meeting, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the independent Bundesbank, will be left in no doubt as to the problems that Germany's money market interest rates of just under 10 per cent are causing for the rest of the Community. Mr Schlesinger in particular will be urged to reconsider German interest rate levels in the light of lower than expected inflation in the German federal states and growing signs of slowdown in Germany's industrial economy. The meeting in Bath has been widely billed as preparing contingency measures to combat financial market turbulence in the event of a French No vote on September 20. But officials stressed yesterday that 'it will not be a forum for drawing up battle plans'. Such an approach could give the unwelcome impression to financial markets that ministers already expect the French referendum to reject the Maastricht treaty. Instead, the meeting is likely to have a more general discussion of market developments and to reaffirm last Friday's statement by EC finance ministers which stressed that the EMS defence mechanisms have already been activated, and which ruled out a realignment of the ERM parities.</p>

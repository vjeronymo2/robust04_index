			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FORMER HAAS SECURITIES CHIEF INDICTED IN TS INDUSTRIES STOCK FRAUD CASE  </P> <P> The former chairman of the defunct Haas Securities Corp. was indicted in New  York Monday on stock fraud and other charges involving the securities of a  former Orange County company and two other firms.  </P> <P> Eugene K. Laff, 51, was indicted on 15 counts of fraud, conspiracy and other  charges stemming from an alleged scheme to manipulate the prices of  over-the-counter stocks between January, 1986, and May, 1988. The counts also  include a charge of obstructing an investigation of the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> Among the companies whose securities were involved in the alleged manipulation  was TS Industries Inc., an insulation manufacturer headquartered in Huntington  Beach before relocating to Salt Lake City last fall.  </P> <P> Former Haas President Stanley Aslanian Jr. has already pleaded guilty to  conspiracy in the case, which came to light as Haas was liquidated in the  aftermath of the stock market crash of October, 1987. The market collapse  yielded evidence of stock manipulation at a number of other securities firms  that federal prosecutors are also investigating.  </P> <P> Acting U.S. Atty. Benito Romano said Laff and co-conspirators used a number of  means to raise and maintain the prices of the shares of the small companies,  commonly called "penny stocks."  </P> <P> To create the appearance of demand for the shares, they sold stock into  accounts in the name of Henry Lorin, a stock promoter associated with the firm,  according to prosecutors. They allegedly kept share prices from declining by  buying up most of what came onto the market.  </P> <P> These means enabled them to raise and maintain prices, even when orders to sell  the stock exceeded those to buy it. The companies involved were TS Industries,  Flores de New Mexico Inc. and Big O Tires Inc.  </P> <P> Laff, of Greenwich, Conn., also published inaccurate information on Big O Tires  in an effort to keep its stock prices up, the indictment said. On occasion,  Haas also discouraged or refused to accept sell orders from customers for some  of the stock.  </P> <P> Prices of the manipulated stocks collapsed when Haas went under.  </P> <P> TS Industries stock plunged from $34.50 per share before the 1987 market crash  to $2 a share in the following quarter. The stock currently trades at about 53  cents per share.  </P> <P> TS Industries Chairman Harry Woodcock once owned 2 million shares of the  company's stock. He said the price collapse caused a significant personal loss  and damaged the reputation of the businesses that he and his wife founded in  1977.  </P> <P> "We were battered. We lost customers when they learned what was going on in New  York, and they didn't want to be involved with us," Haas said by telephone  Monday from his home in Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Woodcock said he hasn't followed the investigation closely in recent months. He  said he couldn't comment on the indictment because he didn't know the specific  charges brought against Laff.  </P> <P> "We've tried to go on with things," said Woodcock, who has stepped down from  his position as TS Industry's chief executive and is not involved in the  company's day-to-day operations. Stung by its decline in business, the firm has  consolidated and is selling off its foam insulation operation to reduce debt.  </P> <P> Woodcock, 55, said he is chagrined by the stock-related events that began in  1986.  </P> <P> "A couple of years ago, things seemed wonderful," he said. "Now I don't have a  job."  </P> <P> As TS Industry's stock price rose, the firm was making investments that turned  sour. For example, the company spent more than $2 million to build an  insulation plant in Grenada as part of a U.S. government program that faltered.  </P> <P> "I didn't know Wall Street, and I never cared to know it," Woodcock said. "In  1985, we were a private company that made $1 million. (Haas) approached us  about going public, and initially we said no."  </P> <P> Woodcock, who testified before the grand jury, said he doesn't plan to file a  lawsuit against Haas Securities. "We don't know that they did anything to us  that was illegal," he said.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory organization that  oversees activities of the over-the-counter stock market, has fined Laff  $15,000, censured him and suspended him for 2 years from any supervisory  position at another NASD member firm.  </P> <P> John Lang, an attorney for Laff, said his client is "completely innocent" and  confident he will be exonerated. The indictment is based in part on the  testimony of witnesses, including Aslanian, who were given special deals by  prosecutors in exchange for their cooperation, Lang said.  </P> <P> Laff faces up to 5 years in jail and a maximum fine of $250,000 on each count,  Romano said. Aslanian is awaiting sentencing.  </P></p>

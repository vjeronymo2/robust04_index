			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sutcliffe Speakman plans restructuring SUTCLIFFE Speakman, whose core businesses relate to activated carbon technology and related equipment applications, is restructuring its balance sheet and raising equity to fund development. It is selling John F Seyfried &amp; Sons, its food merchanting subsidiary and the last of the non-core businesses, for Pounds 1 plus net indebtedness expected to be Pounds 521,000. Results for the year ended March 31 1993, the first under the stewardship of the new board, have also been published. These showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.56m (Pounds 2.7m) after restructuring costs of Pounds 5.83m (Pounds 560,000). An operating profit of Pounds 214,000 was achieved in the second half, primarily due to both Barnebey &amp; Sutcliffe in the US, now the most profitable part of the group, and Sutcliffe Croftshaw in the UK performing strongly. Sutcliffe Speakman Carbons had not yet returned to profitability. The capital restructuring involves: raising Pounds 5.6m net through a 9-for-20 rights issue at 8.5p, against yesterday's closing price of 12p; converting the 7 per cent preference shares issued primarily to banks and finance companies into 17.4m ordinary and cancelling the arrears of dividend; releasing Pounds 2m liability in respect of the lease purchase agreements between the company and Lombard North Central and British Linen Shipping, and issuing 11m shares to the finance companies; placing 6.6m of the conversion shares and 4.2m of the finance company shares at 8.5p each; cancelling the Pounds 333,451 preference dividend arrears and making a scrip issue to holders on the basis of 2.456 shares for every preference; consolidating the 1p shares into 5p shares and reducing the capital to eliminate the deficit on distributable reserves of Pounds 8m. New banking facilities have also been arranged. Turnover in the period under review was Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 30.7m). Losses per share were doubled to 4.2p. The majority of the exceptional costs related to plant write-downs and restructuring provisions in rationalising the UK carbon manufacturing facility at Leigh. The company said that would significantly improve the prospects for restoring Sutcliffe Speakman Carbons to profitability, and was made possible by the success in re-establishing a working contract with the Sri Lankan associate. Carbon sales from Leigh in April and May were showing an improvement on the average monthly level in the second half of last year.</p>

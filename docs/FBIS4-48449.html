			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>   [Text] The ANC's think-tank, the National Institute for  Economic Policy, has completed research showing the full cost of  the reconstruction and development programme [RDP] will run into  R[Rand]80bn-R90bn over five years.    The figure includes central government and parastatal  spending, and no breakdown between the two components was  available yesterday.    Before the election, ANC officials said the cost to central  government would be R39bn over five years, but economists said  the figure appeared understated within the context of the  overall amount.    Institute head Max Sisulu confirmed the full programme would  cost at least R80bn, but declined to say what portion would be  financed via the Budget. He confirmed that spending in the  fifth year of the programme was estimated at R39bn (including  parastatal expenditure). Private sector expenditure, for  instance on housing, was not included in the estimate. Housing  would be financed mainly via the Budget.    He said the institute's task had been to identify savings  within the existing Budget and the scope for further spending,  given conservative assumptions. These assumptions meant in the  short-term there was little that could change. As the programme  went on, the assumptions could be relaxed.    Key assumptions for the first two years included that there  would be no foreign grants, no major taxation changes and no  further selling of strategic stockpiles. But the situation was  assumed to have changed in later years.    The model also assumed a given GDP growth rate, inflation  and  remuneration packages in the short-run.    Criteria had been drawn up to rank programmes in order of  importance. A major effort had been made to link the RDP to  budgetary planning, hence this emphasis.    Sisulu, who is an ANC MP, said he expected the research to  be  released soon.    The Development Bank has drawn up a model costing a  programme  similar to the RDP, and found that overall spending (government  and parastatal) of almost R57bn over five years would cause  government debt to explode. Such a progamme would be  unsustainable even if the economy grew at almost 6 percent by  the end of the period.</p>

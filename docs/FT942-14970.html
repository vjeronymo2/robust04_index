			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Globex The Chicago Board of Trade's decision not to participate in the restructured Globex appears to cast a long shadow over the futures trading system. Perversely, however, the withdrawal of the world's biggest futures exchange may yet turn out to be Globex's salvation. The unhappy relationship between the system's partners has dogged its development. Reuters will at least be relieved that that uncertainty has been resolved. There is only likely to be a small loss of terminals as a result of CBoT's move. Despite its size, CBoT accounted for just 5 per cent of Globex's transactions. But CBoT's withdrawal may ease the fears of other exchanges concerning Globex's governance. Now that a new agreement is being drawn up, other exchanges, such as Liffe and the DTB, may be tempted to sign up to the system - especially if it is able to offer a bund contract. That may be sufficient to give the network critical mass. The experience of Matif has already shown that Globex is a technical success. The big uncertainty is whether the concept of a round-the-clock, round-the-world futures trading market is a valid one. Even if it succeeds, Globex will take a long time to catch on. The financial impact on Reuters is only likely to prove marginal either way. Reuters has already written off its investment in developing the network. The healthy progress of Instinet and Dealing 2000/2 is likely to mask any further disappointment.</p>

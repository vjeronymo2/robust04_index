			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / A profitable homecoming: FT writers examine the contribution of Chinese entrepreneurs to the wave of investment in their ancestral birthplace Mr Kitti Dumnernchanwanit, president of a Thai industrial conglomerate, last month agreed on a Dollars 1bn forestry, pulp and paper project in China's Guangdong province. The deal, part of the wave of foreign investment that has swept into China recently, underlines the leading role that ethnic Chinese from throughout south-east Asia are playing in the country's economic boom. 'I am a Chinese, but was born in Thailand,' Mr Kitti says. 'I always realise that for a human being it is a must to bring progress and prosperity to his country of origin.' From the launch of China's 'open door' reforms in 1979 until the end of last year, Dollars 56bn of foreign investment has poured into the country; Dollars 12bn was invested in 1991 alone, nearly double the amount of each of the previous three years, according to official Chinese figures. The acceleration is likely to have continued this year as a result of a new push by Beijing for growth. Determining the origin of investments is difficult because most of it is done through companies in Hong Kong. A large part is coming from Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese investors - communities that naturally regard China as their homeland. But significant amounts are also coming from the rapidly growing economies of south-east Asia. Though its scale is difficult to quantify, there are plenty of investment examples. Indonesia's Salim group, run by Mr Liem Sioe Liong, is involved in many projects in China, including water treatment and power plants to supply industrial estates and towns. Lippo group, another Indonesian conglomerate, has investment proposals through its Hong Kong arm totalling Dollars 1bn, including a deep water port in Fujian province. Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, founded by the ethnic Chinese Sophonpanich family, has opened a branch in Shantou which will process inward remittances from ethnic Chinese in south-east Asia. Investments of the Charoen Pokphand group, the biggest Thai investor in China, include animal feed mills, chicken farms, a motorcycle factory and a brewery. Mr Robert Kuok, a Malaysian Chinese tycoon, is a partner in the Beijing World Trade Centre, an office, conference and hotel complex which is the country's largest commercial property project. His Shangri-La hotels are in several Chinese cities, and he is investing in other projects, including one in his ancestral city of Fuzhou in the south. For the ethnic Chinese in south-east Asia, there are cultural as well as business reasons for investing in their homeland. Many have only loose connections with China, their forebears having migrated generations ago. However, emotional attachments are strong and knowledge of Chinese dialects remains widespread. 'For us to move to China is quite easy because of the language, and we all have the Chinese mentality,' says Mr Prasong Panichpakdee, managing director of Thailand's Somprasong Land Development, which is building condominiums in China. Throughout south-east Asia, ethnic Chinese are the main entrepreneurs and dominate business activity in most countries. Their investment is vital for continuing growth. Consequently, a significant diversion of funds to China could have economic and political repercussions in the region. A Singapore-based investment analyst says: 'The governments in this region have not yet woken up to the volume of investment now going to China - it could mean precious investment funds draining away from the region. That would only cause more anti-Chinese resentment, especially in Indonesia and Malaysia.' Indeed, many overseas Chinese feel discriminated against in their home countries, despite their economic power. In Malaysia, where they make up about 30 per cent of the population, they face officially sanctioned discrimination in areas ranging from allocation of equity issues to quotas on educational opportunities. Since 1971, partly in response to anti-Chinese riots and concern about Chinese control of the economy, the policy of the Malay-dominated government has emphasised discrimination in favour of Malays. The aim was to increase their participation in the economy and prevent racial conflict. According to official figures, Malays now control more than 20 per cent of corporate equity. Though race relations have mostly been calm, Malays still resent the economic power of the Chinese, who dislike being treated as second-class citizens. In Singapore, where most people are ethnic Chinese, the government has reversed policy and is now encouraging investment in China. Singapore's economy, along with the economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, has reached the stage where it is targeting high-technology industry for domestic growth, with lower-level manufacturing being farmed out to cheap labour countries such as China and Vietnam. In Thailand, where the overwhelming majority of companies large enough to contemplate foreign investment are controlled by ethnic Chinese families, the wave of investment in China is not controversial. There is enough capital available for investment in Thailand, and no one has publicly expressed fears that investment into China will hinder development. The situation in Indonesia, however, is more delicate. The Chinese community makes up about 4 per cent of the 183m population and dominates the economy. Ethnic Chinese control most conglomerates and large private banks. Diplomats say that Indonesia is quietly putting pressure on its Chinese community not to take money abroad. Many businessmen believe it is fighting an uphill battle. A non-Chinese executive of Bimantara Group, a conglomerate headed by a son of President Suharto, says: 'I think the Chinese are tired (of Indonesia). They will keep their investments here, but profits will go to China. The Chinese are going back to China.' Mr Adrianus Mooy, governor of the central bank, says: 'It's not expected of them to be short-sighted and only to look at the opportunities in Indonesia.' Low wages and a large internal market, he says, will allow Indonesia to remain competitive with southern China. Ethnic Chinese businessmen in Indonesia insist that investments in China are made on the basis of financial pragmatism rather than emotion. China, they say, simply offers better returns than elsewhere. Mr Sofjan Wanandi, chairman of Gemala Group, says conglomerates need to diversify. 'They are big already in Indonesia and want to broaden their base.' He says finance for expansion into China is coming mostly from outside Indonesia because of local high lending rates. 'There is growth available for everybody,' says Mr Gus Nilo, managing director of Sinar Mas, an Indonesian conglomerate with substantial investments in China. 'It's a question of what industry will grow in what country.' The profit motive is clearly the primary force driving south-east Asia's Chinese back to China. The homeland offers a huge market with low land and labour costs, with the prospect of fast growth in domestic sales and exports. Many businessmen return to their ancestral villages because they have connections with local people. Family connections help - relatives may know local government and Communist party officials, and may be officials themselves. Good contacts mean good business. Business, however, may not be the only motive. Mr Wang Sui-lin, professor of sociology at Hong Kong University, says: 'They are returning home in an ultimate sense. Among the overseas Chinese there is a strong sense of ancestral roots. They want the status that comes with the recognition conferred on them by their birthplace, or the birthplace of their ancestors.'</p>

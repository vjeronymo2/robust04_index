			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unidentified correspondent video report from the "Regional </F> News Hookup" program]    [Excerpts] Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the Tibet Autonomous  Regional CPC Committee, recently inspected the Lhasa City Rug  Factory and Doilungdeqen County. At the rug factory, Secretary  Chen inquired about its production and earning of foreign  exchange through exports. At Doilungdeqen County Secretary,  Chen Kuiyuan visited a water plant at more than 4,000 meters  above sea level to call on the workers on the frontline. He  also inquired about the county's agricultural production and  application of science in farming. [Video shows Chen Kuiyuan  talking to workers of Lhasa City Rug Factory and cuts to shots  showing Chen Kuiyuan and other Tibetan leaders visiting farms in  Doilungdeqen County. This is followed by shot showing Chen  being interviewed by an unidentified reporter in a room and then  in an open field in front of several farmers] Chen Kuiyuan was  accompanied on the inspection tour by Lieque, member of the  standing committee of the regional party committee, and Luosang  Toinzhub, vice chairman of the regional government and mayor of  Lhasa.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] What are the plans of the  regional party committee and the regional government to  accomplish the tasks of deepening the reform, accelerating  development, and maintaining stability this year?    [Chen Kuiyuan] This year is a crucial year for reform  throughout the country. In Tibet, the level of economic  development is comparatively low. It is a region with a  comparatively backward economy. This being so, it is all the  more necessary that we seize the opportunity and push forward  Tibet's economic development by deepening reform and opening  wider to the outside world. We are unable to compete with the  rest of the country in our level and speed of economic  development. However, reform is not only a motive force for  further development in developed areas, but is also a strong  motive force for economically backward areas to catch up and  accelerate development. Therefore, we must seize the  opportunity for reform. Through deepening reform, we should  strive to further invigorate Tibet's economy and improve the  people's living standards. This year, what we should do first  is to conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Like the  rest of the country, we should transform the economic structure,  especially the financial structure, the pricing structure, and  the planning structure. The state is aiming at building a  unified and orderly market economy. If there is a lack of  uniformity in economic structure and operating mechanisms, we  will face many obstacles in our economic exchanges and economic  cooperation with the rest of the country, as well as in the  normal operation of the economy in the autonomous region.  Therefore, we must first catch up with the rest of the country  in reform so that we can join other fraternal provinces and  autonomous regions in marching toward the development goals of  the end of this century and even of the next century under  similar economic conditions. [passage omitted]    To develop the economy and improve the people's living, we  need a stable social and economic environment. Judging from the  current environment of Tibet, the general situation is stable.  With the efforts of party committees, governments, and  security, procuratorial, and judicial departments at all levels  and with the support of the people, Tibet's entire social  environment is stable. Of course, internationally, a handful of  people desire to stir up trouble in Tibet. Moreover, they have  spread lies about turbulence and disturbances occurring in  Tibet. In fact, the situation which they have been expecting  has never emerged in Tibet. On the contrary, people here are  arduously participating in socialist economic construction in a  relatively peaceful environment. Of course, we are maintaining  high vigilance against both the internal and external factors of  instability. Internationally, there is truly a small number of  people who are unwilling to see Tibet pursue economic  construction in a stable and peaceful environment. Meanwhile,  the splittist clique outside Tibet has been trying to win the  support of international hostile forces in a bid to create chaos  in Tibet in order to achieve their despicable political  objective. In Tibet, with the vigorous support and cooperation  of the cadres and people, we are going all out to participate in  economic construction. Because of this, a relatively peaceful  and stable environment has been maintained in the autonomous  region. In the future, we will continue to adhere to the  principle of "grasping two links" at the same time and of  "attaching importance to both" and be ready at all times to  eliminate the interference of hostile forces so as to ensure the  smooth progress of Tibet's economic construction and gradual  improvement of the people's living standards.

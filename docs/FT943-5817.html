			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Schneider head shuns summons Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman of the French industrial group Schneider, is to ignore a summons by Belgian authorities involved in a fraud inquiry. A Belgian legal official said an investigating magistrate, Mr Jean-Claude Van Espen, had summoned Mr Pineau-Valencienne to Brussels for an interview tomorrow. On Wednesday Schneider said it had taken steps to get an annulment of the legal proceedings taken against Mr Pineau-Valencienne in Belgium which led to a 12-day spell in prison in late May and early June. The company has said its chairman is willing to co-operate with Belgian officials, but only in France and under the supervision of French legal authorities. Mr Pineau-Valencienne was arrested in May after he went voluntarily to Brussels to be interviewed by Mr Van Espen, who is investigating alleged fraud in the affairs of Cofibel and Cofimines, Schneider's Belgian units. Schneider said its lawyers believed the magistrate violated the 1959 European Convention on judicial co-operation and Belgian rules of procedure in criminal investigations.</p>

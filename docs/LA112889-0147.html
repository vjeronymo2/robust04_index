			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CBS SHIFTS PERSONNEL IN SEARCH OF RATINGS  </P> <P> CBS, trying to raise the low ratings of its late-night and morning shows, is  putting a veteran sports producer with "The Pat Sajak Show" and two new  reporters on "CBS This Morning."  </P> <P> Sajak's talk show will get Michael Weisman, an NBC Sports producer for 15  years, as co-executive producer. Sajak is the other executive producer. Weisman  has won 10 Emmy awards for sports telecasts.  </P> <P> The reporters joining "CBS This Morning" are Steve Kmetko of KCBS-TV in Los  Angeles and Wayne Freedman, formerly of KRON-TV in San Francisco. Kmetko will  report on the entertainment industry but continue at KCBS. Freedman, who will  be a features reporter for the CBS show, will be based here.  </P> <P> CBS announced the staff changes Monday. A spokesman also said that director  Peter Bogdanovich, who had reviewed videocassettes of classic films and  interviewed film figures for CBS' morning show, is leaving the program.  </P> <P> The show, co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, is a distant third  in ratings against NBC's top-rated "Today" show and ABC's "Good Morning  America."  </P> <P> Sajak's show has struggled in the ratings since its Jan. 9 debut. It began as a  90-minute program but was cut back to just an hour on Oct. 30.  </P></p>

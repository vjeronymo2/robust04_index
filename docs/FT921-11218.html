			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: Madonna runs with the pack - Antony Thorncroft discusses trends in the art market WE'VE HAD Madonna the slut; can we now expect Madonna the Saint? The rock shocker has long been a serious collector of art - she employs a personal curator - but one of predictably garish taste. Typical of her acquisitions was a self portrait by the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo seen emerging from her mother's womb, which hangs alongside Picasso nudes and the camp beauties of the 1930s artist Tamara. But at the recent New York auctions of Old Masters Madonna dramatically changed tack, paying Dollars 814,000 at Sotheby's for a panel ascribed to the Master of 1310 and depicting scenes from the life of a female saint, probably Margaret of Antioch. Perhaps Madonna identified with the tableau of the saint being consumed by serpents - obviously critics. If Madonna is now buying Madonnas she is running with the pack. The New York Old Master auctions gave the strongest proof yet that buyers are returning to the art market. With US interest rates below 4 per cent there is little point in keeping your money in the bank. Why not pick up some envy by hanging a decorative 18th century French pastorale, or a Dutch still life, on your appartment wall. Estimates at the sales had been cunningly reduced to attract bids, and everyone seemed happy. There is no desire to have another flutter in the speculative area of Impressionist and 20th century art - too many Japanese owned paintings are waiting to be absorbed before that market improves - but the prices of Old Masters have always been underpinned by museum and connoisseur buying, and although some dealers are forbidden by their banks to acquire fresh stock, private demand for the more picturesque paintings was most encouraging. The December Old Master sales in London did not show the same depth of interest (the domestic demand for such works is pitiful) but the exceptional lots did well, notably a Venus and Adonis, now firmly attributed to the brush of Titian, which sold for Pounds 7.4m to a duo of dealers Hazlitt, Gooden and Fox, and Herman Sickman. If an export licence is forthcoming - and since the sum involved almost equals the total annual purchasing grants of all the national museums and galleries there is little point in delay - the Titian is destined for the Getty in Malibu, where it will eventually join the portrait of Pope Clement VII by Sebastiano del Piombo, currently on show at Agnew's in Bond Street while awaiting its export licence. With Sotheby's and Christie's in London quieter than for decades, now is the time for the dealers to tempt buyers. Agnew's is currently offering the pick of its vaults, including works by Tintoretto, Fra Angelico, Turner, etc, in a show to celebrate its 175th anniversary (and it is already poised to sell four paintings) while across the road Leger will shortly celebrate its centenary with a good show of English landscapes. There was a welcome outbreak of spots at the Royal Academy this week, each marking yet another print sold at the Original Print Fair, which ends tomorrow. The rash virtually covered the stand of the Californian dealer Ray Lewis. He had brought along a group of prints by Hokusai, the Japanese master. It was a shrewd move. A few yards away the RA is holding a major Hokusai exhibition, which contains at least four of the prints on the Lewis stand. Rich enthusiasts could suddenly pop down and buy, for up to Dollars 75,000, what previously they could only admire. Such serendipity was pushed further. Flowers Graphics was selling prints by Michael Rothenstein a week before a display of his boxes opens at the RA and the New York dealer Hill-Stone was planning to offer for sale a print by Mantegna. The print is actually at the RA but as part of the great Mantegna exhibition: the National Gallery in Washington bought it from Hill-Stone last autumn and has loaned it to the show. Print dealers have ridden the recession better than most. Expensive American contemporary prints by Johns, Hockney, Warhol, etc, and prints once bought by the Japanese - by Picasso, Chagall, etc, have been hammered, but Old Master print dealers have hardly noticed a downturn and connoisseur demand for good 19th and early 20th century prints has also held up well. At the Fair you can still buy a Gillray lampoon of the Prince Regent for less than Pounds 300, (Andrew Edmunds sold 30 of them on the first day), or a Cotman landscape for the same sum. Or a Matisse for Pounds 14,000; an Augustus John self portrait for Pounds 10,000; a Victor Passmore for Pounds 500; a Piranesi view of Rome for Pounds 1,500; a Rembrandt for Dollars 48,000; and a Munch for Dollars 100,000. The most expensive item marks the moment when prints officially became art. It is the cover created by Toulouse-Lautrec for 'L'estampe originale', the book of prints published in Paris in 1893. Across it T-L scrawled 'passe'. It costs Dollars 150,000. Unlike most dealers traders in prints seem more interested in their stock than in money. Last week's specialist art fairs in London - of watercolours and contemporary art - hinted tentatively at a revival in the market. The Print Fair, with attendances up on 1991, is drawing attention to the fact. Do you fancy Eros as a garden ornament? A copy, one of nine made in 1986 from Alfred Gilbert's original cast, is on offer at the Silver &amp; Jewellery Fair which opens at the Park Lane Hotel next Friday. It is part of the loan exhibition on The Triumph of Love 1530-1930 but its owners, the Fine Art Society, will sell it for around Pounds 190,000. The FAS has already sold seven of its copies and is permitted to cast one more , the tenth. After that the original plaster is to be locked away for 25 years. Eros was made from aluminium, so original in the 1890s, so vulnerable now. Since the Piccadilly Circus Eros seems ill fated - it is currently boarded up again awaiting more repairs - it would be a smart idea to find it a safe retirement home in the V&amp;A next year, when it reaches its centenary. Then an Eros fashioned from the uncast plaster, with appropriate metallic strengthening of the vulnerable legs, could bestride the Circus. The Art Newspaper has absorbed the New York based Journal of Art , acquiring its 11,000 subscribers and its title. Thus ends four years of internecine strife. The two papers, both dedicated to news and well informed art world gossip, had begun within weeks of each other in late 1990. They respectively by Umberto Allemandi and Barbara Rose who had been previously been publishing partners before a spectacular fall out. Given the recession, and the dearth of advertising, it was unlikely that both would survive. The Journal of Art ran up a loss of Dollars 2.5m and has waved the white flag. Bloomsbury Book Auctions is bringing back to London sales devoted to Hebrew books and Judaica, a flourishing market until Sotheby's and Christie's switched their specialist auctions to Jerusalem and New York. Bloomsbury thinks its time to cultivate the market again. At the same auction house on February 13 one of the largest art reference libraries for years is for sale. It was owned by the late Denys Sutton, the long time art critic of the FT. These are not just pretty books with lots of pictures. dealers can't operate without the catalogues raisonnes of leading artists, and rare editions can cost more than Pounds 10,000. On offer here are the standard works on Degas, Cezanne, Renoir and Pissarro, all priced at around Pounds 1,500 each.</p>

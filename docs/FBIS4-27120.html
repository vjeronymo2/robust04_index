			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Norodom Sihanouk of the Kingdom of Cambodia </F> at a banquet hosted by President Kim Il-song in the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall on 28  May]    [Text] Your Excellency most esteemed Generalissimo,  president of the Republic:    Your Excellency, respected and beloved great leader--the  most  distinguished of the Korean nation and people--has arranged this  unforgettable grand banquet out of your invariable benevolent  consideration for Cambodia, its people, and my royal family, and  extended a very kind and well-meaning invitation. This is the  highest honor and a historic event for all the leaders of  Cambodia present here and the Cambodian people. In the name of  all Cambodian people, I am extending the noblest, everlasting  wholehearted gratitude to Your Excellency, the father of the  Korean people, independence, and prosperity, reflecting our  highest respect and emotion. Your Excellency, most esteemed  Generalissimo, president of the Republic:    Cambodia which formally restored independence, territorial  integrity, national unity and peace following the signing of the  Paris peace accord on October 23, 1991, has striven to  substantually restore national unity and peace up until now, but  no success worth mentioning has been made.    Unfortunately, the civil war is going on between the Royal  Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Cambodia side,  imposing ineffable sufferings upon the innocent peaceable  population of Cambodia.    A roundtable conference, a top-level conference for peace  and  national reconciliation between the factions of Cambodia, had to  be organized very urgently with a view to ending this tragic  civil war for today and tomorrow of Cambodia and the Cambodian  nation.    Very significant and noteworthy here is that the Cambodian  leaders have reached a consensus on choosing Pyongyang, the  attractive capital of the so glorious, friendly and fraternal  Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as the venue of the  conference.    The fact that all the leaders of Cambodia have chosen  Pyongyang as the historical place of the roundtable conference  for peace and national reconciliation, their summit conference,  is an expression of Cambodia's full trust in your excellency the  prominent President Generalissimo Kim Il-song, the most intimate  friend and steadfast supporter of the Cambodian people.    Your excellency most respected and beloved generalissimo,  president of the Republic: Allow me to express our noblest,  courteous and eternal thanks to your excellency for the warm  kindness, goodwill and incomparably excellent hospitality  accorded us, for the flawless preparations you have let  competent officials of Korea make for our roundtable conference,  thus making it possible for the leaders of the State of Cambodia  and the Democratic Cambodia side to achieve positive results of  unanimous support to the principles of effecting a cease-fire,  though the date is yet to be designated, defending the national  and territorial unity of the country, forming a standing  committee made up of the factions of Cambodia whose mission it  will be to discuss and solve one by one the pending issues  between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic  Cambodia side, and of maintaining fraternal working ties, at the  current conference for Cambodia and its people.    I express boundless admiration in the name of Cambodia and  its people to you who have made immortal, tireless efforts for  the liberation of Korea and her all-around development of high  degree and made historical contributions to a victory of the  struggle of the third world peoples for freedom, dignity,  justice, peace and progress.    Royal Cambodia has always stood on your side from 1965 and  constantly expressed its full and unflinching support for your  most patriotic and heroic policies of opposing all forms of  outside interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK  including the national defence issue and rejecting threats from  big powers, and this position will never change in the future.    We also firmly support and will support in the future, too,  the lucid and wise and most patriotic proposals made by you for  the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.    Out of this sentiment, in the name of the Cambodians present  here, I propose a toast to the everlasting good health and long  life, and everlasting glory of your excellency generalissimo,  president of the DPRK, Kim Il-song, the respected and beloved  great leader of the Korean nation and people; to the good  health, long life, and glory of his excellency Marshal Kim  Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people and the supreme  commander of the Korean People's Army; to the good health of  esteemed Madame Kim Song-ae; to the everlasting friendship and  invincible unity between the Kingdom of Cambodia and the DPRK;  to the good health of your excellency Premier Kang Song-san and  his wife; to the good health of your excellency Vice President  Yi Chong-ok; to the good health of your excellencies of Korea  and their wives present here; and to the good health of the  Korean friends present here.</p>

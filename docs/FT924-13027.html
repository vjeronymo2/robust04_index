			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Attwoods fall surprises City ATTWOODS, the international waste management company, yesterday surprised the market with an 8 per cent fall in annual profits after volume and margins were hit in tough markets. Pre-tax profits in the year to end-July fell unexpectedly from Pounds 38.7m to Pounds 35.6m on sales 18 per cent higher at Pounds 341m. Earnings per share fell from 12.39p to 8.06p but the full-year dividend is maintained at 5p with an unchanged 3.25p final proposed despite the increase in the number of shares after last year's rights issue. Following the results, Attwoods' brokers, Rowe &amp; Pitman, reduced its forecast of this year's profits from near Pounds 50m to Pounds 40m. The company's shares closed down 7p at 106p. In the second half the US recyclables processing business, Mindis, showed no recovery from the first half fall. An operating profit of Dollars 16.1m in 1991 evaporated to profits of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.45m) after a slide in world metals prices. Mr Ken Foreman, chairman, said that a new Dollars 200m bank facility meant the group entered the new year with the strongest base it had ever had. Gearing had fallen from 91.6 per cent to 36.4 per cent. The group made a Pounds 3.5m extraordinary provision to cover the costs of fines and other liabilities that have emerged from the investigations of over-charging by some Attwoods managers in the mid-Atlantic region. Attwoods has now refunded affected customers back to 1981. Administrative expenses rose from Pounds 35.6m to Pounds 44.9m partly as a result of one-off exceptional items including the reorganisation of the east coast operations following the fraud. Attwoods, which has most of its US business in Florida, is expecting to be a net beneficiary from the clear-up operation after Hurricane Andrew. COMMENT There was almost no element of choice about last year's rights issue - no new money from shareholders would most likely have meant no new money from the banks and thus curtains. But subscribers must nevertheless be dismayed by yesterday's results. The problem is not so much the tough trading conditions that persist, particularly in the US, but what must be most galling is that Attwoods did not flag the potential for continuing problems at Mindis more carefully. As it has turned out, profits have fallen off a cliff and there is little sign of an improvement this year over the Dollars 2.5m contribution in 1992. What is more, there are few signs that Attwoods has turned the corner. With the US flat, any improvement from the well-managed German operation is likely to be offset by a downturn in the UK. As a result profits are unlikely to be higher than Pounds 38m this year, giving flat earnings of 8.1p. The 13 times prospective earnings multiple, though a substantial discount to fellow international waste companies and even the UK market as a whole, may well be an accurate reflection of the company's value.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> WILLIAMS BARRED FROM USING 'MAYOR'  </P> <P> Mayor W.E. (Walt) Donovan has won a temporary restraining order that bars his  opponent, City Councilman and former mayor J. Tilman Williams, from using the  phrase "re-elect Mayor Williams" on campaign signs, with a new round in court  scheduled today.  </P> <P> Donovan said he successfully sought the order Wednesday after a woman called  him at home and asked to speak to "Mayor Williams."  </P> <P> Said Donovan: "I told her that I'm the mayor, and I'm Walt Donovan."  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Julian Cimbaluk issued the  restraining order that bars Williams from "publishing, circulating, (or)  displaying" any campaign material that says he is the mayor. Williams has twice  served as Garden Grove's elected mayor, first in 1976-78 and then in 1987-88.  </P> <P> Donovan was first elected mayor in 1988.  </P> <P> Williams denied that the large red, white and blue signs claim that he is the  current mayor, and calls the lawsuit "another one of Walt Donovan's dirty  tricks."  </P> <P> Williams said he doesn't believe the order requires him to make any changes in  signs now posted in the community.  </P> <P> A formal Superior Court hearing on the dispute was scheduled for Oct. 31, but  given Williams' interpretation of the order, said Richard Levine, Donovan's  lawyer, he will be back in court today seeking enforcement of the  commissioner's decree.JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND'S MAYOR OUTRAGED THAT ROTHENBERG IS IN TOWN  </P> <P> An outraged Mayor Lionel Wilson said Friday he was shocked to learn that  Charles Rothenberg, who set his 6-year-old son on fire, has been paroled to his  city and called for Gov. George Deukmejian to move Rothenberg elsewhere.  </P> <P> Alameda County Supervisor Mary King also decried what she said is Rothenberg's  "irrational lust for the spotlight" and said she would get others to put  pressure on Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "I was disappointingly surprised to find that this man is in our community,"  said Wilson, who said he first learned Rothenberg is living in Oakland from a  story Friday in the Los Angeles Times.  </P> <P> "I am outraged and plan to contact the governor, both verbally and in writing,  to get this man moved," Wilson said.  </P> <P> Rothenberg splashed his son with kerosene and set him ablaze in 1983 in a  twisted effort to hurt his ex-wife, who had threatened to withhold visitation  rights. The boy suffered third-degree burns over 90% of his body and was left  permanently disfigured.  </P> <P> When Rothenberg was paroled from prison Jan. 24, his son said he feared that  his father would hurt him again.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with The Times on Thursday, Rothenberg said he lives  quietly in a "crummy" Oakland neighborhood infested by crack dealers and drug  addicts day and night.  </P> <P> He said he moves about the city freely and is not recognized on the streets. He  wears an electronic surveillance anklet and is under round-the-clock guard by  parole agents.  </P> <P> "I can do pretty much what I want," he told The Times. "I'm just the  most-watched man in America."  </P> <P> Wilson said Rothenberg's comments about Oakland reflect a lack of concern about  his community. The mayor said he wants to make sure Oakland does not become a  "dumping ground" for paroled convicts.  </P> <P> King said she will meet with other supervisors and argue that they should ask  Deukmejian to review Rothenberg's parole.  </P> <P> "Someone who is capable of this sort of irrational lust for the spotlight might  be likely to take steps to return to protective custody," she said.  </P> <P> She described Rothenberg's interview with The Times as "a plea to be sent back  to prison."  </P></p>

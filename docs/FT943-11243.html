			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Beijing to slash steel output China will slash steel production by 1m tonnes this year in an effort to bolster a sagging market. It is also squeezing imports, but is yet to announce details of new import quotas. The official Business Daily reported that the government would also purchase rolled steel for its own reserves to reduce stockpiles. Chinese steelmakers are facing a crisis, with demand faltering due to a cut in construction. Low-priced imports from Japan and South Korea are also posing problems. China plans to produce 93m tonnes of steel this year which would make it the world's biggest producer. At the end of May, stockpiles of steel had risen to 4m tonnes, a 191 per cent increase over the same period last year. Imports of steel in the first six months reached 10.68m tonnes in spite of import curbs. Talks between Japanese steel producers and a Chinese government import agency collapsed last week on the issue of price and export levels. The Japanese are threatening to export directly to Chinese consumers in defiance of restrictions.</p>

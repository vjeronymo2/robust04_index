			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUMAN SEXUALITY  </P> <P> I have been teaching the course on human sexuality at two medical schools for  the past seven years. In my opinion, Dr. Neil Schram is only partly correct in  his analysis as to the reason that primary care physicians do not inquire into  the sexual behavior of their patients ("Physicians' Bias Thwarts AIDS  Prevention," Op-Ed Page, Sept. 5).  </P> <P> It is without question that only rarely do physicians perform adequate sexual  histories. However, his statement that there is a "physician prejudice against  homosexual/bisexual men and an aversion to AIDS" is not the basic reason. My  observation with both medical students and doctors is that the entire subject  of sexuality, be it homosexuality or heterosexuality, is too threatening for  most people in my profession to deal with. One must be comfortable with one's  own sexuality in order to discuss the subject with others, and this simply  doesn't occur in the medical field.  </P> <P> An essay could be written on the causes, but the practical solution to this  dilemma is sex education beginning at a very early age in the public schools  with a detailed course in human sexuality being a pre-med requirement.  </P> <P> RONALD B. FERRIS, M.D.  </P> <P> La Mirada  </P></p>

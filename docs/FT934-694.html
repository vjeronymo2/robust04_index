			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Economic model not understating impact of tax changes Sir, You have recently given publicity ('Tax 'flaw' may trip chancellor', November 15) to the claim by Douglas McWilliams, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, that models of consumers' expenditure of the type conventionally used by the authorities have a serious flaw, which leads them to understate the impact of tax changes on the economy. Instead, he says in his recently published study, 'a change in income tax rates will affect consumers' expenditure by approximately twice the amount estimated by conventional models such as those used by the Bank of England, the Treasury . . .'. The estimate given by CEBR of the impact on consumers' expenditure in the Bank model of a 1p rise in the basic rate, namely a reduction of 0.14 per cent, does not accurately reflect the properties of that model. Nor, for that matter, does it accurately describe the Treasury model, which has been the recipient of most of the adverse comment. The correct way to estimate the economy's response to a policy change is through a simulation exercise on the model in question. On doing this with the versions of the models released to us by the Bank and the Treasury (the Treasury's model is publicly available) we find that the corresponding figures are in the range 0.5 to 0.7 per cent, depending on the definition of consumers' expenditure that is used. CEBR's preferred figure, in the range 0.25 to 0.34 per cent, is itself a considerable under-estimate. Hence its claim, based on its figures, that the official models understate the impact of tax changes, is incorrect. Observer ('Younger model sought', November 29) described Douglas McWilliams's finding as 'an embarrassing flaw' in the Treasury model. Treasury and Bank officials need not be embarrassed at all by this alle-gation. Kenneth P Wallis, director, ESCR Macroeconomic Modelling Bureau, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Free or fair WHAT SORT of trade policy will the US follow under President Clinton? There can be few more important questions. When Mr Clinton said last month that 'we must compete, not retreat', who could forbear a cheer? When he says that 'if we believe in the bonds of democracy, we must resolve to strengthen the bonds of commerce,' the cheers become louder. And when he says that he wants to see completion of the Uruguay Round by the end of this year, they become deafening. Yet Mr Clinton also believes that trade needs to be 'a priority element of American security' and that 'many of our trading partners cling to unfair practices'. Lawyer that he is, he knows the solution: 'we must enforce our trade laws and our agreements with all the tools and energy at our disposal'. Market opening and unilateral pursuit of 'fairness' are not, as Mr Clinton seems to believe, two sides of the same coin. They are two different coins, the latter being intellectually counterfeit. First, 'fairness' is in the eyes of the beholder, the US being just one, if the biggest, of more than one hundred such beholders; second, much of what is deemed unfair is not economically damaging, while remedies for unfairness too often are; third, US trade policy is unfair too, among the most important examples being the very laws that Mr Clinton is so determined to see enforced. That these laws are unfair should not be a controversial statement, other than to those who benefit from them. So-called fair trade laws render illegal practices, such as differential pricing, that are perfectly legal within the domestic economy; they find against practices, such as charging less than long run average cost, which are economically efficient; and they find price discrimination where the same prices are being charged in different markets. This is true not only of the US, but of others as well, not least of the European Community. The Uruguay Round is of great importance. Yet, as the EC itself must have realised after the recent provisional imposition of anti-dumping duties on its steel exports to the US, the Uruguay Round is a small part of the trade story. Fair trade measures may well more than offset the benefits of the round as a whole. What is to be done? A starting point must be to question whether the game is worth the candle. Mrs Carla Hills, the outgoing US trade representative, asked the International Trade Commission to study the economic effects of US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. Mr Clinton could do much to allay the world's fears about the drift of US trade policy, not to mention reduce costs imposed on the US economy, if he were to welcome that study. For its part, the EC should promise a similar study into its equally controversial policies. The pursuit of self-defined 'fair trade' has become the canker at the heart of the trading system. It needs to be excised.</p>

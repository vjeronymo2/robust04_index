			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (ii) The accounting classification will not be placed on the voucher. This is accomplished by the GAO as the payment is made from Treasury funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The letter of transmittal to the GAO will include a statement that the individual whose signature appears on the voucher as certifying authority is the person having authority to act under the provisions of the FTCA and &sect;536.80. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The Attorney General will approve payments in excess of $25,000 in lieu of action of the approval or settlement authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Advance payment. When it has been determined that an advance payment will be made, the approval or settlement authority will transmit to the appropriate disbursing officer_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) SF 1034 (in triplicate) with a request that one copy be returned with voucher number and date of payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The original copy and one copy of the action by the approval or settlement authority authorizing advance payment and the Advance Payment Acceptance Agreement. (See &sect;536.47) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Payment involving minors. Payment will be made to the individual who executed the settlement agreement on behalf of the minor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Lost, stolen, forged, destroyed, or undeliverable Government checks. Army disbursing officers have the authority to issue substitute checks for checks that have been issued by the Army and that are subsequently lost, destroyed, or rendered undeliverable. (See AR 37103, chap 4, secs. VII through X.) Some Federal agencies do not yet have this authority. Inquiries from payees or endorsees of Army-issued checks should be referred to an Army comptroller; inquiries regarding other agencies should be referred to the specific agency involved. For claims paid by the GAO, if the Treasury check is lost or stolen, the payee or endorsee should be referred to the Check Forgery Insurance Fund, Department of the Treasury (31 U.S.C. 3343, 31 CFR 235.1 through 235.6). The Fund can reimburse such losses provided the specific requirements of the Statute are met. The Fund is administered by the Commissioner, Financial Management Service, Department of the Treasury, 3700 East-West Highway, Hyattsville, MD 20782. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.36 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Acceptance of an award by the claimant, except for advance payment, constitutes for the United States, military personnel, or civilian employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, a release from all liability to the claimant, based on the act or omission. However, on tort claims only one payment may be made for all damages a claimant sustains from an incident. Therefore, a signed unconditional settlement agreement is needed to ensure that the claimant understands the finality of accepting payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.37 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Notification as to denial of claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. The nature and extent of the written notification to the claimant as to the denial of his or her claim should be based on whether the claimant has a judicial remedy following denial or an administrative recourse to appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Final actions under subpart D. If the settlement authority has information that could be a persuasive factor for the claimant as to whether to resort to litigation, such information may be orally transmitted to the claimant and, in appropriate cases, released under normal procedures in accordance with AR 340&hyph;17 or AR 340&hyph;21. However, the written notification of the denial should be general in nature; for example, denial on the weaker ground of contributory negligence should be avoided and the inclination should be to deny on the basis that the claimant was solely responsible for the incident. The claimant will be informed in writing of his or her right to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District Court not later than 6 months after the date of mailing of the notification. See DA PAM 27&hyph;162, figures 5&hyph;8 and 5&hyph;9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Final actions under subparts C, F and J. Final agency actions under subparts C, F or J are subject to appeal and the claimant will be so informed. Also, the notice of final action will be sufficiently detailed to provide the claimant with an opportunity to know and attempt to overcome the basis for denial. The claimant should not be afforded a valid basis for claiming surprise when an issue adverse to him or her is asserted as a basis for denying the appeal (see DA Pam 27&hyph;162, figures 5&hyph;8 and 5&hyph;9). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Denials on jurisdictional grounds. Regardless of the nature of the claim or the statute under which it may be considered, claims denied on jurisdictional grounds that are valid, certain, and not easily overcome (and for this reason no detailed investigation as to the merits of the claim is conducted) should contain in the denial letter a statement that the denial on such grounds is not to be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the claim or an admission of liability. If sufficient factual information is available to make a tentative ruling on the merits of the claim, liability may be expressly denied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Claims that may be considered under more than one subpart. In doubtful cases as to whether subparts C, D and F are the appropriate subparts to consider the claim, the claimant will be advised of the alternatives; for example, the right to sue or the right to appeal. Similarly, a claimant may be advised of his or her alternative remedies when the claimant is a military member and the issue of ``incident to service'' is not clear. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Denial after litigation. On those claims cognizable under the FTCA in which the claimant files suit after six months without agency action, a formal denial will be sent to the claimant unless the Assistant United States Attorney responsible for the litigation of the suit expressly directs otherwise. The denial will be on the basis that the claim is no longer amenable to administrative settlement. Other reasons for denial may also be given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Claims <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.38 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;&sect;536&hyph;38 through 536.43 provides an expeditious procedure for the investigation and payment of claims (regardless of the amount claimed) that may be without extensive investigation. If it appears that a claim should be denied or cannot be settled within the limits specified in &sect;&sect;536.38 through 536.43, it will be fully investigated under normal procedures. The use of small claims procedures is not mandatory; however, these procedures should be used whenever considered appropriate in the judgment of the claims approval or settlement authority, as considerable processing time and expense is usually saved thereby. If a fully investigated claim is received by an approval or settlement authority, which in his or her opinion could properly have been processed under small claims procedures, the claim will be settled in accordance with normal procedures. Appropriate corrective action will be taken to ensure the use of small claims procedures in similar future cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.39 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The investigation will be made so as to develop most expeditiously the facts necessary to determine whether the claim is meritorious and in what amount. The evidence required may be obtained by telephone, from incident reports, and other forms of hearsay evidence. Written statements of witnesses, written estimates of repairs, and the like are not required. The approving authority must be convinced and state on DA Form 1668 that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The United States is liable for the damage or injury incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The claimant is a proper claimant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The amount approved, as claimed or agreed upon, is reasonably substantiated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.40 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Report of investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When it appears that a small claim may arise, the report of investigation will be prepared on DA form 1668. The investigator will append a brief summary of the evidence developed. The summary may be used as a basis for completion of the investigation after a claim has been filed. This report is exempted from control in accordance with AR 335&hyph;15, paragraph 7&hyph;2t. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.41 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) If the amount claimed under subpart K is not more than $1,000, or in the case of a tort claim is not more than $2500, and is considered meritorious in full, the claims JA/attorney will complete DD Form 1842 or DA Form 1668 and pay the claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A claim under subpart K is meritorious in an amount of $1,000 or less, or if a tort claim is meritorious in the amount of $2500 or less, the claim JA/attorney may settle the claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) After coordination with the responsible approving or settlement authority, unit claims officers may be authorized to attempt to procure a settlement agreement. If a settlement agreement is obtained, the claims officer will complete the small claims certificate for the amount of recommended payment and transmit it, in triplicate, with the claim and settlement agreement, to the approval or settlement authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If a claimant refuses to accept a sum offered under this section or if it appears that a claim should be disapproved, the small claims procedures will not be employed; the claim will be fully investigated and processed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Nonappropriated fund claims will be forwarded by the approval or settlement authority for payment as prescribed in subpart L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Claims under subpart K. DA Form 1668 will not be employed in the settlement of small claims under subpart K. Such a claim will be submitted on DD Form 1842. Procedures in subpart K will be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.42 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Settlement agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

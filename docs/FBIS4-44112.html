			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Mainz ZDF Television Network in German  at 1730 GMT on 26 June carries a 30-minute program of live  statements by leading party officials from Bonn to questions by  ZDF correspondent Klaus-Peter Siegloch on the preliminary result  of today's Landtag election in Saxony-Anhalt.    Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany (SPD), says that he is "more than happy" with  the preliminary election result, which sees the SPD at about 34  percent and only marginally behind the Christian Democratic  Union (CDU). It has been a "brilliant victory" for the SPD,  which has made "a leap ahead" compared to the election of four  years ago, but also to the European election of two weeks ago.  He believes that the SPD congress in Halle and "the convincing  appearance of Rudolf Scharping" have "boosted" the motivation of  the voters. This means that "the race for the Bundestag  election is entirely open again." He emphasizes that the  CDU/Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) coalition government  in Saxony-Anhalt has been "chased out" by the voters, thus  leading to the "worst election defeat" of the past few years  anywhere in Germany. As far as the Bundestag election is  concerned, Verheugen says that we, the SPD, "do not want a grand  coalition." The voters have to make sure that one can establish  "a reformist alliance against the current government" after the  October election.    CDU Secretary General Peter Hintze argues that, since the  CDU  is ahead of the other parties, this is "a very nice success."  He praises the work of new Minister President Bergner, who was  elected minister president only six months ago after his  predecessor resigned and whose "hard work has been honored by  the voters." The "second reason" for the good result is that  "the positive trend at the federal level has continued." He  praises Chancellor Kohl's great efforts in the CDU's election  campaign in Saxony-Anhalt. Hintze says that today's election was  "not a test election" and that "it is clear" that the Bundestag  election in October has not been won yet. Nevertheless, today's  victory "was another important step."    FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer admits that the election  result, in which support for his party plummeted from  approximately 14 percent in 1990 to under 4 percent today, has  been a "debacle." He blames the result partly to the "poor  relations" between the FDP group in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag  and the party's Land Executive Committee, something the  "citizens have not forgotten." He says that the result will  "certainly" have its consequences. He also points to the fact  that the result clearly reflects a rejection of a coalition  between the SPD, the FDP, and the Greens. The FDP now has to go  into the Bundestag election and the remaining Landtag elections  with "more solidarity." As far as a possible grand coalition  after the next Bundestag election in Bonn is concerned, Hoyer  says that this would be a "disaster for the FRG." This is why  the FDP will and can fulfill "a central function" in the  Bundestag election.    Gregor Gysi, chairman of the Party of Democratic Socialism  (PDS) Bundestag group, which scored some 19 percent in today's  poll, says that the "stabilization" of his party makes him "very  secure" and "optimistic" also for the Bundestag election in  October. Gysi says that the "national front" that was  established against the PDS has "failed." This means that "the  parties must learn to treat us differently than they have done  so far." He says that in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag there is now  a "clear majority left of the CDU and the FDP" and adds that the  PDS would be "ready" to "tolerate a coalition government between  the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens." If the SPD were to prefer a  grand coalition, then this is the SPD's "problem, not ours."  Nevertheless, a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU  would "not" be a "catastrophe" for him.    Marianne Birthler, spokeswoman for the Alliance 90/Greens,  which won just over 5 percent of the vote, believes that the  party's "still very weak structures" in eastern Germany are  partly responsible for the result, which is not as good as  expected. Moreover, the "potential" of voters for "clear  ecological and civil rights policy" as "offered" by her party is  weaker in eastern Germany than at the federal level. With  regard to the good result of the PDS, Birthler says that the  people know "what they do not want" but that they are still "far  from knowing what they do want."    Christian Social Union (CSU) Secretary General Erwin Huber  stresses the necessity for all "democratic parties" to "even  step up the fight" against the "left-wing extremist" and  "communist" PDS. Huber believes, though, that in the Bundestag  election, the voters will "vote differently."    At the end, all officials express their disappointment at  the  low voter turnout in the Saxony-Anhalt election, which fell to  some 54 percent.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: SE Banken cuts deficit by 55% SCANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, said yesterday sharply improved interest and other earnings had enabled it to cut its operating loss in the first quarter by 55 per cent to SKr608m (Dollars 83m), compared with an SKr1.36bn loss in the same period last year. The news triggered a renewed surge in SE Banken's share price, which ended the day at three times its value of eight days ago. The bank brought forward its results by a week in response to feverish market activity in recent days based on speculation that it and other Swedish banks had passed the worst of a credit loss crisis which saw them report large losses last year. SE Banken's most-traded A shares soared to SKr28.50 from SKr15 before closing on profit-taking at SKr23. On April 27, they stood at SKr7.60. State-owned Nordbanken, reported it had returned to the black in the first quarter, showing an operating profit of SKr304m compared with a loss of SKr1.4bn in the same period last year. Its operating profit before credit losses was up 66 per cent at SKr1.65bn compared with SKr994m. The bank's credit losses showed a fall to SKr1.3bn from SKr2.4bn. This was distorted by the removal of SKr50bn in problem loans previously held by Nordbanken to Securum, a so-called 'bad bank' set up by the government to take the worst of Nordbanken's credit risks off its hands. Handelsbanken has reported a return to profit and Gotabank a reduction in its losses. SE Banken said its loan losses in the first quarter rose 4 per cent to SKr2.9bn from SKr2.8bn last year. Negotiated interest deferments were up to SKr380m from SKr209m, and non-paid interest on non-performing loans almost trebled to SKr732m from SKr247m.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / S Korea's new leader challenges the political old guard MR Kim Young-sam has turned out to be a political 'Trojan Horse' since becoming South Korea's president almost two weeks ago. Mr Kim entered the presidential Blue House under the banner of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, but he has acted more as the opposition leader he once was by challenging the political establishment. 'No one expected the breadth of the changes that Kim has introduced to sweep out the old guard,' said one Western diplomat. 'He's blasting away at all fronts as rapidly as possible to keep his opponents off balance.' But there are already signs that Mr Kim is provoking a backlash. His political skills may soon be put to the test as he tries to protect his reforms while maintaining the momentum for change. There is little doubt that the new president has trodden on the toes of some key institutional powers. He appointed political reformers to the Blue House and his cabinet, while largely ignoring politicians from the DLP's dominant conservative faction. He also named political loyalists from his minority group to head the DLP instead of choosing a cross-section of officials from the party's competing factions. The new president has quickly moved to impose civilian control over the military by ousting the hardline army chief of staff and the head of military intelligence. He also ordered a purge of the once-feared Agency for National Security Planning, the country's espionage organisation. He appears to be settling personal scores in the process. Prosecutors yesterday sought an arrest warrant for Mr Chang Se-dong, a former NSP director who is accused of arranging attacks on rallies of Mr Kim's opposition party in 1987. Few ever questioned Mr Kim's commitment to democratic reform since he opposed the military dictatorship for three decades. But many have been surprised by the decisiveness that he has displayed in implementing change because he lacks a widespread power base, in spite of joining the ruling party in 1990. Nonetheless, 'one should not underestimate the potential source of opposition against Mr Kim,' explains one seasoned political observer. The first indication of resistance came in a series of newspaper disclosures last week about alleged past unethical actions by several of the newly-appointed cabinet ministers. The printed exposes, which would have unthinkable a few years ago when the media was tightly muzzled, proved highly embarrassing since Mr Kim had promised to install a clean government as part of his anti-corruption drive. He immediately sacked three ministers. The Blue House believes that details of the transgressions were leaked to the press by the political opponents who had access to intelligence dossiers. Although a military coup remains a remote possibility, the incident reveals that dismissed army officers and intelligence agents could play a mischievous role in creating discontent against Mr Kim. Mr Kim must also maintain firm control over the faction-ridden DLP, although his position appears secure for the moment since most of his main rivals left the party in protest after he received the DLP presidential nomination last year. But he may find it difficult to instil loyalty among DLP legislators if he adheres to his promise not to accept political contributions from business and distribute the funds to the party members. The powerful bureaucracy could also pose problems for Mr Kim. Although many of his ministers are experts in their fields, they lack administrative experience and consequently may fail to gain control of their organisations. In pushing through reforms, Mr Kim does have allies. One is business. Although the Seoul bourse initially reacted adversely to some of his anti-corruption measures because of the chilling effect they would have on stock trading, business leaders seem pleased with the president's programme of economic deregulation and his gradual approach toward reform of big business. Mr Kim has also gained wide public support because of his anti-corruption campaign and his democratic reforms. If Mr Kim can maintain the public trust, his may yet achieve his goal of creating a 'New Korea.'</p>

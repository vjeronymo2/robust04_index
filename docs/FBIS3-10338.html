He added that these measures were  designed for most of the Latin American countries during an  overall economic recession and when Central America had yet to  act as a bloc. He said countries on the isthmus will have a  greater negotiating capability when they strengthen their  integration scheme and when the terms are based on their  countries' reality "rather than simple standard guidelines  implemented in the world."    Zepeda Bermudez met with President Carlos Roberto Reina,  with  whom he discussed integration issues and the need to implement  new development strategies in the area based on the countries'  capability as a bloc. He said the six Central American nations  will have less clout and strength at the negotiating table with  regard to these measures if they act individually, because the  area as a whole has a GNP in excess of $35 billion, which is  equivalent to that of Chile.    Referring to his rejection of President Reina's measures,  the  assistant SIECA secretary said no one can continue to believe in  an institution that imposes general measures or thinks that the  measures will be effective in Central America because they were  effective in other countries. He said the area must have its own  identity and it is necessary to discuss the situation with  international credit organizations. He also recommends planning  alternatives and a willingness to achieve development, which is  what President Reina has implied, he said.    Zepeda Bermudez said a social integration system is in its  preliminary stages, complemented by the economic integration  system which has existed for 33 years. He emphasized the  importance of acting as a bloc, taking into consideration that  this is the only way to face international financial  organizations and the powerful countries' groups which have been  created.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy last night asked the  Colorado Party to strive to continue Paraguay's development.  He said this at the headquarters of the Colorado Party during a  celebration to recall the first anniversary of the general  elections, which the party won. Party President Eugenio  Sanabria Cantero thanked Colorado workers and peasants for not  following "corrupt union leaders."    The chief of state recalled that the Colorado Party won the  9  May 1993 general elections. He told party members that the  party's current challenge as a government party is that of  facing underdevelopment and the fight for health, education, and  welfare.    When asked later if he alluded to the recent strikes when,  during his speech, he said that Paraguay must not be paralyzed,  Wasmosy answered: "I refer to all those who wish to stop the  machine."    He indicated that every effort must be made to enable  Paraguay to win in the formidable war against underdevelopment.  He stated that he made this request as president of the  Republic and as commander in chief of the Armed Forces.    Wasmosy said: "I do not need and I do not want Wasmosistas  or  any type of istas. I need and demand upright men, capable  citizens, loyal aides, and colleagues with whom I can work and  who are willing to face challenges with intelligence,  imagination, and courage."    He called for an end to sectarian fanaticism that motivates  intrigue, slander, and evil. He added: "We must overcome  seditious interests and unite in carrying out the noble mission  of serving the fatherland with talent, capability, and total  devotion."    The chief of state said: "Democratic institutionalization,  the state of law, republicanism, and my profound dedication  demand that I ask my fellow countrymen for the necessary  sacrifice to win."    "This democratic and Colorado government demands respect  without subservience, discipline without obsequiousness, and  support without conditions," he said.    Wasmosy thanked his fellow party members for the support he  received on 9 May 1993, adding that this support must increase  considering the time the party will be responsible for  governing. "A greater responsibility is needed because before  the elections the focus was on the party, but today we carry the  enormous task of being statesman for both the party and for all  citizens," he stressed.    He warned of the possibility of false prophets who may take  up the republican principles and fly the Colorado banner.    Sanabria Cantero expressed the Colorado Party's total  support  for Wasmosy's government task and he congratulated party workers  and campesinos for not following "corrupt union leaders."</p>

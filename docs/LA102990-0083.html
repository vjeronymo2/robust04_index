			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> A PLACE FOR NEW ARTISTS TO BLOOM  </P> <P> For the past two months, a transformation has been occurring in the basement of  the historic Santora Building.  </P> <P> Young artists have been busy turning 6,400 square feet of what was once an  empty basement into the Underground, an art gallery and studio designed to  serve as a haven for aspiring artists from the inner city who are looking for a  chance to create art and have their work displayed.  </P> <P> The Underground is the dream of Greg Johnson, a 36-year-old Long Beach man who  said he is determined to give disadvantaged young people a chance to realize  their artistic potential.  </P> <P> "The Van Goghs are out there, the Michelangelos are out there," Johnson said.  "How many of them are falling through the cracks because they don't have a  chance to develop their talent?"  </P> <P> In 1987, Johnson formed the Society for Economic and Environmental Development,  a nonprofit corporation that sought to get underprivileged youths off the  streets.  </P> <P> The Underground is the corporation's first venture.  </P> <P> "We want to give them a vehicle," Johnson said. "A lot of the young artists  don't have a vehicle in which to express themselves. Most galleries aren't apt  to look at a young artist unless they have an agent behind them."  </P> <P> Johnson's longtime dream of opening the Underground finally began to take form  earlier this year when he was able to rent the basement of the Santora Building  at a reduced monthly rate of $6,400.  </P> <P> So far, Johnson said, he has spent a sizable amount of his own savings on the  venture but is hoping to garner both corporate and city financial support in  the future.  </P> <P> Once the studio is ready, Johnson said, it will have room for up to 40 young  artists to work on their paintings, sculptures and other projects.  Additionally, they will have a place to socialize with other young artists.  </P> <P> Lynn Morgan, an art teacher at Santa Ana High School, said a place like this  has been needed for some time.  </P> <P> Morgan said many of her former students come to visit her after graduation and  say they are frustrated about not having a place to work or the opportunity to  have their work noticed.  </P> <P> Since finding out about the Underground, Morgan has encouraged some of the  youths to become involved.  </P> <P> One of her former students, Raul Garcia, has been spending up to seven hours a  day at the Underground since September. He and a handful of other young artists  have been helping Johnson prepare for the facility's grand opening on Saturday.  </P> <P> From Morgan's standpoint, a place that can provide youngsters with an identity  and a sense of belonging is sorely needed.  </P> <P> "They have a lot of dreams and aspirations," Morgan said. "There needs to be  some steppingstones out there for them. I hope the Underground will prove to be  that steppingstone." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

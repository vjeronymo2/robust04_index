With the adoption of the programme for early elections, the  date of which has not been set yet, the MKDH became the first  party in Slovakia to have such a programme. Bugar said the  programme reacted to the current political situation and to the  creation of the independent Slovak state which is not dealt with  in the previous programme.    Bugar said "we want to live in Slovakia, but we need clear  legislative guarantees. We expect to be equal partners of  Slovaks enjoying equal opportunities.... There is no reason for  the Hungarians to stress their loyalty to the state more than  the Slovaks." Bugar called President Michal Kovac "the only  constitutional official trying to understand the Hungarian  ethnic minority."    The congress was also attended by Geza Entz, the Hungarian  Government's political state secretary and head of the  Government Office department for Hungarians living abroad, and  Surjan Laszlo, Hungarian Social Welfare Minister and deputy  chairman of the European Christian Democratic Union.</p>

Shevardnadze warned against complacency, however. In his  words, there have been certain groups behind Gamsakhurdia which  "will try again to set up a pro-fascist organization which will  oppose the existing authorities."    Shevardnadze believes that it was up to Gamsakhurdia's  family  where to bury him. "We will agree to anything," he said.    He called for an international investigation of  Gamsakhurdia's death "to prevent any rumors."</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Roquefort returns to the French cheeseboard ROQUEFORT, one of France's best known smelly cheeses, yesterday escaped from being Swiss when Nestle, the food multinational, sold a controlling slice to Besnier, a leading French cheese supplier. Besnier, best known for its mild creamy Pont l'Eveque cheese, has agreed to pay Nestle FFr863m (Dollars 180.5m) for the Swiss company's 57 per cent stake in Caves de Roquefort, valuing it at FFr1.5bn. Caves de Roquefort used to be a subsidiary of Source Perrier, maker of the celebrated fizzy mineral water, which Nestle took over in a contested bid battle against Italy's Agnelli family early this year. Roquefort's future was highly publicised at the time, as local dairy farmers complained that a successful foreign bidder would put them out of business by importing cheaper milk for cheese production, to the alleged detriment of one of the most characteristic tastes in French cuisine. Caves de Roquefort accounts for 80 per cent of world production of this cheese and made a FFr36m profit on sales of FFr1.38bn last year. Nestle made clear at the time of the Perrier takeover that it wanted to sell its stake and offered Credit Agricole, the agricultural co-operative bank, which owns 26 per cent of the cheese maker, first refusal. Besnier won the deal against competition from France's three other leading cheese groups, Bongrain, Entremont and Bel. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group is also said to have been interested.</p>

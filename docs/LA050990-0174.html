			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MUCH OF WHAT HURT THE CELTICS' RODGERS WAS NOT HIS FAULT  </P> <P> Coaching the Boston Celtics used to be a dream job. Nobody ever accused Tom  Heinsohn, Bill Russell or K. C. Jones of being coaching geniuses, but they did  not have to be. The National Basketball Assn. was a far weaker,  less-competitive league in those days, and the Celtics' cupboard was almost  always overflowing with great players. Great young players.  </P> <P> Jimmy Rodgers, fired Tuesday after two shaky seasons at the Celtics' helm, had  few such luxuries. He inherited a team of greats who had grown old, their deeds  no longer as wondrous as their names and reputations -- and public  expectations. His predecessor, Jones, had hastened his stars' aging process by  playing them more than 40 minutes a game and all but ignoring development of  the Celtics' young players, leaving them to rot on the bench.  </P> <P> For Rodgers to be successful by the Celtics' exalted standards, he had to be  lucky. He was not. He was forced to coach virtually the entire 1988-89 season  without the team's greatest player, Larry Bird, who was sidelined by surgery on  both feet. He was forced to coach the entire 1989-90 season without his best  young guard, Brian Shaw, who bolted to Italy in August when the Celtics were  slow meeting his contract demands.  </P> <P> Rodgers was not responsible for negotiating contracts. He was not responsible  for the Celtics' uneven success on draft day. But he was held responsible, in  essence, for the Celtics' uneven play this season. He was held responsible for  their elimination in the first round of the playoffs, the second consecutive  season they were eliminated in the first round. That had not happened since Red  Auerbach's first two seasons, 1950-51 and 1951-52.  </P> <P> Some believe that if the Celtics had beaten the New York Knicks, Rodgers would  not have been fired. Don't be so sure. It probably would have taken beating the  defending champion Detroit Pistons in the playoffs to save him.  </P> <P> Celtic owner Alan Cohen was not pleased with the team's erratic play this  season, and there was some feeling that Rodgers, while certainly not a  so-called "players' coach" (which usually means hands-off) in the K. C. Jones  mold, was not quite hard enough on some of his aging stars.  </P> <P> What is more, Rodgers did a poor job communicating with several players,  particularly Kevin Gamble and Jim Paxson. To the surprise of virtually  everyone, Gamble was a budding star when injuries forced him into the lineup at  the end of the 1988-89 season, but Rodgers soured on him early this season and  never told the confused Gamble where he stood, or why. He was similarly vague  with Paxson.  </P> <P> But if Rodgers' inability to communicate with his non-legends was lacking, his  ideas on how to save the Celtics' old legs were not. What was lacking was the  wholehearted cooperation of the most important person in the organization --  Bird.  </P> <P> Rodgers wanted the Celtics to become more of an equal-opportunity team. Besides  starting Ed Pinckney and having Kevin McHale fill a sixth-man role to beef up  bench scoring, Rodgers wanted Bird to shoot less, prompting Bird to  sarcastically refer to himself as a "point forward."  </P> <P> Rodgers also wanted Bird to play less. It was like asking Diana Ross to sing  backup. It did not wash. The Celtics looked great in their opening night  victory against the Milwaukee Bucks, and in the winner's dressing room, the  only discouraging words heard were Bird's.  </P> <P> "It's going to take me awhile to get adjusted to this," he said, after playing  32 minutes. The way he said it, you knew it was not an adjustment he was eager  to make.  </P> <P> Ultimately, he did not. He was Larry Bird, and he knew what was best for Larry  Bird. He shot more. He played more. And the Celtics won more. And when Rodgers  tried to keep 35-year-old Dennis Johnson in a reserve role, Bird let the coach  know that was not the way to go. Ultimately, Johnson played because John Bagley  got hurt and because, lo and behold, Johnson proved he still could. Bird was  vindicated -- again.  </P> <P> But Bird was still a Rodgers booster, after a fashion. When the Celtics hit the  home stretch and the front office failed to give Rodgers a vote of confidence,  Bird let it be known that Rodgers had done a good job and deserved to be  retained. But as Bird proved in the fourth quarter of Game 5 Sunday -- when he  was one for six from the field and failed to score in the last 11 minutes --  his power is not what it once was.  </P> <P> When a coach is on the hot seat, a good image is one intangible that can help  him hold a job. But Rodgers' public image was not overly good.  </P> <P> There were few smiles in this Mr. Rodgers' neighborhood. He was wound tight  emotionally, and often looked and acted as if he was leading a death march. He  baited the referees and got a lot of technicals. He bumped one and got a  one-game suspension. After a loss at Atlanta to the Hawks, he went on and on,  whining about the referees costing the Celtics the game. He sounded like a high  school coach.  </P> <P> But if he wanted to whine about his firing, he would be justified to an extent.  Few of the Celtics' problems were of Jimmy Rodgers' making. As the saying goes,  if he didn't have bad luck, he'd have no luck at all.  </P> <P> Celtic General Manager Jan Volk says Assistant Coach Chris Ford will be  seriously considered as Rodgers' successor. Can Ford make the Celtics young  again? Can he be guaranteed the blockbuster trade that makes the Celtics' bid  for a 17th NBA championship something besides a pipe dream?  </P> <P> If not, his fate will be the same as Rodgers'. Unless the Celtics engage in  some serious restructuring, unless the public's and management's expectations  are lowered during that restructuring, holding the Celtics' reins will be  nobody's dream. More like a nightmare.  </P></p>

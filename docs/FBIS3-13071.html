He said after his meeting with the foreign minister today  that they also discussed the Palestinian demands to resolve the  crisis, both a UN Security Council resolution and measures that  the Israeli Government needs to take to prevent the recurrence  of the massacre.    He said the two sides also discussed cooperation between  Egypt and the PLO to achieve the best results.    On the possibility of a summit meeting between Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin, 'Abbas said such a meeting is out of the question before  certain measures have been taken: the issuance of a Security  Council resolution and adoption of specific Israeli positions to  handle the crisis resulting from the massacre.    On the Palestinian proposals presented to Rabin, 'Abbas said  the PLO has not yet received an Israeli reply.    He said the PLO presented specific and known proposals that  can be summed up by the following questions: How can the  Palestinian people be protected and how can another Hebron  massacre be prevented? We have not yet received a reply from  the Israeli Government, he said.    What is needed, 'Abbas asserted, is UN-recognized  international observers to protect the Palestinians.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs firm Pharmaceutical stocks received support from BZW, one of the UK's leading investment banks, which issued 50m call warrants worth Pounds 223m on four internationally traded stocks. The issue, one of the largest in recent months, comes at a time when securities houses are looking at increasingly sophisticated forms of trading  -such as large over-the-counter options tailor made for individual clients  -in order to satisfy a growing appetite for equities. BZW's basket represents three Glaxo shares, 1 1/4 shares of each class of SmithKline Beecham - the 'A's and the Units - one Wellcome and one Zeneca share. The warrants were priced at 55p each, and 10 warrants give the right to buy one basket for Pounds 44.64 any time until expiry on July 31, 1995. In spite of the early weakness in the New York market and the international nature of the stocks, Glaxo rose 8 to 672p, SmithKline 'A' 4 to 417p and the Units 5 to 386p, Wellcome 9 to 646p and Zeneca 8 to 782p. Oil major British Petroleum ignored a persistently weak oil price and climbed 7 to 385p, with 10m shares traded, on hopes of a stronger dollar and increased enthusiasm over prospects for an oil find west of the Shetland Isles. Analysts have been aware of the potential of the new field, known as Foinavon, for some time but optimism was rekindled by a positive article in a specialist trade publication. There is also informed talk that BP is commissioning feasibility studies from engineering companies and discussing financing arrangements with leading banks. Also, any rate rise in the US combined with a rate cut in the UK would normally lead to a stronger dollar against the pound - a situation which would increase BP's currency gains. Burmah, which also gains from a stronger dollar and is largely unaffected by a falling oil price because it concentrates on refining, was squeezed up 19 to 870p. The market remained unimpressed by GKN's long anticipated hostile bid for helicopter manufacturer Westland Group for nearly Pounds 500m. The engineering group already had a 28.3 per cent stake in Westland and is buying the 18.7 per cent stake held by US group United Technologies as a launch pad for its bid. GKN said its offer was for the outstanding ordinary shares at 290p a share in cash or loan notes and it was making a one-for-five rights issue raising Pounds 248m to fund the bid. Shares in both companies registered little change, reflecting the market's coolness towards the proposed deal. GKN firmed 2 to 582p, in trade of a mere 1.4m shares while Westland retreated from the day's high to also finish just 2 ahead at 307p, in negligible volume. The stock is very tightly held. Several analysts said the fact that the offer was below the current market price was an indication that it was not serious. Reports that Forte has been outbid in its attempt to buy Ciga, the Italian hotel chain, hit the shares and raised doubts among leisure analysts over the company's European strategy. Forte, and Mr George Soros's Quantum Fund, had made a Pounds 270m offer for the group. However, it was dwarfed over the weekend by a Pounds 375m bid from Sheraton Hotels, valuing Ciga at a colossal Pounds 150,000 per room. Analysts were relieved that Forte was backtracking from a bidding war. But some argued it would have to pay a premium price as there are very few luxury hotel chains in Europe which qualify as potential targets. 'This leaves a hole in Forte's strategy - if they are unwilling to pay these kind of prices it is unlikely to be filled,' said one leading specialist. Another said it would increase pressure on the group to make sure it landed the luxury Savoy chain. Forte settled 3 down at 252p, after 249p, with turnover a busy 7.8m. Savoy was steady at 1028p. Speculation that Stakis is close to buying a clutch of provincial hotels helped the shares climb 6 1/2 to 92 1/2 p. Price reductions by both BT and Mercury, owned by Cable and Wireless, hit sentiment, particularly in the former. However, analysts said that although the tariff changes would knock some Pounds 350m off BT's revenues, volume increases were likely to claw back a sizeable portion. BT shares slid 4 1/2 to 459p. Cable and Wireless gained 4 to 518p. Dealers said sentiment was little affected by news of another entrant into the telecoms market in the shape of MFS from the US. Vodafone, paid Pounds 30m for a stake in a distributor, the shares adding 8 to 616p. Television group LWT jumped 35 to 737p after Granada, the leisure group, announced that it was increasing its final offer for the company to around Pounds 776m, the equivalent of 750p a share. Analysts said Granada was now certain to acquire the television group but was paying a very high price. The shares fell 8 at one stage before closing 2 off at 568p. Building groups were marked sharply higher following the interest rate reduction. Redland put on 18 to 638p, with UBS said to be strong buyers of the stock. Spring Ram, meanhwile, saw hectic trading as the nil-paid rights owned by the Rooney family were placed. The shares added 5 to 22p, with a huge 30m traded. The ordinaries climbed 2 to 75p.</p>

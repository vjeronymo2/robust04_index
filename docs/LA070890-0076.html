			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALLEGATIONS DISPUTED IN CASE OF THE PURLOINED KINKAJOUS  </P> <P> This letter is written to respond to allegations made against my client in two  letters to the editor printed July 1. The letters were written by Priscilla  Feral, a representative of Friends of Animals, and Kyle Owens, a representative  of the Fund for Animals.  </P> <P> First, there is an allegation made in the letter by Priscilla Feral that my  client, Cary Chevalier, violated court rules, and thereby "unlawfully obtained  the temporary restraining order" that allowed the University of California to  take possession of the subject kinkajous. Nothing could be further from the  truth.  </P> <P> At the hearing on May 22, 1990, the court simply found that a simple procedural  error had occurred regarding the return of the kinkajous. If, as claimed in the  letter from Ms. Feral, the kinkajous had been "unlawfully obtained," then it is  certain that the judge would have returned the animals to Primarily Primates  Inc.  </P> <P> Therefore, although there might have been a minor procedural error on the part  of one of Mr. Chevalier's attorneys, it did not change the findings of the  court that the animals should remain in the possession of Mr. Chevalier and the  University of California.  </P> <P> Further, Ms. Feral goes to great pains to argue that as a grand jury failed to  indict the individuals who stole Mr. Chevalier's property, that no wrong could  have been committed against Mr. Chevalier. We dispute this strongly and believe  that at the close of the civil litigation, there will be sufficient evidence to  demonstrate the injuries suffered by Mr. Chevalier and his animals.  </P> <P> Mr. Owens claims that the kinkajous were not taken illegally from Mr.  Chevalier, and further claims that the experimentation performed by Mr.  Chevalier has no valid scientific purpose. However, Mr. Owens provides no  factual support for either of these allegations. Unfortunately, it is not  unusual for people in our client's position to have to respond to allegations  of his type.  </P> <P> Finally, all of Mr. Chevalier's experimentation was performed without any harm  to the kinkajous and with all of the appropriate authorizations pursuant to  federal and state law, as well as the in-house rules of the University of  California.  </P> <P> The only harm that has come to the animals has occurred while they were in the  possession of the so-called "animal rights" groups. While the kinkajous were in  their possession, two of the animals disappeared and one of the animals was  castrated.  </P> <P> Although we prefer to have these controversies aired within the context of the  lawsuit presently pending in Texas, it is clear that certain animal rights  groups are bent on pursuing these allegations in a public forum. Therefore, we  felt we had no alternative but to address the allegations made against our  client in that same public forum.  </P> <P> KENNETH E. GERTZ  </P> <P> Hollins, Schechter &amp; Feinstein  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

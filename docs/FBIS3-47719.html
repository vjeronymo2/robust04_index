			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr. and Nelson Bagaforo] </F>   [Text] Discussions between the working committees of  government and Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) negotiating  panels went smoothly last Tuesday, contrary to reports that the  peace talks had hit a snag, government negotiators said  yesterday.    There was no "failure" to sign a cease-fire agreement, they  said, because the signing of the document was not scheduled for  this week in the first place.    Government chief negotiator Manuel Yan said both sides were,  still studying the proposed agreement, although he said it might  be signed in the near future. "The guidelines and ground rules  are still being studied, and after we agree on them, then that's  when the signing will take place," Yan said.    What was scheduled for this week, according to Defense  Undersecretary Feliciano Gacis, was a meeting in Cotabato City  of joint support committee number one of which he is the  government co-chairman." The MNLF co-chairman is Dr. Tham  Manjoorsa.    The meeting, Gacis said, did not need the presence of MNLF  Chairman Nur Misuari, as the media had reported. Misuari,  sources in the panel said, only wanted to be present during the  discussions, but his absence would make no difference because  "these discussions are at the level of the support committees,  which are `below' him (Misuari)."    Support committee number one is concerned with defense and  security matters. There are four other such committees tackling  discussions on the educational system, the financial and  economic system, the judiciary and the administrative system.    The committees, Gacis pointed out, thresh out issues of  contention in the Tripoli Agreement.    Gacis said the worst incident which occurred was that his  discussions with Manjoorsa were delayed for one day "because of  site preparation."    He said his meeting with Manjoorsa was cordial, and that  they  exchanged position papers on the topics they were scheduled to  discuss. "After perusing the documents, we agreed that we both  needed time to study and respond further so both sides agreed to  meet again two weeks from now," he told a press conference in  Camp Aguinaldo.    He refused to reveal the contents of the papers, saying only  that the MNLF's was a slight modification of what they had  submitted during the formal talks in Jakarta last year.  Developments with regard support committee number one are  particularly crucial since they represent what are believed to  be the most controversial sections in the Tripoli Agreement:  paragraphs two and eight.    Paragraph two, Gacis said, "states that defense matters  shall  be the concern of the national government provided that the  joining of the MNLF forces with the Armed Forces of the  Philippines will be discussed later -- so that's why we are  discussing it."    "Paragraph eight says special regional security forces will  be set up in the area of autonomy in southern Philippines  provided that the details will be discussed later," he said.    "What has caused so much trouble," said an official who  requested anonymity, "is that some have assumed that this merger  of the MNLF and AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] and the  setting up of regional security forces can be taken for granted  when it's very clear that these are subject to discussion."    Nevertheless, Gacis said, he had already found "possible  points of agreement" in the position papers.    He conceded "there are also points where we have to close  the  gap," and this was why both sides agreed to study the matter  more closely before meeting again.    As for Misuari's reported wish to enter Cotabato City with  500 armed bodyguards, Yan said: "In the cease-fire agreement it  is clearly provided that both will refrain from provocative  acts."    Although the agreement has yet to be signed, Representative  Edgardo Ermita, a government negotiator, said it was already  being observed informally by both sides.    Yan refused to categorically call Misuari's request as  "provocative" saying only that "we see no need for a large  number of (MNLF) men to secure chairman Misuari, when we have  taken responsibility for his safety."</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Reversal prompts Neste shake-up NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, has initiated a wide-ranging recovery plan after slumping to a FM2.22bn (Dollars 375m) loss before taxes and reserves in 1992. The aim is to strengthen the group's balance sheet and return it to profit in 1994. The group will sell assets and businesses worth a 'number of billion Finnish markka' over the next few years, cut investments from FM4bn to FM2bn a year in 1994 and 1995, reduce staff by 1,300 to save FM300m, and cut other fixed costs by at least FM300m. Last year's losses followed a FM478m profit in 1991. The company struck a trading loss of FM125.7m in 1992, after a FM1.03bn profit in 1991, which was aggravated by interest expenses and foreign exchange losses. The latter totalled FM900m, and were mainly due to last September's decision to float the markka. Net sales rose to FM57.4bn from FM53.0bn, but the operating margin fell to FM1.8bn from FM2.6bn. Oil sales rose to FM46.0bn from FM42.7bn, while chemical sales increased to FM10bn from FM8.9bn.</p>

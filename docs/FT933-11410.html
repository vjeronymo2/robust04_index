			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Depreciation costs hit Philippine Airlines PHILIPPINE Airlines, the national airline which was privatised at the beginning of 1992, reports reduced profits for the year to March 1993 following a steep increase in depreciation charges. Net income for the year dipped by close to 8 per cent to 1.03bn pesos (Dollars 37.6m) from the previous year. Revenues moved ahead marginally to 24.43bn pesos, against 24.41bn pesos last time. Philippine Airlines said earnings would have been higher but for heavier depreciation which for last year took in depreciation on appraisal increments. Without this, profits would have been some 40 per cent higher, the company said. Expenses amounted to 23.01bn pesos, up 9 per cent. This, together with the higher depreciation charge, left operating profits flagging badly at 1.41bn pesos - down 57 per cent on 1991-92. The airline's assets at the end of March totalled 24.19bn pesos, up 21.5 per cent. Total liabilities were 33 per cent higher at 13.44bn pesos. The airline said its net worth grew over the year by 12.5 per cent to 9.15bn pesos. During the year Philippine Airlines pushed through a reorganisation which reduced the par value of its shares from 10 pesos to 5 pesos. The airline said the move helped wipe out accumulated deficits of 5bn pesos.</p>

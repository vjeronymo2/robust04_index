			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Report urges steps to end benefit fraud Strong measures to prevent benefit fraud have been advocated by Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP, in an effort to advance the debate on unemployment, which he says is 'dominated by ideologues of left and right'. He has published a report which 'rejects the Conservatives' tinkering with benefits and calls for a totally new approach to welfare: one that aims to reduce the numbers on welfare rather than punish those forced to depend on it'. Mr Field, who chairs the Commons committee on social security, has written the report with Mr Matthew Owen, a Liberal Democrat economist. The document, funded by Nuffield Foundation, says: Claimants suspected of defrauding the public should be required to register on a number of occasions each day with their local Jobcentre to ensure that they are undertaking adequate job searches and are maintaining and upgrading their skills. Employers should have to register all long-term openings with the employment service so that claimants can be offered real jobs before losing their benefits. Taxpayers will need to fund an employment service adequate to meet the challenge of a flexible labour market where continuing education is a basic requirement for all workers, no less for those in work than those in the dole queue. Government must wipe out benefit fraud as a start to building the foundations for full employability in Britain. Government must start viewing training schemes as opportunities for self-improvement and the betterment of claimants - and not as a means of punishing them. Beyond Punishment.

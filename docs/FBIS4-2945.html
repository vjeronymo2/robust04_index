			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Wide Social Angle" column by Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 </F> 3556): "`Vagabond Reporters' Swarm Into Guangzhou"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 12 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A  27-year-old graduate from the Chinese Language Department of  Beijing University named Xiao Cao not long ago suddenly made the  strange decision to resign from public office. He went to  Guangzhou from Hunan and joined the expanding ranks of "vagabond  [liu lang 3177 3186] reporters."    He is working as a reporter for a newspaper that can be  distributed only in the province. During the day, he is busy  going to streets and lanes, and in and out of government  institutions, to earn a floating salary several times higher  than that in the hinterland. At night, he sleeps in an office  on two desks joined together.    In comparison with regular reporters in Guangzhou, he has no  residency or house, does not enjoy free medical service or other  benefits, and is apt to lose his job at any time.    For all these reasons, "vagabond reporters" have no fear in  competing with regular reporters. They grab "real news"  whenever and wherever they can, showing their talents in press  circles. Guangdong newspapers now ranked third in the country.  Guangdong has more than 120 kinds of newspapers distributed  throughout the country and some 280 kinds of "restricted  publications" distributed only in the province. New newspapers  keeping appearing at sidewalk newsstands.    As there are many "restricted publications," there are many  restrictions on distribution and advertisements, and as funds  also are limited, these publishing houses are willing to recruit  "vagabond reporters" who do not have many burdens. As a matter  of fact, openly distributed newspapers also like to employ  "vagabond reporters" to make up the shortage of local reporters.  After the influential XIANDAIREN BAO [Modern People Journal]  switched to a daily newspaper, it said that it would select  reporters mostly from among the "vagabond reporters."    Generally speaking, the salaries of "vagabond reporters" are  much higher than those of regular reporters. The "vagabond  reporters" employed by XIANDAIREN BAO generally earn more than  2,000 yuan a month, and some may earn 3,000 to 4,000 yuan a  month. Regular reporters envy them very much.    Many "vagabond reporters" live an army-like life. DONGFANG  YEBAO [Oriental Evening News] provides its "vagabond reporters"  with a dormitory, bicycles, pagers, and food.    However, "vagabond reporters" are sometimes worried about  their future and feel they are living under others' roofs.    Initial statistics show that there are now about 100  "vagabond reporters" in Guangzhou. Yang Yikai, director of the  Publication Management Section of the Guangdong Provincial News  and Publication Bureau, told this reporter that "their capacity  should not be underestimated."    The presence of a large number of "vagabond reporters"  supports the emergence of new newspapers. Director Yang pointed  out: At a time when there is a large variety of readers,  advertisements, and contingents, the appearance of "vagabond  reporters" and the emergence new newspapers will bring about  prosperity in the press industry and the competition will force  old newspapers to improve their quality.</p>

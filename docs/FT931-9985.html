			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Turnover up but Sunbop earnings fall to R136.5m SUN International Boph-uthatswana (Sunbop), the South African gaming and leisure group, yesterday announced a 3 per cent fall in taxable profits to R136.5m (Dollars 43.7m) in the six months to December, down from R141.4m a year earlier. This was in spite of a 15 per cent increase in turnover by Sunbop, whose hotels are all located in the Bophuthatswana homeland, to R556.4m from R483.4m. Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, attributed the revenue performance, achieved in the face of an 'extremely poor economic environment', to having the benefit of its new Carousel resort for the full six months. The opening of the R830m Lost City project in December, amid saturation media coverage, also boosted turnover. Average occupancies at the company's hotels, however, dropped to 72 per cent from 78 per cent the previous year, and this put pressure on margins, leading to the lower profits. Earnings per share dropped to 93 cents per share, from 96 cents a year earlier, because of an increased number of shares in issue. The interim dividend was maintained at 64 cents a share.</p>

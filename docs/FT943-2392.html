			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Hungary presses state sell-off Hungary is to privatise 25 per cent of each of its five regional gas distribution companies this autumn, the state holding company AV Rt said yesterday. It said it would hold an international tender for the companies - which serve domestic gas users outside Budapest - in October or November with a view to selling the 25 per cent stakes this year. Registered share capital of the five companies is Ft44.5bn (Pounds 264m). Mr Peter Mihalyi, deputy privatisation commissioner, said gas privatisation would be followed up with the sale of a stake in the country's electricity company next year. He added that the government planned to present a new privatisation law to parliament next month to merge the SPA and the State Holding Company, Hungary's two privatisation bodies, into a single body. Another aim of the law would be to make sale procedures more transparent to counter popular suspicion of corruption and influence-trafficking in privatisation.</p>

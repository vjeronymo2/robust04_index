			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Spain and France tighten drift net fishing controls Spain and France have welcomed a decision to give EU inspectors greater powers to check fishing boats for oversized drift nets after skirmishes on the high seas between Spanish and French fishermen at the weekend, Reuter reports from Madrid. Spanish agriculture and fisheries minister Mr Luis Atienza said: 'I think we have achieved a notable strengthening of the processes of inspection and control which will be carried out by EU inspectors.' After a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in Brussels yesterday, Mr Atienza said France and Spain had agreed to let EU inspectors travel on national inspection vessels to check fishing boats. '(The decision) will reassert the credibility of the inspection process. Until now, inspectors came from individual countries and practice showed that French patrol boats . . . were not sufficiently diligent,' Mr Atienza said. On Saturday, 60 Spanish boats clashed with five French vessels 700km off the northern coast of Spain in the latest skirmish in the so-called 'tuna war'. A French trawler, La Gabrielle, was rammed and set alight with petrol bombs. Spanish fishermen claim it carries oversized nets. Spain's 300-strong fleet headed home on Monday with La Gabrielle in tow. Mr Atienza said the trawler would be returned to France after checks by Spanish authorities and EU inspectors. The French agriculture ministry welcomed the Brussels agreement but stressed that France 'would never and in no way accept Spanish constraints imposed by force'. Mr Alain Parres, president of the French fishermen's national federation, said he would demand that France lobby Spanish authorities for compensation for the La Gabrielle incident. 'We're going to demand compensation for the material damage and for the financial cost of lost catches,' Mr Parres said before meeting French agriculture minister, Mr Jean Puech. Mr Parres said he would also request better protection for French fishermen. EU rules forbid the use of nets longer than 2.5km and Spanish fishermen have consistently accused French boats of contravening these norms. French fishermen say the Spanish are trying to drive them out of the water. The environmental group Greenpeace reiterated its call for a total ban on drift nets. It said the existing ban was insufficient and regularly violated by EU fleets.</p>

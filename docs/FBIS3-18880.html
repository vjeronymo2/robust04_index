Since 1992, there have been only five annual  rates higher than February's 73 percent consumer inflation rate.    There were reports on Friday that a monetary crisis in  mid-January lifted Turkey's February inflation rate to 73  percent, the highest since last July.    The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) revealed Friday that  consumer prices shot up 6 percent in February to bring the  annual inflation figure to 73 percent following a 13.6 percent  lira devaluation on Jan. 26.    Consumer prices had risen 4.4 percent in January when  year-on-year inflation stood at 69.6 percent, and 3.6 percent  last December when the year-end figure was 71.1 percent. The  wholesale price index soared 10.1 percent in February, the  highest since January 1992 and almost doubling the 5.3 percent  figure for January. The 12-month rate rose to 68 percent from  60.6 in January.    A run on the lira from mid-January has caused turbulence in  financial markets and rapid depreciation of the lira. Shortly  after the Jan. 26 devaluation, the government launched a wave of  price hikes, which were followed by several price makers in the  private sector.    In the aftermath of the crisis, economists and observers  widely expected a substantial increase in price levels but Prime  Minister Ciller denied this.    "The impact of devaluation on the general level of prices  will not be as strong as they claim. During the whole year,  there will be an increase of about 3 to 4 percentage points in  the inflation rate due to the devaluation," she said in a recent  statement.    But financial analysts predict an even higher rate in March.  They reason that several retailers have implemented massive  price hikes since the end of February and beginning of March.  "The damage, spilling over from higher prices in the government  sector, will be felt more clearly during March," said one  economist.    The announcement of March figures on April 4 will come after  the election period.    Economists pointed out that there was a reverse occurrence  of  wholesale and retail figures in February, supporting  expectations of a bleaker inflation picture for March. "The  general tendency is that retail prices rise faster than  wholesale prices. In February the situation was reversed. This  was because several retailers were not too quick to respond to  changes in wholesale prices," explained one economist. In a  related development, the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (ITO)  announced that its own price indices for February produced a  year-on-year consumer inflation rate of 73.7 percent, only a  slight 0.7 percentile up on the DIE figure. ITO said retail  prices in February rose by 9 percent. Observers say Ciller's  failure to defeat rampant inflation, a promise made several  months ago, has significantly lowered her True Path Party's  (DYP) popularity and has jeopardized her election chances.</p>

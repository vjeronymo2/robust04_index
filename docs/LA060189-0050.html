			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTWOOD;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEM SET  </P> <P> Work began last week on a $4.2-million computerized traffic control system for  the heavily congested streets in and around Westwood.  </P> <P> Known as ATSAC, or Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control, the system is  similar to one that has cut intersection delays by 20% and travel time by 13%  in the Coliseum area, said S.E. Rowe, general manager of the city  Transportation Department.  </P> <P> Using electronic sensors implanted in the pavement, ATSAC relays information  about the flow of traffic to a control center in City Hall, where computers  regulate the timing of traffic signals.  </P> <P> The system is financed by fees paid by developers whose projects contribute to  traffic congestion.  </P> <P> The Westwood ATSAC area connects traffic signals in the area bounded by the San  Diego Freeway on the west, Beverly Hills on the east, Olympic Boulevard on the  south and Montana Avenue, Wilshire Boulevard and UCLA on the north.  </P> <P> "By next March, West Los Angeles will have the first installment of a truly  space-age traffic control network," City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. "I  look forward to better traffic conditions here and throughout the city with the  implementation of ATSAC."  </P></p>

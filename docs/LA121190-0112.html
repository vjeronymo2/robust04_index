			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL REPORT: SEEKING A NEW WORLD;  </P> <P> THE YEAR 2010: A VIEW FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT  </P> <P> With the turn of the millennium approaching and the end of the Cold War  remaking the map, governments around the world have sent scholars to their  crystal balls. Most of the resulting reports have been unmemorable -- but one  provocative forecast has come from the U.S. State Department. Written by  Michael Vlahos, director of the department's Center for the Study of Foreign  Affairs, it offers some predictions for the next 20 years:  </P> <P> </P> <P> * A global power balance is dominated by three world powers: the United  States/Canada, the European Community and Japan. The main concern for U.S.  foreign policy becomes the economic and political challenge posed by the EC and  Japan.  </P> <P> * The decomposition of the Soviet Union continues through the 1990s. Most of  the non-Slavic republics gain independence, and a new federation dominated by  Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia emerges around 2010. Its gross national  product and production technology will be roughly equivalent to those of India  and China.  </P> <P> * The European Community progresses steadily but slowly toward complete  economic integration and political confederation. The Eastern European  economies will be absorbed and dominated by the Continent's strongest financial  power, the new Germany. The Soviets, too, will rely on German financing to stay  afloat. By 2010, most American military forces are withdrawn from the  Continent.  </P> <P> * East Asia becomes a cockpit of competition, not integration. A decline in  U.S. ability and willingness to maintain large military forces across the  Pacific, plus the growing strength of Asian countries' own armies, will  gradually end America's role as the referee of East Asian affairs. A united  Korea emerges as Japan's most aggressive competitor. Japan's relations with its  neighbors become touchy.  </P> <P> * The United States reassesses its role in the world and its domestic political  system. In the wake of the Cold War and amid a widespread perception that the  federal government isn't working, domestic politics turns to the job of  renewing the American system. Party realignment follows. The U.S. world role  turns somewhat more isolationist, under a doctrine of "selective engagement"  that avoids long-term commitments like those of the Cold War.  </P> <P> * The political use of military force declines. Production technology is seen  increasingly as the new yardstick of world power, replacing the traditional  measures of heavy ground forces and nuclear arsenals. But the world powers do  continue to deploy military forces, concentrating their interest on the oceans  -- and outer space. NATO gradually recedes in importance; Western Europe  becomes an autonomous military power.  </P> <P> * Regional conflicts and instability continue. The United States, Japan and the  Western Europeans attempt to maintain world stability through joint action, but  the United States finds itself increasingly at odds with the others as the  stakes in the global economic competition grow. Major regional issues may  escalate as the world powers assist different sides. Potential clashes among  China, India and the Soviet Union could threaten other powers' interests.  </P> <P>  Are President Bush's advisers using this as a blueprint? "I don't think so,"  Vlahos laughs. "They haven't had time to read it. They've been completely  caught up in the events of the moment." On the other hand, the Soviet Embassy  in Washington took four copies.  </P> <P> </P></p>

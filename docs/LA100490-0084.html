			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 2 U.S. MARINES FACE ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES AFTER VEHICLE INJURES STRIKER  </P> <P> Philippine police filed attempted murder charges Wednesday against two U.S.  Marines whose military vehicle hit a barricade set up by strikers at Clark Air  Base and slightly injured one worker.  </P> <P> A police officer said that Marine Sgt. David Akers and Cpl.  </P> <P> Gary Motler also were charged with disrupting a peaceful meeting. The hometowns  of the two were not immediately available.  </P> <P> The charges were filed with the government prosecutor's office which, with  sufficient evidence, could elevate the case to a trial court. The officer did  not say what sentences the Marines could receive if they are convicted.  </P> <P> Clark authorities said they were unaware of the charges and declined to  comment.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, eight U.S. Marine vehicles and their Philippine air force jeep  escort were passing through the gate when the second vehicle in the convoy  accidentally hit a wooden barricade.  </P> <P> Pieces of the barricade hit a striker, one of several dozen picketers guarding  a gate at Clark, bruising him in the back, Clark spokesmen and police said.  Clark is 50 miles north of Manila.  </P> <P> U.S. military authorities said the incident was an accident and apologized.  </P> <P> But union officials called it a provocation against Filipino workers whose  strike began Sunday at Clark and five other U.S. facilities over wage  increases. The strikers contend that the United States has violated a bilateral  agreement covering Filipino employees that foresees salary increases based on a  survey of 35 Philippine firms.  </P> <P> The U.S. Congress has placed a 3% cap on pay increases for federal employees,  including those oversees, but the recent wage survey suggested an 18% increase.  </P></p>

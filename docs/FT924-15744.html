			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Digital to cut costs by Dollars 1bn a year MR ROBERT PALMER, who yesterday took over at the helm of Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, said yesterday he intended to cut costs by Dollars 1bn a year to restore the struggling company to profitability. He said he would rationalise the company's product line, eliminate redundancy in research and development and increase the pace at which the company was reducing the size of its workforce. 'Reducing unnecessary expense is vital and we are looking at every expense, whether large or small.' Digital, once second only to International Business Machines among international computer companies, has reported losses for the past two fiscal years. For the 1992 financial year ended in June, the company recorded losses of Dollars 2.7bn on sales of Dollars 7.7bn while in 1991 losses were Dollars 617m on sales of Dollars 8.3bn. 'The historically high profit margin on hardware and the business model upon which Digital was built are no longer sustainable,' Mr Palmer said. Digital has been hit hard by moves to smaller, less expensive computer systems which command significantly lower gross profit margins than the company's traditional minicomputer lines. It also failed to move quickly enough into personal computers and open or industry standard systems. Mr Palmer was speaking on his first day as president and chief executive, the post he has taken over from Mr Kenneth Olsen, Digital's founder, who was principally identified with the company's failure to keep pace with the new structure of the industry. Mr Palmer said: 'Digital is going to change. It will take time but we are going to begin today. Digital will undergo a transformation.' He said Digital would refocus its research and development spending. 'Our plan will be to reduce and re-allocate funds to support research and development that satisfies customers and provides an appropriate level of return. This will be a cultural change for Digital.' There was overlap and redundancy within Digital's current product line, Mr Palmer acknowledged.</p>

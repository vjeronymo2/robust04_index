			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  CLOTHESLINES: WEAVING OLD JACKETS INTO NEW WARDROBE  </P> <P> Question: Now that women's clothes are less mannish, what do I do with my two  blazer jackets that have served me so well? One is a navy Anne Klein II and one  is a beige Mary Ann Restivo. Both are in good-to-excellent condition. I'm a  39-year-old working mother with lots of demands on my paycheck and can't afford  to throw out good clothes. -- O.P.  </P> <P> Answer: If you can give your jackets vest-like closings, as illustrated here,  you'll be right in step with spring/summer fashion. The jacket in our sketch is  Vogue 7422, in case you need a pattern. If you sew or have someone who sews for  you, check out Very Easy Very Vogue 7335, which offers three versions of vests,  with and without lapels. These are real, sleeveless vests, and they can be worn  in lieu of jackets over shirts, blouses or turtlenecks or, when summer strikes,  over nothing but skin. A lot of people in the fashion industry believe that the  vest will replace the T-shirt this summer as the top top for hot weather.  </P> <P> Q: I will graduate from college this June and go immediately to work in a law  office. My college wardrobe is totally unsuitable, and I need advice on how to  start building a work wardrobe. Please tell me how to start from scratch. --  E.M.K.  </P> <P> A: If you can get by for the first week with college leftovers, wait to begin  your new work wardrobe until you've seen what other young women in the office  wear. Or, better yet, if your boss is a woman, follow the lead of Melanie  Griffith in "Working Girl," who worked her way up by mimicking her boss  (Sigourney Weaver).  </P> <P> Your first major purchase should be a jacket -- one with a vest-like hemline,  as mentioned above -- or any jacket without a collar. Cardigans look especially  fresh right now. If you choose a fabric such as a beige washed silk, you will  be able to wear it with any color skirt, and you'll soon find that dark skirts  are much more practical than light ones.  </P></p>

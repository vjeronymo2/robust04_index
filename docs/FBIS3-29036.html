			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Correspondent Liu Zhenyan from Phuket] </F>   [Excerpts] Taiwan President Li Teng-hui, accompanied by  his wife and a 40-member delegation, arrived in Phuket on  Valentine's Day. [passage omitted]    Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, in his personal  capacity, hosted a party for the Taiwan president and his  delegation at the Dusit Laguna Hotel last night. Chen Youhan  [Thai name: Chatri Sophonphanit; president of the Bangkok  Bank], Hu Yulin [Thai Name: Saman Ophatwong; chairman of the  Thai Rice Exporters Association], Li Guanglong [Thai Name:  Wisit Lilasithon; chairman of the Wall Street Finance &amp;  Securities Company and the Wall Street Tower], and Chen Zhuohao  [Thai name: Sumit Loetsumit; chairman of the board of directors  of the Si Thai Superware Company] were among the Thai-Chinese  businessmen invited to attend the banquet.    An informed source told our correspondent that Li Teng-hui's  visit resulted from mediation by Gu Liansong, who has close  relations with the Thai-Chinese business community and once was  chairman of the Taiwan-Thai Business Committee and advisor to  Taiwan's Executive Branch.    Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai met President Li while  attending  an international monetary meeting in Taiwan late last year.  Yesterday's meeting was the second between Amnuai and Li  Teng-hui in seven months.    Meanwhile, a Chinese National People's Congress [NPC]  delegation led by Zhu Liang, chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs  Committee, may delay or cancel its visit to Thailand as a result  of Li Teng-hui's visit. The delegation is scheduled to visit  Thailand at the end of this month at the invitation of  Parliament President Marut Bunnak.</p>

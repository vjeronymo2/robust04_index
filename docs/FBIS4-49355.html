			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News and Current Events" program] </F>   [Text] The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the  Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region [SAR] has begun its first group meetings in Hong Kong.  The meeting of the political ad hoc group began on 2 May, and  that of the economic ad hoc group will follow two days later.    Lu Ping, vice chairman and secretary of the PWC; PWC Vice  Chairman Zhou Nan, and the mainland members of the two ad hoc  groups will attend the group meetings to join other businessmen  members from Hong Kong in discussing a series of important items  on the agenda.    During the meetings, PWC members will hear Hong Kong  compatriots' opinions on Hong Kong's smooth transition and on  successfully carrying out the work of the PWC.    At the 2 May meeting of the political ad hoc group, the  participants discussed issues on organs to be set up on the  mainland by the SAR government. Some members strongly  criticized the report on Sino-UK relations issued by the UK  Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, pointing out that the  report is trying to play the international card. It negates the  articles of the Basic Law and supports Chris Patten's program.  This shows that Britain is determined to continue its policy of  confrontation with China on the Hong Kong issue.    Meanwhile, various newspapers published in Hong Kong on 2  May  carried news of the holding of the PWC group meetings in Hong  Kong, and some of the newspapers published editorials welcoming  the PWC's meeting in Hong Kong.</p>

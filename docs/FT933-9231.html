			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Japan's PM to quit if reforms stall MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday indicated that he is ready to resign if his seven-party coalition government fails to implement promised political reforms by the end of the year. In his first press conference as prime minister, Mr Hosokawa was blunt in answering questions, providing a stark contrast to the often rambling and unintelligible replies proffered by leaders of previous Liberal Democratic party governments. The LDP has just lost office after governing for 38 years. However, the substance of the prime minister's answers was not very different. Mr Hosokawa promised to take 'full responsibility' if plans to overhaul the electoral system are not realised this year - an answer which, in Japan, means he is willing to resign. The coalition's priority is to replace a corruption-prone multi-seat constituency system with a combination of single seats and proportional representation. The parties have also promised to introduce a ban on corporate political donations. Explaining that there should be some continuity, Mr Hosokawa was irritated by suggestions that his coalition's cabinet, dominated by ex-LDP politicians, is the LDP in disguise: 'There is a clear difference in the way we will do things. We are not the same.' One difference was in the conduct of the press conference. Mr Hosokawa preferred to stand rather than sit in the velvet chair preferred by his predecessor, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, and he appeared without his parliamentary badge on his lapel. Lapel badges are worn by Japanese workers to indicate corporate loyalty, but Mr Hosokawa has suggested that he dislikes the creation of status distinction through badges. When asked yesterday why his lapel was bare, he said it was not his habit to wear the badge outside parliament. Mr Hosokawa stated clearly that Japan was the aggressor in the second world war, and said the country was still hoping for a settlement with Russia over the disputed Kurile Islands, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the war. Japan, he said, would continue to provide 'appropriate' aid to Moscow. On trade relations with the US, he said the setting of numerical targets for market share, as Washington has requested, is a violation of market principles, but he conceded that the large trade surplus concerns the new government, which will attempt to improve market access. He said the government was considering a review of budgetary procedure, which he considers 'rigid', and wants to increase spending that 'will improve the quality of people's life'. It was unclear whether he was talking about the budget for the year beginning in April. In handling issues of policy conflict between the conservative coalition members and the left-leaning Social Democratic party, Mr Hosokawa was brief but unclear. For example, he said a rice market opening, opposed by the SDP, was banned by a parliamentary resolution, but did not say if he planned to amend that resolution.</p>

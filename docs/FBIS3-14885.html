			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev--The trial of Major Anatoliy Lysenko, a staff  member of the Mostiska customs house of the Security Service of  Ukraine [SBU], continued in Warsaw on 28 February. Lysenko is  accused of espionage. The prosecutor is demanding a five-year  prison sentence for Lysenko.    Asked by a UNIAN correspondent to comment on the "Lysenko  case", SBU Chairman Yevhen Marchuk said: "We have been trying  for a long time now not to make any comment at all on this  regrettable incident in mutual relations between our two  neighboring, friendly states. I would like to say only that SBU  Major Anatoliy Lysenko has nothing to do with our intelligence.  He had no mission and went to Poland with his wife and children  to attend to personal matters. The only thing that he may be  rebuked for is that he went abroad without having waited for the  SBU leadership's consent, thus acting in breach of service  discipline. Our view is that the Polish special services'  actions with respect to Lysenko were instigated by someone else:  There probably are certain forces in Poland that do not want  rapprochement between our friendly people. Nevertheless, we  hope common sense will prevail".</p>

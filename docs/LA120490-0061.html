			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: ANNE MALL  </P> <P> School: Dana Hills High School  </P> <P> Sport: Tennis  </P> <P> Position: No. 1 Singles  </P> <P> Class: Junior  </P> <P> Despite aggravating a groin muscle and playing in pain for much of the match,  Mall defeated Nicole Hummel of San Marino to win the Southern Section  individual singles championship Friday. Although it took Mall three sets to  dispatch Hummel, her sweep of Keri Phebus of Corona del Mar in the semifinals  might be more noteworthy.  </P> <P> Mall had never beaten Phebus, the section's two-time defending champion, in  either USTA junior competition or in three high school seasons. Mall avenged  her only two losses of the season. Phebus had beaten Mall twice -- in a  nonleague match and the semifinals of the Division 4-A team playoffs. Mall, who  recently won the USTA National Indoor Hardcourt singles championship, is on  pace to graduate after her junior year. She plans on either concentrating on  tennis or attending a four-year university on a tennis scholarship next year.  </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> Missy Clements, who had 14 kills and three blocks to lead La Habra to a  three-game sweep over King City Saturday as the Highlanders won their second  consecutive state Division II volleyball championship.  </P> <P> Olivia DiCamilli, who had 39 points and 19 rebounds in Costa Mesa's 65-59  victory over Huntington Beach in a nonleague basketball game Friday.  </P> <P> Lynn Murray, who scored four goals in an 8-0 Esperanza soccer victory over El  Modena Thursday.  </P> <P> Tracy Schriber, who had 13 kills and was named the tournament's most valuable  player in leading Corona del Mar to a four-game victory over Mountain View St.  Francis in the state Division I championship match Saturday.  </P></p>

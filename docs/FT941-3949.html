			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Management: Tuning the channel - After Digital's big job cuts in Europe, Alan Cane explains the company's plans to revamp its distribution The problems faced by Digital Equipment, once second only to International Business Machines as a computer manufacturer, are brutally clear. It is losing money, its sales are declining, and it is supporting a cost structure several percentage points higher than the market can afford. Across the world, Digital is seeking its salvation through cost cutting, successful sales of its 'Alpha' chip, the world's fastest microprocessor, and market acceptance of the company's approach to 'client-server' systems, which customers are beginning to favour over older, centralised approaches to data processing. But in Europe the company's hopes are pinned on a specific plan which involves a fundamental shift in its approach to distributors, software houses and systems integrators, the 'business partners' who sell Digital computers directly to customers, adding value in the form of special software and services. Digital's problems are particularly acute in Europe which now provides about 50 per cent of its global revenues. In a frank report in the company's European newsletter last month Ed Lucente, corporate vice president for sales and marketing, warned top managers that Digital faced its toughest third and fourth quarters: this after two years with only one quarter in profit. He said: 'We are being outgunned in the marketplace.' The plan to put this right has been put in place by Vincenzo Damiani, a 53-year-old former IBM senior executive who became the company's president at the beginning of the year. It will involve substantial restructuring. Some 6,000 of the European organisation's 29,000 employees will be made redundant this year. Analyses carried out by special project teams have suggested that Digital's productivity is half the industry average. Digital has made many mistakes over the past decade. It was slow to understand that personal computers would become the dominant force in the industry. It was slow to realise that high-powered workstations would form the basis of client-server computing. Worst of all it failed to manage its distribution channels in a consistent fashion. The trouble is that the business model for success in the computer industry has changed irrevocably. In the heyday of the mainframe, a small number of major manufacturers sold computers commanding high gross profit margins to their customers through big, expensive direct sales forces. Customers wrote their own software or hired software companies to do it for them. Today, the profit margin on hardware is too slim to support such an expensive structure and the relative importance of business partners - the 'channel' - has grown enormously. Channel partners not only distribute hardware but sell packaged software, help customers develop their own programs and work with them on installing complex networks. What is necessary for successful channel management? First, a sensible discount structure so the channel can make reasonable profits. IBM, which has had to learn about channel management just as painfully as Digital, was criticised by distributors until recently for pricing policies which made it difficult for them to make money. Second, a guarantee that the manufacturer will not compete with the distributor or systems house either by selling directly or by developing customer software. The spectacular growth of Compaq, the world's leading high-performance personal computer manufacturer, was helped by a policy of selling only through distributors. Third, manufacturer and channel must work together to their mutual benefit, agreeing, for example, joint investment in product promotions. It is no exaggeration to say that a computer company's success today is likely to be directly proportional to its ability to manage its channel relationships. This is particularly true of smaller customers (expensive to reach through a direct salesforce), who will look to distributors and resellers for systems and service. Europe's 2m to 3m smaller customers are nevertheless the best hope for growth, so it is worrying for Digital that its products are represented in only about 20,000 to 30,000 of them. Enrico Pesatori, general manager of Digital's personal computer business unit, admits that the company has 'never had a rational or coherent approach to our channel partners'. Damiani says: 'The nub is how well we do in future with our partners. You have to complement rather than antagonise'. He refers continually to working with partners rather than through them, and insists this is more than mere semantics: 'To work through partners gives a very clear idea that the two parties are not working at the same level,' he chides. 'We must select partners with care. We should not have hundreds, but only the ones we need.' The plan, which Damiani dubs his 'Go to Market' strategy, has three elements. First, Digital's 500 or so key European accounts will be managed directly by account executives. They will represent Digital to their customers and have the responsibility for making the customer's voice heard within the organisation. The success of these account executives will be measured on the percentage that Digital takes of the customer's total data processing budget, no matter what channel is used. Second, the small to medium company market will be served by a combination of the direct sales force and channel partners. The principal aim here will be to persuade customers to move to systems based on Digital's Alpha chip. Attracting new customers will depend on strong relationships with software houses and value-added resellers. Third, the large piece of the market represented by very small enterprises and individuals will be directly managed by distributors and the larger value-added resellers. Damiani's plan for Digital's European business partners is a model of the way the company must transform itself globally if it is to survive as a force in data processing. Pesatori is in no doubt the partners must believe Digital has changed: 'This time,' he says, 'we have to persuade them we are for real.'</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> HACKED-UP ADAPTATION FAILS TO MAKE 'CHORUS' A CUT ABOVE  </P> <P> Scarborough, the English coastal resort city that is the setting of "A Chorus  of Disapproval" (Music Hall and Esquire) -- and also the home of its writer,  Alan Ayckbourn -- looks a lovely, eccentric place. Cold cliffs sweep to a paved  esplanade, and the town is full of hilly streets that wind up between  gingerbread houses, dingy pubs and Victorian hotels. In such a town, Alec  Guinness, in a fey '50s comedy, might have wandered bemusedly, lamb to the  slaughter for the flamboyant zanies inside.  </P> <P> Instead of Guinness, this hacked-up adaptation of Ayckbourn's wry play has  Jeremy Irons, playing the befogged Guy Jones, haplessly seeking companionship  in a Scarborough community production of "The Beggar's Opera."  </P> <P> Guy is right: The theater is the place to meet people, the place where  wallflowers become femmes fatales, wimps become superstuds. Though he has the  aggressiveness of a lily pad and the sexual smolder of a pressed tweed suit, he  soon tumbles into one adulterous amour with the director's neglected wife,  Hannah (Prunella Scales, of "Fawlty Towers"), and another with voracious Fay  (Jenny Seagrove), a woman who pumps undreamed-of lascivious metaphor into the  word veal.  </P> <P> Like many amateur groups, this one is riddled with good intentions, high  hamminess and sexual intrigue. The director, Dafydd Ap Llewellyn (Anthony  Hopkins), is a temperamental tyrant: a sentimental Welsh lawyer who throws  tantrums with geyser regularity and seems less concerned with hearing the  actors than playing to them, springboards for his weird, dreamy malice.  </P> <P> But instead of a Robert Hamer or an Alexander Mackendrick -- a director in tune  with classic British movie comedy -- to handle all this, "Chorus" has  producer-director Michael Winner. Like Jack the Ripper, Winner has a crucial  flaw: He likes to cut.  </P> <P> From "I'll Never Forget What's 'is Name" to "Death Wish I, II and III," Winner  has never been a man to shoot one set-up when seven will do. And Ayckbourn's  humor depends on keeping his characters within a habitable universe, letting  the action grow organically around them.  </P> <P> There's not a bad actor in the cast but barely a complete performance. Seagrove  has a nice, brittle lewdness, but Winner's camera seems so transfixed by her  derriere, he reverses strategy and holds her shots too long. Irons is such a  limp Guy that he seems capable of dribbling into the crannies.  </P> <P> As Dafydd, the play's great part, Hopkins gives his most contorted performance  since the Hunchback of Notre Dame, whose posture he almost duplicates.  Scrunched-up, stiff-shouldered, roaring, whispering, rasping, Dafydd is a piece  of spiced ham, burnt to a crisp. His melancholy eyes pop at you out of the  charred lines.  </P> <P> It's a shame that Winner the producer -- who's assembled a splendid cast, fine  script and locations -- is so ill-served by Winner the director, who treats the  play's wit like salami thrown into the slicer of his movieola. He's as  shameless as Guy fingering his drawers. The material suggests the deft whimsy  of "The Man in the White Suit" or "Tight Little Island." But the execution is  just that: a slaughter. Winner keeps chopping off the heads of his scenes,  battle-axing his actors. Behind every Ayckbourn on-target mal mot you can  practically hear a directorial growl: "Arf a mo', mate. I like to cut!"  </P></p>

The official disclosed these events in an interview with the  official GRANMA newspaper. He also said that changes in  relations between the two countries were unlikely during William  Clinton's administration.    Rodriguez said that "a possible solution to the U.S.-Cuba  crisis" had been interrupted by Carter's decision to accuse Cuba  of being responsible for the internal conflict in Zaire, which  was triggered by armed refugee groups on the border with Angola.    He recounted that he was scheduled meet secretly with then  Secretary of State Cyrus Vance at the apartment of Andrew Young,  then U.S. representative to the United Nations, on the same day  that hostilities broke out in the African nation.    Rodriguez said that Vance was meeting with former USSR  Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko when Carter gave the speech in  which he made his charges. Thus, it was the Cuban official who  informed Vance of the U.S. president's statements when they met.    Vance apparently did not know that Carter had decided to  make  this announcement; embarrassed, he ended the meeting. The Cuban  vice president added that it later became known that Cuba had  had nothing to do with the Zaire events "but the opportunity to  begin negotiations had passed."    Rodriguez indicated that the Clinton administration's  position is based on the idea that Cuba could collapse in the  immediate future. It is also under pressure from the most  recalcitrant sectors of the Cuban-American community and its  allies.    He added that the Clinton administration is not being  pressed  to make decisions and "that is why it is difficult to expect a  change in relations between the United States and Cuba."    The vice president emphasized that Washington has become  obstinate in its intent to regain its control over the island.  He added that the possibility of a new U.S. attack was greater  during the Republican governments of Ronald Reagan and George  Bush.    Our land has not had a moment of respite in the enjoyment of  its independence, he asserted.</p>

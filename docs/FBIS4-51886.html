			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] At the Light Industry Committee's Garment  Research Center    A little while ago, we visited a garment research center  which has set out to realize the policy of putting light  industry first. We were filled with joy that there, upholding  the Great Leader's New Year's Address, new garment research  results are being produced which will give great joy to our  people, who are pressing forward the overall advance of  Socialism. [passage omitted]    The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out the  following.    "The garment-research enterprise will have to be done well  for the specialization of clothing production, for ceaselessly  developing processing technology, and for setting up a clothing  system well suited for the Socialist mode of living and the  figures of the Korean people."    Our first stop was the Materials Research Office. Office  director Comrade Pyong Kwang-chol set out very thin copper leaf  [tongbakpan]. We found out that it was the material for a mold  to make a cylindrical metallic screen [kumsok wontong chaebon],  the heart of the adhesive lining machine [chopchak simji kigye].    Lining forms the skeleton of clothing. Early on, our  scientists and chemical-factory workers were successful in  taking materials plentiful in or country and making them high  grade using chemical methods. Thus, the garment industry has  made easy use of clothes lining made from weaving lining  material, pasting it to any fabric with an adhesive developed  our way.    The research center did not stop at this. Last year it newly  developed an efficient adhesive lining machine capable of  meeting the nationwide demand for lining with just one machine.  Completing its design, the research center turned it over to a  weaving-machine factory. Even so, the office decided to make and  guarantee the cylindrical metallic screen itself. This was  because among lining machines, the cylindrical metallic screen,  which holds the adhesive and sprays it on fabric, is a part very  difficult to manufacture.    During the first week of the new year, the Materials  Research  Office brought about collective reform, creating the mold  material for the screen. Displaying their revolutionary spirit  of self-reliant innovation, the members of this office,  including researcher Comrade Yi Sang-chun, devoted themselves to  manufacturing a screen mold with this material. We too became  confident that if the cylindrical metallic screen was completed  by the end of March, as they resolved, an adhesive lining  machine would easily be born in time for the holidays of April.    We entered the room where the automated clothing-design  research collective works. Office director Comrade Sim  Pang-hyang introduced us to a young researcher absorbed in  assembling electronic elements in the middle of the room, which  had large and small pieces of modern electronic equipment  installed around the room like folding screens. It was computer  expert Comrade Nam Sung-il, winner of the Beacon Award for New  Technological Innovation.    Adopting the computer to tailoring technology in our own  way,  he developed a new type of automated body-measuring apparatus,  technologically more modern and also suited to the figures of  Koreans. Put on display in the Three Revolutions Exhibition  Hall, it is getting people's attention. When a person enters and  stands in the automated body-measuring apparatus, the form of  his or her body is automatically measured by a television  camera. While this is happening, an appropriate clothing pattern  is drawn by a computer. All the cutter has to do is take this  and cut the fabric.    However, unsatisfied with this and determined to follow the  Great Leader's New Year's Address, the clothing-design research  collective began a research project of a higher stage for the  most precise automated design of clothing form, using a  three-dimensional design method, in accordance with people's  preferences and demands.    Within the research collective beat devoted hearts of  loyalty, working to gloriously realize the lofty purpose of the  Great Leader and the Dear Leader, who with tremendous love and  care concern themselves with clothing the people in smart,  good-looking clothes. Researchers Comrade Yi Kyong-sun and  Comrade Yang Il-sun in particular worked hard to guarantee the  scientific character of materials analysis, adopting new  analytical methods from the analysis of body-measurement data on  Koreans accumulated over a long period. They thus created a  breakthrough capable of advancing to the middle of January  completion of the enormous task of data analysis.    Immediately upon completion of data analysis, the research  collective will make clothing patterns appropriate for male  figures by the February holidays, and clothing patterns  appropriate for female figures by the April holidays. They set  up bold objectives for the time after that, to be of service to  residents by making various other types of clothing patterns. We  drew a picture of the level of clothing-manufacturing service to  be provided to our people when this objective is realized.    Next, we stopped by the Process Research Office.    Office director Comrade Sim Chun-chan laid open a thick data  book entitled, Clothing Manufacturing Time Handbook  [Oskagongsi Pyollam]. The numbers filling every page, even  at first glance, seemed to speak of the hard research and  thinking devoted by the scientists of this place.    Precisely stipulating manufacturing time by clothing product  type and clothing part was presented as an important requirement  for further raising production efficiency and product quality,  by guaranteeing balance between production processes in garment  factories. In order to solve this problem, office members,  including researcher Comrade Chong Kun-myong and testing  technician Comrade Kim Chae-ok, for several years went to  garment factories in Pyongyang, Kanggye, and Hamhung, passing  around machine tools directly. Taking scientific measurements of  the manufacturing time of the numerous types of clothing and  clothing parts, they put together a data book.    This became a precious reference work for garment-factory  workers. In keeping with the great leader's New Year's Address,  the researchers united their strength and wisdom to enable  workers to easily and widely make use of this data book.    This was the creation of programs capable of determining  clothing-manufacturing time by product type using computers.  [passage omitted]    Going around visiting the Computer Research Office and  various other units, we were able to gain the certainty that,  with the interest and backing of the Light Industry Committee,  the scientists of this place will realize the policy of putting  light industry first and will greatly contribute with scientific  knowledge and technology to improving the dress of our people.</p>

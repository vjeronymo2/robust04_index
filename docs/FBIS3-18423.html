			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Changes Will Refresh Government"] </F>   [Text] A good opportunity is opening up for Esko Aho's  nonsocialist government to obtain fresh blood for the government  when the Eduskunta elects a new speaker next Monday [8  February], and when Martti Pura, the minister of agriculture,  departs soon to become the city manager of Sodankyla. Let us  hope that the government makes skillful use of both  opportunities. The government is tired and in a rut. It needs  competent new ministers to manage during the year remaining  before the Eduskunta elections.    The Conservatives have wanted to change ministers for a long  time, but the undertaking did not succeed in practice. The  speaker's post will be vacated by Ilkka Suominen, who is moving  to Alko [alcoholic beverage monopoly] in the nick of time. If  the Conservatives name one of their ministers as the new speaker  -- for example Riitta Uosukainen -- space will naturally be  created in the government. During the government's term, four  Center Party ministers have already been changed, but the  Conservatives continue with their original makeup. Experience  has not helped the Conservatives win victories in the  government; it is high time to see if a personnel change will  bring new vigor to their government group.    It would pay the Conservatives, however, to consider  carefully whom they change and to what post. It would be useless  -- although there are attempts -- to move Ilkka Kanerva from the  Labor Ministry a year before the Eduskunta election. The shift  would look like desertion. One would wish that the Center Party,  for its part, would realize that, on the threshold of important  EU [European Union] negotiations affecting agriculture, it is  time to implement a fundamental change in the intellectual and  skill qualifications at the Ministry of Agriculture. The  leadership of the ministry can only be assumed by someone who  knows foreign languages and can operate smoothly in the world.</p>

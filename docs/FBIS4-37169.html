			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, June 11--Seven crude bombs were found  yesterday at Talkatora Stadium, a couple of hours before the All  India Congress Committee (AICC) session was to commence. The  bombs were found near the main dais from where Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao was to address the delegates and then remain  seated there for some time.    Sources said the bombs were made of `sutli' (rope) and some  explosive powder. However, these devices were meant to scare the  security agencies and drive home the point that the elaborate  network was pierced. The bombs did not have any time device or  detonator.    These devices were found during the security drill two or  three hours before the session was to commence. The bomb  disposal experts detected the devices near the dais and took  them away for analysis. Sources reiterated that the devices were  placed by miscreants or terrorists to make their presence felt.  They, apparently, did not want to explode bombs there.    Intelligence agencies were now making efforts to trace the  loophole. They were alarmed about this breach in tight security.  A massive security operation was launched three days before the  session was to commence. Experts of the National Security Guards  (NSG) bomb disposal squad, the Special Protection Group (SPG)  were assisting the Delhi Police to ensure security. The main  dais was handed over to the SPG 48 hours before the session was  to commence. The bombs were found yesterday morning.    Two Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP), nine Assistant  Commissioners (ACP), ten inspectors, 50 sub-inspectors, 130 head  constables and 600 constables of the Delhi Police were  responsible for the security along with the SPG and other  agencies. Separate parking lots were earmarked for the VlPs and  only those cars with special parking labels were allowed to  enter.    Security was tightened around the State guest houses where  the VIPs including Chief Ministers were staying. Entry was  restricted to the Talkatora Stadium and metal detectors were  installed at all the entrances.    The hedges and thick foliage around the stadium were trimmed  as a precaution and personnel of the para-military forces were  stationed there. Trained `spotters' from the Intelligence Bureau  (IB), the Delhi Police and other agencies fanned out in various  places of the city to keep tabs on hide-outs of terrorists.</p>

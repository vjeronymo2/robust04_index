			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Hong Kong (1): A test of nerves - The rise in US interest rates and concern about the Chinese government's ability to control its economy are clouding the outlook for Hong Kong, whose claim to be a financial centre of consequence is being tested This is Hong Kong's year of living dangerously. It is a year when the colony's claim to be a regional financial centre of consequence will be severely tested. Unusually, the tests it now faces have nothing to do with the Sino-British row over Hong Kong's political development. Britain and China appear to have reached a tacit agreement to draw a line under that dispute and are in the process of sorting out the remaining, mostly non-political, issues which need attention before the mid-1997 handover of sovereignty. The problems facing Hong Kong come from the US and China, and are a mixture of politics and economics. They could delay one of the most remarkable transformations in Hong Kong's ever-changing corporate personality or, at worst, threaten its new-found and potential financial might. US interest rates are on the rise and, because of the link between the American and the Hong Kong dollar, that means Hong Kong's interest rates are also heading up. The change in the direction of interest rates - initiated by the US Federal Reserve in February - has already had an unsettling effect on the colony's financial markets, although US rates have risen only by three- quarters of a percentage point. Financial markets have been nervous because they know the change in the US interest rate cycle heralds the end to cheap money. And the effect has been immediate: share prices have come under pres- sure and are 20 per cent to 30 per cent off their highs of early January; sentiment towards the colony's overheated property market has turned cautious. Most analysts have con- vinced themselves that the property market will not crack: that Hong Kong in 1994 is not Tokyo in 1989. Instead, they talk of a slow, orderly deflation in property values, with prices falling between 10 per cent and 20 per cent in the coming year. However, orderly corrections of overheated markets are rare; it is more normal for them to overshoot and a sharper correction in prices cannot be ruled out. This possibility has grown in recent weeks with a marked change in sentiment towards Hong Kong's property market - where transactions appear to have diminished - and property companies listed on the stock exchange. The rise in interest rates has also coincided with a shift in sentiment towards China. While China may still be the 'growth story' of the 1990s, in the short term, there is concern in Hong Kong about the Chinese government's ability to control the economy. That, together with the difficulties of doing business on the mainland, is causing some business people to look elsewhere in Asia for investment opportunities. 'The Chinese think there is an endless appetite out there for their companies,' says one investment analyst. 'Let's see how they manage their economy over the next six months.' Further clouding the short- term outlook is the possibility that the US might not renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) access to the American market, and the imminent death of Deng Xiaoping, China's diminutive and increasingly frail senior leader. Hong Kong is populated by gamblers and the smart money is on MFN renewal. The calculation is based on two words and one set of initials: North Korea and AT&amp;T. President Clinton cannot afford to add China to his list of north-east Asian woes; on the contrary, he needs Beijing's support if he is to achieve his aims on the Korean peninsula. Mr Clinton also faces strong domestic pressure from US manufacturers who are looking at the world's largest emerging market for high-tech imports and manufacturing. Already, there are signs that moderates on Capitol Hill are preparing the way for Mr Clinton to bury the MFN issue once and for all. The effect of the death of Deng would be more problematical. Although much talked about, few believe that it has been fully discounted in Hong Kong's markets or psyche. One finance director of a large Chinese conglomerate was only half joking when he observed recently: 'I'm not totally sure that the old Chinese money won't be switched into Switzerland when Deng dies. No-one knows, that's what makes this town so exciting.' Capital flight, excitement and uncertainty are nothing new to Hong Kong. But they were probably not at the head of the checklist which persuaded many of the world's leading financial institutions recently to flock to the colony. Since 1991, Hong Kong has increasingly looked like a centre they must be in. They have been lured not only by the prospect of China and the role to be played in the intermediation of its financial needs, but also by the explosive growth in corporate Hong Kong's financing needs. Getting a slice of that lucrative business has been one of the reasons behind the startling expansion of investment banks in the colony. Goldman Sachs' presence in Hong Kong is approaching 300 staff, up from about 130 a year ago. Similarly Salomon Brothers, which has put Hong Kong on an equal footing with New York, London and Tokyo as one of its regional business centres. Salomon's staff numbers have risen to 200 from 65 a year ago; it recently announced the formation of a Hong Kong 'syndicate desk' which will be responsible for Asian equity transactions. The arrival of the Americans has had a large impact on Hong Kong's financial markets. The US houses have kindled US investors' interest in Hong Kong equities but, more than that, they have pushed aside the traditional British brokers who have tended to be more narrowly focused. US securities houses are at the forefront of market innovations (for Hong Kong at least) such as 'book building' for a new issue. They have brought expertise to the emerging derivatives market in the colony and have been prime movers behind the creation of a corporate debt market in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is laying siege to title of Asia's location for the arranging and trading of syndicated debts. Virtually over night a 'dragon bond' market emerged in Hong Kong last year. Some USDollars 3bn of bonds were issued last year, most of which were lead-managed by Lehman Brothers. In the first quarter of this year a further USDollars 1bn have been issued. An indication of the tough competition in this sector of the colony's financial markets was given earlier this month when most of the Lehman team joined Peregrine, a local merchant bank and broker. Peregrine is firmly of the view that equity-dominated Asia will have to develop a long-term bond market to finance its development. SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, agrees, believing there will be a 'spectacular' growth in the debt market in Asia on the back of infrastructure development. Underlining Hong Kong's importance to Warburg is its decision to station a main board director in the colony from this summer. In 1991, corporate Hong Kong tapped the equity market for HKDollars 37bn. In 1992, that had nearly doubled to HKDollars 67bn. By 1993, when corporate debt also appeared on the scene, corporate Hong Kong - which by this time included the first of China's state-owned companies to be listed in the colony - raised HKDollars 87bn in equity finance and HKDollars 33bn in debt finance, mostly convertible bonds. The poor performance of the Hong Kong stock market - under pressure from rising interest rates and the special uncertainties which China currently poses - has done much to take the shine off the world of corporate finance. In the first three months of this year, just HKDollars 8.6bn has been raised in equity and debt - half the amount of the same period a year ago. There is little doubt that many recent arrivals in Hong Kong have geared up for the volume of issuance seen in 1993 rather than that expected in 1994. But for those who can stay in the race, the rewards should be there.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Savimbi says MPLA has not captured headquarters ANGOLAN rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, in a defiant radio broadcast, told followers yesterday he was still at his post in his stronghold, Huambo, and his Unita forces were still battling government troops, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'It is a lie that my house is in MPLA (government) hands,' Mr Savimbi declared over his group's radio, The Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel. The battle for Huambo, Angola's second most important city, has been raging for three days, with little independent information reaching the outside and both sides issuing wildly conflicting claims. Diplomats in the capital, Luanda, believed yesterday that the government had the upper hand and most Unita troops had retreated to the outskirts of the central highlands city. An army communique on Saturday said government troops had captured Mr Savimbi's headquarters, a villa known as 'the White House' near Huambo airport, and his supporters were fleeing. Diplomats in Luanda, reached by telephone, also said that after two weeks of fierce fighting the two sides might be nearly ready to negotiate again. The Unita leader said in his broadcast that his organisation was ready to talk to the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) whenever the MPLA wanted. Diplomats said Unita and the government had already held talks at military commander level which indicated talks at a higher level could be on the cards. One western diplomat told Reuters that the city of Sumbe, south of Luanda, had been mooted as a venue.</p>

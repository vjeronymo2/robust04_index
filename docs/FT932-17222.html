			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Wave of profit-taking sends Nikkei down 2% PROFIT-TAKERS took their cue from a rise in the yen against the dollar and the Nikkei average lost 2 per cent, disappointing investors who had expected the market to rise on the last day of the financial year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 371.71 to 18,591.45. After initial weakness, it had rebounded on strong buying by dealers and individuals, hitting the day's high of 19,059.53 in the morning. However, it dropped to a low of 18,550.89 in late trading. Volume totalled 700m shares, against Tuesday's 619m. Declines led advances by 749 to 314, with 119 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 20.67 to 1,431.87. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.34 to 1,134.58. While some investors expected year-end window dressing to support share prices, aggressive profit-taking by investment trusts, and arbitrage selling, reversed early gains. Most life insurers and financial institutions are still looking to fix profits on stockholdings, and one analyst warned that there may be more profit-taking at the beginning of the financial year which starts today. The market should focus on the restorative fiscal package expected before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, goes to Washington this month. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council, yesterday reiterated his calls for a package larger than the Y10,700bn programme adopted last August. However, a Finance Ministry official said figures which have been floated by politicians were unrealistic, and the new programme could be smaller than last year's package. High-technology exporters were hurt by the fall in the dollar, which closed Y1.43 down against the yen at Y115.35. Toshiba lost Y27 to Y652 and Sony Y160 to Y4,430. Banks were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan slipped Y60 to Y2,460 and Mitsubishi Bank Y40 to Y2,360. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y2,000 at Y877,000, after touching Y903,000 on buying by individuals and dealers. Other telecom-related issues were strong, with Furukawa Electric up Y18 at Y648 and Fujikura ahead Y7 at Y845. Gold-related issues advanced in anticipation of a rise in gold prices in overseas markets. Mitsui Mining and Smelting was the most active issue of the day, climbing Y13 to Y498, and Sumitomo Metal Mining put on Y42 at Y755. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 248.03 to 20,140.11 in volume of 31.1m shares. Roundup MANY Pacific Rim markets were easier but Taiwan provided one firm spot. TAIWAN shrugged off the consolidation of recent weeks and share prices rose to a 12-month high in heavy trading. The weighted index ended 74.59, or 1.6 per cent, up at 4,825.29 in TDollars 79.87bn turnover. The market's optimistic mood has been helped by encouraging economic indicators and corporate profits, and the announcement that Formosa Plastics would soon build its USDollars 7.5bn naphtha cracker. There are also expectations that the central bank will soon loosen curbs on bank lending to corporations and lift its ban on unsecured loans for purchases of property. Most sectors posted solid gains and financials rose strongly on continued interest in the medium business banks, which are expected to benefit from a Finance Ministry plan to let them expand operations into other cities. Taichung Bank closed the day's limit up at TDollars 117.50. The plastics sector, which surged in the previous few days, ran out of steam and Formosa Plastics retreated 30 cents to TDollars 45.20. HONG KONG finished easier but off its lows as bargain hunters moved in shortly before the close. The Hang Seng index dipped 17.63 to 6,388.86 in HKDollars 3.06bn turnover. Jardine Matheson, vulnerable to a falling market after being the subject of criticism by Chinese officials recently, declined HKDollars 1.25, or 2.6 per cent, to HKDollars 46.50. AUSTRALIA wilted on the last day of March futures trading, in spite of strong gold prices, and the All Ordinaries index gave up 10.8 to 1,667.4. BANGKOK picked up in late trade on rumours that the Securities and Exchange Commission would impose only light penalties, and not jail sentences, on pending share manipulation cases. The SET index rose 16.03 to 865.23. BOMBAY recovered on institutional buying, the BSE index putting on 68.69 at 2,271.47.</p>

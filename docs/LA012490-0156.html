			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> ROSTROPOVICH PLANS SOVIET TOUR  </P> <P> Conductor Mstislav Rostropovich said Tuesday he is returning to the Soviet  Union for a concert tour next month with feelings of "enormous emotion" but  rejected any notion that he might end 16 years of exile in the West.  Rostropovich, music director of the National Symphony Orchestra, said he and  his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, were happy that Soviet authorities had  "admitted their mistake" and decided to restore the citizenship stripped from  them in 1978.  </P> <P> But Rostropovich made clear during a session with reporters at the Kennedy  Center that the couple has no intention of abandoning their life in the West  and returning permanently to their homeland. Rostropovich repeated his  assertion last week that "the almost 16 years spent in the West since our exile  do not yet allow us to change our lives again."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: TIP-OFF;  </P> <P> COMBATTING THE ROADWAY BLUES  </P> <P> SOME OF US complain about commuting 25 minutes back and forth to work. Others,  however, actually like to spend the entire day driving perhaps 200 miles in  stop-and-go traffic.  </P> <P> Robert Chamichian, a former Los Angeles Police Department officer, drives about  4,000 miles a month for Beverly Hills-based V.I.P. Limousine. Whether  chauffeuring rock stars or corporate presidents, he takes a scientific,  eye-on-the-clock approach to dodging gridlock. We asked him to share his  time-tested tips:  </P> <P> "Avoid the freeway between 3:30 and 6 p.m.; any of the city's wide surface  streets are probably faster."  </P> <P> "Beverly Boulevard is the quickest route west from downtown L.A.; Imperial  Highway is a clear route to the beach."  </P> <P> "To reach LAX at rush hour, get onto Sepulveda Boulevard if you can. From  Sepulveda, it's a straight shot into the airport, bypassing all freeways and  Century Boulevard."  </P> <P> "To San Diego, Interstate 5 is better than (Interstate) 405."  </P> <P> "Plan your down time and average it in on the total trip time, especially on  the surface streets. The average time spent at a red light in rush hour is  about 1 minute and 20 seconds."  </P> <P> "It's fine to listen to the traffic reports on the radio, but remember that  most of them are 20 minutes behind, and a lot of the accidents have already  been cleared."

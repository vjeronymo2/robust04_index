			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Voluntarily Installed Type 2 Belts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Heavy truck manufacturers, one of their belt suppliers, and motor home manufacturers expressed concern that the proposed regulatory language was broad enough to include Type 2 belts that had been voluntarily installed in vehicles with a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds. Motor vehicle manufacturers were similarly concerned that the regulatory language included Type 2 belts voluntarily installed at seating positions in other types of vehicles (e.g., center seating positions).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA intended the adjustability requirement to apply to seating positions for which Standard No. 208 requires a Type 2 belt, but not to seating positions for which Standard No. 208 provides a choice of either a Type 1 or a Type 2 belt. Among the seating positions for which the Standard provides this choice are all seating positions in vehicles with a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds, and center seating positions in vehicles with a GVWR of not more than 10,000 pounds. For all of these seating positions, the choice of a Type 2 belt is voluntary. Under this final rule, a Type 2 belt that is voluntarily installed in any vehicle need not comply with the adjustability requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Owner's Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters addressed the issue of requiring information on the use of manual AUAs in the owner's manual. Two commenters supported an owner's manual insert. One manufacturer stated that clarification was needed on whether the information must be provided for belts mounted on the seat frame so that they move with the seat. The agency has clarified the informational requirement in S7.1.2 so that it more clearly applies only if the belt system includes the movable component required by that paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Every vehicle manufacturer requested additional leadtime to make the design changes required by this rule. Some manufacturers stated that an effective date of September 1, 1997 would better correspond to the date on which air bags will be mandatory. Other requests ranged from 2 years to a request for a four-year phase-in beginning at least 5 years after publication. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA) and Bornemann Products Incorporated (Bornemann) requested an additional two years leadtime after the effective date for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing these comments, NHTSA has decided to extend the effective date to September 1, 1997. The agency believes it would be more practicable to closely parallel the schedule for vehicle redesign required for the implementation of manual belts and air bags. Manufacturers will then be able to avoid redesign of the anchorage systems for two safety belt-related rules. By this date, 100 percent of passenger cars and 80 percent of light trucks must be equipped with manual belts and air bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While NHTSA agrees that redesigning some vehicles will be difficult, many commenters stated that all or most of their vehicles will have an adjustment feature before this date. In addition, NHTSA notes that many of the requests for longer extensions were based on compliance difficulties for rear seats. Therefore, NHTSA has decided that longer extensions are not necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has also decided not to allow additional leadtime for vehicles manufactured in two or more stages. There are questions about the sufficiency of the agency's authority to grant relief to vehicles based on their method of production instead of their type; however, the agency need not address those questions in this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bornemann and RVIA requested additional leadtime because there is no assurance that engineering information or prototype vehicles would be available in time for final stage manufacturers to comply with the adjustability requirement by the same date as single stage manufacturers. The commenters are concerned that, due to the lack of leadtime and lack of early information from vehicle manufacturers, they would be forced to install integrated seats to comply with the proposed adjustability requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency believes these concerns are unwarranted for numerous reasons. First, as discussed above, the agency has provided an additional year leadtime beyond that proposed. Because NHTSA anticipates that many vehicles will comply before the effective date, this should allow first stage manufacturers additional time to divulge design information to final stage manufacturers. Second, the apparent trend in the industry is to provide AUAs in incomplete vehicles. Since the upper anchorage is not a component that is normally modified by final stage manufacturers, there would be no additional requirement or burden on the final stage manufacturers. Third, if neither of the previous reasons provide relief, final stage manufacturers have options other than integrated seats in designing vehicles to comply with the adjustability requirement. For example, a ``semi-integrated'' safety belt assembly in which the lower inboard anchorage is mounted on the moving portion of the seat can be provided by the seat manufacturer and is in the same magnitude of price as an AUA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RVIA also stated that additional leadtime was necessary if the agency did not exclude motor homes and rear seats. This request is largely moot. As explained previously, the adjustability requirement does not apply to voluntarily installed Type 2 safety belts. The agency's decision to exclude voluntarily installed Type 2 safety belts makes it unnecessary to adopt RVIA's request to exclude motor homes. Many motor homes have a GVWR greater than 10,000 pounds. Thus, the Type 2 belts in those motor homes are all voluntarily installed belts. For motor homes with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less, the modifications made to the front seating positions are not different than other van conversions. Finally, the agency's decision to exclude fixed seats has effectively excluded rear seats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

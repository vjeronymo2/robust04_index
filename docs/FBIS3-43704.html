			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 13 SAPA -- Chief negotiators from  the government, African National Congress [ANC] and Freedom  Alliance [FA] will meet in the next few days to try to arrange  full-blown trilateral talks. Roelf Meyer, Cyril Ramaphosa and  Rowan Cronje will meet informally to explore whether the  political impasse with the Freedom Alliance can be broken.    Two rounds of trilateral talks at the end of last year ended  with alliance negotiators agreeing to take a proposal to their  leaders that would pave the way for further talks. It also  addressed the commitment required by the government and the ANC  before they are prepared to discuss the changes to the  constitution demanded by the Freedom Alliance.    The three sides gave themselves until January 24 to broker  an  inclusive political deal. An apparent lack of movement by the  alliance and signs of "reluctance" on the part of the ANC to  resume negotiations since the last round had made it more  difficult to arrange further talks, a government spokesman said  on Thursday. "It is a tense and difficult situation to  overcome," he conceded.    The alliance was still committed to further trilateral  talks,  Mr Cronje said on Thursday. However, he warned the government  and the ANC to stop "playing with words". He said the alliance  welcomed the latest statements from the government and ANC  committing themselves to an inclusive settlement, but there were  fears the two sides were "stringing the FA along".    It appeared some elements within the government and the ANC  were not keen to re-open the interim constitutional package.  "Let's stop putting obstacles in the way. Let us know where we  stand," the alliance chairman pleaded. He dismissed the tough  stance taken recently by some alliance members who believe the  government and the ANC to be dragging their feet. He also  dismissed as "nonsense" speculation that cracks had appeared  within the alliance, following Ciskei's decision to participate  in the Transitional Executive Council.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Golden screen haunts LDP THE MYSTERY of the golden screen is haunting Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party. This unsolved case of alleged corruption - involving banks, senior politicians and an exquisite Y4bn (Pounds 23m) traditional folding screen - has resurfaced this week, at a particularly bad time for Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister. He is to appear before parliament next week - with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general - to answer questions over a separate scandal involving illegal donations by a road haulage company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Opposition parties delayed the passage of the budget for the fiscal year to begin in April, so as to force the LDP to offer the two politicians for formal questioning. This will be the third such appearance in recent months by Mr Takeshita. Simultaneously, a former auditor at Heiwa Sogo, the small bank at the centre of the screen mystery, is on trial for commercial breach of trust, and is expected to explain at least part of the background to the mystery in coming days. His testimony could provide opposition politicians with a further opportunity to undermine Mr Takeshita, who has resisted demands that he resign from parliament. The gold-leaf screen mystery began in 1985, when there was a struggle for the control of the ailing Heiwa Sogo, and four of its executives sold the screen for Y4bn to a Toyko art gallery. It had just been valued at only Y500m. Some of the sale proceeds were used to buy shares in Heiwa Sogo, but it is alleged that other funds were given to politicians, including Y300m to a secretary to Mr Takeshita, according to court testimony by former executives at the bank. But the secretary, Mr Ihei Aoki, who is at the centre of the mystery, committed suicide in April 1989 amid another scandal, the Recruit stocks-for-favours affair. This was the scandal which ultimately forced Mr Takeshita to resign as prime minister. Japanese prosecutors are also attempting to link the sale of the golden screen to the eventual takeover of Heiwa Sogo by Sumitomo Bank in October 1986, though there is no suggestion that the latter bank has done wrong. Mr Takeshita, who knew executives at both banks, is believed to have played a role in bringing them together, and opposition politicians want to him to clarify whether he saw Y300m. Late last year, Mr Takeshita said the affair was also a mystery to him.</p>

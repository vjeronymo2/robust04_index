			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Flawed reflections on the Bush era Sir, It's been remarkable to watch Michael Prowse evolve into an ever more enthusiastic fan of American orthodoxy. In his two September 1 stories ('Life under Bush better than it seemed' and 'Pace of US economic growth beats Wall Street forecasts') on the upward revision of 1990-92 GDP figures, he essentially argues that the 1992 election campaign was fought on premises now revealed as false: official statistics of the time badly understated the pace of growth in the year's second half, lending credence to Bill Clinton's indictment of George Bush's economic policies. Since we now know that Bush's final year was nowhere near as stagnant as we'd thought, we have to wonder, Prowse asks, 'why public perceptions of the economy were so weak'. He answers his question by pointing to 'dashed expectations' - even with revised figures, the recovery has still been slower than earlier business cycles. This will not do. GDP may matter to pundits, but the average American couldn't tell you whether 2 per cent growth was strong or weak, or what the average growth rate for the first eight quarters of a recovery are. I'm no fan of Clinton, but he must be given credit for arguing throughout his campaign that the problems of the US economy are structural, not cyclical, and that prominent among these pathologies is the 16 per cent decline in real hourly wages over the last 20 years, when real GDP has grown 56 per cent. The point can be put even more pungently. Since 1973, the time necessary for a worker paid the average hourly wage to earn the average household's yearly expenses has grown 43 per cent; to buy the average new house, 45 per cent; the average new car, 57 per cent; and to pay for a year at Yale or the University of California, 75 per cent. Clinton seems to have forgotten these facts; now, he takes his cue from the bond market, where deficit reduction is revered and wage growth viewed with fear. Falling real wages, not the course of the statistical fetish known as the GDP, drive popular perceptions of economic weakness. Were political discourse in the US not so stunted, not so dominated by what Keynes called the 'simple-minded maxims . . . one still reads in old-fashioned financial weeklies', then these issues might be more openly ventilated. New-fashioned financial dailies should know better. Doug Henwood, editor, Left Business Observer, 250 West 85 Street, New York, NY 10024</p>

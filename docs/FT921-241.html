			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Team short of match practice: Philip Stephens assesses the calibre of Labour's cabinet-in-waiting They have perfected the art of opposition. In 10 days they may have to start learning how to govern. Mr Neil Kinnock and his colleagues are not yet looking beyond the election. The 13 years spent in the political wilderness has left them too superstitious to take for granted a fractional lead in the opinion polls. Last week's row over health reminded them just how easily even the most professional election campaign can be derailed. So far the Conservatives have been bruised but not beaten. The Labour team is conscious also that the approach of April 9 will turn a harsher spotlight on to just how well-equipped for government is a party which has not ruled since 1979. Three successive Conservative victories have given resonance to Labour's claim that it is time for change. The Tory wins have also provided substance to Mr John Major's charge that the opposition lacks the calm authority needed to steer Britain in an uncertain world. If he wins, Mr Kinnock will enter Downing Street with one of the least experienced teams ever to take office. The Labour leader has been in parliament since 1970 but has never held a paid government post. Mr Tony Blair, the aggressively bright employment spokesman, has had a pivotal role since 1987 in the party's shift to the political centre ground. He was 16 years old when Labour last won a general election in 1974. Mr Gordon Brown, the 41-year-old trade and industry spokesman and a candidate in any future leadership contest, is among the two-thirds of the party's front bench team who have never experienced life at Westminster with Labour in power. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, are alone among elected members of the shadow cabinet in having sat around the real cabinet table in 10 Downing Street. The sober-suited guardian of his party's painfully reconstructed economic strategy, Mr Smith would find the transition easy. He is instinctively conservative, a creature of government rather than opposition. The exhaustive review of policies which followed defeat at the last election in 1987 has persuaded Mr Kinnock that he leads an opposition as well prepared as any in history. Behind a slim manifesto lie a clutch of detailed documents setting out an agenda stretching far beyond a single term in office. In the first year alone the manifesto promises an economic recovery programme, devolution for Scotland, a freedom of information bill, repeal of the council tax, reversal of the Tory health service reforms, an overhaul of training and education policies and a statutory minimum wage. The review - the route through which Mr Kinnock dumped his party's ideological baggage - forced Labour to map out in detail the alternatives both to its own socialist past and to the Tory agenda. But overwhelmingly the politicians who would be charged with implementing this programme are men and women whose experience has been shaped by the priorities of opposition rather than of practical policy-making. The cabinet would be undeniably Mr Kinnock's. The mutterings about his leadership which have surfaced when Labour has lagged in the opinion polls have not weakened his grip on the leadership. Mr Smith is more popular with the voters, but nine years as leader have tightened Mr Kinnock's grip on the levers of power. That authority does not mean his government would be shaped entirely in his own image. Once installed in Downing Street a Labour leader can choose his team, but the cabinet he starts with is the one elected in opposition by the party's MPs. Mr Kinnock's team is young - most are in their 40s or early 50s - and overwhelmingly the product of the very grammar schools the party is pledged to abolish. But it is far from uniform in style or outlook. The abrasive self-confidence of Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, contrasts with the softly-spoken obscurity of Mr David Clark, the agriculture spokesman. The self-effacing style of Mr Donald Dewar, the spokesman for Scotland, is offset by the explosive unpredictability of Mr John Prescott, the transport spokesman. Mr Hattersley, guaranteed the Home Office as well as the deputy leadership, has an awkward habit of reminding more technocratic colleagues that the party remains committed to greater equality as well as to competent economic management. His relationship with Mr Kinnock is sometimes cool but friends insist there are fewer divisions on the central policy issues which would confront a Labour government than Mr Hattersley's less cautious rhetoric implies. Mr Kaufman, promised the foreign office after extricating the party from the minefield of unilateral disarmament, does not slot easily into any cliques. Widely credited with describing the party's isolationist 1983 election manifesto as the 'longest suicide note in history', his approach to foreign policy is both pro-Nato and pro-European. The social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty and economic and monetary union would be embraced as part of a strategy to 'promote Britain out of the European second division'. There are few traces in the shadow cabinet of the factionalism and left-right divisions which bedevilled the governments of Mr Harold Wilson in the 1960s and 1970s. But Mr Robin Cook and Mr Bryan Gould, responsible for health and the environment respectively, might prove powerful advocates of a strategy to rediscover in government some of the radicalism the party has suppressed in opposition. Mr Frank Dobson, the energy spokesman and Mr Michael Meacher, responsible for social security, fall into a loose left of centre category, as do Ms Anne Clywd and Ms Jo Richardson, entrusted with overseas development and women's affairs. Mr Meacher, mistrusted in the leader's office, would be among the most likely casualties of any early reshuffle. More broadly, there is private acknowledgement that some of the policy tensions which have been suppressed willingly in opposition could quickly re-emerge in government. The commitments pencilled in by Mr Smith in his shadow Budget may not satisfy the expectations of many of those running Whitehall spending departments. Colleagues believe that Mr Kinnock's refusal to contemplate any devaluation of sterling reflects a private as well as public conviction. But if the economic outlook proved to be as gloomy as it now looks, there might be dissenting voices in his cabinet. On their past records, Mr Cook and Mr Gould would not share the view that the pound's value was sacrosanct if the price was a retreat from a stronger welfare state. But Mr Kinnock's cabinet would not be a government bursting with radicalism. His long, often embarrassing, journey from the rebellious left to the centre-right of his party has obscured a new-found conservatism. The politician who in 1981 was too busy to attend Prince Charles's wedding is now prepared to boast of his visits to Windsor Castle. Earlier advocacy of a command economy cut loose from Brussels has been replaced by a conviction that Germany and France are the appropriate models now for a Labour Britain. A vibrant manufacturing sector has replaced equality as Mr Kinnock's Holy Grail. Close friends predict that once in Downing Street Mr Kinnock would combine a tight grip on his cabinet with a 'conventional' relationship with the civil service establishment. A shadow cabinet colleague says: 'He would want above all to prove that he was up to the job.' The scars inflicted by the strife within his party have also brought with them a streak of authoritarianism. Mr Kinnock puts a premium on loyalty. He is contemptuous of those who prefer the 'self-indulgence' of dissent. His aides are understandably resentful of any comparison with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's autocratic style. They insist that the question he asks is not 'Are you one of us?' but rather 'Can you deliver?' Mr Kinnock's instinctive conservatism would be shared by the most powerful figures in a Labour cabinet. There have been tensions between Mr Kinnock and Mr Smith. The shadow chancellor is not shy about acknowledging his immense contribution to the party's bid for power. He has powerful backing from Mr Jack Cunningham, the campaign co-ordinator who would expect to become leader of the House of Commons. But personal rivalries between them have not spilled over into fundamental policy differences. The industry and the employment spokesmen are among prospective members of a powerful inner cabinet promoting Mr Kinnock's vision of European-style social democracy. Mr Brown, responsible for the interventionist industrial strategy at the heart of Labour's economic programme, is a close, if sometimes competitive, ally of the shadow chancellor. Mr Blair has demonstrated by reshaping the party's industrial relations strategy that youth and a public school background are no obstacle to his handling of the trades unions. Mrs Margaret Beckett, once a left-wing firebrand but now charged with maintaining a tight grip on the purse-strings as shadow chief secretary, completes the team of 'realists' in control of economic policy. Mr Cook and Mr Gould have a different relationship with Mr Kinnock. Both at times have been among his most strongest supporters. Both on other occasions have fallen out with him. To some in the leader's inner circle Mr Cook's advocacy of electoral reform and Mr Gould's residual Euro-scepticism make them too 'independent-minded'. But along with Mr Jack Straw, the education spokesmen, both Mr Cook and Mr Gould meet the criterion of politicians who can deliver. Deliver, that is, in opposition. For now Mr Kinnock can claim nothing more for any in his team. They jettisoned the old ideologies and crafted a set of policies which has made Labour electable. They have mastered the art of political point-scoring. But if he wins on April 9, Mr Kinnock may well discover than that the realities of life in government are harsher still.</p>

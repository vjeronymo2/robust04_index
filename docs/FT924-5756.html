			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Letter: Royals would improve their lot if they treated public with respect Sir, While in Britain recently, I had the opportunity of visiting Windsor Castle, now sadly damaged by the fire. While I appreciate that it is a residence of members of the royal family, I was not impressed by the very high admission charges and the general feeling that public visitors were treated largely as an unavoidable nuisance. Two days beforehand, I had the pleasure of visiting the White House in Washington, where I paid no admission charge and was told proudly by the official guides that 'this building belongs to the people of the United States, and we are honoured to be able to share it with our citizens and guests from abroad'. I suspect that if a similar attitude were displayed by your royal family and those who represent them, they may receive much more sympathy from the public both in Britain and abroad. Furthermore, as I understand that the majority of the damage was inflicted on areas not even accessible to the general public, it seems rather presumptuous to ask British taxpayers to foot the damage bill. Piotr Ney, Prinsengracht 488, 1017 KH Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OVERSEAS;  </P> <P> STOCK PRICES IN TOKYO DROP SHARPLY IN MORNING SESSION  </P> <P> Erratic price movements resumed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this morning, with  the Nikkei index plunging by more than 400 points in the first few minutes of  trading.  </P> <P> Share prices have eroded steadily since the beginning of the year and  registered their second-worst fall ever on Monday. Stocks fluctuated wildly  Tuesday and Wednesday, although they showed signs of stabilizing above a  "support level" of 28,000 points on the Nikkei 225-share average as investors  shored up confidence.  </P> <P> But the Nikkei quickly fell through the 28,000 level again today, dropping by  449.06 points to 27,993.88 as of 9:16 a.m. After one hour of trading, the index  had recovered somewhat but was still down 370.48 points to 28,072.46.  </P> <P> "The fall in the index was caused by rumors from various sources that some  minor securities firms had gone bankrupt," Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro  Inoue told the Associated Press.  </P> <P> Local news reports said more than 30 minor brokerages had been left with  massive losses by speculators who were unable or unwilling to pay for their buy  orders because of this year's market plunge.  </P> <P> Before Japanese stocks went into their descending roller coaster ride, the  Nikkei had soared to a lofty peak of 38,915.87 on Dec. 29, when the average  price/earnings ratio stood at 62.4. The index was gutted by 28% by the end of  trading Monday, when the Nikkei closed at 28,442.94 and the average P/E ratio  on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down to 45.1.  </P> <P> Analysts differ on whether the current stock decline represents a crisis-style  meltdown of the Tokyo market or a healthly correction to more sustainable  levels after speculation and excess cash drove prices out of line with  fundamentals.  </P> <P> Most traders and analysts agree, however, that the atmosphere in Kabuto-cho --  Japan's Wall Street -- is now one of resignation, not panic.  </P> <P> Various factors have contributed to the bearish mood, most notably a sense that  Japanese financial authorities are ineffectual in their attempts to manage the  dollar-yen exchange rate. The greenback has strengthened relentlessly against  the yen in recent weeks, despite yen-buying market intervention by the Bank of  Japan and pleas for international coordination in monetary policy by Finance  Ministry officials.  </P> <P> The dollar, which traded momentarily above the 160-yen level on Monday, opened  in Tokyo today at 158.32, down 0.58 yen from Wednesday's close, and  strengthened to 158.15 after one hour of trading.  </P> <P> Also fueling pessimism in stocks is an amorphous anxiety over trade friction  with the United States. Negotiators were holding 11th-hour consultations in  Washington in the Structural Impedements Initiative talks as financial markets  opened in Tokyo today.  </P></p>

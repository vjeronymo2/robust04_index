			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- As already reported,  the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea in a statement of its spokesman declared that the DPRK  would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] in answer to the grave encroachment upon the  dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK by the Secretariat of the  agency.    In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says the DPRK's  withdrawal from the IAEA is a legitimate self-defensive measure  to defend its sovereignty and existence as a dignified  independent, sovereign state.    The responsibility for its withdrawal from the IAEA rests  entirely with the agency, the analyst says, and goes on:    We joined the agency in September 1974, believing its  impartiality and hoping that its assistance would be conducive  to our peaceful nuclear activities.    After we signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]  in  December 1985 and concluded the safeguards agreement in January  1992, however, the Secretariat of the agency has zealously  joined the United States in its moves to isolate and stifle the  DPRK, contrary to its mission and function, and some officials  of the Secretariat intentionally created "inconsistency" and  adopted a resolution demanding "a special inspection" of our  military sites which have nothing to do with nuclear activities.    Such unjustifiable acts of theirs resulted in forcing the  DPRK to declare its withdrawal from the NPT.    It was for the removal of the U.S. nuclear threat and the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula that we joined the NPT.  The Secretariat of the agency, however, encroached upon the  supreme interests of our state and cried to stifle the DPRK,  abusing the NPT. Under this condition, we could no longer hope  for its help. Later, we temporarily suspended the effectuation  of our declared withdrawal from the NPT in June 1993 on  condition that the DPRK-U.S. talks for a peaceful solution to  the nuclear issue would continue on an equal and fair basis.    Even in a unique status following the temporary suspension  of  our withdrawal from the NPT, we had honestly accepted  inspections for the continuity of safeguards and allowed even  "an additional inspection." But the United States and some  pro-U.S. officials of the Secretariat had used inspections as a  leverage for infringing on our sovereignty and stifling the  DPRK, refusing to recognize its special status and intentionally  laying obstacles to the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The agency's anti-DPRK moves reached the extent where it  adopted an unreasonable "resolution" on the discontinuation of  "its assistance" to the DPRK at the meeting of the governors'  board on June 10, demanding the opening of our military sites to  public under the pretext of the nuclear issue.    Such being the situation, we did not feel the need to have  dealings with the agency any more and reached the conclusion  that we could no longer hope for its help.    Now that we declared the withdrawal from the agency, we will  not bound in the legal point of view to the "resolutions" or  steps which the governors' board has adopted and taken or will  adopt and take in the future, and we are not obliged to  implement them. Now the agency is not in a position to dictate  to us.    The freedom of choice is not a monopoly of the United States  and the Secretariat of the agency.    Whether our special status following the temporary  suspension  of the withdrawal from the NPT is removed or we completely  withdraw from it, fully depends on the future developments.    If the United States and its allies resort to a strong arm  to  stifle the DPRK, ignoring its special status and abusing the  NPT, we cannot but make another choice.</p>

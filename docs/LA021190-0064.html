			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS PARK  </P> <P> As the author of the 1978 legislation that created the Santa Monica Mountains  National Recreation Area, I take issue with Bill Boyarsky's discouraging  assessment of the efforts to save this beautiful area ("Watching the Mountains  Go Downhill," Metro, Feb. 2).  </P> <P> It's true that some very valuable pieces of land in the Santa Monicas have been  lost to development, or are about to be. However, of the 150,000 acres within  the boundaries of the recreation area, roughly 60,000 are already in public  ownership -- thanks mainly to the state's foresight in establishing four large  parks in the mountains many years ago. The 16,000 acres of park land Boyarsky  mentioned refer only to land which the National Park Service itself has  acquired.  </P> <P> That the Park Service has been able to acquire even that much acreage is a  testament to park supporters' ability to make progress under adverse  circumstances. Not only did we have to contend with skyrocketing land prices  and competition from developers, but also the opposition of President Reagan  and his appointees.  </P> <P> Fortunately, we were able to persuade Congress to continue appropriating at  least modest amounts of funds for the Santa Monicas anyway, which enabled the  National Park Service to buy some key properties. And, two years ago, the park  got a big boost from Prop. 70, which provided $30 million for state  acquisitions in the mountains. Now that we have a President who supports the  Santa Monica Mountains park, the prospects for its continued expansion are more  encouraging.  </P> <P> We shall keep working to obtain federal funds for land acquisition but, to  ensure that the Park Service has the opportunity to buy land before it is  developed, local officials will need to make appropriate land-use decisions --  for example, refraining from increasing zoning densities, which make the land  more attractive to develop.  </P> <P> REP. ANTHONY C.  </P> <P> BEILENSON  </P> <P> D-Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Natal right-wing group, the northern Natal Boer  Commando, has come out in support of Zulu King Goodwill  Zwelithini's call for a Zulu kingdom. At a rally addressed by  the king near Newcastle today, a spokesman for the group said  they would be at the disposal of the king. The king again told  his followers that suppression would follow if they voted on  April the 27th and 28th. Gary Alfonso reports:    [Begin recording] [Alfonso] It was a day of contrasts which  became a day of unity. Zulu impis [warriors] armed with spears  and knobkieries danced passed the group of stone faced  right-wing commando members. They have, however, one thing in  common. They refused to acknowledge the state of emergency in  kwaZulu/Natal. The Zulus are defying the restrictions by  carrying illegal traditional weapons. The right wingers have  occupied a site in the center of Newcastle. Despite emergency  regulations, they refused to budge.    At Dick's Halt outside the town, King Goodwill Zwelithini  told his followers their vote on election day would empower a  central government that did not understand their needs.    [Zwelithini] As long as central government continues to  exist  and the voice of the people is silent, the bigger our problems  in the region will become.    [Alfonso] A while later, a spokesman for the Boer Commando  told the crowd what they apparently wanted to hear.    [Boer Commando's Delarey Schoeman] We are here to tell the  king of the Zulu people that our strength is his strength. Our  power is his power. [loud applause]    [Alfonso] The unit was cheered as they marched from the  gathering site, and the king later officially opened a  life-giving water supply scheme to the small Zulu community. An  ANC rally in the same area was postponed to tomorrow. Most  party supporters opted to go to Ladysmith to catch a glimpse of  their leader. Newcastle is well known for its political  divisions. Local ANC, IFP, and now right-wing officials say the  area belongs to them. That claim will not be tested because  thousands of people have been told not to go to the polls in  less than two weeks' time. [end recording]</p>

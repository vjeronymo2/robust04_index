			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 17 Jun (INA)--An Iraqi newspaper has  asserted that the new Saudi military buildup on the Yemeni  border is no surprise for those who have been following the  Saudi regime's policy and planned roles, which basically aim to  destroy all constituents of the Arab nation's strength and unity.    In an article today, AL-THAWRAH adds: This buildup is  another link in an aggressive conspiratorial chain. Saudi  Arabia has already implemented links in this chain by expelling  more than half a million Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia. It  was also behind most of the assassinations and disturbances that  took place in Yemen following Yemeni unity. Moreover, the Fahd  regime refrained from addressing the border problem with Yemen.  Afterward, the most obvious link became clear with the arms and  financial support that Saudi Arabia provided to the  secessionists, in addition to the Saudi political and diplomatic  moves in this regard.    AL-THAWRAH points out that the Saudi policy against Yemen is  part of an imperialist-Zionist conspiracy designed to fragment  the Arab homeland. This policy complements the 30-state  aggression on Iraq, exploiting the regional and international  situation created as a result of this aggression.    The paper wonders: Would the agent Fahd's regime dare to  undermine Yemen's unity and harm the Yemeni people if the Arab  situation were different, a situation that resulted from the  wounds the Arabs caused to Iraq and from their unjust embargo  imposed on it?    The paper also wonders: Would this regime be able to do what  it pleases and rally the positions of the traitors, agents,  hirelings, and renegades against Yemen's unity if there were  sound logic governing the concept of Arab solidarity? It adds:  The policy of agentry, treason, and aggression, which has  blindfolded the Saudi rulers, must eventually lead them to a  terrible end. This is because the power they are relying on is  not their intrinsic power in the first place; they are only  implementing an imperialist scheme. One who relies on a  foreigner cannot be safe in the long run.    AL-THAWRAH adds: The political opportunity that has pushed  the Fahd regime toward both recklessness and brandishing force  against all that is a genuine Arab is actually a transient  opportunity. The Saudi rulers should learn a lesson from Iraq's  steadfastness and from Yemeni unity, knowing that the need for  this unity was unanimously emphasized by the Yemeni people.  These rulers should also learn from what is taking place inside  Saudi Arabia itself where decay, scandals, and collapse are  spreading.</p>

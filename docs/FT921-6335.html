			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Pentagon urges pressure on Beijing over high-tech weapon sales A SENIOR Pentagon official yesterday called on allies of the US to step up pressure on China to curb ballistic missile exports and transfers of nuclear technology. Mr James Lilley, assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs, said the task should not be left to the US alone. He hoped Beijing would take the 'wise course' of curtailing deliveries in keeping with its decision last year to adhere to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and comply with western guidelines on missile-related sales. Failure to do so would justify 'a very strong demarche' from the US and its allies, he told a conference on Asia-Pacific defence. His comments followed recent reports of Chinese sales of missile components to Iran and other Middle East countries. Mr Lilley said the west must also use economic leverage to persuade North Korea to back down from developing nuclear weapons. Earlier this week, Mr Robert Gates, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told a Congressional committee North Korea was between 'a few months' and 'a couple of years' from making a nuclear bomb. Mr Lilley said difficulties over ratifying and inspection agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency appeared to be a 'delaying tactic' while Pyongyang proceeded with nuclear reprocessing facilities. He described the latest evidence of North Korean activities as 'ominous.' The US, which had already postponed the second phase of planned troop withdrawals from South Korea, needed to maintain a military deterrent, Mr Lilley said. It had to be made clear to Pyongyang that it would be denied economic assistance and international respectability as long as it pursued its programme. Mr Francois Heisbourg, the director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, warned that the issue could blow up into 'a massive international crisis'. However, these warnings were challenged by a prominent Chinese rocket scientist and academic, Dr Hua Di, who said North Korea was incapable of making nuclear weapons and was deceiving the west in order to improve its bargaining power.</p>

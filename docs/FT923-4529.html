			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Trustee to interview Kevin Maxwell next week ACCOUNTANTS will be able to put together a more comprehensive picture of movements of money from the empire of the late Robert Maxwell as a result of the bankruptcy order against Mr Kevin Maxwell, his son, it emerged yesterday. Mr Peter DuBoisson, a partner with accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn who was appointed trustee in bankruptcy to Mr Maxwell on Thursday, said he intended to question 'as many people as required' to help identify the assets. He said he would be interviewing Mr Maxwell early next week. He also expected to hold a meeting with creditors later this month to select a committee and to appoint Mr Phillip Sykes, a colleague, as joint trustee. Under his powers as trustee, Mr DuBoisson can interview anyone who might have information on the assets which Mr Maxwell may own. The process might involve, for example, Mr Maxwell's wife, his brother Mr Ian Maxwell, and his mother Mrs Elizabeth Maxwell, as well as advisers to the companies of which Mr Kevin Maxwell was a director. Mr DuBoisson's role is to identify and realise for creditors existing assets and any which have been disposed of by Mr Maxwell in the past five years. He said he did not expect money owed to other creditors to take the claims against Mr Maxwell above Pounds 500m and stressed that he would be working with existing accountants to minimise the costs of his appointment. Mr Neil Cooper, head of insolvency at Robson Rhodes said he was pleased the bankruptcy petition had succeeded. As liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds, he is tracing funds taken from Maxwell pensioners. He said: 'We know what assets there were about two years ago, but it is important that we can reconcile where they have gone. We must be satisfied that all the puddles of wealth have been accounted for.' The High Court has yet to rule on a claim brought by Mr Cooper against Mr Ian Maxwell for Pounds 400m which could bankrupt him if his defence is rejected.</p>

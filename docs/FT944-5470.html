			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: Italian banks in negotiations over Credito Italiano's new bid Credito Italiano, the Milan-based bank, and Credito Romagnolo of Bologna were last night trying to reach agreement on the terms of a friendly bid by Credito Italiano for control of the Bolognese bank's quoted holding company. Full details of the new offer could be announced in the next few days, assuming it is approved by Credito Romagnolo and the Bank of Italy, which supervises the fragmented Italian banking sector. Credito Italiano (Credit) last week offered to improve the terms of its bid, plans for which were first outlined at the end of October and rejected by Credito Romagnolo (Rolo). The Milan bank has so far refused to specify whether it will pay more than the price originally proposed - L19,000 a share - or offer to buy more than a 50.1 per cent stake in Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo. Last night, advisers to both banks were working together in Milan on the plans for a new bid. If Rolo decides to accept an improved Credit bid, it will put paid to the alternative plan for a merger with Caer, the parent company of another local bank, Cassa di Risparmio, in Bologna. Under the terms outlined this week, Credit offered more management autonomy to Rolo, albeit for a limited period, guaranteed the rights of minority shareholders, and said it would recommend a dividend at least equal to 55 per cent of Rolo profit, in line with the trend in recent years. Separately, Credit and the UK banking group National Westminster announced yesterday they were intending to sell their majority stake in Banca Creditwest e dei Comuni Vesuviani to Credito Emiliano Holding, a growing privately owned Italian banking group. Credit owns 68.04 per cent of Creditwest, and National Westminster a further 19.2 per cent. Creditwest, which has about 20 branches and a headquarters in Milan, has been handicapped by its size. Credit and NatWest said they had signed a declaration of intent to sell to Credito Emiliano and were now negotiating a price for the stake. The 87.3 per cent stake in Creditwest could be valued at more than L120bn (Dollars 74m) Italian news agencies reported yesterday.</p>

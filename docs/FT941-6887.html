			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Peru poised for telecoms sell-off High expectations surround Peru's largest ever privatisation, to be held in Lima today. Three bidders are seeking control of the country's two telecommunications companies, the capital's telephone company, CPT, and the provincial and long-distance monopoly, Entel. Telecommunications in Peru, now about to turn into what will effectively be a five-year monopoly, are expected to boom. Peru has the lowest level of telephone provision in South America - about 2.6 lines per 1,000 inhabitants. The new owner will have to invest the equivalent of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 671m-Pounds 1bn) in expansion. The bidders are all leading world operators. All have provisionally signed contracts and put up refundable deposits of Dollars 20m. They are: a consortium headed by GTE of the US, of which Portugal's Radio Marconi and Brazil's Empresa Brasileira de Telecomunicacoes have small slices; South-western Bell of the US with Korea Telecom, whose other consortium members are Daewoo, Mexico's Condumex group and the offshore branch of Peru's Banco de Credito; and Telefonica de Espana with three local partners. The first two are considered the most likely contenders, with GTE reported to have the edge. A source close to the contest forecast GTE might have to pay Dollars 800m to secure CPT/Entel, compared with a base price of Dollars 525m. CPT shares held privately, which account for almost 80 per cent of the total, have soared on the Lima stock exchange in recent months. The buyer today will acquire 35 per cent of CPT (the existing 20 per cent stock held by the state being increased via a new share issue) and a similar percentage of Entel. Remaining Entel shares will be released in packages later, probably through the local stock exchange. Bankers and businessmen are hopeful that the sale today will consolidate international business confidence in Peru. The country can now offer sweeping liberalisation of what was extensive state control of the economy, structural adjustment, marked advances against subversion, and low inflation (for South America), but a question mark hangs over legal stability and over official attitudes to respect for human rights.</p>

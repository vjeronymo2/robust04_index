			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Sensitivity Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section presents the results of EPA's analysis of the effects of varying selected major parameters in the cost analysis (where the Agency used considerable judgment in arriving at the parameter's value) on the estimated savings incurred under the proposed conditional exclusion and the proposed Universal Waste Rule. The following assumptions were analyzed in the sensitivity analysis for EPA's analysis of spent lamp management costs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Percentage of Lamps Generated at Small and Large Quantity Generators. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the sensitivity analysis, EPA set its lower bound estimates of the percentage of lamps generated at SQGs and LQGs at fifty percent of total spent lamp generation and its upper bound estimates at ninety percent. (Seventy-five percent was used in the initial cost analysis). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) Cost to Transport Subtitle C Waste. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the sensitivity analysis, EPA increased the upper bound estimates of the costs of transporting spent lamps as Subtitle C by a factor of three, based on price quotes from commercial transporters, over original estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (3) Cost to Dispose of Subtitle C Waste. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Based on price quotes from commercial hazardous waste disposal facilities, EPA increased the upper bound estimates of the Subtitle C disposal costs by a factor of four over original estimates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (4) Cost of Employee Training. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To reflect uncertainty over whether a professional trainer would be required and over how many employees would need to be trained, EPA increased and decreased the cost of employee training required by 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The costs associated with the high-end scenario were estimated using the upper bound estimates for each cost element included in the sensitivity analysis. The costs associated with the low-end scenario combined the lower bound estimates for each cost element. The results from these two analyses suggest that the range of total annual savings from the proposed condition exclusion for spent lamps could be $65 million to $289 million, and the range of total annual savings from the proposed Universal Waste RCRA requirements for generators of spent lamps could be $15 million to $39 million. The range in cost savings is mainly the result of uncertainty over Subtitle C transportation and disposal costs for lamps. Although EPA has received price quotes for management of lamps as Subtitle C waste that are considerably higher than the average cost of managing hazardous waste in Subtitle C landfills, it is not appropriate to directly compare price quotes to engineering costs because the price quotes reflect a constrained market place which tends to inflate prices well above costs. However, a three-fold difference between the price quotes for spent lamps and standard Subtitle C management cost may also be due to other factors beyond the inflated prices of the constrained market, including the low density of lamps (i.e. a ton of lamps has a greater volume than a ton of hazardous waste sludge), or difficulty in handling lamps. EPA requests comment on the true costs, as well as the reasoning behind these costs, of managing spent lamps as Subtitle C waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Proposed Rule Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Impacts on Generators of Mercury-Containing Waste Lamps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, option 1, the exclusion, is estimated to result in average annual savings per small and large quantity spent lamp generator ranging from $2,000 to $2,250. Option 2, special collection, is estimated to result in an average annual per generator savings of approximately $300.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Secondary Effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While total incremental savings from the proposed exclusion (option 1) and from the proposed special collection system (option 2) over a Subtitle C management approach appear to be high, the Agency does not expect significant immediate shifts in demand or price for the lamps or for products manufactured or sold by firms which consume these lamps due to the proposed options. Because the impacts to lamp generators are positive (i.e. net savings), the Agency does not expect the rule to result in adverse impacts to businesses, or to affect employment or international trade to any appreciable degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that, with the exception of lamps generated in States with existing lamp disposal requirements, most small and large quantity generators of mercury containing lamps will choose to dispose of their waste lamps in municipal solid waste landfills under option 1, the proposed exclusion from Subtitle C. This is because Subtitle D disposal is significantly less expensive per bulb than recycling or Subtitle C disposal. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Subsequently, most waste lamps currently being handled according to Subtitle C standards by permitted hazardous waste haulers, disposal sites and spent lamp processing facilities, would be handled by Subtitle D haulers and disposal facilities. Thus Subtitle C waste haulers, disposal and spent lamp processing facilities would be affected negatively while Subtitle D haulers and disposal facilities would be affected positively under option 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA estimates that the average cost per ton for Subtitle D disposal is $35 as compared to $400 per ton for Subtitle C disposal and $1,375 per ton for recycling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

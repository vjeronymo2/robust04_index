			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> LIBRARY SITE PANEL TO BE NAMED SOON  </P> <P> A committee will be taking shape soon to consider possible sites for a new main  library in the city.  </P> <P> The current library, on Chapman Avenue between Center and Shaffer streets, was  built in 1960 when there were 22 library staff members and a city population of  26,000, library director Karen Leo said.  </P> <P> With 50 staff members and a population of more than 107,000, the present  22,140-square-foot building is considered inadequate.  </P> <P> A consultant hired by the city recommended two locations for the new library,  but residents at a public hearing last week criticized both sites.  </P> <P> One of the proposals is to raze the present library and rebuild on the current  site, but this would require either building a smaller library than recommended  by a consultant or buying about 10 homes to the north of the library for  expansion.  </P> <P> Buying the homes, in a section of Old Town, is unacceptable to many, City  Councilwoman Joanne Coontz has said.  </P> <P> Building at the other site recommended by the consultant, the corner of East  Chapman Avenue and Yorba Street, was unacceptable to some because it is a  former dump, Leo said.  </P> <P> Mayor Don E. Smith suggested another location, the County Fire Department  headquarters on East Chapman Avenue at Water Street. Smith said the county may  move to another location.  </P> <P> The committee, the five library board trustees and five residents to be  appointed by the City Council, will consider these and other possible locations  for a new library and will report back to the council at a study session  scheduled for March 27, Leo said.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 24 (YONHAP) -- Seoul subway workers went  on strike at 4:00 AM Friday, leaving hundreds of thousands of  commuters stranded during the morning rush hour in the capital  area.    The Seoul Subway Corp. set in motion an emergency subway  operation plan, using 295 non-striking engineers to start train  runs at much longer intervals at 5:30 AM, 30 minutes later than  usual.    The workers, sticking to their demand for a 14.5-percent  wage  hike, turned down the corporation's offer of a 3-percent raise,  an informal guideline set by the government to fight inflation.    Railroad engineers also went on strike Thursday, nearly  paralyzing railway transportation across the country.    In a related development, subway workers in Pusan, the  country's second largest city, shelved a plan to strike Friday  morning in sympathy with their colleagues in Seoul.</p>

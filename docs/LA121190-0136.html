			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NORCO YOUTH, 16, SHOT IN FREEWAY CONFRONTATION  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Norco boy was shot in the shoulder Monday during a freeway  confrontation between the occupants of his car and the driver of a red  Corvette, police said.  </P> <P> The unidentified victim and two teen-age friends were apparently fired upon on  the Artesia Freeway after they "exchanged finger gestures" with the man in the  Corvette, Buena Park Police Sgt. Terry Branum said.  </P> <P> Branum said investigators have not yet determined what sparked the shooting.  The youths "haven't said much," he said.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred about 2:15 p.m. in the eastbound lanes near the Beach  Boulevard off-ramp.  </P> <P> The victim, a passenger in the car, was shot in the shoulder by a bullet that  penetrated the left, rear panel of the vehicle and was partially deflected by  the youth's right hand, Branum said.  </P> <P> After the shooting, the victim's friends pulled off the freeway and flagged  down a motorcycle officer at the intersection of La Palma Avenue and Western  Avenue in Buena Park.  </P> <P> The wounded youth was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange where he was listed  in stable condition, Branum said.  </P> <P> The assailant was described as having dark hair and wearing dark clothes,  driving a late model red Corvette with a cellular phone antenna on the back.  </P> <P> "Needless to say, we don't have a whole lot to go on here," Branum said.  Investigators have requested that anyone with information about the shooting  call police at (714) 521-9352.  </P></p>

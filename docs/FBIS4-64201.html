			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hal"-signed report: "Research Institutes Cautiously </F> Optimistic"]    [Text] Bonn, 26 Apr -- Against the background of a dynamic  upward development in the United States and of an economic  recovery in West Europe, the leading economic research  institutes are expecting the German economy to recover. The  German GNP will grow by 1.5 percent this year, according to the  spring report by the Hamburg HWWA Institute for Economic  Research, the Munich Ifo Institute for Economic Research, the  Kiel University's Institute for World Economy (IfW), the Halle  Institute for Economic Research (IWH), and the Essen-based  Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI). Only  the Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) is  skeptical, predicting a 0.5 percent growth for the whole of  Germany.    Yet, the institutes are dampening the politicians' optimism:  "The improvement in the economic situation does not, however,  mean that the course has already been set for a strong growth of  the west German economy and for a high level of employment," the  report says. The economic researchers' assessment of eastern  Germany is equally cautious: "While industrial investment has  been strong so far, it cannot be ruled out that the initial  development may gradually lose momentum, after major investment  projects by Western companies have been completed." Also, many  investors seem to have planned projects that they are now unable  to realize. The institutes are pinning their hopes on an  increase in foreign demand. Private consumption will, however,  remain slack. After all, the macroeconomic total net wages and  salaries will go down by just under 2 percent due to higher  social insurance contributions and tax increases. This could  result in more restrained consumer habits.    Just as in previous years, the majority of the institutes  urge politicians to conduct a moderate wage and fiscal policy.  Investments must come from private funds to enable the creation  of a large number of jobs. The researchers confirm that the  public deficit will decrease considerably in 1995. A lower  public budget deficit does not, however, imply a more sound  financial policy. With the agreed massive tax increases,  consolidation threatens to become an end in itself as far as  fiscal policy goes. Yet it is quite natural that those private  investors contributing most to the net product are hit the  hardest. After its reintroduction next year, the solidarity  surcharge should be gradually abolished, starting in 1996.  Since the Federal Constitutional Court demands a change in the  tax-free subsistence level as of 1996, "reforms of taxation"  should be tackled, all institutes except for the Berlin-based  DIW say. The progressive rate will be kept, and the income  level for the maximum tax rate should be increased.    The institutes reprimand the government for thinking that  the  economy virtually has to earn tax cuts by means of rapid growth  and increasing tax receipts. "Tax cuts are not the climax of  economic expansion, but they are a precondition for a lively  economic development," the report says. Also, the state must  promote structural changes by deregulating markets and making  them more flexible. Market power threatens to be misused in the  fields of energy supply, waste disposal, and in part of the  transport and financing businesses. Thus, banks achieving  higher profits during the recession than other sectors do during  a boom, indicate a lack of competition and markets being sealed  off. The Bundesbank is urged to continue to announce money  supply targets in spite of the recent unusually high increase in  the money supply. For 1994, the institutes consider a money  supply target of 5 to 7 percent appropriate, which is slightly  more than the Bundesbank's 4 to 6 percent. The increase in  money supplies is expected to go down considerably over the next  few months. Even if interest rates in the United States  continue to increase, the Bundesbank could lower its key  interest rate by another 2 percent in the course of the year.  Long-term interest rates in the capital market could move below  6 percent.    The DIW is much more skeptical. With private consumption  expected to go down considerably, the Berlin researchers are  forecasting a further setback in production in the second half  of the year. The DIW also holds a different view on financial  policy. Instead of tax cuts, the DIW considers a mixed strategy  of tax increases, lower social insurance contributions, and cuts  in expenditure appropriate.</p>

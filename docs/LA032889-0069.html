			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS MOURN TEACHER SHOT TO DEATH  </P> <P> Grant High School students on Monday mourned a popular longtime teacher and  senior class adviser who was fatally shot last week by an unknown assassin  outside of his Sherman Oaks home.  </P> <P> School administrators and senior class representatives spent much of the day  sharing their grief, as well as their determination to complete plans for the  year-end senior activities that teacher and class adviser Hal Arthur had  started. Arthur, 60, was shot and killed Friday morning as he was leaving for  work.  </P> <P> "You've been chosen by your class to be the leaders and sometimes it's a hard  role," said Grant High Principal Bob Collins to a meeting of student body  officers. The students are planning a memorial service on the Van Nuys campus  Thursday to honor Arthur, who had taught history and government classes at the  school since 1962.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Basically in Shock'  </P> <P> "Everyone is basically in shock right now," said Helen Edelstein, the senior  class secretary. She and other students say they still cannot believe that  anyone would want to harm Arthur.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police detectives said they have no suspects or motive in the  slaying. A 16-year-old former Grant student was questioned for six hours Friday  and then released. "We were convinced at the end of the discussion with him  that he was not involved," Lt. Warren Knowles said.  </P> <P> The student, in an interview Monday, said police gave him a polygraph test and  for several hours asked questions about his whereabouts on Friday. But he said  that he does not even know Arthur.  </P> <P> "It's sad what happened, but I was home in bed," the boy said. "I'm not a bad  guy and I'm not a trouble-maker."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Year-End Activities  </P> <P> Meanwhile, senior officers began the job of preparing for the flurry of  year-end activities, such as the prom and graduation, that Arthur had organized  for senior classes at Grant for more than 20 years.  </P> <P> "There's the gowns and the invitations, ordering everything, picking colors,  everything that comes with being a senior he knew about because of his  experience," said Karen Berelowitz, the senior class historian.  </P> <P> Arthur was a friend to his fifth-period senior leadership class, his students  said. He spoke often of his travels and "knew about everything," said Janna  Talbot, the senior vice president.  </P> <P> "I came in to talk to him on Thursday, I was sick and the last thing he said to  me was, 'Take care,' " Talbot said. "That was typical. He cared a lot about  students and you felt it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easy-Going Style  </P> <P> Arthur wore a Grant team jacket that had "Hal Baby" stitched on the front. He  earned the nickname because of his easy-going style in dealing with the many  vendors that did business for senior class activities, the students said.  </P> <P> Senior class officers decided over the weekend to dedicate the senior lawn quad  area in memory of Arthur. They spent only a few minutes deciding what to put on  the plaque that will be placed on the senior lawn:  </P> <P> "Hal Arthur, devoted teacher, caring senior sponsor and an inspiration to all."  </P> <P> "He wasn't a teacher to us," Berelowitz said. "He was our friend."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Michael Connelly contributed to this article.  </P></p>

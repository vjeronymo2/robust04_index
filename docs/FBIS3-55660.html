			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Kostikov: "Outlines of a `Clean </F> Russia;' Law and Order Are Product of Mature Democracy and Legal  and Everyday Standards, not Ideology"]    [Text] I remember that one of the most pleasant sensations  of my childhood was the clatter of our yardwoman's broom. The  windows of our old Moscow house looked out onto the streets and  in the intervals between the thunder and squealing of the tram  wheels turning the sharp corner at the church of Metropolitan  Filipp, at number 2 Meshchanskaya Street, I could clearly hear  this "whoosh," which I still remember, coming from the  yardwoman's ancient broom. These sounds began at around  0500-0600 hours, that is when it was still dark in the winter,  but when early in the morning the Moscow working people or we  primary school children emerged from our homes the sidewalks  were "scraped clean" and swept and in the summer were washed  with water from a black hosepipe and in winter after snowfalls  neat piles of snow rose up at the roadsides and were later taken  away into the yards in huge plywood crates with the most  vigorous support from us small boys.    Today many people are inclined to idealize the order  maintained on the streets and in the yards and doorways and to  present it as a model of the "socialist way of life." Most of  us probably remember how Moscow was ordered to be a model  communist city and consequently the world's cleanest city. With  the adroitness of communist propaganda and the vitality of  Soviet myths this illusion of outward order fools many people.  And there is nothing surprising in the fact that the party of  the "communist broom" was very successful at the Federal  Assembly elections.    The Communist Party and the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party  of  Russia] as though in collusion both put forward the introduction  of order as virtually their main election slogans while not, it  is true, specifying how this would be achieved in reality:  through rebukes from the "parteigenosse" at party meetings,  with the aid of a radical GULAG or, even more radical, by means  of a war against their own people, on which subject the leaders  of the All-Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks-CPSU have  nothing to learn from anyone: They surpassed everyone in  practice, beginning with the suppression of the Kronshtadt and  Tambov uprisings. Here the communist and national-socialist  agitators "forget" to tell the population that order, legality,  and cleanliness have existed in the majority of European cities  for several centuries. That is, long before Lenin, Stalin, and  Hitler tried to grace Russia and Germany with the theory and  practice of social and racial cleansing.    Law and order are the product of mature democracy and legal  and everyday standards, not ideology.    How to explain the popularity of slogans of order for Russia  or the interest displayed by the public in the idea of a "clean  Russia," if we are speaking of its more workaday transformation?    Probably by the fact that alongside civil rights, rights to  education, medical services, freedom of religion, and others  there is, without being described in law, citizens' right to  order. If you talk of simple and clear elements in the people's  life then the concepts of democracy and freedom as reflected in  daily life are implemented through the order, calm, and  cleanliness of urban and rural life. Cleanliness and order in  the country begin with cleanliness in your own doorway, on your  own threshold.    It is only in our politically unsettled times that we have  to go to the polling stations several times a year. In  countries with a stable democracy such an expensive "pleasure"  is permitted only once every several years. It is we, concerned  with repelling the ideologists and leaders of the  communo-fascists, who are prepared to go to the barricades or  meetings at the first call to defend our fragile democracy. In  old Europe meetings and demonstrations take place with the  strict observance of established regulations and under police  guard. In our country abuse and obscenities against the  president and government are considered virtually to be in good  taste for the newspapers which flaunt their new independence. A  real democratic press knows how to say unpleasant things and  even to cut into the flesh with the expertise of a skilled  surgeon. During Watergate Richard Nixon was brought to  political death not by the newspapers' unbridled statements but  by professional journalists' painstaking work.    In a healthy society politics and the population do not  notice each other, in the good sense of the word. The assembly  bell should ring in exceptional cases and only when the people  do indeed need to be pushed to accomplish something  extraordinary.    One of the underlying reasons for the democrats' failure at  the elections is the fact that neither the parties nor their  leaders have the stomach or the ability to perform routine work  for the sake of the genuine values of the state and the people.  The aim of the election campaign was not to put forward ideas  which could normalize Russia but to obtain deputies' seats and  to win a successful percentage. Not a single one of the  election blocs' programs essentially even mentioned how  nationwide problems, as opposed to narrow party or group  problems, would be resolved. The Agrarian Party of Russia quite  frankly preached the conservation of the collective and state  farm system in the interests of "soviet landowners" -- the  directors and chairmen of the state and collective farms. The  "Civic Union" interpreted the interests of the "red directors."  "Women of Russia" introduced its own "feminine" note to the  chorus of demands made on the government. The communist party,  having repealed the dictatorship of the proletariat for reasons  of expediency, traded wholesale and retail in the specters of an  equalizing social happiness.    The very concept of the "social state" stuck in the new  Constitution sounds like the echo of communist ideology and  essentially reflects the same party division in the face of the  general and indivisible interests of all Russia and the entire  people. It is merely through the inertia of Soviet thinking  that it preserves the illusion of the possibility of preserving  social peace by issuing unbacked loaves.    Yet the lack of uniting national-strategic political  parameters that are clear to the people is extremely dangerous.  The Federal Assembly, recruited on the basis of the party and  leader [vozhdevoy] principle, by virtue of this face alone is  already programed for political and personal disputes. It is  hard to believe that, counter to the Russians' hopes, it will be  able to given an account of itself as the expresser and defender  of the people's life. Russia's national, underlying interests  could again be beyond the Federal Assembly's purview.    It could happen that a truly broad movement of the  population  for national normalization will be formed around a  nonparliamentary figure and outside the Federal Assembly walls.  Examples of such phenomena are known to history. There has  been Gandhi and Gandhism in India, Tolstoy and Tolstoyism in  Russia, and the movement around Martin Luther King in the United  States. There is the O. Palme phenomenon in the Scandinavian  countries. A. Sakharov could have been such a figure in our  country were it not for his untimely end.    Without underestimating the country's economic difficulties  I  should like to express the opinion that the main barrier  complicating Russia's emergence onto a strategic expanse is the  lack of a clearly formulated national goal brought to the  awareness of every family and citizen. The absence of, if you  like, a "Russian idea," a Russian goal and dream. And it is  obvious that this aim is outside short-term politics and even  outside the economy.    One reason for the democrats' defeat at the elections was  that masses of the population did not want to identify  themselves with any of the democratic parties or with any bloc.  And it is not that the leaders or promises were bad but because  not a single party was able to clearly disclose a uniting  strategy.    Our new politicians argue intelligently about a collective  approach [sobornost] and its benefits to the Russian man and  state. They forget that for the overwhelming majority of  peasants, workers, and housewives whom they want to tempt with a  collective approach and great powerdom these words sound as  absurd and incomprehensible as "Snickers" or the "Maastricht  Treaty."    A person will understand that matters in our country have  finally turned toward order not because he is given a correct  explanation of how and why the White House was burned down and  why a trial was needed of the State Committee for the State of  Emergency and totalitarian ideology but only if his wife,  daughter, and grandchildren are no longer afraid to leave the  house after dark. Millions of people who suffered from the  tyranny of the CPSU will only believe that the suppressed  rebellion has saved us from the threat of a communist  restoration if the lovers of red-brown sauce, sickles, hammers,  and swastikas are firmly and clearly shown their place in  society.    But if in our country punch-ups, drunkenness, car thefts,  and  fighting between racketeers continue on the streets even after  the October events, if a month after the rebellion's leaders  entered Lefortovo their lawyers are beginning shamelessly to  demand that the president stand trial, if several weeks after  the president's supporters were almost hanged on the Kremlin  trees, the inflammatory newspaper DEN is again starting to be  sold in Moscow, if after all that we learned of the National  Salvation Front and of Anpilov and Anpilov's supporters and they  have the impudence to apply to picket the new parliament... then  that person, whom they want to lead by collective and  great-power means toward democracy with a Russian face may quite  justifiably send the democrats and democracy packing and demand  a real dictator. Which in part is what happened 12 December.    The new parliament will probably be able to become a testing  ground for running in and calibrating statesmen. For all the  shortcomings already discerned in it, that will be its useful  mission. Here they must not only be clearly aware that  politicians' personal accounts far from always coincide with the  nation's aspirations. Being a politician is always a profession  with all its transient, often pleasant but, alas, short-lived  attributes and gifts.    In connection with the possibility of the Federal Assembly's  "self-disillusionment" in the very first months of its work,  particular importance attaches to the Constitution which has  been adopted. The development of the Constitution is of  strategic importance to Russia. It reveals the democratic  future of a single and indivisible Russia as the aim of national  policy. In other words, for the first time in our state's  history a general national uniting task has been set before  Russia's people.    But the new Constitution, with enormous internal creative  energy, is nonetheless a sleeping Ilya Muromets. This hero  still has to be awoken and taught to walk and act. It would be  naive to suppose that after 12 December there will be a miracle  of Russian transformation. The great American constitution was  adopted 200 years ago yet the American economic boom began only  after World War II and without any direct link with the  constitution. The constitution is only a "great promise."    And perhaps the most important thing which we must all  understand is that the new Russian Constitution is not the  truth, it is a path.    With the coordinated collaboration of the state and the  democratic parties that path can be shortened. But only the  united people themselves can plow the deep furrow of their own  fate and implement it on the basis of the ideals of the  Constitution.    I have already written about the idea of the "Clean Russia"  movement. About the extra-party people's movement which would  be based on Russia's nationwide aims. Of course it is not a  case of revising the democratic idea of pluralism. The parties  in a democratic society perform an essential role, ensuring the  generation of competing ideas and the necessary level of  critical control over the activity of the government, president,  and other parties. But the actual principle of party-mindedness  contains the idea of people's division on the basis of their  interests: class, professional, corporate, social, and property  interests. In addition the party is always a vehicle for moving  toward power. And whether the leaders of the parties want it or  not, even the most sincere of them are obliged, especially under  crisis conditions, to subordinate their actions to the  imperatives of the struggle for political survival. National  aims proclaimed in the party programs are most often camouflage  for the road leading not to the temple but to power.    The "Clean Russia" movement would not set itself power  goals. It does not need deputies' seats or government posts.  Its strength would lie in the moral solidarity of the entire  population around a few goals determining the health of the  nation and the unity of the country. The instrument of the  "Clean Russia" movement would be not violence but the voluntary  donation of a small part of one's labor, a modest contribution,  physical or moral participation. It would not be a movement of  likeminded people. But people adhering to different views could  unite for joint actions for Russia's benefit. I could cite as  an example one of these nationwide goals.    The collapse of the USSR generated major migration  movements.  The Russian-speaking population is flowing out of nearly all the  former USSR republics. In each specific case, for each family  obliged to move away from their home and go out into the unknown  it is a drama, often a tragedy.    Of course, one can see this problem in a political and  propaganda focus. One can demand sanctions against the states  which expel the Russians. One can push the Russians to resist.  One can ultimately achieve certain concessions through the use  of certain means. In the short term this policy and these  tactics can bring short-term dividends for a party or leader who  has declared himself the defender of the oppressed. But as a  result of reciprocal national violence there can arise such a  complex knot of contradictions and hatred that it cannot be  unravelled without bloodshed.    There is another path. A nationwide program, based on  all-Russian solidarity, for the Russians' return, to draw them  inside Russian borders. We have tens and hundreds of cities and  villages which were once declared "unpromising" and escheated.  Yet Russian people lived for centuries in these cities and  villages. They lived and worked, augmenting the country's  wealth. Today these lands lie empty and the cities are going to  ruin, degenerating demographically.    Russia has spent too generously on "developing" adjacent  lands, exerting itself immoderately, tearing its own umbilical  cord. Dozens of cities, plants, factories, and airfields  constructed by the genius of the Russian mind and the skill of  Russian hands, when union property was shared out made us the  hostages of alien intentions, the victims of national  improvidence. We are already being blackmailed with the  technological and cultural munificence we ourselves bestowed.  Russia gave primers to many peoples who did not even have their  own written language and now they are trying to teach us, the  heirs of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevskiy, they are trying to  teach us "human rights" on the basis of these primers.    Russia does not need other people's resources. But we must  distribute our own resources in the manner which is customary in  a healthy family: first to our own children, elderly parents,  and our own orphans, and then (if the granaries are not empty)  to close and remote neighbors.    The "Clean Russia" ideas are based not on racism but on a  normal and healthy feeling of national egotism. Someone who  does not know how to provide a sufficiency in his own home is  useless to his neighbors. We must equip and sweep clean our own  house and only then speak of the concepts of humanism for all  mankind.    Here the Russian people, the Russians must pose least of all  in the guise of some kind of ideal and model and least of all  surrender to the messianic temptations of the "third Rome"  ideology. We have no grounds for this. We must simply reach  the level of other peoples who have learned to live normal human  lives under the conditions of democracy.    For this discipline is needed. The discipline of the nation  and of each person. We must rid ourselves of laxity in work and  daily life. We must introduce normal models of labor discipline  and conduct into society. So that it is clear to everyone where  the permissible limit of "naughtiness" ends and where  hooliganism begins, where there is normal festive drinking and  where it turns into drunkenness, boorishness, and lack of labor  discipline. Today these borderlines are eroded in our country.  In our country people can ridicule a teetotaller, a man who  speaks in a literary Russian language, an educated man, and  softheartedly take pity on a drunkard and idler known to  everyone in the apartment block. A dangerous distortion of the  concepts of good and bad has occurred in society. A  foul-mouthed idler drinking with the foreman at the plant in our  country often passes as a "great guy." An overt criminal passes  for a resourceful businessman. We have become accustomed to the  shameful filth of our doorways, muck on the streets, and  bureaucrats' bribe-taking and arrogance. We have gotten out of  the habit of walking normally and dressing normally. Often not  even because of poverty but because of the primitive nature of  our taste and education.    And at the same time these are Russian citizens or ethnic  Russians [russkiye ili rossiyanye]. The task of the "Clean  Russia" movement is to return to them their human dignity or at  least not to allow them to defile the lives of their own  children.    We do not need much money for that.    We need powerful and coordinated work by all the mass media  interested in the country's upsurge.    I do not remember whose idea it was that to encourage a  people to rise up they must be aware of the degree to which they  have fallen. In my opinion we are close to that. Today many  people in our country are speaking and writing about patriotism.  The false monopoly of the Communists and national socialists on  love for the Fatherland is being broken. Democratic writers and  journalists are speaking seriously and profoundly about  patriotism. Patriotic impulses are emanating from the Russian  president.    But today it is important to take the next step. To switch  from agitation and competition in patriotism to action. It is  important to transfer the concept and expression of patriotism  to the plane of routine, daily life. It is not every day and  every year (fortunately) that society requires lofty sacrificial  patriotism, examples of which were given to us by the Great  Patriotic War. Patriotism and love for the Fatherland in  everyday life can most often be displayed in the unremarkable  actions about which no one will write in the newspapers.    If instead of being in the habit of cursing the Moscow city  hall for badly cleaned streets several apartment block residents  were to go out onto their own doorway with brooms and shovels  after a heavy snowfall that would be a small step toward a  "Clean Russia" (someone would probably ridicule it to start  with). If in a small provincial city a few intellectual and  educated people were to organize lectures on linguistic  standards that would be a small exploit in the name of Russian  culture. If through our collective protests (not political  protests, with no banners or raised fists, but through peaceful  civic means) we were to get television to observe a ban on the  advertising of alcohol and tobacco, that would mean that the  "Clean Russia" movement had begun to exist in reality. If  together with the church we were to ensure that it is not the  funeral mafia which runs the cemeteries but that normal, honest  people work there, that would be a small step toward returning  the nation's dignity.    "Clean Russia" is not a fantasy, not mythmaking. It is a  feasible reality precisely because it calls people not to  exploits, not to sacrifice, but to the display of humaneness and  discipline in the simplest circumstances of daily life. If  there are millions of us, Russia will be transformed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nobuhiko Wada, Professor in the Faculty of </F> Science, Nagoya University]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   Silver(Ag), was evaporated in argon(Ar) and xenon(Xe) gases  at various pressures in the low gravity aboard the space  shuttle. Four glass bulbs with filaments tipped with 50g of  silver, were filled with argon of 50 Torr(A), 300 Torr(B) and Xe  gas of 5 Torr(C), 100 Torr(D), respectively, and ignited one by  one in the low gravitational field of space. The evaporation  temperatures were maintained at 1150 degrees Celsius at which  the exhaust gases were barely detectable in all cases for the  ground experiment. The smoke appeared as a ball of smoke  particles growing around the evaporation source instead of  rising as it would under Earth gravity. It could hardly be seen  for (A), but it was observable for (B) and (C) and there were  bursts of smoke gushing out from (D) in various directions. The  experiment suggested the vapor could be confined locally around  the source with high pressure and temperature by the surrounding  gas in the low gravity. This suggestion cannot be interpreted by  any conventional model of evaporation in the gas.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   ``Evaporation of materials in the gas atmosphere'' is a  technique for producing ultra-fine particles by evaporating  materials in an inert gas under atmospheric pressure [1] and has  been used in various fields of science and industry. But far  less attention has been given to the investigation of the  process of evaporation of materials in a gas atmosphere than to  that of the process of evaporation in a vacuum. This is mainly  due to the fact that each evaporation process in a gravitational  field is accompanied by the convection of gas, rendering  analysis of the process difficult.    The evaporation of materials in gas is a very ordinary  phenomenon, seen in such natural phenomena as the evaporation of  water on the surface of the sea and in boiling water and such  industrial applications as in smelters, fractional distillation,  distillation, etc. However, evaporation by heating in a gas on  the ground is always accompanied by convection and subsidence,  which are complicated phenomena in themselves. This makes it  difficult to duly grasp facts in the experiment.    Fonda [2] has proposed an empirical evaporation formula of  tungsten filament in an incandescent lamp bulb, where he assumed  a stagnation layer of flow on the evaporating surface (Langmuir  sheath) and that the evaporation rate was to be controlled by  the diffusion velocity in this layer. This concept was  originated by Langmuir and has been used for the analysis of  those kinds of problems up to the present time [3,4]. The  thicknesses of these layers are not deducible theoretically, but  they are estimated to be within the range of millimeters of the  actual evaporation rate on the ground. For the gas evaporation  under low gravity conditions, the thickness of the stagnation  layer is as large as the distance from the evaporation source to  the inner surface of the vessel, it is in the order of ten  centimeters which is ten squared times as thick as the one for  the ground experiment. It means the evaporation rate is too  suppressed to deposit a smoke consisting of fine particles in  the low gravity especially in evaporation of gas at high  density; the real situation is to be discovered by the low  gravity experiment.  <H5>  Outline of Flight Experiment </H5>   An experimental metal particle generation device was used in  the experiment (Fig. 1).    Four glass bulbs with filaments tipped with 50 mg of Ag,  were  filled with Ar gas of 50 Torr, 300 Torr and Xe gas of 5 Torr,  100 Torr and were ignited one by one in a low gravitational  field in space. The pictures of the developing smoke were  recorded on VTR and brought back with the used bulbs to the  laboratory on the ground (Fig. 2, not reproduced). These bulbs  will be cut open and the deposited particles to be examined  under electron microscope.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-03A>           Fig. 1. Schematic Illustration of Experimental Faculty </FIG>      <H5>  Results </H5>   All four bulbs worked, and the heating temperature was kept  well within the lower constant of 1110 to 1150 degrees Celsius,  which temperature was too low to develop smoke under Earth  surface conditions. The heating temperature of the bulb (D) was  also kept the same for four seconds at the beginning of  evaporation, but it rose to over 1200 degrees Celsius, and the  filament blew out in two minutes. The recorded pictures of smoke  are very dark for the bulb (A), and no smoke can be observed;  however, for the bulbs (B), (C) and (D) smoke balls appear  around the filament. These are spherical in shape and consist of  particles which developed around the evaporation source instead  of rising as convection smoke. The brightness of (B), (C), (D)  was seen to increase consecutively (Fig. 2). Especially in the  case of (D), a few branches of smoke burst out in various  directions at 1,100 degrees Celsius. This smoke burst was  expected in this experiment (Fig. 3, not reproduced).    Fine particles of uniform size from 20 nm top 50 nm were  found deposited on the inside walls of the bulbs (A),(B) and  (C), but in the bulb (D) the particles of Ag were widely  distributed in size from 20 nm to 10 mm with clear habit.  <H5>  Observations </H5>   The conventional idea of evaporation in gas is that a  ``Langmuir sheath,'' a sheath of certain gas molecules, which is  not affected by convection, exists on the surface of the  evaporation source and vapor molecules are supposed to be moving  there through diffusion.    As a boundary condition, the saturation vapor pressure of  the  temperature of evaporation source is assumed and, on the  external surface of the sheath, the vapor pressure is assumed to  be 0. The diffusion speed calculated on the basis of these  assumptions is considered to be the evaporation speed.    The diffusion speed is decided by the thickness of this  diffusion sheath. Actually, the thickness of this sheath is  decided by the condition of convection, but it is difficult to  generally predict the thickness. In reality, there is no other  way than estimating the thickness from the results. Under  conditions of low gravity or when there is no convection, the  whole inside of the vessel is the diffusion sheath. So, the  thickness becomes overwhelmingly larger compared to a case in  which there is convection. This theoretically reduces the  diffusion speed to an extremely low level, almost stopping  evaporation. The results of the experiment, however, differ  largely from such a surmise. In either case, evaporation of the  sample silver was observed and smoke of particulates was  generated.    In an experiment ball (D), in which Xe gas with a large  atomic weight was enclosed under high pressure of 100 Torr, the  smoke ball became unstable and smoke was observed gushing out  through many points. This phenomenon cannot be explained at all  with the conventional theory that evaporation is the diffusion  of vapor.    In this experiment, one experiment ball was used per  parameter. However, preliminary experiments conducted so far,  using drop capsule and airplanes [6-9], guarantee that the  observed phenomenon is not accidental. It is significant that  the phenomenon, observed in the preliminary experiments, was  also observed this time under long time stable conditions with  the lowest gravity.    To explain this fact, this writer and others have proposed a  new model for evaporation in gas.[5] In this model, evaporation  is not considered to be simple diffusion. It is considered that,  as in the case of vacuum evaporation, evaporation is caused by  the spontaneous emission of vapor atoms from an evaporation  source.    Emitted atoms reach the wall as they are in vacuum. In a  gas,  the atoms collide with the gas, are scattered and mix with the  gas. Then the atoms spread inside the vessel through scattering.    When the emission speed is greater than the diffusion speed,  the difference stays somewhere in space and constitutes a part  with high vapor density. The higher the gas pressure and the  larger the atomic weight, the slower the diffusion speed of  vapor becomes, raising the density of vapor that stays in space.  This idea is explained with the following equation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-04A>           Formula </FIG>      D,p and J respectively show diffusion coefficient, vapor  density and emission atom flow. By solving this equation, the  vapor density distribution as shown in Fig. 4 obtained. This  example suggests the possibility of forming of a part of  saturation vapor. Its supersaturation degree tends to rise as  gas pressure and the mass number of atoms are increased. It is  considered that the instability of the smoke interface and the  gushing of smoke as observed in the experiment ball (D) are  caused by the vapor pressure when it surpasses gas pressure.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-011L-04B>           Fig. 4. Calculated vapor density distributions </FIG>       Likewise, heat is considered to concentrate near the  evaporation source in the state of low gravity without  convection. The relationship between abnormally a high filament  temperature of smoke and its premature snapping in the  experiment ball (D) is being analyzed by opening the experiment  ball.    This report does not touch on the particles that were  generated as they are now being analyzed. However, we report  here that ultrafine particles of silver with a good  homogeneousness of almost 20 nm were obtained from the  experiment ball (A),(B),(C).  <H5>  Applications </H5>   1) Space high-temperature nuclear fusion reactor    Achievement of high-temperature nuclear fusion, utilizing  high-temperature, high-density concentration that can be  obtained in high-temperature gas in the state of weightlessness  in space.    2) Material synthesis utilizing gas atmosphere reactions.

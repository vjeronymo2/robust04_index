			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Gould expected to quit politics Mr Bryan Gould, a former leading member of Labour's shadow cabinet, is expected to announce this morning that he is to quit politics. Senior Labour officials forecast that Mr Gould was preparing to leave the Commons after he issued a statement inviting journalists to a press conference at Westminster today. There was some irritation among party officials that Mr Gould had not given advance notice to the leadership of his intentions. He is understood to have written to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, but the letter had not been received late last night. Colleagues said that Mr Gould, who quit the shadow cabinet last year in protest at Labour's support for the Maastricht treaty, had become increasingly disenchanted with the direction of Labour policy. Mr Gould had some success in promoting alternative policies through the Full Employment Forum, a pressure group for a return to traditional Keynesian policies. More than 30 Labour MPs joined the group, indicating a significant level of support for his views. He was particularly anxious to combat the conservative approach favoured by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, who is one of Labour's leading modernisers. However, Mr Gould had confided to friends that there appeared to be little hope of influencing the party leadership before the next election. It was not clear whether Mr Gould planned to leave the Commons immediately, or wait until the next general election. Party officials said they would be relaxed about a by-election in Dagenham, where Mr Gould had a majority of 6,733 at the last election.</p>

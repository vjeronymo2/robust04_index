			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Cumbria opencast mining to end BRITISH COAL is to phase out its opencast mining in Cumbria because of the highly competitive nature and uncertain future of its markets. The decision, which will cause 300 direct job losses over the next five years, underlines the difficulties British Coal faces in competing against new gas-fired power stations and cheap imported coal. Last year its opencast operations made a Pounds 160m profit on a Pounds 700m turnover.</p>

The organization's constituent committee named Abrik [as  transliterated] al-Suwaysi as its official spokesman. In the  founding statement it issued in Geneva yesterday, the committee  explained its overall intellectual and political view of Libya's  situation and future. It stressed the need to form a democratic  system based on free elections, peaceful political practice, and  rejection of "any forms of material or organizational linkage  with foreign states or political forces and organizations which  could blemish national affiliation with the suspicion of loyalty  to non-national interests and schemes."    The statement said that preliminary consultations among "a  large number of Libyan strugglers" have resulted in the  formation of a constituent committee, which has decided the  following:    "First, to work to build a political force to be joined by  Libyans who reject tyranny and dictatorship and those seeking to  restore legitimacy in their country, contribute to correcting  its deteriorating conditions, and lay foundations suitable for  rebuilding the country with the will of its people and their  independent decisionmaking, so that it will be a homeland for  pride and dignity and a land for freedom, democracy, stability,  development, and progress in the context of the belief in the  following basic principles and foundations:    "-- The importance of organized political action as a  foundation for a civilized civil society.    "-- Constitutional legitimacy implemented through in a  people's referendum by a free secret ballot as the only basis  for government, and considering any authority that is not based  on the people's will an illegitimate authority that should be  rejected.    "-- Democracy as a foundation for the system of government  and a method for the peaceful political practice of political  action, and the incrimination and combating of the methods of  terror and material and moral violence.    "-- Islam as the basic source of legislation and a  cultural authority on which to rely as a foundation, criteria,  and program for the comprehensive cultural transformation  process in the various areas of life.    "-- The fundamental position held by freedom of opinion  and expression among the various basic human freedoms, on the  grounds that it is a human value and a principal pillar of a  civilized civil society.    "-- The fundamental value of work and free initiative as  basic pillars of a free and developed economy that is good at  utilizing national resources and financial and material  capabilities so as to achieve self-sufficiency, stability, and  prosperity.    "-- Libyan national identity as a basic factor in the  various choices relating to Libyan society's transformation from  a state of tyranny, chaos, and cultural backwardness to a state  of legitimacy, rule of constitutional institutions, and  comprehensive cultural advancement. In addition, current local  human, cultural, and economic factors are considered basic  elements for the authenticity of these choices as distinct from  other formulas and methods.    "-- Affirmation of a civilized concept of the duties of the  security forces, including police and intelligence, namely to  protect citizens' security, property, privacy, freedom, and  rights, and to protect the security and stability of civilian  life in society as a whole, not the ruling executive authority  and its continuation in power.    "-- Affirmation of the national, pan-Arab, and  humanitarian role of the national defense forces, namely to  protect constitutional legitimacy, safeguard the national  territory's independence and unity, and contribute positively to  pan-Arab and humanitarian efforts to establish peace and  guarantee the people's right to self-determination.    "-- National unity represented in territorial integrity  and the Libyan people's unity, and commitment to bolstering,  consolidating, protecting, and defending it against racial,  frontal, and tribal disputes and to fighting any inclinations or  attempts to strike at it or impair it.    "-- National affiliation represented in the sincere  affiliation of Libyans -- individuals and political forces -- to  their homeland and people; affirmation of the independence of  the national will; and rejection of any forms of material or  organizational linkage with foreign states or political forces  and organizations which could blemish national affiliation with  the suspicion of loyalty to non-national interests and schemes.    "-- Arab affiliation, on the grounds that Libya is part of  the Arab nation and bound to it culturally and by destiny.    "-- Islamic affiliation, on the grounds that Libya is part  of the Islamic world, proceeding from the faith and Islamic  values. It interacts with it and is aware of the nation's  reality and current issues.    "-- Affiliation to the international community by virtue  of the scale and nature of international interactions and the  belief in Libya's role founded on the establishment of  international relations based on the principles of peace,  cooperation, and noninterference in the internal affairs of the  other peoples and states.    "Second, it has been initially agreed to call this new  struggle formula the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform and  to choose brother struggler Abrik al-Suwaysi as official  spokesman for the constituent committee.    "Third, to continue contacts, consultations, and endeavors  in  order to complete the elements and requirements needed for the  convening of the constituent conference, which will be devoted  to achieving the following steps:    "-- To endorse the basic principles and general features  of the struggle and political program;    "-- To endorse the name and slogans;    "-- To elect the various organizational institutions;    "In announcing this practical preliminary step, the  Constituent Committee of the Libyan Movement for Change and  Reform is eager to stress the following:    "-- Its members do not claim anything other than the honor  of taking the initiative to shoulder part of the responsibility  to achieve this historic national endeavor.    "-- Their mission will end with the convening of the  constituent assembly, which alone will be entitled to take the  various organizational, political, and practical decisions,  including selecting and electing the institutions and  leaderships in a democratic manner based on free choice and the  adoption of the majority's opinion.    "-- The door is open to all Libyan strugglers who agree in  principle with the intellectual and political features declared  in this statement in order to contribute to enriching and  bolstering this historic national endeavor and join the ranks of  those who took the initiative, in order to make it a success."    Meanwhile, Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Ghalbun, leader of the Libyan  Constitutional Union, has welcomed the establishment of the new  organization, describing it as "a tributary of national action  and a comrade on the road of sacrifice for the sake of ridding  our homeland of its current predicament." He wished it and its  founders "success."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian </F> Justice and Life Party, by Pal Szombathy in the parliament on 8  March: "The Agents Law Is Merely a `Powder Law'"]    [Text] I am glad I vetted myself earlier, and I voted  in favor of this cosmetic law in order to prove that this thing  no longer interests me -- Istvan Csurka told MAGYAR HIRLAP after  the parliamentary vote of the so-called "agents law." Istvan  Csurka, the cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP], who uncovered his recruitment as an informer prior to  his expulsion from the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], also  complained that the parliament failed to extend the memorial day  of Nazi victims to the victims of Bolshevism.    [Szombathy] What position did you and the MIEP group take at  the vote on the agents law?    [Csurka] We voted yes, so we accepted the proposal. Our  parliamentary group coordinated its stand prior to the vote and  all of us tried to participate in the vote in order to emphasize  our position. However, Janos Denes was so shocked at the  previous vote (on the memorial day of the Nazi victims) that he  was no longer able to wait for this vote too. I understand his  indignation, because the entire legislative process is becoming  ridiculous.    [Szombathy] Why did you decide to support the agents law?    [Csurka] Actually, this has never been questionable for us.  We would have liked to adopt a serious law, but our strength is  still to limited for that. The law is not an agent law, but an  irresponsible "cosmetic law." The law on former informers will  have no positive consequences on the Hungarian public  whatsoever, because the law continues to leave the real agents  unnamed and unpunished.    [Szombathy] If this is your opinion about the law, why did  you support it?    [Csurka] It is better than nothing. We could not allow  ourselves to be accused that precisely the MIEP was not voting  in favor of the law, when we exclude every communist element  from our activity.    [Szombathy] In your opinion, why is this law incapable of  fulfilling its real function?    [Csurka] It does not have power, and it does not contain  restrictions, punishments, and sanctions, like other laws. It  makes the procedure extremely lax, and it does not cover the  entire public life, and it is extremely lenient toward the old  regime and party machinery.    [Szombathy] Why did you not try to make the bill stricter  with various modification proposals?    [Csurka] We submitted modification proposals, but the  miserable results of the vote preceding the agents law proves  the extent to which such MIEP efforts were swept away. For  example, we earlier demanded the replacement of the chief  prosecutor. We are alone when we want to modify a law in order  to condemn communism and the old regime. It is interesting  that, yesterday too, there were 57 of us who wanted the memorial  day of Nazi victims to be extended to the victims of Bolshevism.  In our view, Nazism and Bolshevism are totally identical  concepts. However, our parliament absolves Bolshevism and  condemns Nazism. One victim should not be more sympathetic than  the other one. In addition, I think the law on creating a  memorial day is slightly dangerous because talks are now being  held between certain Jewish organizations and the government on  compensating the Jews and settling the damages incurred to them,  and now the representatives of full compensation have received a  big moral push with this law. Unfortunately, the parliament  failed to sense that circumstance. This parliament is  definitely ripe to step down.    [Szombathy] To what extent does your own case influence you  when you voice your criticism? Certain things became known  about this before your departure from the MDF....    [Csurka] Those were difficult days, but I can only say that  I am glad that I vetted myself and accepted the things that can  be used against me. It is both an honest and Christian thing to  remain alone on the pedestal, although I do not feel guilty at  all. They cannot bring anything against me by which I caused  any damage to anyone; I never submitted any report.    [Szombathy] Starting from your own case, what advice can you  give to those affected by the law?    [Csurka] I do not deal with it, and I will not answer that  question. I have nothing to do with them.</p>

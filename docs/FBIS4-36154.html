			<p>BFN     [Text] A top Yemeni official has said that southern  warplanes bombarded government forces this morning, violating an  hours' old unilateral cease-fire aimed at ending Yemen's civil  war.    Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani told the press  that  Aden aircraft were bombarding all around since 6 AM this  morning. Mr. al-Iryani declined to say whether the reported  bombardment meant the government would now consider the  open-ended cease-fire invalidated. He also declined to comment  on reports from Aden that gunfire was heard coming from outside  the city as early as 3 AM. All he said was that when jets fly  over troops, they will have to fire back.    The cease-fire declared by the Yemeni Government in coping  with last week's UN Security Council resolution on Yemen went  into effect at midnight last night. In announcing the  unilateral cease-fire last night, the Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salim Basindwah warned that tacit support for the  separatists could reignite the fighting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Excerpt] The three Fatah activists in Hebron who  announced their resignations a few days ago, said Friday [7  January] that they would vacate their decision. They made the  decision after talking with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who  promised that Force 17 in Hebron was not set up at his  instruction nor that of the organization's leadership. 'Arafat  blamed "an Arab intelligence apparatus" (he was apparently  referring to Jordan) for setting up the body.    The activists who withdrew their resignations -- Jibril  al-Bakri, Dhiyab al-Sharabati, and Ihsan al-Nazir -- telephoned  'Arafat Friday night in order to inform him that they resigned  because of organizational deviations by the Fatah leadership,  various appointments in the region, and an attempt to set up a  security apparatus, Force 17. The activists said that "bad  elements, which have always been outside the national consensus  and constitute the remnants of the village associations, headed  by Muhammad al-Nasir, are responsible for the establishment of  the force.    A message sent to 'Arafat in the name of the activists in  the  various Fatah committees in the region was disseminated Friday.  It detailed the reasons for the resignations and the demand to  correct Fatah's internal situation, including the election of  the organization's committees by mass conferences and democratic  elections.    'Arafat made clear to the three activists his positions on  the issues they raised and called on them to withdraw their  resignations. He stressed that no order has been issued by any  authorized body in Fatah Tunis for the establishment of "a  presidential guard apparatus" or "Force 17 militias" in the  territories. He said that Fatah has nothing to do with any  militia or with Muhammad al-Nasir.    'Arafat told the three that a hostile Arab intelligence  service is behind "the announcements about appointments and the  establishment of bodies outside Fatah's legal organizational  framework." He claimed that only the organizational framework  that existed prior to 13 September is considered legal and  binding, and that Fatah's central committee in the Hebron area  would be in charge of dealing with all the attempts by others to  intervene in Fatah affairs.    Despite the tension among Fatah activists in the Hebron  region, a festive gathering was held in East Jerusalem by Fatah  activists in the town on the occasion of the 29th anniversary of  the organization's establishment, which really took place on 1  January. Activists who participated in the event said the delay  was because "the Jerusalem gathering was held after similar  events took place in various regions, in order to underline the  fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Falastin, where the main  rally was held."

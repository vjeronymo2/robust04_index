			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, May 29 (AFP) -- The self-declared Bosnian  Croat parliament has given qualified backing to an accord  providing for a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, the Croatian  news agency HINA said Sunday [29 May].    At a meeting Saturday in the southern Bosnian city of  Mostar,  the parliament endorsed the federation plan as an "historic  necessity" dictated by "internal and foreign policy realities."  But it made its backing subject to the Croats in Bosnia being  afforded equal rights and the federation being liked in a  confederation with Croatia. Croatian Defence Minister Gojko  Susak, who attended the assembly's debate, said "without a  confederation, there can be no federation."    The meeting came ahead of a session in Sarajevo on Monday of  a constituent assembly to elect a Croat president, a Moslem  vice-president and a Moslem prime minister for the federation in  accordance with an agreement reached May 11 in Vienna.    Under the latest international peace plan for Bosnia, the  federation is to cover 51 percent of Bosnian territory. The  Moslems and Croats have said they want 58 percent. The Bosnian  Serbs currently hold 70 percent. The Vienna accord foresees the  creation of four Moslem, two Croat and two mixed cantons. The  mixed areas in central and southern regions of the country will  be jointly administered, but this has upset local Croats,  especially in Mostar. Croat inhabitants complain the canton  including Mostar includes the Catholic pilgrimage site of  Medjugorje.    Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has said Mostar should  underline its Croat identity. "Mostar should be the home of the  main Croat institutions. It should have a Croat university, a  Croat theatre, a Croat fotball club." The Croats also want to  keep their Croatian currency, the kuna, in Bosnia as added  evidence of their ethnic identity. The federation accord  provides for a Bosnian federation currency under central  government control.</p>

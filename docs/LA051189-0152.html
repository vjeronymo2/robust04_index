			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY: PACKED FUND-RAISING CALENDAR PUTS STRAIN ON LOYALTIES  </P> <P> Martha Ehringer, chairwoman of Friday's 11th anniversary gala for the Mingei  International Museum, coined a new word in response to the unusual (to say the  least) circumstances that disrupted the local fund-raising scene last weekend.  </P> <P> Speaking in the Grand Ballroom of the U.S. Grant hotel, Ehringer inaugurated  the word "bi-galal" to describe a pair of fellow committee members who worked  not only on her "Encore 1989" event but also on the "Magical Experience" gala,  given the same evening at the Sheraton Harbor Island for the La Jolla Cancer  Research Foundation. The volunteers in question, artists Annette and Dick Ford,  designed the decorations for both events and thus had to attend both parties on  a part-time basis.  </P> <P> The weekend strained the loyalties of many, since seven major fund-raisers were  held Friday and eight Saturday. No one admitted to understanding how this  traffic jam of good citizenry came to pass -- and good will between competing  organizations was in some cases stretched thin -- but among the weekend's  maelstrom of major events were the annual Gold and White Ball for the Crime  Victims Fund, the annual Fiesta Grande for the Children's Museum, the  Temptations concert at Del Mar Plaza for Casa de Amparo, the Mainly Mozart  Gala, the Louis Ferraud haute couture show for La Jolla Chamber Music Society  and -- well, too many others to mention.  </P> <P> The Mingei event revealed itself through its details; since the museum houses  collections of folk art from around the world, the decorations included fine  specimens from private collections. A live auction offered items dear to the  hearts of crafts collectors, including a Dogon granary door, an antique drum  made of African lion skin and a hand-made wooden rocker commissioned by the  museum's board of directors. The menu represented different parts of the globe,  with emphasis on French cuisine, highlighted by consomme de canard and saumon  avocat. Anthropologists Ethel and Burt Aginsky were the subject of a special  tribute.  </P> <P> The evening coincided with the 11th anniversary of the museum, but Mingei  founder and director Martha Longenecker said that the occasion prompted her to  look ahead, rather than to the past. "What's ahead of us is much greater than  what is behind us," she said. "We're looking towards the future and towards  building a permanent museum."  </P> <P> Among those present were Katy and Michael Dessent, Barbara and Jim Sherrill,  Roger Cornell, Edie Drcar, Nora and Alan Jaffe, Mary Rand Williams, Dorothea  Cronogue, Alice and Tony di Gesu, Susan Eyer, and Judy and Thomas Buffaloe.  </P> <P> Donna Theodore, a professional singer who attended Friday's Mainly Mozart gala  as a guest of event chairman Jacque Powell, glanced around the Westgate Hotel's  Versailles Ballroom and said, "If Mozart was only alive to see this . . . ."  </P> <P> Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, characterized in the film "Amadeus" as the bad boy of  classical music, might have felt at home in the confines of the Baroque,  candle-lit room, where an air of Viennese gaiety prevailed that could have been  sweetened only if the guests had worn period wigs whitened with powdered sugar.  </P> <P> The event anticipated the first Westgate Mainly Mozart Festival (ts proper,  corporate-sponsored name), which will run June 2 through June 11 on the  Festival Stage at the Old Globe Theatre and will feature, as should seem  obvious, mostly Mozart. Festival President Laurie Waddy described the evening  as the concert series' only fund-raiser, and predicted big things for Mainly  Mozart.  </P> <P> "This is probably going to be the biggest musical event ever to happen in San  Diego," Waddy said. "We're hoping to do for San Diego what the Santa Fe Opera  Festival has done for Santa Fe, and what the Spoleto festival has done for  Charleston (South Carolina)."  </P> <P> Event chairman Powell planned a lush, lavish evening for her 180 guests that  began with a Champagne reception, continued with a dinner of filet  strasbougeois and strawberries in sauce sabayon, and featured continuous  dancing to society pianist Barry Levich and his ensemble. Perhaps because  Mozart wrote relatively few syncopated rhythms, Levich played everything but  Mozart, including the "Varsity Drag" and "Makin' Whoopee" (it can be  conjectured that Wolfgang would have liked the latter of these). Climbing  arrangements of miniature orchids towered above the dinner tables.  </P> <P> Powell said she chose orchids as a symbol of the Mainly Mozart Festival's  potential. "A first-time event is a lot like taking a chance on an orchid  plant," she said. "Will it grow? Will it blossom? This one will."  </P> <P> The guest list included many long-time supporters of San Diego classical music  organizations, including BobbieCQ and Blaine Quick, Veryl and Aage  Fredericksen, Martha and George Gafford, D'Neane Wilkinson, Dick Jacobson,  Peggy Duly, Linda and Charles Owen, Lael and Jay Kovtun, Jeanne Larson, Sheri  and Ben Kelts, Evelyn Truitt, Ed Pilkerton, Luba Johnston, Darlene Davies with  Paul Marshall, and Kathy and George Pardee.  </P> <P> Alex Spanos, the multimillionaire developer who founded his fortune on selling  sandwiches from a panel truck, has been criticized once or twice since he took  control of the San Diego Chargers in 1984, but he managed to maintain a  cheerful countenance the other evening when Bob Hope, Telly Savalas and other  pals stood to praise him as a philanthropist, leading citizen and all around  good guy.  </P> <P> The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith awarded Spanos its National  Distinguished Community Service Award at the prejudice-fighting group's annual  tribute dinner and dance, given May 3 at the San Diego Marriott. But while  Spanos said he was pleased with the award, what he really wanted to talk about  was football.  </P> <P> Waving the award at the audience of 500, Spanos said, "As I look at this  trophy, I want to thank the ADL, but I hope the next trophy I hold will be the  Super Bowl trophy. I've given orders to director of football operations Steve  Ortmayer and our new coach, Dan Henning, 'Whatever it takes, you get that  talent and bring it in.' I hate losing, and I promise you will see dramatic  changes this year."  </P> <P> In reference to the main topic of the evening, the work of the ADL, Spanos  said, "I believe there will be a day when no ethnic or racial minority will  have to fight for its rights." In 1986, Spanos, the son of Greek immigrants,  was among 80 Americans awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor by the Statue of  Liberty Ellis Island Foundation and the New York Statue of Liberty Commission.  </P> <P> The dinner's seven co-chairmen -- the group included banker Bob Adelizzi,  attorney Miles Harvey and Chargers director of administration Jack Teele --  organized an elegant tribute for Spanos that ranged from delicately demure  arrangements of white tulips to a training-table menu of steak and baked  Alaska. The formal program opened with videotaped tributes from Spanos family  members and assorted golfing buddies, including former President Gerald Ford,  who said that Spanos "epitomizes the very best in our society."  </P> <P> The audience was notably disappointed when the famous Hope-Spanos soft shoe  routine, which the pair frequently dances at charity events, was performed on  tape rather than the stage, but perked up when Hope took the microphone to  reminisce about his long-time friend.  </P> <P> "Alex is some kind of man," Hope said. "I taught him how to dance. He's a  charitable guy, he's nice to know. But that's not what interests him right now  -- what interests him now is getting a winning team for San Diego."  </P> <P> The guest list was headed by Spanos' wife, Faye, and included Susie and Dean  Spanos, Dea Economou, Dolores Hope, Warren Jones, Si Coleman, Gerry Wambach,  ADL chairman Jodyne Roseman, Stanley Heyman, Mitchell Dubick, Jim Schmidt,  Marilyn and Kim Fletcher, former Chargers coach Sid Gillman, County Supervisor  Leon Williams, and Anne and Abe Ratner.  </P></p>

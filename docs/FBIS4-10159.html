			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Yesterday, Jorge Arturo Reina,  brother of President Carlos Roberto Reina, rejected claims that  the alleged plot to assassin the president is part of a  "smokescreen" to cover up the country's real problems and  assured that no Liberal would attack the government.    Yesterday, Jorge Arturo Reina, first vice president of the  legislative branch, arrived at legislative branch headquarters  and said that "we cannot rule out the fact that democracy is  always exposed to dangers and that there are always minds  capable of hatching anything to destabilize democratic order."    "I, however, think that the problem should neither be  overblown nor minimized," he added, after denying that this is a  "smokescreen." He said "that this is absolutely false because  it was not planned by Honduran intelligence or the government.  It was kindly passed on by a neighboring government (Nicaragua)  to the Honduran Government."    As for Private Secretary Lucio Izaguirre's hint that there  are Liberals seeking to destabilize the government, Reina said  he had not heard about it. But he clarified that "no one is  conspiring in Honduras, there is no national goal to do so and  much less within our political party,"    "The Liberal Party is more united than ever. It is normal  for someone to voice his views within the Liberal Party, and  this will continue to happen because we censor no one."    As for the economic crisis and announced increases in  electricity rates, the president's brother said that there is a  need for ample and clear explanation on the real situation in  the country to ensure that Hondurans are informed and support  the thankless and bitter decisions that the government has to  make.</p>

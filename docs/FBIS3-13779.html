			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 19 Mar (INA)--Today's Iraqi papers stress  that the opposition to the U.S. and British viewpoint at the UN  Security Council legitimizes the Iraqi people's options for  removing the injustice being exercised against them and for  ending the sanctions which the UN Security Council has failed to  lift as a result of the political conspiracy of Washington and  Zionism.    In today's articles and commentaries, the papers stress that  what happened at the UN Security Council yesterday reveals the  magnitude of the dangerous anti-Iraq plot and underlines the  deep links between the Zionist and U.S. interests and a full  U.S. readiness to implement Zionist circles' desires to weaken  Iraq and curb its pan-Arab intellectual renaissance.    AL-QADISIYAH says that the split the Iraqi position has  effected among the permanent UN Security Council member states  affirms the legitimacy of the Iraqi position and the legitimacy  of any move that Iraq might deem necessary to open for its  people a window of hope for ending the blockade.    AL-QADISIYAH continues: Lifting the blockade has become a  matter of life or death for the Iraqi people. Therefore, as a  people, they are entitled to do whatever their leadership, which  is aware of the dark corners of the political plot that is being  implemented against them, deems necessary to lift the blockade  by all available means and to reassess all the stands that have  led and lead to maintaining the blockade against them.    BABIL says that the Iraqi people are waging the battle of  Iraq and the Arab nation together, and that their success in  putting an end to the blockade means thwarting the attempts and  plans to besiege the masses of the Arab nation.    Reviewing the current Arab state of affairs, BABIL indicates  that Libya, just like the people of Iraq, is being subjected to  an air blockade. Meanwhile, Sudan is being subjected to an  aggressive scheme aimed at imposing an unjust blockade, and our  Palestinian people have been subjected to a continuous Zionist  siege since the breakout of the intifadah. The paper says that  the policy of imposing blockades has been adopted as an  available means to besiege the Arab nation, beginning with the  countries rejecting U.S.-Zionist hegemony, and ending with any  hope for success by emerging Arab powers.    BABIL warns the Arab nation against the gravity of the  schemes to besiege the Arab nation. It urges parties,  movements, federations, unions, and all social forces to work  and struggle to support Iraq's pan-Arab position and to confront  the evil powers. It calls on Arab institutions, beginning with  the Arab League and its organizations and ending with Arab  regimes, to adopt a clear and explicit stance against the  continued blockade.    BABIL stresses that the current circumstances experienced by  the Iraqi people provide a historic chance for whoever wants to  atone for his sins or the sins being committed in his name  against the Iraqi people to do so, for such sins have encouraged  the aggressors to launch their treacherous aggression and to  maintain the blockade. To atone for their sins, they should  declare a clear and explicit stance against the continued  blockade.    AL-JUMHURIYAH describes what happened at the UN Security  Council yesterday as an obvious political and diplomatic defeat  for the United States and Britain and an end for the U.S.  honeymoon at the UN Security Council, which has lasted for over  three years.    The paper says that when three members--France, Russia, and  China--of the five permanent members demand that the  positiveness of the Iraqi position be recognized, it signals a  change and a number of important facts, most prominent of which  is that the United States has lost its ability to issue easy  resolutions and to impose its will on the Security Council.    The paper explains that Washington has come to realize the  long- term significance of this change, which particularly means  that the battle for lifting the blockade has entered its most  critical turning point and that the U.S. logic has proved  unsuccessful unconvincing even inside U.S. Congress.    AL-JUMHURIYAH continues: What happened at the Security  Council yesterday reveals a third fact which tells us that  renewing the blockade every two months is no longer something  that can be unilaterally decided by the United States. Rather,  such a decision is now influenced by the wills and interests of  other countries, because the blockade not only harms the Iraqi  people, but also the international community as a whole.    The paper expresses confidence that month after month, the  stand of the states supporting the lifting of the blockade will  become stronger and firmer, thus leading to the emergence of a  legal argument and a conflict of interests which will turn the  disagreement that emerged yesterday to a crisis that will  escalate violently every two months, thus provoking disputes and  differences, and perhaps a serious crisis, until the blockade  comes to an end.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / One wall that still stands: Jimmy Burns visits a symbol of hope in troubled Ulster ALBERT HUNTER, supervisor of the Spring community farm in west Belfast, stands in the driving Northern Ireland rain, feeding a rejected newly-born lamb from a bottle. 'This site is no good, the mud builds up, and then the animals just sink,' he says. Around him the small farm of peacocks, peahens, pigs, bullocks and sheep seems at odds with the desolate urban landscape. Drainage may be the most immediate problem but it is not the most serious for Hunter, a former shipyard worker, and his staff of six young unemployed men working on the farm as part of ACE (Action for Community Employment) the government-assisted scheme for the long-term unemployed. The farm stands on a piece of bombed-out waste land between two deeply divided Belfast communities: to the west, the Roman Catholic Ballymurphy estate, to the east, the protestant Springmarket estate. It was set up in the mid-1970s with government money in an attempt to reconcile the communities. The site picked for early residents Louis the pig and Barney the bullock was one of several groups of houses burnt down during sectarian rioting. Hunter himself has suffered as much as anybody from the social consequences of Ulster's 'Troubles'. A 37-year-old Protestant, he remembers a peaceful childhood on the Ballymurphy estate, but as an adult he was forced to move house to the Protestant enclave of Springmarket. He came to work on the farm after being made redundant. 'People have asked for this fence to be built to keep each other out,' he says, surveying the Ballymurphy estate beyond it. The fence and nearby walls  -bricks and concrete topped by a steel palisade - are among several so called 'peace lines' which zig-zag through the working-class areas of Belfast. While other walls in Europe have been taken down, the one by the farm has been built up over the last year. It was reinforced after a Protestant loyalist terrorist walked round the farm's perimeter fencing, into the Catholic area, and shot a 14-year-old schoolboy. At the begining of the decade, it was widely assumed that such barriers would come down in Northern Ireland as they seemed to be doing in Germany and Eastern Europe. However, more recently a more tragic process of osmosis has taken place: Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland have grown to reflect each other. In its bloody dissolution, Yugoslavia has revealed the underlying divisions that have sprung from religion, territorial dispossession, and the burden of history. These are familiar themes on Ulster's political landscape. While some community-based groups and church figures do reach out across the political divide in a spirit of reconciliation, the continuing violence of the paramilitary gangs - and the unreconstructed rhetoric of some politicians - springs from old fears, old antagonisms. Against such a background it is not surprising that the farm has not developed into the universal playground it was meant to be. But it has been become a symbol of frustrated hope in the midst of Northern Ireland's seemingly insoluble divisions, as poignant as the television images of correspondents in Yugoslavia trying to make sense of the latest exchange of sniper fire. 'No one has been shot on this farm and we are visited by Catholic and Protestant school children,' says Hunter. 'But the Catholics come in their buses, and the Protestants in theirs. They stay here for ten minutes, then they go back into their estates.' Staff at the farm are provided by the local office running the community employment programme, which provides grant-assisted part-time jobs at minimum rates for mainly young people who would otherwise be on unemployment benefit. The area has an unemployment rate of above 50 per cent. The local manager is Jackie Hewitt, a Protestant ex-trade unionist who has spent most of his working life commited to community work. He plans to move the farm to a better-drained area by the summer. But, like Hunter, he does not under-estimate the problems of building a more effective bridge across the sectarian divide. 'We are trying to reach out to the fringes of our community, but we don't fool ourselves that Protestants and Catholics are going to suddenly live together . . . Reconciliation in Northern Ireland is not easy.'</p>

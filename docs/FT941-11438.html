			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Promise on prison slopping out broken Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has gone back on a promise made three years ago by Mr Kenneth Baker, one of his predecessors, to end slopping out in prisons by the end of this year, David Owen writes. In a Commons written answer, Mr Howard blamed the delay on the forecast increase in the prison population. This has reduced the amount of prison accommodation planned to be taken out of use for refurbishment during the next two years, he said. 'The alternative would have been a return to the prolonged use of police cells and an unacceptable level of overcrowding,' he added. Mr Baker made the original promise in February 1991 when responding to Lord Justice Woolf's report into serious riots at six prisons. In April 1990, the then home secretary said the programme to give all prisoners access to sanitation would cost Pounds 36m. Mr Howard said the government's aim now was to complete the programme 'no later than February 1996, the date recommended by Lord Woolf'.</p>

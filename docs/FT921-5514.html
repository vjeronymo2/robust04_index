			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Museveni sets himself against the multi-party wind: Uganda's president will not win the plaudits on democracy he has on the economy UGANDA'S President Yoweri Museveni has firmly set himself against the prevailing wind of multi-party politics blowing across the African continent. For Uganda it would be a 'diversion' and the wrong course, he says. The president, widely credited by multilateral agencies and the west for tackling the political and economic ravages inflicted by his predecessors, is unlikely to win similar plaudits for this view. 'In our country parties are a basis for division on tribal and religious lines,' Mr Museveni said in an interview. 'More than 90 per cent of our people are peasants and their problems are to do with selling their crops, getting water and education. It is easier for people to belong to one mass movement like the (ruling) National Resistance Movement. 'Parties are not synonymous with democracy,' he added. Mr Museveni suspended party political activity - parties were not banned outright - soon after coming to power in 1986. He followed this by inviting the parties and tribal factions to join his NRM in forming a broad-based government. His aim was to achieve the reconciliation and political stability that deserted Uganda during the ruinous reign of Idi Amin and Milton Obote during the 1970s and early 1980s. 'Even in those countries in Africa which have adopted multi-partyism (such as neighbouring Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia), I doubt if the experiment is sustainable. We have seen it all before in the 1960s but where did it take Africa? The whole thing just collapsed. I hope to be proved wrong but I just don't see multi-partyism as the best route.' 'One only has to look at the progress Uganda has made over the last six years by harnessing the diverse elements. So I say no to multi-partyism but yes to democracy.' Yet, paradoxically, a multi-party movement may be the result of the president's own democratisation measures. Soon after coming to office, he introduced a grassroots democratic system involving the election of so-called 'resistance councils' (RCs) in villages, parishes, counties and districts. The RCs in turn elect a member to represent them in the National Resistance Council, the 268-member national legislature, which also includes 20 presidential nominees. Several RCs, which held elections this week, are known to favour a return to multi-party democracy. Political parties, such as the Democratic party, have also called for the lifting of the suspension on multi-party activity. The political debate is likely to reach a head in December when an independent commission drafting a new constitution is due to report. Mr Museveni has indicated he would abide by the commission's decision. The current political debate, however, is unlikely to overshadow Mr Museveni's impressive list of achievements on the economic front. Gross domestic product has increased by 6 per cent for each of the past five years; inflation has been cut from its 1988 peak of 240 per cent to about 35 per cent in 1991; inefficient state monopolies have been abolished; and a new investment code and privatisation programme have been introduced. Most of this radical overhaul has been with the help of a stringent World Bank structural adjustment programme. The World Bank says it is 'optimistic' about the outlook for the economy and is soon to release Dollars 125m to cover the next 18 months of the structural adjustment programme and Dollars 65m for privatisation. One area of prime concern is falling revenues from Uganda's main foreign exchange earner, coffee - largely the consequence of the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in 1989 which aimed to support prices through an export quota system. Coffee earnings have slumped from about Dollars 285m in 1989 to Dollars 140m last year and now account for some 70 per cent of total export earnings, down from 97 per cent 1987. At the same time the government has sought to ease dependence on coffee exports by encouraging production of other crops such as bananas, pineapples, beans and sesame seed and cotton. Last year, exports of these crops totalled Dollars 50m. The immediate problems of the economy however are dwarfed by the ravages wrought by Aids. More than 1m people are reported to be HIV positive of a population of about 17m. The disease is described by the authorities as their greatest social problem. Corruption remains widespread and a December 1991 Amnesty International Report accused the Army of 'torturing, executing and detaining people'. Mr Museveni said: 'We have tried to respect human rights. Where violations have taken place we have taken action. I wouldn't like to say Amnesty are not a serious group but all they seem to do is reproduce the accusations of bandits.' Such problems are likely to continue taxing the ingenuity of Mr Museveni at least until 1995 when presidential elections are due. He said he was unsure if he would stand. 'If I do, it will only be for one term. If Uganda isn't stable by then, then I don't see why I should devote the rest of my life to it. I have other things to do. After all, if a company does not break even in 15 years, it will never be viable, will it?'</p>

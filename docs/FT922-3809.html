			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Observer: Counter attack Juan Antonio Samaranch, the most powerful man in international sport, should be enjoying his twilight years as president of the International Olympic Committee. But the run-up to the summer Olympics in his home town of Barcelona has been marred by unpleasant criticism. The publication of a critical book, Lords of the Rings, and a couple of Granada TV documentaries, have thrown into question Samaranch's stewardship of the Olympic ideal. So yesterday, Samaranch came to London to face his Anglo-Saxon critics who want to unseat him. The occasion was the launch of David Miller's official biography: Olympic Revolution, which had been rushed out to counter-balance the charges made by Lords of the Rings. Samaranch did not come alone. He was flanked on the stage by three IOC members, the IOC director-general and Sir Arthur Gold, chairman of the British Athletics Association. As an accomplished ex-ambassador, the president knows how to be diplomatic in the face of hostile questioning, especially on the subject of his future. A lot of people have been putting pressure on him both to stay and to go, but, teasingly, he says he will wait until after Barcelona to make up his mind. The ring-master remains in complete control of the Olympic circus.</p>

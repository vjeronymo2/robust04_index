			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: Baring strategist bullish on Manila Manila's composite index is expected to hit 3,250 by the end of September after its recent spurt through the 3,000 level, Reuter reports from Manila. In the August issue of Tiger Talk from Baring Securities, the broker's director for Asian strategy Mr Alan Butler-Henderson forecast the climb to 3,250 and said that the composite could regain its previous high of 3,300 by December, rising to 3,600 in March 1995. Mr Butler-Henderson said the Philippine stock market could be Asia's next darling, with a buoyant economy and good corporate fundamentals underpinning its growth. He added that the local market had managed to hold up extremely well, even through the difficult times of the last six months, when a major correction occurred. Baring noted concerns about the profits outlook for the index heavyweight Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), but said this was outweighed by strong capital inflows, firming economic growth, declining interest rates and positive corporate news. The market shrugged off early profit-taking yesterday to close higher on aggressive buying, the composite index climbing 5.65 to 3,011.6 for a 7.6 per cent advance since the end of July.</p>

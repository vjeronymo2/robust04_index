Its purpose is to take into account the fact that at the end of the spawning season, the scallop resource is dominated by small scallops. This action increases the average meat count standard to 33 meats per pound (MPP) (33 meats per 0.45 kg) and the shell height standard to 311/16 inches (94 mm). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Paul H.

These criteria, which appear at &sect;650.22(c), include the finding that: (1) The objective of the FMP would be achieved more readily, or would be better served through an adjustment of the standards; (2) the recommended alteration in the standards would not reduce expected catch over the following year by more than 5 percent from that which would have been expected under the prevailing standard; (3) the recommended standards for meat count and shell height are consistent with each other; and (4) 50 percent of the harvestable biomass is at scallop sizes smaller than those consistent with the prevailing standards, and a temporary relaxation of the standards would not jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. Adjustments of the standards may remain in effect for up to twelve months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After consideration of the criteria, the Regional Director made a proposal to adjust the standards. In accordance with the regulations, a public hearing was held during the December 9, 1993, New England Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting and comments on this recommendation were solicited. Attendance at the public hearing was low; only one State Director and one member of the industry commented. The comments were in support of the recommended adjustment. No written comments were received on the recommendation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of the full record, including: (1) Comments from the public, (2) comments from the Council, (3) new resource and assessment information, and (4) available information on the fishery and the industry, the Regional Director has decided to adjust the standards to 33 MPP (0.45 kg) with a corresponding shell height standard of 311/16 inches (94 mm) for the period February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This adjustment to the standards coincides with the end of the 10 percent spawning season adjustment approved under Amendment 2 to the FMP (53 FR 23634). This action was also taken in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, at the end of the spawning season adjustment period. Survey information shows that abundance and recruitment values for the sea scallop resource are down and that the resource is dominated by small scallops. This makes attaining an average MPP standard difficult because of the scarcity of large scallops available for mixing. Vessel costs increase because additional time and fuel must be spent in search of large scallops, discard mortality increases on small scallops, and landings decrease. These factors conflict with the objectives of the FMP and, therefore, criterion 1 outlined above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action meets criterion 2 because it is not expected to reduce catch over the following year by more than 5 percent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 3 states that the meat count and shell height standards will remain consistent with each other. Based on analysis of historical survey data, the 33 MPP (0.45 kg) is consistent with a corresponding shell height standard of 311/16 inches (94 mm), thereby, conforming with criterion 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion 4 states that 50 percent of the harvestable biomass must be at sizes smaller than the prevailing standard (30 MPP). Recent survey results show that 50 percent of the harvestable biomass consists of scallops smaller than 30 MPP. Thus this portion of criterion 4 is met. Criterion 4 also states that a temporary relaxation of the standards must not jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. Sea scallops have their first significant spawning at age four. Age four sea scallops range from approximately 30 count to 50 count. The Regional Director recognizes that caution must be exercised when recommending a temporary adjustment to the meat count standard within this range. It is unlikely, however, that an adjustment of this magnitude, for a one month period, will jeopardize future recruitment to the fishery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This temporary adjustment will be effective February 1, 1994, through February 28, 1994. During this period, the meat count standard will be 33 MPP (33 meats per 0.45 kg) and the shell height standard 311/16 inches (94 mm). After February 28, 1994, sea scallop FMP Amendment 4 will be effective, and the meat count will no longer be in use as a management measure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 650 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David S.

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Survey of Distribution Services (3): Increasingly prominent role - UK companies target Europe RECENT news that UK-based logistics service company McGregor Cory, part of the Ocean Group, is to build an Pounds 18m distribution centre in Spain highlights two trends in the UK distribution industry as a whole. First, there is an increase in the number of leading operators who are building up their presence in continental Europe. And second, there is a tendency by several of those companies to base their European expansion on links with specific customers rather than setting up service networks and then looking to win new business. The announcement of McGregor Cory's new venture in Spain, for example, coincided with news that the company's Spanish subsidiary, Serralta, had won a six-year, multi-million-pound contract from detergent and household products manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble covering the warehousing and distribution of products in Iberia. Other distribution companies are following a similar path. Mr John Stocker, group director business development for Ryder PLC, the UK arm of US-based Ryder System Inc, said: 'Our approach is to enter a country either with a customer or with a target industry - it is not our intention to set up a European network and invite customers to use it.' Not all UK distribution companies have adopted that philosophy, though. Business services group Hays, for example, this summer followed up the acquisition of French specialist distribution business FRIL for Pounds 37.5m in 1992 with the purchase of a 75 per cent shareholding in German national contract distribution business Mordhorst for Pounds 32m. A spokesman for Hays said that unlike some of its UK competitors which had bought smaller continental distribution service operators and sought to integrate them, it had purchased companies which already had national networks. The present generally cautious mood among UK distribution companies when it comes to European expansion in part reflects the fact that a number of earlier efforts to develop operations on the continent ran into problems. For example, even one of the UK's most experienced distribution operators in continental Europe, Transport Development Group, was recently forced to close French road haulage subsidiary Translittoral at a cost of more than Pounds 12m following persistent heavy losses. Mr Alan Cole, TDG chief executive, said one of the problems had been that a big company such as Translittoral had found it hard to compete with small hauliers prepared to operate at very low margins in a business where there was little scope to add value to services. The economic recession in many European countries is further encouraging caution among UK distribution companies. TDG's results for the half-year to June 30, 1993, for example, show how the present downturn in continental European transport business is hitting overall profits. While operating profits in the UK rose from Pounds 13.8m in the 1992 half-year to Pounds 15m this year, profits for continental Europe fell to Pounds 2.9m compared with Pounds 4.3m in the first half of 1992. NFC group, reporting its latest results last month, said that while positive signs of economic recovery were beginning to emerge in the UK, the economic scene in mainland Europe was 'more complex'. Trading remained 'difficult', particularly in Germany and Spain. Longer term, however, leading UK distribution companies believe their widely acknowledged expertise will enable them to become increasingly prominent players on the broader European scene. For example, McGregor Cory executives claim their company's planned Spanish distribution centre at Mataro, some 30km north of Barcelona, will break new ground as far as Iberian logistics operations are concerned. Their 22,000 sq m building, due to become operational by September 1994, will feature a combination of fully-automated high bay warehousing capacity and conventional manual low bay space. That, they say, will make it the first such multi-user facility in Spain and probably Europe as a whole. NFC's thrust into continental Europe is being spearheaded by Exel Logistics whose European developments over the past year have included work on a multi-regional chill distribution network in France; the integration of German distribution company Theo Macke u Sohn; and establishment of a new operating unit in Belgium. Also expanding in continental Europe is Christian Salvesen Distribution. Profits for its continental activities increased by more than 40 per cent in the year to end-March to just over Pounds 6m. CSD said it experienced particularly good growth in the Benelux countries, while in Germany a loss-making contract was terminated and efforts were refocused on the company's original retail distribution business. Profits in France were held back by the lorry drivers' strike but the retail customer base was increased. Other well-known UK distribution companies to announce new developments in continental Europe over the past year include leading parcels carriers such as Securicor Omega Express, United Carriers and Parceline. They have all expanded coverage through partnership and consortia arrangements. Prominent among the more general UK-based logistics service operators to expand on the continent recently are Hogg Robinson, P&amp;O and Tibbett &amp; Britten.</p>

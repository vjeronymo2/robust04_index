			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Paying tax on share sales Do you have to pay tax when selling shares. I am a non-taxpayer. You have to pay CGT only if your total capital gains (after indexation relief) amount to more than Pounds 5,800 in 1994-95. As you are a non-taxpayer, the next Pounds 3,000 of capital gains beyond Pounds 5,800 would be taxed at 20 per cent; the next Pounds 20,700 at 25 per cent; and the rest at 40 per cent. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

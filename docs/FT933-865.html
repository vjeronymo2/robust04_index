			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / People: Cipau seeks a welcome in Japan Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, has reinforced its determination to expand in Japan, the world's second largest market, by appointing a new president there. For the first time, the post also carries a main board position. Gabriel Cipau, 52, is to become president of Nippon Wellcome KK, the British group's 55 per cent-owned joint-venture with Sumitomo of Japan. The company has only a limited portfolio in Japan - Zovirax, Zyloric, and Retrovir - but according to John Robb, group chief executive, 'we've done pretty well.' Sales in Japan increased by 18 per cent last year to Pounds 128m. 'But strategically we have to make progress in Japan if we are to grow. We have worldwide market share of 1.4 per cent and US market share of 2 per cent. However, in Japan it is only about 0.6 per cent. Improving that is a high priority for us,' he says, nor does he exclude the possibility of making an acquisition there. Robb says the importance of Japan is reflected in the decision to make the position a board appointment. The directors of the US, Europe and the international operations are already on the board. The aim is to look at licensing opportunities in Japan, particularly licensing products to Japanese companies. This should help drugs pass through the regulatory process more quickly. Wellcome's portfolio includes valaciclovir, a new anti-herpes compound, and Lamactil, an anti-epileptic drug which may also be used to treat stroke victims. Nippon Wellcome will soon face added competition in Japan against its best-selling product there, the anti-herpes treatment Zovirax. Nippon Shoji Kaisha has developed a competitor compound called sorivudine which is expected to be licensed soon to treat shingles. The drug, also known as BVaraU, is also being developed for herpes and will be co-marketed by Yamasa Shoyu. It has been licensed to Bristol-Myers Squibb for marketing outside Japan. Cipau, a Hungarian by birth and now a US citizen, has an MSc in chemistry from East Carolina University and an MBA from Duke University. His last post was senior vice-president of production and engineering at Burroughs Wellcome, the US subsidiary. In his new position he will be based at Osaka.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 22 (YONHAP) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will form two inspection teams to  witness the changing of fuel rods at North Korea's 5-megawatt  nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and plans to send the first one  Sunday, diplomatic sources here said Friday.    As North Korea has already notified the IAEA that it will  soon change fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor, an advance team  leaves Vienna on Sunday and is to arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday to  prepare for the refueling procedure.    The second team will depart for Pyongyang around Wednesday  to  push for full-fleged inspections including observation of the  refueling, according to the sources. The second team's  inspection activities, however, might be limited because North  Korea is still resisting IAEA demands for additional checks such  as collecting samples at a radiochemical laboratory, saying only  that it will allow the inspectors to witness the fuel-rod change.    The United States will hold a working-level contact with  North Korea next week to discuss the teams' scope of inspection  duties in witnessing the refueling as well as additional checks  of the radiochemical laboratory. They are also expected to  discuss meeting the conditions for a third round of high-level  talks.    The sources expected that the U.S. Government will hold a  senior officials' meeting to chart a course on the nuclear issue  and that it will urge North Korea to accept further checks to  ensure that the next round of dialogue takes place.    Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said  Washington can only hold the third round of talks with Pyongyang  when the Feb. 15 agreement on the continuity of safeguards at  North Korea's seven declared sites is implemented.    McCurry added, "... IAEA inspectors must be present to  monitor the unloading and storage of this spent fuel. And we've  made it clear from the very beginning that if the IAEA is not  allowed to do this, we would have no choice but to end our  dialogue with North Korea and return the issue to the Security  Council."</p>

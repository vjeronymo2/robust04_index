			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): More losses expected at troubled bank - Credit Lyonnais/Michelin Credit Lyonnais, France's state-owned bank, is expected to report another large loss when it announces its first half results on Thursday, with earnings depressed by the general fall in credit demand in France and weighed down by continued bad loan provisions. Its chairman, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, had earlier predicted that the banking group, which recorded a 1993 net loss of FFr6.9bn (Pounds 831m) after FFr17.8bn worth of provisions, would break even in the second half of this year and return to profit in 1995. But the group has taken longer to clean up its balance sheet than it expected, and though it has not uncovered any major new problems, it is likely to have to make further provisions for doubtful loans and investments by its Althus and SDBO subsidiaries. As a result, analysts expect a first half net loss well above the FFr1.05bn loss reported for the same period of 1993. Michelin, the French tyre-making company, will announce first half results tomorrow which will reveal the extent of recovery at the group. Last year, Michelin suffered net losses of FFr3.67bn, reflecting the impact of restructuring costs and the depressed state of the European automobile industry. This year, most analysts are expecting a sharp improvement as the benefits of recovery feed through.</p>

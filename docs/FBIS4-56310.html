			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Ruben Blades of the </F> Papa Egoro Movement during the final presidential "debate"  sponsored by the Latin American Institute of Advanced Studies  and the Media Presidential Debate Committee; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] Some 90 years ago, at the beginning of a new  century, Panamanians adopted with patriotism and courage the  decision to forge a new nation. Today, nearly 100 years later,  Panama is preparing for another important historical event --  the country's entrance into the 21st century. The government we  will elect on Sunday will be responsible for preparing and  implementing a national program that will allow us to enter the  21st century ready to participate and compete advantageously.  We must resolve the current crisis; we must strengthen our  institutional, cultural, economic, political, and moral values;  and we must begin the construction of a new country capable of  facing the challenges of a new century.    To achieve these goals, the new government will have to work  with the greatest degree of honesty, dedication, and patriotism,  and it will have to work with only one goal -- to serve Panama.  For this reason, it is vital that the executive branch not be  controlled by private interests that are represented by the  leadership of the traditional political parties. The bosses of  these parties do not differ from one another. All of them have  betrayed their own rank-and-file, and they have also betrayed  the ideals of their original leaders. See how today, given the  actual possibility that decency may win, they are uniting to  attack us in a shameful campaign of lies and infamy. Let us  start putting things in their rightful order, because we will  not let them insult the intelligence of our nation's men and  women.    The same conceit and arrogance that prevented them from  seeing the nation's problems have also prevented them from  recognizing the balanced proposals of the Papa Egoro Movement.  Moreover, they were unable to foresee the consequences of their  blindness. Now that the people's wisdom has bested them and the  Panamanian people are overwhelmingly supporting a new and  different program, they have been unable to find arguments that  enable them to fight fairly.    In this immoral campaign, which I suppose will continue  until  Election Day, I am being accused of being a CIA agent, of being  a communist, of trying to change the currency, of being a  hireling of the military, of using drugs, and of many other  things, and all of these accusations are made without evidence  or are based on false or forged evidence. I assure you, honest  men and women of my country, that all of this is part of a plan  to cause confusion and undermine our movement's support. It is  all a lie. They want you to believe that the option of decency  has no possibility of winning, as well as believe that, in these  elections, you can only choose between two options which  represent the past and which have squandered the best  opportunities Panama ever had.    We, on the other hand, propose a government that will be  honored and proud to work for our country and will also exalt  all of us in order that we may recover the feelings of national  pride which glorify a nation. The government we propose  includes capable professionals who come from all social,  political, and labor groups in Panama. They are people with  vast professional experience, noble qualities, and whose  leadership is based on merit. This government team will set an  example of unity and tolerance among brothers, honesty,  creativity, goodwill, independence, national pride, ability,  imagination, and all of the good qualities of the Panamanian  people.    This is what we need in order that, when the Canal is handed  over to the Panamanian people, the reverted areas do not become  political loot for irresponsible individuals capable of  sacrificing a whole country to satisfy their material ambitions.  Let us remember that the Canal is not simply an important  economic resource; it is a responsibility shared by all  Panamanians before the entire world. The seriousness of its  management will determine the amount of respect we receive  within the international community.    The Papa Egoro Movement has stated and repeated many times  that it is necessary to change the Panamanians' political  conduct so that their participation in the government may become  a true civic goal. I agree with the school of thought that  defines the failure of traditional politics as the failure of  men and women whose moral corruption has been unmasked by power,  or who have been compelled to accept corruption to achieve a  covetous share of power.    We have to make an effort -- all of us, together, all social  and economic groups, the rank-and-file of all political parties,  and all ethnic groups -- to elect and support a government that  makes a change. I am confident we will achieve this, because  the Panamanians who are responsible, decent, and prepared to  work for a better country represent the majority. This  determination to solve our problems and establish the groundwork  to enable Panama to begin to change must be clearly stated at  the ballot boxes as an exemplary civic duty.    I congratulate those who will vote for their candidates, not  because they will get a sinecure or a job, or as a result of  vengeance and retribution, but because they are convinced by  their proposals and because they believe in those men and women.  The electoral challenge we now face is a struggle between hope  and failure, between an honest political position and politics  for the sake of politics, between the desire to honor the  homeland and the desire for personal gain, between the future  and the past, and between honesty and corruption.    Let us go out and win this battle for the sake of Panama,  for  the sake of our highest thoughts, for the sake of our finest  feelings, and for the sake of honesty. I am asking the  Panamanians to go out and vote and unequivocally state that we  all want true change, and I am asking them not to let money and  false promises prevail when they make their decision. This  time, please, listen to your consciences and hearts. Thank you.</p>

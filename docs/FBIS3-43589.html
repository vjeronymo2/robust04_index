			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We begin this newscast with a report on a ceremony  at which New Year's wishes were presented to Mr. and Mrs.  Casimir Oye-Mba. The ceremony began at 0930 local time at the  ceremonies hall of the Intercontinental Hotel at (?Koume Palace)  and was marked by speeches from Higher Education Minister Michel  Anchouey and (Yves Oualele), secretary general at the Office of  the Prime Minister, and by Prime Minister Casimir Oye-Mba.  Moussa Mounguegui, you were present at this ceremony. Please,  summarize what transpired:    [Mounguegui] On behalf of his fellow cabinet members, the  minister of higher education praised the job done by the prime  minister as manager of Omar Bongo's presidential campaign and as  head of government, a government that ably handled the  transition period from the national conference to the  organization of presidential elections on 5 December last year.  In spite of the unfavorable social and political atmosphere,  the government did not fail in its mission. Those who compose  the adminstration are happy to work with Mr. Oye-Mba, Minister  Michel Anchouey added.    The secretary general at the Office of the Prime Minister  observed that 1993 was rich in lessons, and hoped that 1994  would be marked by new vitality. Mr. (Yves Oualele) seized the  opportunity to present to the head of government workers'  overall concerns. Beside duties, the worker also has rights.  For this reason, the secretary general at the Office of the  Prime Minister called for the setting up a higher civil service  council as soon as possible.    In his reply, the head of government acknowledged that 1993  was rich in events and lessons. For him, 1994 will enable us to  evaluate these lessons. Now that the transition period has  ended with the presidential election, deservingly won by Mr.  Omar Bongo, Mr. Casimir Oye-Mba made it a point to caution, in  his words, those who are making capital out of Mr. Bongo's  victory. To his detractors, the prime minister stated that he  was not yet finished, and that he remained cool and composed.  The head of government congratulated his cabinet and office  aides for the work they have done. To workers, the prime  minister gave the reminder that rights and duties go hand in  hand. Mr. Oye-Mba then expressed the government's intention to  resume discussions with international finance institutions. In  conclusion, he expressed the following wishes to Gabon and its  people. He was speaking to Philippe Tonda:    [Begin Bongo recording] I wish our country peace, civil  peace, without which nothing can ever be undertaken, or built.  My wish for our our country is that the political pluralism  which we have instituted lead us to democracy, because I am  among those who think that we do not really have democracy yet.  So far as I am concerned, democracy is not the constitution  that enshrines it, nor is it just the constitutional court,  which interprets that constitution, nor is it just the National  Communications Council, which regulates the audiovisual  landscape. Democracy is first and foremost accepting other men,  accepting living with other men, agreeing to live together not  only with our affinities and similarities -- and, surely, these  are legion -- but also with our differences and dissimilarities,  since this is the reality of human nature. Most fortunately in  our our country, the things that unite us are many. We are a  small country: 1 million inhabitants on an area of nearly  290,000 square km --that is really very little. Surely, you  have gone around Gabon just like me. Our country is empty in  terms of men. Now, it is men who, in reality, constitute the  primary wealth of nations. I would like here to reecho an idea  which has permeated the minds of Gabonese, and according to  which the fact of our country being so richly endowed by nature  is enough. I say that is not true. My wish as we enter 1994 is  that democracy really take root in the daily behavior of each  one of us, in our actions and in our attitudes, in our way of  reasoning and, once more -- hopefully -- in our hearts. My wish  also is that our country settle down to work and that it restore  growth. A short while ago, you mentioned the prescriptions of  the Bretton Woods institutions. I contend that we must resume  talks with the IMF and the World Bank, not because I consider  their therapies to be always correct -- not at all. In fact, I  know a thing or two about these institutions. But in the world  as it is today we have no choice -- we have no choice. So we  must resume active -- since there has never been a complete  break -- discussions with these institutions. In fact, it is  very easy to lay the blame on the Bretton Woods institutions.  But if we did not have problems, we would not be compelled to  go and see people in Washington. It is up to us to manage to  develop our potentials and manage our resources in such a way  that we never find it necessary to go and see the people in  Washington. [end recording]</p>

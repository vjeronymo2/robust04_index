			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / ANC demands end to KwaZulu 'homeland': A harder stance towards Buthelezi's poll boycott The African National Congress yesterday called on South Africa's multi-party Transitional Executive Council to take over the administration of the KwaZulu black homeland from Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, putting the ANC and the chief's Inkatha Freedom party on a collision course. The call, from Mr Jacob Zuma, ANC deputy secretary general, the highest ranking Zulu in the ANC, represents a significant hardening of the organisation's position on KwaZulu, the only one of the 10 black homelands which continues to offer political opposition to the ANC. Asked whether the ANC-dominated TEC, which oversees government in the run-up to elections, should send in troops to remove Chief Buthelezi from power, Mr Zuma replied: 'Why not?' The TEC said on Tuesday night it would take all steps to ensure free political activity in KwaZulu/Natal, where some 85 people have died since the weekend. Inkatha supporters have prevented ANC election rallies and made voter education in KwaZulu almost impossible. And Although Chief Buthelezi said last night he would allow the Independent Electoral Commission to prepare for elections in the homeland, he has given these assurances in the past without persuading his supporters to respect them. Mr Zuma said the TEC should cut off government funding to KwaZulu, which is a semi-autonomous 'self-governing territory' within South Africa but receives all of its funds from Pretoria. The ANC would tomorrow launch a campaign of mass action aimed at demonstrating that most Zulus oppose Chief Buthelezi's plan to boycott April's all-race elections. The campaign would begin with a mass march in Durban on Friday and continue with civil servants' protests. International mediation of constitutional issues would continue, he said - indeed ANC sources said yesterday Lord Carrington, former British foreign secretary, and Mr Henry Kissinger, former US secretary of state, would be asked to mediate - but results would probably not come soon enough to resolve the crisis. The ANC has successfully eliminated all opposition from other homeland governments, widely vilified as the creations of apartheid. Other governments have either been ousted as a result of popular pressure orchestrated by the ANC - Brig Oupa Gqozo was removed from power in the Ciskei homeland on Tuesday night, and President Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana was deposed 10 days ago - or thrown in their lot with the group which they expect to lead South Africa's next government. ANC officials, excited by victories in Ciskei and Bophuthatswana and angry at Chief Buthelezi's campaign to prevent elections in Natal, yesterday adopted a more belligerent tone towards KwaZulu. Said one senior official, normally a moderate: 'Buthelezi must learn the lesson of Bop (Bophuthatswana). The KwaZulu police, the youth and the civil service - the same forces which brought down the Bop government - are present in KwaZulu: the time has come for them to stand up and be counted,' he said, adding the ANC only needed 'a trigger' to provoke Buthelezi's deposition within weeks. All of the homelands, including KwaZulu, will cease to exist after elections. But ANC officials said they could not wait for the poll before removing Chief Buthelezi. Too many people were being killed in his campaign to prevent voting, they said. But KwaZulu differs greatly from the other homelands where unpopular leaders have been toppled: Chief Buthelezi commands significant support in the homeland and and he is unlikely to crumble as other homeland leaders have done. But thousands of KwaZulu police and civil servants depend for their salaries and pensions on funding from central government, which will be controlled by the ANC after April. The next few weeks will tell whether they decide to revolt, as did their counterparts in other homelands.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICAN HOMELANDS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -Transkei and Venda: nominal independence ends with election; ANC-aligned  -Ciskei and Bophuthatswana: nominally independent, now being administered jointly by Pretoria and Transitional Executive Council  -Qwaqwa; Gazankulu, KwaNdebele, Kangwane: self-governing territory, legally part of South Africa.  -Lebowa: Self-governing territory, legally part of South Africa.

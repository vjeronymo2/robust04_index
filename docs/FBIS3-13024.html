The eyewitnesses said that  at least 10 people were wounded in the clash and "scores"  arrested.    Demonstrators assembled at the Ghalu Bandak [as  transliterated] crossroads in southern Tehran near the bazaar,  shouting slogans of protest at high prices, the scarcity of food  supplies, and shortage of medicine. They also denounced  corruption. The eyewitnesses said "hundreds" took part in the  demonstration. They said that security forces surrounded the  demonstration and fired shots in the air. As a result a number  of demonstrators were wounded, while security forces arrested  "scores" of them.    The value of the Iranian riyal has dropped over the past two  months by 40 percent, causing the prices of local and imported  commodities, especially essential ones, to rise at rates  exceeding 80 percent. The soaring prices provoked a tide of  demonstrations in a number of Iranian cities.    Last Saturday Central Bank Governor Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli  blamed government economic establishments for the high prices.  Local media services said that car assembly plants belonging to  the public sector have increased the prices of their products by  30 percent in less than a month.    As is known, the Iranian regime bans media services from  broadcasting any reports about antiregime demonstrations. It  also accuses demonstrations of "being hostile to the revolution  and Islam." And the publication law considers broadcasting such  reports "collaboration with the enemies" and imposes severe  punishment for violators.</p>

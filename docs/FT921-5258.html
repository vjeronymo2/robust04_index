			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Management: Space may prove the final frontier / Investigating the intense struggles within the media buying business This is meant to be the year of EC harmonisation. It is also turning out to be the year when one of the most important, yet overlooked, aspects of marketing and advertising - the media space-buying business  - may witness some intense struggles among the biggest European players. Reports that the French company Publicis, and its partner in Europe, Foote Cone and Belding, may link with The Media Partnership (TMP) have been around for many months. TMP negotiates media-buying for a number of traditional advertising agencies which offer a full range of services, winning discounts from media owners by bulk-buying large volumes of advertising. The rumours took flight in February, when there were suggestions that Publicis-FCB Europe had signed a letter of intent to join TMP. Publicis executives this week strongly denied that but acknowledged that negotiations were 'continuing' with TMP. At the same time Publicis is also considering expanding its media-buying links with Interpublic, the US group; Publicis and Interpublic use Publi-Media Service (PMS) in France as their media-buying agency. The background to this flurry is the growing belief among the larger full-service agencies that greater, European-wide fragmentation of the forms and outlets of media, in conjunction with increased concentration of media ownership, requires an equal concentration of media-buying in order to ensure the best prices. Media owners might be controlling bigger empires; but audiences and readerships are becoming more specialised. There has been an explosion of European media outlets in the last 20 years. In 1980 there were no satellite television channels; in 1990 there were 82. The number of radio stations has more than doubled (to 5,820); consumer magazine titles have increased from 5,400 to 8,240; terrestrial television channels have grown from 15 to 38. That development offers opportunities for media space-buyers to haggle over volume prices. As the number of media outlets seeking advertising revenue has soared, and the general recession has forced collapses in advertising spending, the jam is being spread more thinly. Hence the current interest in forming 'media-buying clubs' such as TMP and PMS, which exist solely to negotiate discounts on volume advertising expenditure. Media buying is a complex business. But in terms of its impact on advertising spending budgets, it vital particularly in a recession. On average, advertisers spend 15 per cent of their advertising budget on creative work and 85 per cent on the space for their commercials, be they placed in newspapers, television or radio. Advertisers have already managed to squeeze down the traditional 15 per cent commission on advertising budgets they pay for creative work; attacks on the space-buying front are now the order of the day. That is especially true in France, where Carat (part of Aegis), PMS, TMP and Eurocom together account for almost 80 per cent of all media-buying activities. TMP is but one 'buying club' among several; their sole rationale is to negotiate better deals for full-service advertising agencies on the basis of volume. In France today, discounts on the standard advertising rate card of up to 50 per cent can be wrung from some of the weaker media, such as radio. There is a growing belief among media-buying agencies that the French model will spread to the rest of Europe sooner or later. This is not welcomed by either media owners or media space-buyers, who fear that a valuable product  -advertising space - is rapidly being turned into a commodity where price will be the only determining factor. Some advertisers, however, may welcome such a move; it will force down the cost of advertising, albeit at the risk of lessening their control as to where and when their commercials run. It is easy to see which way the wind is blowing; specialist space-buyers and 'buying clubs' accounted for just 11 per cent of all advertising buying in Europe in 1980; by 1990 that had jumped to 47 per cent. The losers were the conventional 'full-service' advertising agencies. Of specialist space-buyers, Carat is dominant in Europe, with 1991 billings of Dollars 5.2bn. Optimedia, the media-buying wing of Publicis, came 7th with billings of some Dollars 1.2bn; TMP was fourth with some Dollars 1.4bn; PMS registered some Dollars 1.3bn. Were Publicis (through PMS and Optimedia) to join TMP, the new group could leap-frog into second place, still significantly behind Carat but displacing another powerful media-buying company, Zenith (part of the Saatchi group). The big guns are being rolled into position; but howitzers are cumbersome and heavy - it may be a considerable time before Publicis makes up its mind who will be its best partner, if at all.</p>

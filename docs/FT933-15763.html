			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ropner makes Pounds 4.1m buy ROPNER is buying DAC for approximately Pounds 4.1m cash from Rolls-Royce's Northern Engineering Industries subsidiary. The consideration will be adjusted depending on net asset value on completion date. Ropner, with interests in engineering, property and shipping, warned that it continued to face difficult trading conditions and saw no reason for expressing great optimism during the present year. DAC, based in Burton-on Trent, supplies communications systems. In 1992 operating profits were Pounds 654,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.6m.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL TORN BETWEEN HIGH-RISES;  </P> <P> CITY HALL: POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PREVENTS ABBE WOLFSHEIMER FROM CASTING  TIE-BREAKING VOTE.  </P> <P> If the nine-member San Diego City Council were writing a book, it might be  called "A Tale of Two High-Rises." Only trouble is, the council keeps adding  chapters but can't agree on an ending.  </P> <P> Four members favor the Huntington, a 36-story, $91-million luxury condominium  project proposed by the Koll Co. and Davidson Communities Inc. for the  southwest corner of Broadway and State Street, a prime piece of city-owned land  surrounded by the towers of downtown's resurgence.  </P> <P> Four others prefer Huntington's competitor, a 30-story, $44-million high-rent  apartment building called simply 900 State Street and proposed by A. J. Lirot  of El Dorado Asset Management and his partner, Trammell Crow Co.  </P> <P> Try as it might for the past few months, the City Council has been unable to  reach a majority decision. The council failed again Tuesday, deadlocking 4 to 4  on separate votes for each project. On the side of the Huntington were Ron  Roberts, Gloria McColl, Bruce Henderson and Ed Struiksma. Backing 900 State  Street were Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Bob Filner, Wes Pratt and Judy McCarty.  </P> <P> Another vote is scheduled in three weeks, when, according to the mayor,  Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer will be available to cast the tie-breaking vote.  </P> <P> But Wolfsheimer's chief aide says the councilwoman has no intention of voting.  Wolfsheimer, who owns a Marina Park condominium near the contested property,  believes that such a vote might constitute a conflict-of-interest violation of  the state Political Reform Act.  </P> <P> "They can't depend on her. This has to be resolved by negotiations among the  eight of them," said Wolfsheimer's aide, Joanne Johnson. She added that an  outside legal opinion may not be available until December or January.  </P> <P> Johnson said Wolfsheimer is unsatisfied with the conflict-of-interest analysis  provided by City Atty. John Witt and the financial analysis provided by City  Manager John Lockwood, who concluded that, by voting for one of the high-rises,  the councilwoman would not sufficiently increase the value of her condominium  to create a conflict of interest.  </P> <P> The City Council's discussion after the tie vote indicated that they assumed  Wolfsheimer was close to receiving an opinion from a private attorney. But  Johnson said Wolfsheimer has not hired an attorney and has no plans to do so.  Instead, she said, the councilwoman will probably rely on advice from the state  Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer left council chambers during the high-rise debate, her absence  particularly noticeable because, unlike her colleagues, she was dressed for  Halloween in a "Hairy Sterling" outfit consisting of a judge's robe on which  knives, forks and spoons were taped. Her head was covered with a cotton-white  fright wig.  </P> <P> The council again discussed the merits of the proposed buildings -- from height  and design to street-level accommodations -- and the city's potential financial  windfall.  </P> <P> "What you have are two very good projects," said City Architect Mike Stepner,  telling the council: "It's a judgment call."  </P> <P> Attorney James Milch, representing the developers of the $130-million, 30-story  Emerald Shapery Center under construction across Broadway from the high-rise  site, described the 470-foot-tall Huntington as massive and bulky, calling it a  "monolithic wall" that would block Emerald Shapery's southern views. He called  on the council to approve 900 State Street, a more slender and shorter edifice  at 400 feet.  </P> <P> The mayor said that, if the deadlock continues, the city should "go back to  square one."  </P> <P> Such a prospect is disquieting to Pam Hamilton, head of Centre City Development  Corp., the agency in charge of downtown redevelopment that reviewed the  projects before recommending the Huntington. However, the agency's board also  told the council that, if the Huntington was rejected, it approves of 900 State  Street.  </P> <P> Hamilton said after the council meeting that she hopes the council will realize  that going with its second choice is better than starting the bidding process  again.  </P></p>

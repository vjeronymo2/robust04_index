			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on lottery funds A LABOUR MP warned yesterday that the National Lottery may not be as successful financially as ministers are assuming. Mr Joe Ashton, MP for Bassetlaw, told Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, that the numbers 'just don't add up'. Mr Ashton, speaking at a national heritage committee hearing, said that suggestions of a Pounds 1.5bn turnover with prize money of about Pounds 14m a week looked 'phenomenally optimistic.' Apart from high start-up costs, it might be possible to equip only 10,000 retail outlets with the necessary computers in the first year. Smaller shops and pubs would have to sell thousands of tickets to meet such a target. Mr Brooke said the Pounds 1.5bn figure had been illustrative. If that turned out to be the turnover, then prize money of Pounds 14m a week would be possible, because the payouts of many lotteries around the world varied from 48 per cent to 52 per cent of revenue, he said. A number of MPs also expressed concern yesterday at the effect the lottery might have on the football pools and in particular their requests for 'a level playing field'. Although he repeated previous statements that the government would keep an open mind as the National Lottery bill went through parliament, Mr Brooke did not appear to hold out much hope on the main changes the pools companies are asking for. Mr Brooke said that if the government started adjusting, that might damage the lottery's chances of success. If pools companies were allowed to advertise on television the government 'would receive pressure that all gambling should be allowed to advertise.</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KINNEY CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> What -- This is the only national championship event in high school sports. It  is the culmination of four regional qualifying meets.  </P> <P> The top eight boys and girls from those regionals will run a 5,000-meter course  in the finals.  </P> <P> Where -- Balboa Park's Morley Field will be the race site for the 10th  consecutive year. The course is considered among the nation's most challenging.  </P> <P> When -- The girls' race begins today at 10 a.m. and the boys' race will start  at 10:45.  </P> <P> Who -- Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande, third place last year and the first  underclassmen to finish, is expected to have little competition in the boys'  race. Already this year he has won the Stanford Invitational (14:47), the  Virginia Invitational (15:26) and the Clovis Invitational in Fresno (14:56).  His times at Stanford and Virginia set course records. The two favorites in the  girls' race -- Melody Fairchild of Boulder, Colo., and Deena Drossin of of  Agoura -- should duel for the title. Fairchild is attempting to become the  second person to win two consecutive championships. Erin Keogh managed the feat  in 1985-86. Fairchild recently won the Colorado State championships by two  minutes and 30 seconds. Drossin of Agoura finished the West regional at 17:07,  the fastest time in any regional. Fairchild clocked a 17:08 in the Midwest  regional. Don't be fooled by Drossin's superior time, however. All courses are  different and Fairchild has not lost a cross-country or track race since May  1989. Fallbrook's Milena Glusac, a sophomore, is the only San Diego-area  entrant. She finished third in the West regionals (17:25) and may have an  advantage, having run at Morley Field in Section championships for two years.  </P></p>

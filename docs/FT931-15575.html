			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CSI withdraws from double glazing Cannon Street Investments is withdrawing from the double glazing segment of its operations. For the year to December 31 1991 these activities incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.3m. The directors believe that losses from this source for the 12 months to January 3 1993 will be 'significantly' higher than 1991's. Olivers Windows, the group's principal double glazing business, is calling for the appointment of a liquidator and the boards of the other double glazing offshoots have each requested that a receiver be appointed.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHAT THE ORIGINAL STARS SAY  </P> <P> TED SHACKELFORD  </P> <P> "We are this quiet little show that keeps getting better," said Shackelford,  who plays Gary Ewing. "There is a very loyal staunch audience. People have  'Knots Landing' parties. I think the audience likes the characters."  </P> <P> Especially Gary and Val. Fans, he said, are eager to see the couple get back  together. This season, Gary came to Val's side when she learned the truth about  Danny. "We are getting closer," Shackelford said, laughing. "But if we got back  together, neither one of us will have a job."  </P> <P> Shackelford's willing to play Gary for as long as "Knots" is on the air. "I  don't want to write, produce or direct," he said. "I am too old and I make too  much money. The show has been real good to me. You will never hear me say  anything bad publicly about the show. I am delighted to be working. You can't  ask for better working conditions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> JOAN VAN ARK  </P> <P> "We are the darling of the network," said Van Ark, who plays Val. "We are right  there delivering week after week. It's really quite amazing and deserves more  attention."  </P> <P> Van Ark gives most of the credit for the series' success to executive producer  and creator David Jacobs. "I equate the show with an elite sports team like the  Lakers. Each person in the ensemble has a position they play. The quarterback  changes, but each player knows its game. It's a true ensemble effort. It's  composed of players who have a position and know their position. The coach is  David Jacobs."  </P> <P> Though she said the show's fans in New York and Los Angeles usually leave her  alone, Van Ark is constantly recognized when she visits other areas of the  country. "People hit on you like crazy," she said. "They do come up and talk to  you. A lot of what they talk about is about Gary and Val. People appreciate  Val."  </P> <P> And how long will she stay with the show? "Well," said Van Ark, coyly. "I think  I will pass on that question."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MICHELE LEE  </P> <P> Lee agrees with her co-stars that it's their characters that keep the audience  tied to "Knots." "Our characters have histories and back stories," said the  actress. "There is also a sense of future. They are three-dimensional and are  honest and decent."  </P> <P> But it's getting more difficult for Lee to do the show. "It's harder to make  realistic and believable stories and make them interesting," she said. "You  fight to keep it interesting for yourself and the show. I find myself having  less fun in that area. I think the reason Joan and I get so obsessive about the  show and our characters is that we care deeply about what's going on in the  screen. I think it's possible to bend and squeeze yourself into a situation. I  try to do that, but there have been moments when I have been opposed to a  situation that goes against the grain of my character. We have dropped the  storyline."  </P> <P> Last season, Lee was allowed to direct an episode of "Knots"; she's also  directed two more this year and hopefully will do more next season. "I had been  interested in directing before TKnots,"U she said. "It's one of the reasons I  still want to be on TKnots.' You can love a character to death, but you can do  it so many years and then you need other things."  </P></p>

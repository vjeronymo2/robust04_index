			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: BES replacement extends to non-resident investors  -Enterprise scheme The government yesterday unveiled details of its proposed Enterprise Investment Scheme, to replace the Business Expansion Scheme. The main features are relief at the lower rate of income tax (20 per cent) on investments of up to Pounds 100,000 a year, capital gains tax exemption on the first disposal of shares on which relief has not been withdrawn and relief against either income tax or capital gains tax for a loss on the first disposal of shares on which the original relief has not been withdrawn. An investor can become a paid director and still qualify for relief if he or she was not connected with the company or its trade at any time before the eligible shares were issued. There will be a limit of Pounds 1m on the amount a company can raise in a year on which relief will be given. The new scheme will incorporate a number of the features of the BES Eligible shares in a qualifying company must be held for at least five years Relief on up to half the amount an individual invests between April 6 and October 5 in any year can be carried back to the previous tax year, subject to a maximum of Pounds 15,000; Qualifying investors are individuals who are not connected with the company (employees and shareholders with more than 30 per cent of the shares) during a specified period; Qualifying companies are unquoted trading companies which carry on a qualifying activity for a minimum of three years A special limit of Pounds 5m a year on the amount which a company engaged in certain shipping activities can raise in a year on which relief will be given. The new scheme will extend to companies trading in the UK whether or not they are incorporated and resident in the UK and to investors liable to UK income tax whether or not they are resident in the UK. The BES is available only for companies that are incorporated and resident in the UK and for investors resident in the UK. A limit of Pounds 40,000 will apply for 1993-94 to an individual's combined investment under the BES and the Enterprise Investment Scheme, with the new limit of Pounds 100,000 applying from 1994-95. The Exchequer cost of the Enterprise Investment Scheme will depend on the take-up and the success of the investments made. Estimated costs are put at Pounds 10m in 1994-95, Pounds 35m in 1995-96, and Pounds 50m in 1996-97.</p>

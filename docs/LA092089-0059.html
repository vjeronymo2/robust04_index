			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MGM GRAND PLANS HOLLYWOOD THEME PARK IN LAS VEGAS  </P> <P> With the ink scarcely dry on Kirk Kerkorian's deal to sell his 82%-controlled  MGM/UA Communications Co., the financier announced that his 98%-owned MGM Grand  Inc. plans to build a movie theme park and new hotel in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The news sent a ripple through Hollywood, because two larger entertainment  companies -- Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc. -- have committed over $1 billion to  similarly themed attractions in central Florida, with talk of competing in  Europe as well.  </P> <P> To further complicate matters, the MGM name already appears on the Disney tour  in Florida, under a 4-year-old agreement that was unsuccessfully challenged by  MGM/UA last year in California state court. While that decision is on appeal,  MGM Grand disclosed Tuesday that it has sued Disney in a Nevada state court to  establish its right to use the MGM Grand name on theme parks.  </P> <P> At least one analyst expressed skepticism that Kerkorian is firmly committed to  the theme park undertaking. "Kirk's a very bright guy," the analyst said,  speaking on the condition that he not be identified. "He does things like this  constantly. He throws things out just to see what the reaction is."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Desert Inn  </P> <P> No immediate reaction could be registered on Wall Street, however, since the  announcement was made after the close of the stock markets. MGM Grand, which is  traded over the counter, ended the day at $17 a share, with no change in price.  </P> <P> MGM Grand, organized three years ago, launched a posh airline offering service  between New York and Los Angeles in 1987 and bought the Desert Inn the  following year, along with adjacent undeveloped property in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The company announced Tuesday that it has agreed to pay $28 million for 143  acres of land on the Desert Inn site, which it presently leases, to provide a  possible site for the 4,000-room hotel and entertainment complex.  </P> <P> MGM Grand has previously disclosed plans to raise about $120 million in a stock  offering which would reduce Kerkorian's stake in the company to about 77%. The  company intends to proceed with that offering once it clears the Securities and  Exchange Commission, MGM Grand Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Benninger said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Benninger acknowledged that the company has not yet drawn up plans for its  entertainment complex, and he said the company has not enlisted a partner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Seems Like Lunacy'  </P> <P> But a source at MCA said that company has engaged in preliminary discussions  with Kerkorian about "possible participation" in the venture.  </P> <P> Analysts were divided about a movie tour's chances of success in  gambling-oriented Las Vegas. "There's desert all around. There's no (large)  population base. That seems like lunacy," one entertainment industry analyst  declared privately.  </P> <P> But Harold Vogel, Merrill Lynch's veteran analyst, said: "Vegas has been  evolving to a more family-oriented business, and this, I think, is a natural  extension of the destination resort concept. I think a lot of people bring  their family and don't know what to do with their family while they go while  they go gambling."  </P> <P> (Vogel noted that Merrill Lynch has served as Kerkorian's adviser, so he  declined to talk about MGM Grand's specific plan.)  </P> <P> With Kerkorian's agreement last Friday to sell MGM/UA Communications to the  Australian Qintex Group for $1.5 billion, the 72-year-old financier appeared  ready to relinquish his 20-year-old hold on the beloved MGM name and logo. At  the time, however, the buyer and seller agreed that MGM Grand would enjoy  certain licensing rights to the MGM Grand name.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Lawsuit Seen  </P> <P> In its California lawsuit, MGM/UA argued that Disney had no right to use the  name on its movie and television production facility in Florida, which opened  months before the actual tour. MGM/UA also opposed the construction of hotels  adjacent to the Disney tour, arguing -- again unsuccessfully -- that MGM Grand  has exclusive rights to the MGM name on hotels. The decision has been appealed,  said Skip Miller, the Los Angeles attorney who is handling both the California  and Nevada cases for Kerkorian.  </P> <P> No lawsuit over the theme park name is anticipated by Qintex, according to  Kevin Wallace, Qintex America's chief financial officer. "We've worked out a  special agreement (for) the use of the MGM Grand name and the stylized lion  logo, which is a different lion (from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lion familiar to  movie-goers) . . . for use in the theme parks and hotels," Wallace said.  </P></p>

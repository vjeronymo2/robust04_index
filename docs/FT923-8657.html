			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Benefits system to be streamlined MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, is to launch a 'one-stop' benefit system today aimed at cutting costs and providing a more user-friendly service. The object is to enable claimants to apply for a range of benefits in the same place. It is also designed to make it more difficult to defraud the system - fraud costs the department millions of pounds a year. Mr Lilley has also been considering allowing the Benefits Agency staff to offer clear advice on which benefits to claim to ensure that maximum entitlements are known to the claimants. At present, claimants have to fill out different forms for different benefits, often repeatedly having to give the same details.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG)--U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) chief for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said  on Wednesday that he had agreed with Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic that "the current crisis in Gorazde should be used as  a chance to secure a lasting peace and ceasefire in the entire  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Asked about his current contacts with the Bosnian Serb  leadership, who suspended all links with UNPROFOR after the NATO  air attacks on Serb positions near Gorazde (Moslem enclave in  southeast Bosnia), Akashi said he had received assurances from  Milosevic that he can continue the talks with the Bosnian Serb  leaders.    "I intend to fly to Sarajevo to resume the talks regarding  the ceasefire and peace, not only in connection to Gorazde but  also linked to all other situations and I am very satisfied by  such prospects," Akashi said.    He described the hour-and-a-half meeting with the Serbian  president, held on Wednesday morning, as "very useful and  productive."    "I appreciate his understanding of the complexity and  urgency  of these issues," Akashi said.    Commenting on the possibility of additional air strikes  against the Bosnian Serbs, Akashi underscored his hope that the  situation would not deteriorate to such an extent to force  UNPROFOR to defend itself and the staff of humanitarian  organizations with the minimum of weapons.    U.S. NATO jets on April 10-11 bombed Bosnian Serb positions  near Gorazde, a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been  demilitarized. It served as the starting point for a  10,000-strong Moslem offensive in late March on Serb  territories. After a strong Serb counter attack, which  threatened to defeat the Moslems, the United Nations called for  NATO air strikes on Serb positions allegedly to protect U.N.  observers in Gorazde.    At last Saturday's negotiations with the Moslems, the  Bosnian  Serbs proposed a ceasefire in the entire Bosnian territory, but  the Moslems rejected this suggesting a partial ceasefire and  focusing only on the issue of Gorazde.</p>

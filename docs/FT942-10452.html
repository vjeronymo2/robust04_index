			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (1): An African test case for good government - In spite of the legalisation of opposition parties and the implementation of economic reforms, Kenya is still very much on probation Kenya has undergone such radical changes in the 1990s that the image which it presents to the world is often discordant and confused. The one-party state legalised the opposition and contested elections in 1992, while arguing it did not believe in democracy. President Daniel arap Moi rebelled against the dictates of the International Monetary Fund last year, and then implemented a comprehensive set of economic reforms which have won plaudits from local and foreign investors. A new team at the treasury is attempting to stem the misuse of public funds, but the culprits remain politically powerful and above the law. The Kenyan government shelters hundreds of thousands of refugees from conflict in neighbouring countries, but tolerates the practice of ethnic cleansing in its own backyard. It is not always easy to decipher these conflicting signals, in part because the international community's relations with Kenya have also changed. More than any other country in Africa, Kenya is being held as a test case for new donor policies linking aid to good government. Since November 1991, when the World Bank, IMF and donor governments decided to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of financial assistance as a protest against mounting corruption and against Kenya's political and economic failings, this lapsed African role model has been on probation. The aid freeze proved to be the catalyst for much of the change that ensued. A few days after the landmark donor meeting in Paris, President Moi legalised opposition parties. In the elections which followed in December 1992, President Moi and his Kenya African National Union (Kanu) party defeated a divided opposition. The elections, however, failed to deliver the promise of democracy. Kanu retains an absolute grip on power, which it wields arbitrarily. Since the advent of the new multi-party era, police have developed a worrying fondness for arresting and harassing opposition members of parliament. Twenty-five MPs - almost a third of the opposition force - have been inside Kenyan jails in the past year. Their most frequent offence has been to hold meetings in their constituencies in defiance of police bans. Kenya's lively and independent press is also under attack for reporting on ethnic clashes in the populous Rift Valley - a highly sensitive conflict pitting President Moi's Kalenjin clan and other pastoral tribes against Kikuyu settlers, the largest ethnic group in Kenya. The clashes have caused 1,500 deaths and displaced 300,000 people since 1991, according to church and human rights groups. The government, meanwhile, is trying to impose a blackout on news about the troubled region by charging reporters with subversion. The government blames Kenya's recent social turmoil on the multi-party system it adopted under duress. President Moi, a reluctant convert to democracy, believes western-style political parties cannot work in Africa because of their tendency to fragment on tribal lines. But whereas the new political scenario in Kenya has thrown the tribal factor into greater relief, the fissures were already evident under one-party rule. Since 1978, President Moi has governed with a coalition of minority Rift Valley tribes, who resented Kikuyu domination under the late Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's first president, and fear a revival of Kikuyu power. While tribal arithmetic and mistrust have prevented genuine political dialogue between government and opposition, the arithmetic of dwindling aid dollars has made talking with Kenya's distrustful donors an absolute imperative. Kenyan officials are reluctant to spell out the cost of the two-year aid freeze but it can be measured by the slump in economic growth, the decline in per capita incomes and in the collapse of social services. During the first year of the aid freeze, Kenya recorded its lowest growth rate since independence: a meagre 0.4 per cent in 1992. The economy remained stagnant in 1993, while the government ran up Dollars 700m in arrears on its external debt repayments. Unemployment affects 27 per cent of the urban population. In Kenya's state hospitals, operating theatres lie idle because of the lack of essential drugs and surgical equipment. Children are being denied education because parents cannot afford school fees. Roads, railways, power and water systems have fallen into disrepair. In addition, the run up to the December 1992 elections saw some very curious financial transactions thought to have benefited some who were uncertain of their political future. New domestic banks were licensed to finance the campaigns of Kanu politicians. Large quantities of gold and diamonds were allegedly exported in order to qualify for generous government rebates. Financial irregularities multiplied after the elections, involving the Central Bank in the provision of billions of shillings of unsecured loans to 'political banks'. By the time Mr Musalia Mudavadi, appointed finance minister in January 1993, was able to stop the rot, the cost to the exchequer had been estimated by independent auditors at Ks30bn (Dollars 430m), or approximately 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. It was the biggest sum to go missing from public funds in Kenya's history. Heads rolled at the Central Bank, but, to date, no-one has been charged with financial wrongdoing. The enormity of the financial losses, however, appears to have jolted Kenya's decision makers to their senses. A rapprochement was sought with the World Bank and IMF. A new governor, Mr Micah Cheserem, was appointed to the Central Bank. By mid-1993, Kenya was back on a serious reform track. Mr Cheserem, a former senior accountant with Unilever, concentrated on tightening banking regulations and supervision. At the Treasury, Mr Mudavadi worked on the most rapid deregulation of an economy Africa has ever seen. Import licences were scrapped. The Kenya shilling was devalued and then floated. Exporters were allowed to keep their foreign exchange earnings. Restrictions on the repatriation of profits and dividends were lifted. All price controls, with the exception of petroleum products, were abolished. The government opened to private traders the import and marketing of maize, Kenya's staple foodstuff. The private sector, long suffocated by government controls, is feeling rather giddy in the newly liberalised environment. Exports responded to the devaluation of the shilling, surging by 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn. Local manufacturers no longer have to queue and bribe to obtain import licences and rationed foreign exchange. A majority of multinationals polled by the East Africa Association are planning significant new investments. The reforms have won Mr Mudavadi and Mr Cheserem a devoted following among Nairobi bankers and businessmen. In November 1993, Kenya's dynamic duo were rewarded with the restoration of fast-disbursing balance of payments aid and encouraging words of support from a less sceptical donor community. Inside government, however, Mr Mudavadi is battling a formidable coalition of opponents of reform, who resent the loss of patronage implicit in the finance minister's agenda. So far, Mr Mudavadi has stayed the course, thanks to President Moi's backing and the absence of any credible alternative economic policy, but his security of tenure is not guaranteed. Neither is success as he prepares to tackle the daunting problems of a chronic budget deficit and parastatal reform. Donors worry that the finance minister's plans may be over-ambitious. Neither inflation, running at an annualised rate of 50 per cent, nor government expenditures are under control. The cost of servicing the government's ballooning domestic debt leaves little room for investment in Kenya's dilapidated social services. Few of the 400,000 school-leavers this year will find jobs. And yet, with elections not due for almost four years, there is hope that Mr Mudavadi, backed by a strengthened private sector, may be given the chance to put Kenya back on to the growth fast-track. Perhaps a modern civic society will also be allowed to emerge as a generation of political leaders, whose authoritarian instincts date back to the struggle for independence, finally retire.</p>

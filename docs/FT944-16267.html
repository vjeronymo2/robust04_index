			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Government puts chips on the menu for everyone - The smart-card technology which could be applied to Tory plans to introduce identity cards - if the cost hurdle can be overcome The mention of identity cards is guaranteed to raise hackles in a Britain acutely conscious of threats to civil liberties. So Shell UK's plan, announced this month, to replace fuel tokens and trading stamps with 'smart' cards may give government plans to introduce identity cards an unexpected boost by making the public familiar with a technology which has so far failed to find much favour. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was clearly referring to smart-card technology when yesterday he talked about an identity card capable of being a bank card, driving licence, social security card and kidney donor card. He could, of course, have been talking about a paper document. But without the security against fraud afforded by electronic technology it is hard to see where the advantage in paper would lie. Since its invention in the late 1970s the smart card - a piece of plastic the size of a bank card with an electronic circuit embedded in it - has been acknowledged as prime candidate for a host of applications - identity card, security device, electronic purse and information storage. Pioneered by the French, whose trials of the card as an electronic purse proved the feasibility of the technology on a large scale, it has found applications from transport systems to satellite television and public telephones. Mastercard and Visa, the international payment groups, have said that they intend to move to smart-card technology. There are about 300m smart cards in circulation, and the number is expected to increase to 3bn within the decade. Last year, according to Retail Banking Research, about 14bn transactions were made with cards capable of being 'charged' with cash in advance. The advantage smart cards have over conventional bank cards is the ability to store and process large amounts of information while remaining completely secure. The magnetic stripes on conventional cards are easy to obtain and data can be written on the stripe using equipment not much more sophisticated than a domestic tape recorder. Smart cards contain memory and microprocessor chips which are hard to counterfeit. They can store codes and carry out complex calculations which render them tamper-proof. And they can hold, in computer language, some physical characteristics of the card-holder - a fingerprint, for example, or the pattern in the retina of the eye. Together these can be used to guarantee that a card is genuine and that the cardholder is who he or she claims to be. It can also hold extensive information about the holder - medical history, for example, or bank statement. The sticking point - and one reason why banks have not already replaced magnetic-stripe cards with electronic cheque books - is cost. Magnetic-stripe cards cost almost nothing - about 10p each in bulk. Smart cards are expensive. The most common types of smart card - representing about 90 per cent of those in issue - have little processing but extensive storage capabilities. Mr Bernard Brooks, managing director of GPT Card Technology, which manufactures 30m of these memory cards each year, said the cost in bulk was about 50p. True smart cards containing both memory and microprocessor can cost between Pounds 5 and Pounds 20 each. They are manufactured in comparatively small numbers by a handful of manufacturers worldwide. The terminals used to read them vary in price from Pounds 800 for a system robust enough for street use to Pounds 150 for a desktop box in a secure environment. Memory cards which are adequate for use in payphones, in unscrambling encrypted satellite video films and in storing motorists' petrol points in Shell's scheme are not secure enough to be used as electronic wallets or multipurpose identity cards. These applications require a true smart card with a complete computer embedded in it. Mondex, an electronic purse which National Westminster Bank, Midland Bank and British Telecommunications intend to test next year, uses Japanese-made computer chips. Some manufacturers are looking for ways to cut the cost by combining magnetic technology with microelectronics. Thorn EMI has developed a smart card which does away with expensive data encryption on the chip in favour of a development of its 'watermark' technology which makes cards hard to tamper with. Dr David Arnold of Thorn's Transaction Group said the cost of the chip could be cut significantly by minimising its size. Advanced Risc Machines, the UK-based microprocessor company owned by Acorn, Apple of the US and VLSI, is talking to Gemplus of France, Europe's biggest smart-card manufacturer, with a view to using low-cost, low-power processors in smart cards.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 158m repaid to parent by O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Hldgs O&amp;Y CANARY Wharf Hold-ings, the developer of the Pounds 3bn office complex in London's Docklands, repaid Pounds 158m of its share capital to its Canadian parent in November 1990, according to newly published accounts. The repayment was the main cause of the net assets fall to Pounds 571.7m (Pounds 751m) in the year to October 1991. O&amp;Y did not comment on the repayment, other than saying that money was transferred back and forth to the parent company as required. A City banker said that it was O&amp;Y's practice to fund the early phases of a development from its own resources before raising long-term debt and repaying some of the parent company's equity. There are also tax advantages in transferring equity rather than debt between a parent company and a subsidiary. O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings made a Pounds 21.1m loss in the year. O&amp;Y said that the loss for the year was 'wholly attributable' to its accounting policy of charging interest to the profit and loss account, rather than capitalising it. Interest costs of Pounds 123.7m and administrative costs of Pounds 16.6m were offset by interest receivable of Pounds 67.1m and gross profits of Pounds 52.1m. The profits were due to Pounds 1.6m of rental income and a Pounds 54.5m sale and leaseback deal with Credit Suisse First Boston. O&amp;Y Canary Wharf Holdings' gearing stood at 132 per cent at the year-end. During the year, O&amp;Y refinanced nearly Pounds 1bn of short-term debt. It arranged Pounds 501m of bank loans which are repayable within two to five years and Pounds 90m of loans repayable after five years. Some Pounds 100m of loans are unsecured but all the loans are guaranteed by the ultimate parent company. Its cash balance was reduced from Pounds 921m to Pounds 54.1m during the year. The position of O&amp;Y's parent company remains unclear, as its finances are kept entirely private. However, it has been affected by the downturn in North American property markets and the difficulty of obtaining bank financing for projects, as well as the demands of Canary Wharf.</p>

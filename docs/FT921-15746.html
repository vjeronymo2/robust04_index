			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): AEU signals move towards white-collar recruitment A RECRUITMENT battle for white-collar staff and technicians in the engineering industry could erupt if the merger between the AEU engineering union and the EETPU electricians' union goes ahead later this year. Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said yesterday that the EETPU had a 'viable, successful white-collar section'. The AEU has not traditionally recruited in the white-collar area which is dominated by the MSF general technical union. The merger is likely to form the basis of an AEU attempt to win recognition rights in the white-collar area from the Engineering Employers' Federation. The merger proposals are going to a ballot of the members of both unions between February 17 and March 2. The result is expected on March 4. Mr Laird also said yesterday that single-union deals between employers and either the AEU or the EETPU will not be nullified by the merger. 'The single-union deals will remain exactly as they are, but if they need to be renegotiated it will be with the merged union,' said Mr Laird. Initially the two unions will remain quasi-autonomous sections, with their own rule books. The biggest obstacle to a fuller merger is the fact that the AEU elects officials while the EETPU appoints them. In the longer term, the EETPU rules are likely to prevail. AEU elections for officials have recently attracted turn outs of less than 20 per cent. The AEU yesterday published the results of a poll of members' attitudes to the merger. Of 3,000 members polled at random, 24 per cent responded. Those who said they would vote for a merger made up 49 per cent, with only 12 per cent saying they would vote against and 39 per cent undecided. Nearly 60 per cent of respondents said they expected to be worse off this year compared with last year.</p>

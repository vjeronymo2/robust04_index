			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pro-European Conservatives seek advantage THE Euro-enthusiasts in the Tory ranks sought to seize the initiative in the debate about Maastricht yesterday by publishing a pamphlet calling for a positive approach to European union. In a foreword to the paper - launched to mark Europe Day - Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said that the Tories needed to show the British people that membership of the European Community brings 'solid advantages and opportunities'. He warns that the Conservatives need to start work both for next year's elections to the European parliament and for the next EC inter-governmental conference in 1996. 'It is time to lift our eyes from the trenches,' he said. The paper warns that the Tory party risks paying a heavy price in terms of a poor performance in the Euro-elections, a loss of influence within the community, and a fatally weakened campaign in the next general election if it fails to unite around a positive message. While ministers are likely to welcome the positive support for ratification, other aspects of the paper, by Mr Ian Taylor, vice-chairman of the Conservative Group for Europe, are likely to add to the government's difficulties by highlighting splits within the party. Underlining the government's commitment to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr Taylor urges ministers to put forward a plan to make the ERM work, instead of merely talking about 'fault lines'. 'We are committed to the goal of economic and monetary union - so let us come up with a way of getting there rather than implying that the Maastricht timetable will not work,' he says. Although this is one of the few weeks that the debate Maastricht is not dominating events in the Commons, the divisions within the party are as marked as ever in the run-up to the final Commons debate on the Maastricht bill after the second Danish referendum, which takes place next week. Tomorrow the Tory Euro-sceptics will once again put their side of the case when the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward publishes a compilation of Euro-sceptic arguments from the detailed committee stage debate on the Maastricht bill, with a foreword written by Mr John Biffen, the former cabinet minister.</p>

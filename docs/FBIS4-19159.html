			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Making Tirana See Reason..."] </F>   [Text] The extreme measure of expelling the Greek consul  from Gjirokaster under the pretext of a suspicious incident that  took place last Sunday [10 April] clearly shows the intention of  Tirana to exploit the sad event internationally and to attribute  full responsibility to the Greek side.    In other words, Berisha's reaction is not defensive but  clearly aggressive. It's aim is to rally and incite the  fanaticism of the Muslims in his country and in the other Balkan  areas where his fellow nationals live as a minority. The  Albanian leader has not concealed his intentions to link what he  calls the "Albanian issue" to the problem of the former  Yugoslavia. It is for this reason that he looks forward to  (instead of wishing against it, as the whole world does) the  expansion of obscurity and unrest in Kosovo, Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], and other areas where  there are Muslims and Albanian-speaking minorities.    For many months now the Berisha regime, without even the  pretext of last Sunday's incident, has insisted on portraying  the country as directly threatened by Serbia and Greece. The  goal of Tirana's tactics was to ensure the strongest possible  support from the United States and West European countries by  being in the position of a weak and threatened state. At the  same time, the Berisha regime apparently believed that it was  securing an alibi for its future moves and "reactions" in  pursuing a solution to the "Albanian issue."    So, last Sunday's incident was so opportune and helpful to  the Albanian plans as to be suspicious, possibly incriminating  those who hasten to exploit it in a relentless and extremist  manner.    Our country has maintained a stance toward Albanian and  Berisha's provocations that exceeds the limits of tolerance and  has already entered the field of an unjustified and obviously  unequal retreat. In addition to the moral, material, and  economic assistance we have granted the Berisha regime, the  Greek people are currently hosting almost all the unemployed  Albanians who entered the country illegally. The Greek people  are also being hit by an unprecedented crime wave that also  comes from our neighboring statelet...    All these things are being pointed out not to highlight our  country's strength or to threaten reprisals against the Berisha  regime, they are merely designed to make Tirana see reason and,  of course, warn that the Hellenism of North Epirus is not being  offered as a victim of pressure and blackmail. Its rights are  safeguarded internationally and the guarantor for these rights  is, naturally and primarily, the national metropolis of the  Greek minority...</p>

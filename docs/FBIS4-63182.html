			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under "In the Government" rubric: </F> "Danger of Pressure From Lobby Groups"]    [Text] For the few months it has been in power Viktor  Chernomyrdin's government has managed to achieve a positive  result as regards curbing inflation, but there is a danger that  the cabinet, under pressure from agrarian and  military-industrial complex lobby groups, will make undesirable  adjustments to monetary and credit policy. This was stated by  Yevgeniy Yasin, leader of the Russian Federation president's  analysis center.    In his opinion the rate of the reforms has slowed down  somewhat in the same period. "We could and should have moved  faster," he said. Yasin believes that the government's main  task is "not to hold up the processes begun in 1992 but to  provide the opportunity to implement the transformations at the  level of enterprises and regions."</p>

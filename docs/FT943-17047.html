			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Union pledges all-out protests The Union of Communication Workers intends to mobilise its 160,000 members employed in the Post Office to campaign among the general public against the government's privatisation plans. Postal workers have already handed out more than 2m anti-privatisation leaflets and stickers to customers. Mr Alan Johnson, the union's general secretary, said yesterday there were 'no limits' to what the union would do to try to thwart privatisation, although it opposed any industrial action. Some workers may campaign unofficially in their working time against privatisation but this will not be encouraged by the union. Mr Johnson warned that the government would pay a heavy political price at the next general election if it went ahead with privatisation. The union will target Conservative MPs in marginal constituencies as part of its campaign. Mr Johnson said: 'Conservative MPs should think long and hard about the views of their constituents and their electoral majorities before deciding to support such a madcap and illogical plan as that of Michael Heseltine.' He was confident that his union could win its campaign: 'I don't believe the Post Office will be privatised. It is a privatisation too far.' There would be an 'enormous public outcry' against the government's plans, he added. Mr Johnson welcomed the government's decision to include the option for allowing the Post Office to enjoy greater commercial freedom as an integrated network in the public sector. 'This will achieve the goals the industry seeks without the unnecessary and irreparable damage that privatising and breaking up the Post Office would inevitably bring,' he said. The union aims to appeal to the traditionally patriotic instincts of the customers. Mr Johnson claimed that what the government proposed would 'deeply offend the national character' as the Post Office is a 'facet of British life, woven into the fabric of society'. He added that Mr Michael Heseltine's option of splitting the Post Office's counter services from Royal Mail and Parcelforce was a 'mixture of political expediency and personal ambition'.</p>

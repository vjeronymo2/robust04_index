			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS 'STAMPEDE'AFTER TOHSHIN SCRAPS PROJECT;  </P> <P> TOPANGA CANYON: A BANKRUPT DEVELOPER HAS OFFERS TO REPLACE THE JAPANESE FIRM  THAT BACKED OUT, HIS ATTORNEY SAYS.  </P> <P> Controversial plans to build a golf course and housing in Topanga Canyon are  still alive, with "a virtual stampede" of other companies lining up to replace  Japanese financial interests that withdrew, an attorney for the would-be  developer said Thursday.  </P> <P> John T. Janosik, representing developer Christopher Wojciechowski, said in a  federal bankruptcy proceeding that Wojciechowski has made "clear, substantive  progress" in the last several weeks toward obtaining the five county permits  still required before construction can begin on the site of the proposed  Montevideo Country Club.  </P> <P> And he promised U.S. District Judge William Lasarow that once the county issues  the permits, "we will not have any difficulty in getting a signed agreement"  from a company that wants to buy the 257-acre site, located in the northern  part of the canyon about three miles from the Woodland Hills border.  </P> <P> Wojciechowski, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection about a year ago,  planned to sell the Montevideo Country Club site and the plans for the  development to the Japan-based Tohshin Co., for $22 million, plus an additional  $14 million when construction began.  </P> <P> But Japanese banks were reluctant to finance the purchase and Tohshin decided  not to proceed on the night before the agreement was scheduled to be ratified  by the federal bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> Company representatives said the project seemed too risky an investment because  of the obstacles still standing in the way of construction.  </P> <P> Before construction can begin, the project needs final approval from the  county's Subdivision Committee, and the Board of Supervisors would have to  grant a zoning change, an oak tree removal permit and a general plan amendment,  county Planner Don Culbertson said.  </P> <P> Now another potential buyer is negotiating with Wojciechowski to acquire the  land for the project, Janosik said Thursday, although Janosik admitted that the  company -- which he would not identify -- is reluctant to commit itself to the  purchase until the Board of Supervisors clears the way for construction.  </P> <P> Many Topanga residents vehemently oppose the plan to turn the rolling,  oak-dotted meadow into an artificially landscaped golf course, and members of  the Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community have launched a letter writing  campaign to persuade Supervisor Mike Antonovich to oppose the project's current  design.  </P> <P> "We have to get the word out that we are not going to accept this thing," said  Bob Bates, president of the association. "We also want to get the word out to  potential buyers."  </P> <P> In an interview after the court hearing Thursday, Janosik refused to reveal the  company that is considering the purchase. But he said in court that even if  that firm backs out, others have expressed interest.  </P> <P> "There is a virtual stampede of new interest," Janosik said. But, he said,  "buyers want to wait for county approval."  </P></p>

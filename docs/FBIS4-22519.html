			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Andreyev article: "If Terrorists Capture an AES, </F> There Will Be No One To Liberate It"]    [Text] The collegium of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] (which, we would remind you, was set up last  December to replace the abolished Ministry of Security) devoted  its first session specifically to the security of Russia's  strategic installations. Among other things the problem of  nuclear electric power stations [AES's] was vociferously  discussed in some alarm since the FCS thinks that they may fall  prey to criminal, terrorist encroachments.    In the opinion of Colonel Leonid Semenov, a leading FCS  expert and head of a Strategic Installations Directorate  section, the first symptoms of trouble with crime at AES's  appeared in the eighties. As was said at the time, "offices"  received letters from personnel at the Kursk and Novovoronezh  AES's and some AES's on Ukrainian territory. For all their  differences, the messages boiled down to one thing: If you  don't solve my problems (housing, and so on), I will not spare  myself, I will blow an AES to kingdom come. Inspection of the  "complaints," Semenov said, showed that the writers were  suffering from psychological disorders.    The FCS believes that, since the early nineties, the  socioeconomic preconditions for attacks on AES's have been  compounded by political ones. According to the latest figures,  which have not however been confirmed by documentation,  extremists from the Ararat Valley made threats against the  Armenian AES, while the most rabid separatists in Chechnya seem  to have threatened the Balakovo and Kursk AES's. The Lubyanka  believes that both groups saw the AES's as a potential means of  putting political pressure on the Union and Russian authorities.    In Col. Semenov's view, there is an equal danger from  arbitrary actions by AES personnel trying to get the government  to resolve various social problems. Like, for instance, the  hunger strike and picket of the Kursk AES this March by staffers  protesting nonpayment of wages since December. In the opinion  of counterintelligence personnel, extremists may exploit such  situations, as well as the power generation operatives' just  discontent, and events may quite possibly end up seriously out  of control.    Although every AES has an FCS subunit working there, whose  duty is to know everything and promptly gather information about  likely attacks on AES security, legal norms no longer make  provision for rigorous scrutiny of job applicants. Surprisingly  enough, candidates for jobs as nuclear power generation  personnel do not take a mental fitness test and are not vetted,  as is the case throughout the civilized world, for reliability  -- at least in human, civic terms. The once tightly sealed  30-km zone around AES's has long been open to all comers. Today  anyone, including criminals, can come and register or even live  here without a stamp in their passport. There are no legal  grounds for refusing people work at an AES, nor are there  grounds for getting rid of extremists working at a power unit's  control panel. The Law on Atomic Energy, the draft of which,  according to Leonid Semenov, enshrines "cadre" norms, is one of  those that legislators have failed to adopt since 1987.    So, imagine the worst case scenario: The reasonable  organizers lose control of some quite peaceful demonstrations at  an AES, and determined people, ready for anything, fishing in  troubled waters, become the masters of the situation. Or some  outside terrorists take crack AES staff hostage, keep them in  their sights to get through the guards, and dictate terms to the  government: Immediate sovereignty for the Verkhnevzdyblenskaya  [imaginary name, akin to Ruritania] Republic].    Earlier, even a couple of months ago, the country had the  now-notorious "Vympel" to cope with that eventuality, whose  superfighters were used at AES's since 1987. Each of them knew  all the AES's like their own home and during exercises got  through the seemingly impenetrable utilities' layouts to reach  the power unit, a feat that amazed even AES specialists. Thanks  to the exercises, incidentally, the AES guard system was  perfected; they are guarded by Internal Troops and this system  has been tightened up year after year.    "Vympel" no longer exists now -- it has been transferred to  the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and effectively  devastated. The FCS is hoping to re-create something similar,  but these unique skills take years to cultivate and who can say  that the crack detachment's combat experience and knowledge will  not be needed today or tomorrow?    I got the feeling from my talk with Col. Semenov that the  problem is not just one of a fighting force, capable of  combating "nuclear" terrorism. For good or ill, no one in the  past doubted the special services' right (and qualifications) to  play the prime role in an emergency. That is, the forces  assembled by various departments in a "hot spot" to counter a  serious danger always had a natural, universally recognized  hierarchy to guarantee unified command of an operation. No one  muscled in, everyone knew their place, their rights, and duties.  Regrettably, last December's action against the terrorists  spilling dollars over Dagestan showed that there was no sign of  the former unified command, since the presidential edict winding  up the Russian Ministry of Security erupted precisely 21  December.    My interlocutor in the FCS once again sees the Law on Atomic  Energy, which has thus far not been adopted, as the solution to  this power struggle. According to him, this law clearly sets  out the rights and duties of each of the departments that  oversees nuclear power generation. There has not yet been a  tragedy, there is time, but the price of delay may be far more  terrible than Chernobyl, which, as you know, blew up without any  malicious intent on the part of those who caused the catastrophe.</p>

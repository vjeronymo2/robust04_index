			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther by </F> Heribert Prantl and Ulrich Deupmann; place and date not given:  "One Will Find Oneself Standing With One's Empty Words in an  Empty Room"]    [Text] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] When you took office eight  months ago you promised that internal security would not become  an issue in the election campaign. Is your word still true  today?    [Kanther] The issue has not been artificially put up, but it  is simply there. Internal security is a political issue that  the citizens are interested in, which is why the differing  approaches to it are, of course, also the subject of an election  campaign.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The Social Democratic party of  Germany [SPD] has presented an election campaign motto, and it  is: Security Instead of Fear. Do you like that motto?    [Kanther] It is an empty phrase. The citizens are  concerned. I do not want them to have fears.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What motto can you come up with?    [Kanther] The longer I am in the business of politics the  less I am interested in coining such slogans. They give the  people stones instead of bread and simplify difficult problems.  Permanent concern about internal security, adapting state  measures to the situation of threat; creativity in observing the  permanently changing situations of threat -- with such  statements I can outline the basis of my conviction better than  with a hackneyed phrase.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] This does not sound very bold  compared to the reputation you have. When you took office you  were described as the "Black Sheriff." Have you started to  change your image?    [Kanther] Interior Minister Kanther does not have image  problems at all, but was never interested in taking any image  people gave him particularly seriously or even change it. I do  not care much about such labels. I think that, in politics, one  can make oneself best understood through success and not through  announcements. What is important to me is progress in the  issues I have to deal with.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So let us come to those issues.  Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein has accused you of being to  lenient in the negotiations with you coalition partner, the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] -- for example as far as the  issue of bugging private homes of suspected criminals is  concerned.    [Kanther] The anticrime law includes two dozen important  points on which this coalition agreed. Since we have treated  our coalition partner as a partner, we have also achieved the  State's evidence regulation for organized crime. This was not  all that easy. What is the point of overthrowing an entire law  because of individual controversial issues such as the bugging  of apartments? If the Federal Government wins the election, an  new coalition agreement can be concluded -- then the bugging of  apartments will get a new chance.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Members of your Bundestag group have  criticized that, for the first time, an interior minister is  concentrating too much on issues of substance and does not  engage enough in the election campaign.    [Kanther] I regard that as a compliment, because the  election campaign can be understood as empty words. For me, the  election campaign is something completely different, something  permanent. Moreover, consumer behavior toward politics and  politicians is changing. If, as a politician, one fails to be  aware of it, then one will quickly find oneself standing with  one's empty words in an empty room or in front of 13 believers.  I think that the public develops an understanding for whether  politicians work seriously on an issue and advance it step by  step -- if necessary, step by step. I would also prefer the  bugging issue to have been contained in the anticrime law that  we agreed with the FDP. Yet, had I culminated the controversy,  the coalition climate would have been damaged and the other two  dozens points of the anticrime law could not have been adopted  either.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The assignment Helmut Kohl gave you  when he called you into his Cabinet was: "Strengthen my right  wing." It has been said that this wing feels it is not getting  enough from you....    [Kanther] There is not the slightest reason for that within  the party. First, everybody was murmuring that the Black  Sheriff would get the republic under control, starting at the  right margin -- and six months later this person is simply too  conciliatory.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So far, your time in office has  been dominated by the Bad Kleinen disaster. The operation was a  Waterloo for the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations  [BKA], which is why, immediately after you took office, you  issued the slogan that a new spirit must move into the BKA....  Has it moved in yet?    [Kanther] A new spirit can only partly be decreed, and it is  not enough that it moves in. One has to assay the origins of  the mistakes and then undo the mistakes. Coming to terms with  the circumstances of Bad Kleinen is a tiresome procedure that  only works on the basis of close cooperation with all parties  involved. One cannot decree something by pressing a button, but  one has to convince the people of the right course. This is  leading to new insights as far as the [special antiterrorist  task force] GSG-9 is concerned and to new leadership structures  in the BKA. There is considerable need to understand things, to  reflect on the necessity to change the work. The idea,  particularly at the level of the BKA, that one was immune to any  mistakes, has been quite rightly shattered. In the wake of Bad  Kleinen, essential basic mistakes were made. It was certainly  not a leadership question. There was too much routine, in the  sense that "we can do all that single-handedly." There were, of  course, also mistakes at the leadership level, particularly  deficiencies regarding the BKA's behavior regarding  communication; internally, and toward the public. Information  was concealed, from man to man, that should have been exchanged.  Information was passed on wrongly. My predecessor did not sit  at one desk with those who had the information and he never got  it. Besides, in such a situation, public relations are not of  secondary importance that should merely be left to the press  office, but the police must focus on making the results of  public-relations work clear to everybody.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] What was the reason for the news  blackout imposed by the BKA?    [Kanther] Explanations are not easy. It cannot be compared  to stress on the site of the action. The man who leaves his  position during the operation because he receives a garbled  radio message or comes to a wrong assessment of the situation at  the moment the shooting starts is faced with different demands  than the person who sits 500 km further back and is guarding the  information.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is the BKA currently fully or only  partly operational?    [Kanther] I consider the BKA to be fully operational. In  principle, the BKA's authority has not been challenged by the  Bad Kleinen affair. Basic mistakes can happen everywhere, also  at the level of the Land Offices of Criminal Investigations.  The connection between the Ministry and the BKA has been filled  with new people in important positions. One thing is still  pending -- the formulation of a new leadership structure of the  BKA, which should rather become something like a board, and must  facilitate cooperativeness to a greater degree, instead of a  pyramid-like hierarchical leadership.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] This means a cold-blooded stripping  of power of current President Zachert, who cannot be transferred  under the civil service regulations....    [Kanther] No. The president has a large number of  international, representative external responsibilities based on  the federal structure of the FRG. The internal effect of the  leadership can be intensified by strengthening the cooperative  features.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Something like a directorate at the  top of the BKA?    [Kanther] Not in a formal sense. Let me put it this way:  The Ministry will have greater influence on, and participate  more intensively in, a leadership that is more strongly  characterized by cooperativeness.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Your ministry's influence should  increase.    [Kanther] Correct.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] At the moment, the president is not a  political public servant. What you said sounds as if you wanted  to change that.    [Kanther] No. This is not what we have in mind. I am  absolutely unemotional in this connection. There are various  ways of improving the situation. The basic mistakes of Bad  Kleinen have nothing to do with the legal status of the  president. I do not see any need for change in this connection.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You will soon present the final  report on Bad Kleinen. Will there remain any doubts that Grams  really shot himself?    [Kanther] I have never had the slightest doubt that the  police could not have "executed" Grams -- as conveyed by some  media, which is what created the special dimension of the case.  If this had ever become a real question, then DER SPIEGEL could  have given the name of its witness. Still, the dilemma was that  the public's confidence in the police was so shattered by the  daily changing and obviously wrong information that such a  grotesque claim could no longer be countered with authority.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] An office that has been shattered,  an office whose organization is in a process of change, such an  organization should receive even further tasks from you on the  basis of the new BKA law: You are intending to give the BKA the  authority to carry out so-called preliminary investigations,  that is to say to let the BKA investigate when there is only a  first suspicion.    [Kanther] The so-called preliminary investigations -- the  authority to investigate even before a concrete suspicion --  will not be included in the draft law. This issue contains an  element of irritation -- not so much toward the FDP but toward  the laender. By carrying federal thinking to extremes, the  laender -- all of them -- regard preliminary investigations  carried out by the BKA as an infringement of their authority  regarding criminal persecution. I do not exactly regard that as  a modern approach. Nevertheless, It would be insensible to face  the Bundesrat deliberately with a set of laws it cannot accept  and then, finally, to eliminate a passage at the end that was  known to be unacceptable to the Bundesrat from the very  beginning.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In your speeches you often talk of  the authority of the state. Is this authority not being  questioned by the constant propagation of new and stricter laws  and by making people believe that such laws (for example the law  on bugging private homes) would improve things enormously?    [Kanther] Of course, the problems of the world would not be  solved for good afterwards, either.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Still, your party also contributed to  the exaggerated hopes that have been pinned on the bugging of  homes private homes.    [Kanther] The debate has started to spiral. This cannot be  denied. It was like this with the asylum issue, too -- with the  result that the law, ultimately, included 75 percent of what the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] wanted. Now we no longer have  30,000 but 10,000 refugees [arriving in Germany each month].  That is, at least, something. This result confirms that our  policy is right. We could have not achieved that without the  public debate -- which, of course, led to some hot controversy  and friction.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] There was fire and it keeps flaring  up. Do you have nothing to do with the generation of the heat?    [Kanther] Those who ask such questions owe me the answer to  how democratic politics should be made in general -- together  with the people, I hope! I am not generating heat. I am trying  to keep debates under control with the adequate measures. In  the asylum debate, I strongly represented the CDU's position for  many years, which brought me sharp attacks in the Hesse Landtag  for many years. I have put in my files all letters that were  imbued with references to morals without ever doubting that the  policy was correct.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The way in which you conducted the  asylum debate is, thus, unrelated to the murderous attacks  against foreigners?    [Kanther] No. Only there was no other way to conduct the  debate -- because the SPD had assumed an unacceptable position  and could not have been moved otherwise.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So the murderous attacks have been  the consequence of the SPD's unyieldingness?    [Kanther] I have been in this business too long to give you  such a headline -- particularly after such an important  constitutional compromise.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you not regret anything?    [Kanther] I have never conducted a debate against foreigners  -- but one on the inability of the SPD-Greens-ruled Hesse land  Government to accommodate asylum-seekers and to deport those who  had their applications for asylum turned down.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Emotionalizing....    [Kanther] ...is one possible political instrument. Yet one  has to use it very, very cautiously, otherwise one will share  the experience of the sorcerer's apprentice.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] And do you really think that you  acted very cautiously?    [Kanther] I am sure. I am always making a point in  controlling what I say in public, because it cannot be easily  revoked.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Whenever you speak of the dwindling  authority of the state, the term degeneration of values will  inevitably follow. You like to blame the movement of 68 for  this alleged degeneration of values. Yet, 1968 was a long time  ago and you had nothing to do with it. So it is easy to put all  the blame on it....    [Kanther] But I am not doing so....    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You are talking of 68 when you refer  to the decline of values, while I attribute it to private  television. A professor worked out that a 12-year-old child has  seen an average 12,000 murders on television....    [Kanther] 18,000.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In Hesse, you fought for private  television for 10 years, and now we are shocked about its  extreme developments. You are -- in legal terms -- under a  guarantee obligation, an obligation for doubtful past actions....    [Kanther] Responsibility cannot be denied.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In what way are you doing justice to  it?    [Kanther] I have to change the picture that you have drawn.  The fact that a carpenter sometimes cuts himself is no evidence  against the necessity of the saw. Authorizing private radio and  television stations was a necessary step. Germany cannot be an  island. Yet, first of all it is the journalists who are  responsible for the program. Journalists have to be held  accountable for any representation of violence on public or  private television. Second, the business community that runs  commercials on television has to take action. It is  insufficiently assuming responsibility.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So no more commercials during violent  programs?    [Kanther] If possible, such programs should not be broadcast  at all. It is first and foremost those who put a program on  television who have to reflect on the problem.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So no activities by the legislative  power?    [Kanther] I do not see any need to take action, as far as I  am concerned at the moment. I want the phenomenon to be solved  by the television people.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let us stick to the issue of  television. The chairman of the Central Council of Jews has  just endorsed a general ban on election spots for all parties.  Are you finding it hard to do without a few colorful pictures  in commercials for the CDU?    [Kanther] I think this debate is bizarre. Why should we do  without television spots?    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Because you have enough other  possibilities to promote your party and because the profit the  radicals are making from such commercials is dangerous.    [Kanther] What makes you think that? The clips that I have  seen so far in this connection are all absolutely stupid and  will hardly cause any damage with people who are in their right  mind; moreover, there are limits under the Penal Code.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] So you think there is no audience for  such films?    [Kanther] Only a very limited one.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Do you not fear that certain extreme  groups might only become popular with the help of election  commercials on television?    [Kanther] No, this has to be ruled out; that is absolutely  overestimating this medium. The political parties of the center  must not knuckle under.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F> Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary, by Peter Csala; place and  date not given: "Sandor Nagy Has No Ministerial Ambitions"]    [Text] Setting the electronic points at Celldomolk was  only a small action for Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National  Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ]. Nagy met  railway workers during his visit to Vas County. It remains a  big question for him, too, whether it will be just as easy for  him in his capacity of parliamentary deputy of the governing  party to put the engine of trade unions on its tracks. We asked  him about his views on the future of the trade unions that will  become a parliamentary factor after the elections.    [Nagy] The role of the trade unions will definitely change  in the coming four years. If for no other reason then because  the current government is trying to keep the MSZOSZ in  quarantine, with the occasional support of the liberal  opposition. Our struggle against this often distracted us from  our essential duties. Our proposals were rejected and the  government treated us as enemies. We will not have to face this  when the government is led by the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP]. I expect that we will be seen as important partners.    [Csala] In order to be seen as partners, do the trade unions  definitely have to sit in Parliament, as deputies of precisely  the governing party?    [Nagy] I do not think that this issue is as important as is  presented by the press nowadays. The deputies will indeed have  to decide about their attitude. When the MSZP made the  agreement with us, it could not have wanted us to deny our  identity and it did not. Therefore, naturally, we will also  represent the interests of employees in Parliament and we will  not basically change our views. It is important that we take the  requests and demands of employees into Parliament instead of  explaining and mediating the government's measures to our  members. This is not what they expect from us.    [Csala] How can this be made consistent with the discipline  in the parliamentary group?    [Nagy] I cannot say anything about this at the moment  because I do not know what discipline in the parliamentary group  will mean for the MSZP. We will probably have conflicts but we  would like these to remain manageable and possible to solve.    [Csala] At the moment, you are chairman of the MSZOSZ,  leader of the local social insurance administration board for  pensions, and future parliamentary deputy. Are these not too  much together?    [Magy] The law prescribes that I have to resign my position  at the social insurance administration board within 30 days  after receiving my mandate. I will do this. However, in my  view, the chairmanship of the trade unions does not clash with  being a parliamentary deputy. There are other examples of this  in Europe.    [Csala] Would you perhaps accept a governmental function or  a ministerial position?    [Nagy] I did not think of this even when I decided to run in  the elections. As a matter of fact, one does not have to be a  parliamentary deputy to become a government member. At the  moment, I do not have such ambitions.    [Csala] What possibilities can you see to solve the problems  of social insurance?    [Nagy] Short and long-term proposals will have to be drawn  up in both areas. However, it is important for the two systems  of social insurance to be completely separated both  organizationally and financially by the end of the year. Health  insurance is impossible to finance in its current form and,  because of the links, it is a burden on the pension insurance  system. Together, the two insurance funds struggle with a 150  billion forints deficit, therefore, we have to begin to collect  the debts owed to us as soon as possible and to have the state  assets handed over to the insurance boards immediately.    [Csala] What are your views on the coalition possibilities?  What would be the attitude of the MSZOSZ in case of a balanced  coalition between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats?    [Nagy] I believe that a coalition led by a strong MSZP will  emerge. It would lead to many senseless conflicts between the  government and the trade unions if the liberal economic program  was implemented. I trust that this will not happen and this is  why I ask everyone to go to vote on Sunday [29 May] and not to  let themselves be influenced in their decision.</p>

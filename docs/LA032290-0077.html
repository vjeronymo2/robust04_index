			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: SEVERAL WAYS TO ELIMINATE TERMITES  </P> <P> Question: As a subscriber, an urban entomologist and a technical service and  development specialist for Dow Elanco &amp; Co., I would like to provide you  with additional information relative to your article of Feb. 7, 1990, "Tallying  the Benefits of a Cool, New Method of Termite Extermination" (using liquid  nitrogen). As you stated, fumigation has been the primary method of eliminating  dry-wood termites from structures. What you failed to tell your concerned  readers is that it remains the only proven method of eliminating dry-wood  termites from structures.  </P> <P> The Blizzard System requires the extent of the infestation to be determined  before treatment. The problem with attempting to control dry-wood termites with  local treatments such as Blizzard is that most colonies are very difficult to  find. Fiber-optics will not reveal most colonies . . . because dry-wood  termites leave the outer layer of wood beams untouched as a protective shield.  I am sure that most homeowners are not informed of this drawback.  </P> <P> A bill is being introduced in the coming session of the California Legislature  which will require evidence to support the claims of persons proposing the use  of non-pesticidal insect-control methods. Without the field testing, which Jim  Wells of the California Department of Food and Agriculture said was not  conducted, how can one know whether the Blizzard System actually is effective?  </P> <P> The Blizzard System probably will kill dry-wood termites in exposed locations  when colonies can be located. In such cases, spot injections of very small  quantities of an aerosol insecticide into the termite galleries would also kill  the colonies, and at about 25% of the cost of the Blizzard System.  </P> <P> Often, one method of handling complaints (of dissatisfied customers) is  fumigation, since fumigation eliminates all the termites in the structure, not  just those that can be found by the termite inspector. It is our right to  choose, but it is also our right and obligation to be well informed when making  our choice. -- BRIAN M. SCHNEIDER  </P> <P> Answer: Since Tallon Termite &amp; Pest Control's use of liquid nitrogen to  exterminate termites is relatively new (1985), and is a patented technique to  boot, I didn't think for a minute that the previous column describing it would  slip by without rebuttal. I am in the middle, just as much as the lowly termite  is. We took the points you made to Joe Tallon Sr., the firm's president,  because you obviously have broad expertise in the field.  </P> <P> I'm sure you aren't surprised that Tallon found little merit in your arguments.  He concedes that the extent of infestation does, indeed, have to be determined  before treatment with liquid nitrogen. But he takes exception to the statement  that "fiber-optics will not reveal most colonies there (in wall voids or floor  beams) because dry-wood termites leave the outer layer of wood beams untouched  as a protective shield."  </P> <P> Tallon points out that fiber-optics are used extensively in such diverse  professions as the medical field and in the inspection of aircraft engines and  are quite successful. He also adds that while termites do "leave the outer  layer of wood beams untouched," this misses the point of the fiber-optics  inspection -- which is to pick up "the termite pellets that they kick out in  order to clean their channels."  </P> <P> And, Tallon continues, while the California Department of Food and Agriculture  may not have conducted field tests of the Blizzard System, his company  conducted field tests "extensively before we applied for and got EPA  (Environmental Protection Agency) approval. In all, we've probably done 2,000  to 3,000 field tests."  </P> <P> And he agrees with you completely that termites in exposed locations can,  indeed, be killed with small quantities of aerosol insecticide at about 25% of  the Blizzard cost. "Sure," Tallon agrees, "if you can see them you can kill  them -- with insecticide, WD 40, aerosol hair spray or with a hammer, for that  matter. They aren't the problem."  </P> <P> Neither does Tallon dispute a Wall Street Journal story about a dissatisfied  Blizzard System customer.  </P> <P> "In about 15% of the cases it doesn't work, and so we go back and do it  conventionally, with tenting. What the fumigation people don't tell you is that  they have their misses, too. If the temperature drops or stays cold after  tenting they've got a strong chance of not getting a kill, either."  </P></p>

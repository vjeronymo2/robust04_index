			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Beijing political situation" column by Jen </F> Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "China Appreciates Sino-U.S.  Relations in the Nixon Era"]    [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (HSIN PAO) -- China and the United  States hold the balance in international affairs, hence  Sino-U.S. relations are always the focus of the world.  Sino-U.S. relations were at a low ebb after the 4 June Incident  in Beijing. In November 1993, PRC President Jiang Zemin met  U.S. President Clinton in Seattle at the latter's invitation.  Since this was the first official meeting between the heads of  state of the two countries in more than four years due to a  break in high-level dialogues, it was considered a new beginning  in the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations. However, to  everyone's surprise, and at a time when a thawing of Sino-U.S.  relations was expected, the United States unilaterally announced  on 6 January that China's textile import quotas would be reduced  by 25 to 35 percent starting 17 January. Although China has  already agreed to settle this issue through talks by 17 January,  it was, after all, the United States which stirred up the  Sino-U.S. trade war. In viewed of this, people cannot but ask:  How will Sino-U.S. relations develop? In order to answer this  question, we must first understand how the Clinton  administration has revised its policy towards China and how the  Chinese Government is reacting to the United States.  <H5>  Clinton Revises His Tactics Towards China </H5>   According to a source in Beijing, after studying U.S.  foreign  policies since Clinton came to power, Chinese experts in U.S.  affairs judged that the United States had decided to revise its  policy towards China before Clinton invited Jiang Zemin to  Seattle. The United States did not give up its strategy of  facilitating changes in China through peaceful evolution, but  due to the consideration of revitalizing the domestic economy  (the United States has elevated economic issues to the high  plane of national security), it decided to change its tactics  towards China and establish multilateral relations through  dialogue with various Chinese ministries. On 7 September 1993,  the Clinton administration pointed out in the "Evaluation Report  on U.S. Policies Towards China in Recent Years," of which the  Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of  Representatives were informed by memorandum (the report was  passed later): It is necessary to treat U.S. national  interests, rather than human rights in China, as a top priority.  It showed that Clinton wanted to change the past practice of  dealing with foreign relations which treated human rights in  China as the top priority and which neglected economic issues  related to U.S. national interests and national security.    U.S. political circles described the revised policy towards  China as a "policy of contacts," which implies: On the one  hand, with the Clinton-Jiang Summit as the beginning, the United  States will have more and more contacts with China. In  particular, the two "forbidden zones" of mutual visits between  senior leaders and of military contacts set up by the United  States have been abolished, thus implying that the atmosphere of  Sino-U.S. relations will be improved. On the other hand, if the  United States mainly resorted to the practice of "facilitating  changes by exerting pressure" on China in the past several  years, it will, more often than not in the future, try to  influence China and ask China to change its existing systems and  policies through contacts and cooperation.    However, Chinese experts in U.S. affairs pointed out: It is  true that the Clinton administration treats the reinvigoration  of the domestic economy as the top priority and the  consideration of economic interests has a greater share in its  foreign policy, but U.S. diplomacy in the post-Cold War era  still considers the pursuit of economic interests, defense of  national security, and promotion of "democracy and human rights"  as three interrelated and complementary goals. Compared with  other powers, U.S. diplomacy has strong ideological colors. The  House of Representatives sticks to the principle that human  rights diplomacy can never be abolished, otherwise the United  States will lose its spiritual leadership in the world and  friction will arise in economic cooperation. Hence, although a  thawing of Sino-U.S. relations after the Seattle Summit is  expected, substantive issues have not yet been resolved and  China should make a sober estimate of the difficulties in  Sino-U.S. relations.    The source said: Chinese experts on U.S. affairs and Chinese  leaders hold that senior U.S. Government officials (for example,  President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher) are not as  farsighted as former U.S. President Richard Nixon and former  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The unremitting efforts and  courageous policy decisions made by Nixon and Kissinger for the  establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States  and China are still a much-told tale. For this reason, they  established friendship with China and become friends of the  Chinese people. Not long ago, DACANKAO [LARGE REFERENCE 1129  0639 5072], a CPC journal published internally for senior  cadres' perusal, compared the three letters separately sent by  Kissinger and James Lilley (former U.S. ambassador to China) to  the U.S. presidents and its intention was obviously to praise  Kissinger and censure Lilley, which shows that the Chinese  authorities very much appreciate Sino-U.S. relations in the  Nixon-Kissinger era.  <H5>  Beijing Appreciates Nixon and Kissinger </H5>   DACANKAO said: In order to normalize American-Chinese  relations, Kissinger wrote two letters to President Nixon and  one to President Reagan. He volunteered to pave the way for  Nixon's visit to China and later helped bring about  U.S.-Vietnamese peace talks. Consequently, he and Vietnam's Le  Dec Tho were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Late PRC  Premier Zhou Enlai said when congratulating him, "Dec Tho will  get longevity and you will get valuables." The non-isolation  policy pursued by Reagan was also facilitated by Kissinger. The  Chinese people will never forget Kissinger's contributions to  the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the  United States.    DACANKAO went on to say: Lilley also wrote three letters to  the U.S. president (Bush). His second letter, which is still  sensible, suggested that it was inadvisable for the United  States to link human rights with trade in formulating its policy  towards China. However, his first letter (which was written  after the disintegration of the Soviet Union) maintained that  the United States should fully support Taiwan independence, and  his third letter maintained that the United States should  vigorously and unequivocally support Hong Kong Governor Patten's  political reform package. Obviously, these two letters were  antagonistic towards China. In particular, his advocacy of  Taiwan independence helps China see clearly that there are two  persons surnamed "Li" working for Taiwan independence, the first  one is Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan and the other is James Lilley of  the United States, which may be called a "two-man comic show,  with one singing while the other acts." It is impudent enough  for people like Lilley to try to play Kissinger's role in the  present time, but are they qualified?    Chinese experts in U.S. affairs said: By praising Kissinger  and censuring Lilley, DACANKAO hoped that in dealing with  Sino-U.S. relations, the Clinton administration can, just as  Nixon and Kissinger did, bear its own long-term strategic  interests in mind and, at the same time, respect China's  interests according to the principles of mutual respect and  equality without haggling over differences in social systems and  ideologies, thus properly resolving the issues between China and  the United States.    The source also said: The Chinese Government is fully aware  that Clinton has revised his policy towards China and is willing  to have dialogue with China, but so far he has not had the same  strategic courage as Nixon and Kissinger had. He will still  couple threats with promises and frequently stir up troubles in  the process of making contacts with China. Moreover, China  cannot but notice that recently the Clinton administration aims  at China and has taken some abnormal moves on the issues of the  DPRK, Vietnam, and Hong Kong.  <H3>  China Pays Attention to Abnormal Moves Taken by the United  States </H3>   As far as the DPRK issue is concerned, the United States  once  held that with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China's  strategic position declined. But with the emergence of the DPRK  nuclear issue, the United States affirms the importance of  China's strategic position and wants to win over China to  jointly deal with DPRK.    As far as the Vietnam issue is concerned, the United States  wants to win over Vietnam so as to make it become another China  in the Cold War period, whereas China is regarded as the  then-Soviet Union. Hence, on the one hand, the United States  announced the decision to relax the 18-year-long trade ban  against Vietnam to reciprocate Vietnam's assistance to the  United States in searching for MIA's from the Vietnam War, and  on the other hand secret talks have been held in Paris and  Vietnam, which will be elevated to the ambassadorial level or  even the level of special envoy. Clinton described the U.S.  envoy taking part in the talks as a modern Kissinger.    As far as the Hong Kong issue is concerned, members of the  U.S. House of Representatives and the person in charge of the  Republican Party's Human Rights Committee have already promised  leaders of Hong Kong's radical democrats that they will put  forward a motion at regular Congressional sessions in the near  future: First, to amend the "Law of Hong Kong Relations" and  ask the State Council to submit a report on Hong Kong issues to  Congress once a year instead of twice a year; second, to urge  Patten to table his original political reform package to the  Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion; and third, to ask  Congress to open a hearing on the issue of democratization in  Hong Kong.    As indicated by various signs, there is a thawing of  Sino-U.S. relations, but the path is still not easy. As  compelled by reality, the Chinese authorities must  conscientiously study tactics to deal with the United States.  Hence, the development of Sino-U.S. relations in the future  will still be the special concern of the world.</p>

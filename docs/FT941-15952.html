			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York creditors to sell 61% Abitibi stake Olympia &amp; York's creditors have offered public investors the controlling stake formerly held by the failed property developer in Abitibi-Price, the Canadian newsprint producer. A&amp;G Resources, a company formed by 32 O&amp;Y lenders, said yesterday it planned to raise CDollars 886m (USDollars 674m) from the sale of a 61 per cent stake in Abitibi. The 54.5m shares will be sold for CDollars 16.25 a share, payable in three instalments to October 1995. The offer is being made worldwide, except the US, where shares will be privately placed. O&amp;Y pledged the shares to a group of banks, led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp and Credit Lyonnais, as the main collateral for a USDollars 2.5bn loan advanced in the late 1980s. The banks gained the right to sell the shares as part of O&amp;Y's restructuring last year. They still control a 70 per cent stake in Gulf Canada Resources, a Calgary-based energy group, which was also pledged by O&amp;Y as security for the USDollars 2.5bn loan. However, barring a sharp rise in the oil price, the banks are unlikely to recoup anywhere near the full value of the loan. The decision to sell the Abitibi stake has been prompted by a sharp rise in share prices of forest-products companies as evidence mounts that the long slide in pulp and paper prices may be ending. Mr Ron Lloyd, director of syndication at RBC Dominion Securities, which is co-leading the offer, said yesterday 'there is a significant demand for paper stocks'. Abitibi shares closed at CDollars 16 1/4 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday, up from CDollars 16. Abitibi is one of the world's biggest newsprint and uncoated groundwood paper producers. Mr Bernd Koken, chairman, said yesterday the sale would not affect the company's day-to-day operations or longer-term strategies. Abitibi is the latest of several Canadian forest-products companies in which a large stake has been spun off to the public by a troubled controlling shareholder. Toronto's Bronfman family last year sold their interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast pulp and paper producer, while Stone Container of Chicago recently reduced its stake in Montreal-based Stone-Consolidated.</p>

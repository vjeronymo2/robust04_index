It is, therefore, essential that precise and comprehensive information about the linkages be available to ensure that the proposed site receives every opportunity for an equitable evaluation. The proposal should contain for each linkage the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A comprehensive description of the service to be provided, including projected listing of resources that will be involved such as number of instructors/staff, types of equipment and materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether it will be provided at no cost to Job Corps or will be available on a contractual (paid) basis to Job Corps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether the linkage will be provided on-site or off-site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The number of students to be served and over what period of time, as well as the specific benefits to Job Corps students while in Job Corps and/or after leaving the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Distance to linkage, if off-site, and any arrangements for transportation to off-site services, including any cost to Job Corps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The estimated annual value of the contribution and the basis on which the estimate was determined ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , two full-time staff devoted to Job Corps at an annual salary of $30,000 each for a total annual value of $60,000, or one hour of a professional staff-person's time per week for 52 weeks at an hourly rate of $15.00 for an annual value of $780, or 15 computers at a cost of $1,800 each for an annual value of $27,000). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Any limitations associated with the linkage, such as eligibility restrictions ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in-state versus out-of-state residents), limited hours of service, and availability over time ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  all-year versus selected months). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Long-term prospects for continuation of the commitment (e.g., one time only, 1 year, on-going, dependent on outside funding sources). If dependent on outside funding levels, which may vary significantly, what is the likelihood that the linkage will not be funded? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Documentation that addresses timeframes and steps involved in firming up the linkage, if appropriate, including obtaining State or local legislation, fitting into other planning cycles, or securing other agreements or arrangements which may be necessary to assure provision of the service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A letter of commitment confirming each aspect of the linkage, including the level of resources and annual value of these resources, from the head of the agency responsible for delivering the contribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Name of the agency/organization(s), address, telephone number and contact person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: SIA chairman gives Qantas pledge SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA) would not try to exert close management control over Qantas - the Australian international carrier which the government is planning to privatise - if it succeeded in taking a 20 per cent holding, Mr J Y Pillay, SIA's chairman, said yesterday. In a warning to Canberra over the future independence of Qantas, he contrasted this promise with British Airways' apparent plans to direct the activities of USAir, in which it proposes to acquire a 44 per cent stake for Dollars 750m . The UK carrier has, however, denied such plans, describing its proposed USAir investment as a partnership. BA - which has also expressed interest in buying a stake in Qantas - would have a veto of USAir board decisions in spite of only having a minority shareholding. 'We do not want a BA/USAir-type deal,' said Mr Pillay. Canberra is particularly sensitive to accusations of giving up control of the national airline before elections next year. A significant interest in Qantas would help BA fulfil its plan to build a global airline. Earlier this year, Lord King, BA chairman, said the airline needed a stronger presence in the Asia Pacific market. Mr Pillay said SIA wanted board representation only in proportion to its stake, but that details had yet to be worked out. The link would reinforce SIA's position in the Pacific region. Mr Pillay admitted that its ties with Delta, the US carrier with which it has a 5 per cent crossholding, 'could be a lot better'. Delta has been 'pre-occupied' with dealing with its heavily loss-making routes especially in the highly competitive domestic US market.</p>

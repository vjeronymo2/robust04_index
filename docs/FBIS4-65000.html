			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EFE report: "Foreign Ministry Does Not Deem Cuba's </F> Opening-Up Measures Sufficient"]    [Text] Madrid -- Spain deems "clearly insufficient" the  measures adopted by the Cuban regime to promote dialogue with  the opposition, according to Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of  state for international cooperation and Latin America.    Dicenta emphasized to the Congress [of Deputies] Foreign  Affairs Committee that "the Spanish Government may err on the  side of generosity but not of naivety and passivity with respect  to the Cuban people's suffering," and emphasized that "we also  maintain scrupulous respect for Cuban sovereignty."  <H5>  There Is No Interference </H5>   Hence he asserted that Spain's constant calls for respect  for  human rights and basic individual freedoms should not be  interpreted as interference in Cuba's internal affairs.    In his opinion, the good level of dialogue and relations  between Spain and Cuba and the public and constant condemnation  of the U.S. embargo do not prevent the government from  reiterating its views on Cuba's future to the Fidel Castro  regime.    "We will emphasize the Spanish Government's firm resolve to  cooperate in order to enable Cuba to emerge from the crisis and  join the community of free and democratic countries with  prosperous economies," Dicenta said.</p>

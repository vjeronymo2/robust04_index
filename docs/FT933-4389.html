			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / BNF accounts delayed by Thorp BRITISH Nuclear Fuels' annual report and accounts, expected last week, may not be published until the end of January because of uncertainty about the future of the Thorp reprocessing plant. Testing of the equipment began again yesterday after a leak of nitrogen dioxide gas on Tuesday afternoon. BNF said yesterday that the cause of the leak was the testing equipment, not Thorp. The government is due to make a final decision on Thorp next month.</p>

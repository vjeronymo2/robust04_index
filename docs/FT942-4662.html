			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Pakistanis warned of sacrifices: A look at the background to tomorrow's budget Government leaders including the prime minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, have warned Pakistanis to be prepared to make sacrifices, for the sake of long-term growth, when the annual budget is unveiled tomorrow. The budget, for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, follows economic growth of about 4 per cent, up from 3 per cent the previous year but below the target of 7.4 per cent. Official estimates show the inflation rate at 10.5 per cent, again an improvement on the 11 per cent of the previous year but above the government's target of 8 per cent. Exports and imports have both fallen and the agriculture sector, which makes the largest contribution to the economy has grown by only 2.6 per cent, largely because of the destruction of more than a third of this year's cotton crop by a virus. However, there are some brighter spots. The government claims that this would be the first year in almost a decade that the budget deficit would remain within its target, in this case 5.4 per cent of gross domestic product, following several years of rampant fiscal indiscipline. This compares with nearly 8 per cent in the previous year. Foreign exchange reserves have risen to almost Dollars 2bn from last summer's low of below Dollars 300m. Independent economists say improvements in the budget deficit and the reserves are important positive factors for international financial institutions. Earlier this year, Islamabad signed loans worth Dollars 1.36bn with the International Monetary Fund and agreed to accept conditions including lower bank borrowings by the government, improvement in reserves and a lower deficit. 'Our key priority is to attain macroeconomic stability. We consider it a prerequisite for future growth,' says Mr VA Jafarey, the prime minister's adviser on finance, who is de facto finance minister. 'We consider that previous attempts at accelerating growth failed because macroeconomic stability was not ensured.' Among planned measures are a widening of the scope of the existing general sales tax in order to boost revenues. The government's intention to lower tariffs over the next three years is forcing the country to wean itself from reliance on duties on exports and imports. 'We have to find ways to tax consumers and also encourage industrial growth as well as trade,' says a senior official. Some businesses have already begun opposing the move, arguing that with a large black economy and smuggling flourishing, only legitimate businesses would be hit hard by the sales tax which would mean higher prices at retail outlets. Last year, a parliamentary committee found that up to Rs100bn (Dollars 3.34bn) worth of smuggling takes place each year. In addition, some businesses argue that with large scale corruption in the tax department, the new tax would provide further opportunities for bribery. Mr Tahir Khaliq, a businessman and former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, claims that items which are taxed end up being sold at a price of up to 50 to 60 per cent higher than smuggled goods. 'If the tax collector is not honest, people take advantage of that and misuse the system,' he says. Mr Haroon Rashid, president of the KCCI, wants the 'unorganised sector'  - a reference to the black and informal economy, to be taxed like other businesses so that the sales tax would be considered to be fair. Other issues related to the country's macroeconomic structure are also being debated. Almost two-thirds of the budget goes towards debt servicing and funding the defence forces. The recent decision by India, Pakistan's arch enemy, to raise its defence budget by up to 20 per cent has put added pressure on the government of Ms Bhutto to look closely at the country's defence needs. However Ms Bhutto said this week that Pakistan would not try to match the Indian defence budget increase. Boom time for smugglers, Page 9</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour extends Euro links LABOUR yesterday became part of a new European Socialist Party, signalling a strengthening of its EC credentials. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, was among 500 delegates from 16 socialist parties in the EC countries and Austria taking part in the launch ceremony in the Dutch capital The Hague. The occasion is the twice-gathering of the Confederation of EC Socialist Parties, and Confederation president Mr Willy Claes - the Belgian foreign minister - insisted that the move was more than merely a change of name. During The Hague meeting, socialists will be debating openness and democracy in the EC; the enlargement of the Community; and the improvement of social, economic, and environmental standards in member states.</p>

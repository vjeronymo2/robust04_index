			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Net profits at Israel Chemicals slip 20% ISRAEL Chemicals, the flagship of the government's slow privatisation programme, has reported a 20 per cent drop in net profits in 1991, down to Shk142m (USDollars 62m) from Shk179m in 1990, the second year running profits have slipped. The government announced last week it intends to float 31 per cent of Israel Chemicals on stock markets in the US and Europe at an unspecified time later this year. The move would bring down the state's holding to 49 per cent of the company, which exploits Israel's only real natural resource by extracting chemicals from the Dead Sea and surrounding desert area. In late February, some 20 per cent of Israel Chemicals was sold to the public, chiefly through a Dollars 225m flotation on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Plans are to run down the state's share in the company to less than 30 per cent. After running into political objections to its original plan to sell a controlling stake to foreign investors, the Treasury now intends placing privately only a 15 per cent block. Despite the fall in profits, Israel Chemicals maintained its position as the most profitable of the state's 150-strong portfolio of companies, with return on capital of 10 per cent. The decline in profits was blamed mainly on declining demand and prices for fertilisers in western Europe. Sales, about half of which go for export, were down slightly at Shk2.78bn, compared with Shk2.82bn in 1990.</p>

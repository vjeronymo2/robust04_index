			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Arts: Essay in diversity - Concert SZYMANOWSKI'S Stabat mater (1925-6) and Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin (1926) are unlikely components of the same concert programme. Both were written during the same decade, and both employ a chorus (the Bartok confines its to a brief passage of wordless humming) and a large modern orchestra. Otherwise, their attributes could not be more dissimilar: the Szymanowski prayer a rapt re-discovery of an 'archaic', specifically Polish quality of spiritual intensity, the Bartok ballet-score a penny-dreadful tale of urban violence clothed in luridly colourful musical modernism. It was, therefore, the special, splendid achievement of Simon Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus to make such a success - in part and sum equally - of their inclusion in Thursday's concert at the London Festival Hall. The planning was aided, of course, by the larger thematic concerns of the South Bank series enclosing the event: this was the latest on the 'Toward the Millennium' schedule, which is currently focusing on all the diverse, complex and often wildly contradictory musical of the 1920s. A pointed essay in extreme diversity was, indeed, what we were given: along with Bartok and Szymanowski, Busoni's subtly piquant New Classicism was also represented (by two instrumental sections from the opera Doctor Faust) and Sibelius's final refinement of the late-Romantic symphonic ideal (by the Seventh Symphony). But mainly it was the extraordinarily unstinted advocacy of Rattle and the profoundly musical playing and singing of his Birmingham forces that achieved appropriate weight and balance in each of the concert's sharply contrasted items. On this occasion, the Bartok particularly exposed a shortage of fibre in string tone; it could also be argued - but not, I hope, too stringently - that Rattle's enthusiasm for the glorious 'arrival' of the Sibelius finale was advertised a degree too early and too obviously. Between soulless international-orchestral virtuosity and the kind of impassioned commitment to musical meaning on offer here, there has seldom seemed a greater or more illuminating difference.</p>

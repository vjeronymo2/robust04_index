			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Study makes new claims of Nasdaq collusion - Allegations that dealers conspired on prices give fresh impetus to legal action A new twist has been added to the debate about pricing on the Nasdaq stock market. Four months after a US academic study claimed that dealers on the Nasdaq colluded to keep spreads between buy and sell prices unnecessarily wide, a second study by the same university professors has given the debate new impetus. The National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), which runs the screen-based Nasdaq market, vehemently rejected the claims in the first study - but this time it is refusing to comment. Reticence is probably well-advised, because the issue is at the centre of a legal battle that could culminate in some of Wall Street's biggest firms paying out millions of dollars to investors. When the first study on spreads was published in May by Mr William Christie of Vanderbilt University and Mr Paul Schultz of Ohio State University, it prompted the filing of scores of class action lawsuits against the Wall Street firms which act as dealers on Nasdaq. The lawsuits alleged that collusion between the dealing firms to keep spreads wide deprived investors of the best possible price on share trades and violated US anti-trust laws. Wide spreads are regarded as bad for investors because they deny them the opportunity to pay a little less when buying a stock or receive a little more when selling. For dealers, the wider the spread, the bigger the profit they make. The lawsuits relied heavily on the findings of the Christie-Schultz study, but now lawyers have more ammunition to use against the Nasdaq dealers as the second study, by the same two authors plus another Ohio State finance professor, Mr Jeffrey Harris, claims to have found fresh evidence of collusion. While the first report said the dealers had been conspiring for years to keep spreads wide, the new study says dealers have since colluded to narrow their spreads. According to the three professors, within days of the study's publication in May attacking dealers for the wide spreads, Nasdaq dealers narrowed the spreads they quoted on some of the market's biggest stocks, including such well-known companies as Microsoft, Intel and Apple Computer. More specifically, the professors claim that whereas before the first study, dealers invariably quoted their buy and sell prices in even-eighths of a dollar - Dollars   1/4 , Dollars  1/2 , Dollars  3/4 , or a whole dollar - the day after newspapers reported the study's critical findings dealers began quoting prices in the long-neglected fractions of odd-eighths, such as Dollars  1/8 and Dollars  3/8 , as well as even-eighths. For example, before the first study was released dealers would quote investors Dollars 50 1/2 if they wanted to buy a company's stock and Dollars 50 1/4 if they wanted to sell. After the study was publicised dealers would quote Dollars 50 3/8 to buy and Dollars 50 1/4 to sell - a spread of only Dollars  1/8 , compared with Dollars  1/4 before. After the first study was reported on May 26, the change in spreads was sudden and dramatic, says Mr Christie. 'Starting from May 27, marketmakers began using odd-eighths en masse. There was a complete switch.' And it was not just a case of a few firms using quotes of odd-eighths. For each stock they looked at, says Mr Christie, 'there was a minimum of 40 marketmakers, and some stocks had over 60'. These firms, he claims, had not used odd-eighths in years. 'Suddenly, they all started using them.' When asked what conclusion could be drawn from the dealers' actions, Mr Christie responds: 'Cynically, you could say that it was good of Paul (Schultz) and I to remind them that they had these odd-eighths available.' Alternatively, he says the fact that they all moved at once suggested the change had been co-ordinated. 'Our evidence suggests spreads narrowed because an implicit agreement among marketmakers to maintain spreads of at least Dollars  1/4 was abandoned.' Although the professors imply that the dealers colluded to narrow spreads because of publicity surrounding the original study, they nevertheless welcome the resultant cost savings to investors. They calculated that after the shift to narrower quotes using odd-eighths, investors' transaction costs declined by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. When Mr Christie and Mr Schultz published their first findings in May, the NASD said there was no evidence of collusion between dealers and argued that what investors lost through wider spreads, they gained in the guarantee of liquidity afforded by the multiple dealer system. If spreads were narrower, the NASD said, dealers would find it harder to make a profit and some would be forced to abandon making a market in stocks. The subsequent reduction in liquidity would only harm investors. This argument, however, appears to have been undermined by the second study, which found that after dealers started using odd-eighth quotes and effectively halved the size of spreads, the number of marketmakers in each stock did not decline. The second study threatens to greatly embarrass the NASD greatly because for its findings strike at the heart of the very structure of the Nasdaq system, which the NASD trumpets in television advertising as 'the stock market for the next 100 years'. Under the system, investors are meant to get the best price service because competition among multiple dealers for orders should keep spreads narrow. There is little doubt that the new study will be used by lawyers in the cases that have been filed against several Nasdaq dealers. Although it is still early in the legal process, lawyers involved in the class action suits estimate the damages that will be sought from dealers by disgruntled investors could be as much as Dollars 100m for every trading year.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALCUTTA CITIZEN  </P> <P> I am a graduate student at UC San Diego and I am from Calcutta, India. I would  like to draw your attention to the reporting "A Calcutta Murderer Slinks From  Depths Of Depravity" by Mark Fineman (Oct. 9).  </P> <P> At the end of the second paragraph Fineman has reported, "Calcutta is being  stalked and spooked by a serial murderer, barbaric even by local standards." As  a citizen of Calcutta I find this remark not only an ignorant one, but also  insulting because it clearly implies that the local standards of Calcutta are  already barbaric.  </P> <P> Born and raised in Calcutta, I know the demerits of the city better than any  one else and I also know that it is a shame for us that people still sleep on  the streets, but having beggars and poor people doesn't prove at all that the  standards of a city are barbaric.  </P> <P> I would like to know by what standards has Fineman judged Calcutta, especially  if the issue involves crime, because he himself is the citizen of a country  which is known in the world for having the highest crime rate. Fineman should  have known that in spite of the large population, Calcutta is the least  crime-infested city in India. It is far behind any city in America as far as  crime goes. The barbaric drive-by shootings by gangs which are so common in  this country are alien to the citizens of Calcutta. Women in Calcutta are  absolutely safe on the streets compared to the women in Los Angeles or New York  and the murder rate doesn't affect the normal flow of life in the city.  </P> <P> SUNANDA KR.

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Discreet man of steel - Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, talks to Andrew Hill European Community competition policy seems to have gone quiet since Mr Karel Van Miert took over from Sir Leon Brittan as EC competition commissioner in January. Mr Van Miert has taken fewer high-profile decisions than his predecessor, delivered fewer speeches and had no 'rows' with his industry counterpart, Mr Martin Bangemann, who last year merrily lambasted competition hard-liners as over-legalistic 'ayatollahs and gurus'. The difference is due partly to a dearth of important competition cases, but mainly to a clear change in style. Mr Van Miert, affable former chairman of the Flemish Socialist party, is no ayatollah - nor, however, has he turned out to be as pliable as Europe's more interventionist governments perhaps hoped he would be. That should be little surprise to those who know Mr Van Miert. As commissioner responsible for transport, Mr Van Miert helped cajole governments and flag-carrying airlines into far-reaching liberalisation of air transport last year. But now, 10 months into his job, his discreet approach faces some of its biggest tests. He has just returned from a trip to the US and departs for Japan at the beginning of next month with the aim of challenging some of its deep-rooted restrictive business practices. Before then, he hopes finally to persuade some of Europe's largest publicly owned steelmakers to agree the capacity cuts and reductions in state aid that will allow a restructuring of the EC industry to go ahead. Under such circumstances - with the European economy squeezed by recession and lagging behind its competitors - Mr Van Miert, 51, believes the question of whether he is strict or relaxed about competition policy is irrelevant. 'It's not a matter of soft-line or hard-line,' he says. 'The question is: how can you balance and combine the legalistic approach (to competition policy) with what's happening in the real world.' As he moves out of the shadow of Sir Leon, Mr Van Miert has begun to answer that question. In speeches during his US visit earlier this month, he argued that recession and the increasing openness of world trade should change the way in which the Commission examines competition cases. In particular, Mr Van Miert is convinced the potential for job creation ought to be a factor when deciding whether or not to clear deals hovering between assent and prohibition. This would appear to re-awaken the fears of competition lawyers, among others, that Mr Van Miert might start to blur what they saw as a consistent and orthodox line pursued by Sir Leon. But Mr Van Miert says competition policy cannot stand on its own, even if it remains the principal criterion in Commission decisions. Competition policy is the motor of economic growth - but it is useless unless, as he puts it, the 'bodywork' is also kept in good condition. 'My responsibility is to look after the motor in the first place, but not forgetting that it's part of an overall structure,' he says. By taking into account employment prospects the Commission is only responding to acute concern about the EC's growing unemployment rate, which is bound to figure in debate between EC leaders at this Friday's special summit in Brussels. 'It's hard to see how a society can survive with unemployment of 15 per cent or more,' Mr Van Miert points out. (The average EC unemployment rate is 12 per cent.) 'You can't just look at your competition textbook and say: 'That has to be No, and that's it.' You need to take into account the real situation.' Mr Van Miert's other concern is that competition policy should adequately reflect changes in the market for certain products. The Commission used to examine the effect on competition in national markets or the European market, but increasingly the world market is a more appropriate reference, particularly for electronics products. 'There are no ready-made solutions,' he says. As an example, the commissioner cites the approval he gave earlier this year to a joint venture between Philips of the Netherlands, and Thomson and Sagem of France to produce liquid crystal display screens. They were the only producers in the EC, but competition on the world market is so intense that the Commission decided it could allow them to co-operate in the research, development and production of LCD screens for strategic reasons. Internationally, Mr Van Miert is keen to promote a three-stage process for removing the remaining barriers to free competition. First, he says a level playing field must be created. For the EC, that would mean protecting EC airlines and telecoms companies, for example, until they were strong enough to face their US counterparts - 'who grew strong on the back of the biggest, best protected market in the world' - on equal terms. Otherwise, he says, 'it would be like starting a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight'. For the second stage, Mr Van Miert would take up an idea first mooted by Sir Leon 18 months ago: to challenge restrictive business practices worldwide, such as cartels, by setting minimum competition rules, enforced through the disputes settlement procedure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is one topic which Mr Van Miert hopes to discuss with the Japanese next month, building on what he claims is a new readiness by the Japanese authorities to tackle collusion between Japanese companies. 'We should tell them now: 'Really, enough is enough',' he says. Finally, and most ambitiously, Mr Van Miert - who was briefly environment commissioner last year - would like to prevent companies exploiting some countries' inferior environmental or social standards, by imposing minimum international rules in these sensitive policy areas. Such environmental and social concerns have rarely been voiced with such passion by an EC competition commissioner. But Mr Van Miert says that the broad thrust of EC competition policy has not really changed since the days of Sir Leon. In fact, in spite of his more aggressive profile, Sir Leon's approach was not always as strict as his most zealous fans would like to make out. Several of the decisions cited by Mr Van Miert as examples of Commission flexibility on job creation and markets were taken by his predecessor. Moreover, Mr Van Miert has proved himself capable of using the textbook - particularly against the public sector - when necessary. He has demonstrated genuine toughness in regulating state aid, notably to the ailing steel sector. This was the part of his job which he believed would be most challenging. Mr Van Miert insists on restricting state subsidies to some of Europe's largest publicly owned steel companies. He has banned subsidised construction of new capacity, and insisted on closures and job cuts in exchange for approval of existing state aid. In doing so, Mr Van Miert has faced down the Spanish government, which has agreed to cut capacity in the sensitive Basque region of the country, and is trying to manoeuvre the Italian and German authorities into a deal on their restructuring plans. Mr Van Miert hopes to table proposals for limiting state aid at a crucial meeting of EC industry ministers next month. To persuade them to approve the Commission proposals, he will warn ministers of what is likely to happen if they fail to take a decision. If capacity cuts are not made, he says, and state subsidies are not reduced, then recent modest price rises will be wiped out, and a potentially crippling race for state aid could ensue. 'I'm rather optimistic,' says Mr Van Miert. 'The situation in the sector is such that I think companies and governments will go for a deal. We're near to the end, but the last centimetres are always the most difficult.' PERSONAL FILE 1942    Born Oud-Turnhout, Belgium.  Graduate in diplomatic sciences,         Ghent University.

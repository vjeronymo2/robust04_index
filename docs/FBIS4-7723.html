			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 4 (TANJUG) - A Croatian radio  correspondent reported from Mostar on Monday evening that the  ceasefire has been seriously violated in this town in southern  Bosnia-Herzegovina after several heavy shells were fired from  Moslem east Mostar on Croat west Mostar.    Radio Free Europe reported this evening that two Moslem  soldiers were killed and four were wounded in Croat-Moslem  clashes near Gornji Vakuf.    Moslem Radio Sarajevo has not reported about Moslem-Croat  clashes around Gornji Vakuf these days, but Croatian radio  claims that the fighting is between two groups of smugglers.  The Croatian radio did not say which side sustained casualties.    Military sources of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) have  said that the HVO military police will try to seize the  smugglers, who are said to have "abused the reached agreements  on opening communications and are not refraining even from armed  clashes."    Bosnian Croats and Moslems signed an agreement on the  forming  of a Moslem-Croat federation in Washington in mid-March under  strong pressure from the United States. The federation  Constitution has already been adopted but clashes between the  two peoples continue. Serbs, the third nation who live in this  former Yugoslav republic were not invited to the Washington  talks.</p>

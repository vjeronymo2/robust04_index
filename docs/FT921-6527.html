			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: False rumours lift zinc market FALSE RUMOURS that one of the world's biggest zinc smelters was to cut production drove the metal's price up strongly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Zinc for delivery in three months closed at Dollars 1,180.50 a tonne, up Dollars 33.50. The price has risen by nearly 5 per cent this week on nervousness about supply disruptions even though analysts insist that stocks are high and rising and the market is heading for another supply surplus this year. After the market closed last night, Cominco, the Canadian group, denied persistent rumours that it was to cut output at its Trail smelter in British Columbia. The smelter is scheduled to produce 270,000 tonnes of zinc and 110,000 tonnes of lead this year. Cominco earlier announced a cut of 500 jobs at Trail to save Dollars 50m a year. Also underpinning the zinc price is the force majeure at Minero Peru's 93,000 tonnes-a-year Cajamarquilla smelter - although it is delivering some metal to customers - and labour contract talks at Big River Minerals' 80,000 tonnes-a-year smelter in the US. Analysts pointed out that nearly half of zinc demand came from the galvanised steel industry and the main users, the construction and automotive industries, were unlikely to recover from recession until towards the end of 1992. 'Demand is not healthy. There have not been enough cuts in production. But the market is being driven by sentiment,' said Ms Karen Norton, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group.</p>

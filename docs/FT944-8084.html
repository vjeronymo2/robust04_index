			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Data office reacts on TV claims Tougher measures to curb the sale of confidential financial information are being consdiered by the Office of the Data Protection Registrar following claims that personal information about British Telecommunications' customers is available on the black market. A Welsh language current affairs programme, The World on 4, revealed last night that itemised phone bills could be acquired on the black market, with details of bank and building society accounts and national insurance payments. Mrs Elizabeth France, the registrar of data protection, said yesterday her office was aware of such undertakings and was looking into ways to take strong action against offenders. She said: 'Recent changes approved to the criminal justice and public order bill will only come into force in January, and we are investigating how this will affect our powers. The sale of confidential data is of major concern to us, and we have held talks with British Telecom and other organisations on this issue.' BT said there may have been instances where personnel had given out confidential information. It said: 'In the unlikely event of a British Telecom employee giving or selling this information, the minimum penalty would be dismissal.' BT viewed the issue very seriously, but did not believe it to be a widespread problem.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Observer: Another Bath for Patten? The spectre of another election defeat has returned to haunt Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor who, as Tory party chairman, oversaw the Conservatives' fourth general election victory in 1992 only to lose his own seat, Bath, in the process. Tomorrow, Patten's plans for the development of democracy in Hong Kong come before the colony's Legislative Council. There he faces concerted opposition from the Liberal party, a grouping of mainly appointed conservative politicians, who want to water down his plans in a way they hope China will like. And guess who is the special adviser helping them with electioneering techniques and campaign organisation? Step forward Marian Elsden, a former chair of western counties' Liberal Democrats. In the run-up to the 1992 election, she was intimately involved in devising the campaign which ruined Patten's chances of taking higher office in the UK.</p>

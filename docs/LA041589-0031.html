			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SOMETHING WAS TERRIBLY WRONG';  </P> <P> HOW CONCERNED WORKERS BLEW WHISTLE ON NORTHROP  </P> <P> On her very first day at Northrop's Western Services Department in El Monte,  which produced guidance devices for nuclear-armed cruise missiles, Florence  Castaneda said she knew that "something was terribly wrong."  </P> <P> In an electronics "clean room," Northrop employees were smoking cigarettes,  boiling water for soup, eating lunch at their work stations and watching soap  operas on a television set mounted on the supervisor's desk, she recalled.  </P> <P> Castaneda noticed that instead of using industrial solvents to clean and  prepare circuit boards for soldering, workers were using a jar of Tarn-X, a  retail brand of polish for silverware.  </P> <P> "There was a price tag on it from Thrifty Drug Store," she recalled. "I hadn't  seen this kind of work being done in the aerospace industry."  </P> <P> A little more than three years after starting her job, Castaneda blew the  whistle on Northrop and played an important role in helping other Northrop  workers get in touch with Air Force officials.  </P> <P> As a result of their efforts, a federal indictment was filed earlier this week,  charging their former supervisor, Charles Gonsalves, with criminal fraud. Tests  were allegedly faked and in some cases not performed at all on cruise missile  guidance systems and on stabilization systems for Marine Corps jet fighters,  the indictment said.  </P> <P> Besides Gonsalves, criminal charges were filed against Northrop Corp. itself,  two high-ranking executives and two other supervisors. Northrop has said the  criminal charges against it and two current executives are "unwarranted," but  the firm has acknowledged that problems existed at the plant and that Gonsalves  and three other employees have been fired.  </P> <P> In December, 1987, the company shut down the operation. It has since cooperated  with federal investigators, according to Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tiny Outpost  </P> <P> The El Monte plant was just a tiny Northrop outpost, employing about 30 workers  and reporting to a parent organization in Newton, Mass. In the operation of the  multibillion-dollar corporation, Western Services Department somehow fell  between the cracks. Not only was the plant manager, Gonsalves, charged with  fraud, but the factory's quality assurance supervisor and its chief engineer  were indicted.  </P> <P> "They tried to tell me that I was a small person and that nobody would listen  to me," Castaneda said in an interview this week. It was Castaneda and her  fellow workers, Leocadio Barajas and Patricia Meyer, who alerted the government  to conditions at Northrop's Western Services Department.  </P> <P> Unlike many other defense industry whistle-blowers, Castaneda has no financial  stake in any False Claims Act law suits, which individuals can bring on behalf  of the government and share in the damages. She was motivated by a sense of  concern over "those nuclear missiles out there" that she always worried "could  be the start of World War III."  </P> <P> The recent indictments and the Air Force's examination of the missiles for  potential flaws have left her with little sense of vindication. The battle with  defense industry giant Northrop, she said, has left her alienated and has  destroyed her faith in the aerospace industry.  </P> <P> Castaneda's daughter contacted The Times last month, saying that somebody  should tell the story of how much trouble her mother and other Northrop workers  had in simply blowing the whistle.  </P> <P> "I called the FBI in November, 1986. They told me I sounded like a disgruntled  employee and that it was a case of sour grapes," Castaneda recalled. (Justice  Department officials declined to comment on Castaneda.)  </P> <P> It was not until a nephew in the Air National Guard arranged a meeting with Air  Force agents from the Office of Special Investigations that anybody would  listen to her story.  </P> <P> In January, 1987, an OSI agent came to her home in Baldwin Park and met with  Castaneda and fellow workers Barajas and Meyer. In an interview in August,  1987, Barajas confirmed that it was Castaneda who arranged the initial  interview with Air Force officials.  </P> <P> "Florence had earlier attempted to contact Northrop, but nothing ever  happened," Barajas said. "Pat Meyer and Florence called back east to Precision  Products Division (the corporate parent of Western Services Department) to say  problems were going on. After that, absolutely nothing was done. It disgusted  everybody. We knew that if we tried to complain, nothing would be done."  </P> <P> Barajas said he wrote an anonymous letter to corporate executives at Northrop,  but the letter eventually ended up back with Gonsalves. "He posted it on the  bulletin board to tell everybody that it wouldn't do any good to complain. He  laughed at it. He said, 'Whatever fool tried it didn't get anywhere.' "  </P> <P> After the investigation was launched in 1987, however, government agents met  with the employees once every other week at Barajas' house. Barajas provided  investigators with a computer tape used to falsify tests on cruise missile  guidance systems built at the plant.  </P> <P> At one point in the spring of 1987, the FBI asked permission to wire Barajas  for sound to collect evidence.  </P> <P> "I wasn't too happy," he recalled in the 1987 interview. "This tape recorder  was really big and bulky and it showed through my shirt. I said, 'This is the  FBI's modern technology?' I wished I had gone to Radio Shack and bought my own  tape recorder."  </P> <P> He then went to Gonsalves and said he had told the FBI that the company was  falsifying tests on the missile guidance units, Barajas said in the 1987  interview. On July 14, 1987, Barajas was fired.  </P> <P> Barajas and Meyer eventually allied themselves with attorney Herbert Hafif of  Claremont and filed a suit against Northrop, charging that the firm had  defrauded the government by improperly testing the missile components. The  Justice Department joined that suit last month.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Castaneda waged her own battle against Gonsalves and the company.  She started her job at Northrop on Oct. 23, 1983, as a senior  assembler/technician. She was certified by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration for a variety of electronics work, including soldering and  assembly. The certifications were granted by Caltech's Jet Propulsion  Laboratory and by three defense contractors, Loral, Perkin-Elmer and Honeywell.  </P> <P> Everything about the El Monte operation was out of the mainstream of the  aerospace industry, she said. For example, components such as wires did not  have "date codes," which are standard in the aerospace industry to provide for  traceability.  </P> <P> "When I started to raise concerns," Castaneda said, "Mr. Gonsalves told me that  if I just did my work like everybody else, we would get along.  </P> <P> "If you were in with the crowd, you could do whatever you wanted," she said.  "That meant going out to the track to place bets at lunch, coming to work  intoxicated or anything else you wanted to do.  </P> <P> "It was Mr. Gonsalves' intent to keep everything quiet. It was his own  operation, his own dynasty," she added. "When DCAS (the Defense Contract  Administration Service) would come in, Miss (Cheryl) Hannan would intimidate  them."  </P> <P> (Hannan was a quality assurance supervisor at the operation and was one of the  former Northrop officials indicted earlier this week.)  </P> <P> When Northrop shut down the El Monte facility in December, 1987, it fired  Gonsalves, Hannan and the two others. The company has acknowledged that the  operation was not following company procedures. Gonsalves and Hannan could not  be reached for comment this week.  </P> <P> In a hearing before the investigations panel of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee last year, Northrop Vice Chairman Frank W. Lynch testified that  Gonsalves' work "was inadequate or totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable  management performance."  </P> <P> Lynch testified that Northrop management learned of the problems at Western  Services Department from the government, which had learned about them from the  employees.  </P> <P> When asked why the employees went to the government instead of to Northrop  management, Lynch testified: "Well, unfortunately, sir, the manager of the  plant was involved in the decision to falsify or alter or not perform the  tests. So, this was being done with the knowledge of and the direction of the  manager.  </P> <P> "I don't think I would -- if I were in that situation -- I don't think I would  go to that individual . . . " he added.  </P> <P> In May, 1984, Castaneda was injured in a fall at work. While recovering, she  began to complain about conditions at the plant to several Northrop officials.  She said one official in the corporate medical department even came to her home  to listen to some of her concerns.  </P> <P> Barajas and Castaneda tried to contact the parent organization of the El Monte  operation, the Precision Products Division in Newton, Mass. But, as hourly  production workers, they apparently did not know the right people to talk to,  they said, or the officials they reached did not want to respond. Again,  nothing resulted from their efforts, they said.  </P> <P> In April, 1985, Castaneda went on temporary disability, a result of reinjuring  her back and of stress, she said. By then, Northrop had grown so concerned  about her allegations that it assigned a psychologist to her case through its  insurance adjuster, Industrial Indemnity, she said.  </P> <P> The psychologist, Cherry Ann Clark, visited her at home three times a week for  two hours each time for several months.  </P> <P> "She told me to forgive Northrop and to forgive Mr. Gonsalves -- to ask God to  forgive them -- and to just go back to work," she said.  </P> <P> "She would take me to her home or take me to a nice restaurant. When I would  cry, she would cry," Castaneda said.  </P> <P> "She got very friendly with my family," she said. "She sent my daughter  birthday cards. She hired my son to do some work around her house."  </P> <P> Clark, of San Marino, declined to comment on those statements, saying that her  relationship with Castaneda was confidential. She confirmed, however, that she  was assigned to some Northrop employee cases through Industrial Indemnity.  </P> <P> At one point, Clark also met with Barajas, Meyer and Castaneda together to give  them the same message about forgiving the company, Castaneda said. Ultimately,  Castaneda said, she grew disenchanted with the psychologist. One day, she  recalled, while talking to Clark in the psychologist's Lincoln Continental, she  opened the door of the parked car and got out.  </P> <P> "She was crying, begging me to get back in," Castaneda recalled. "I didn't  retain a lawyer until that October, when Northrop didn't send me a (disability)  check and I couldn't pay the rent." Northrop reinstated some of the disability  benefits, after Castaneda's attorney intervened.  </P> <P> For a time, Castaneda, a Potawatomi Indian, considered moving back to the  reservation where she grew up. But she decided against it when her children  insisted that she continue her battle to expose the problems at Northrop.  </P> <P> Castaneda left Northrop in April, 1987. Since then, she has attended a business  school to study automated accounting and was graduated several weeks ago. She  has begun to look for a job but has avoided the aerospace industry.  </P> <P> "When I can trust the system, I might try it again," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: An Imperial past For an exercise designed to enhance shareholder value, ICI's demerger has got off to a poor start. Paying a portion of this year's dividend out of reserves only to ask for the cash back in June is hardly the most tax-efficient way to proceed. If the demerged chemicals side keeps its promise to maintain the pay-out this year, that may also come indirectly from the proceeds of Zeneca's rights issue. Shareholders might equally be forgiven for balking at the Pounds 75m cost of separation. These misdemeanours will only be forgiven if demerger reverses ICI's long-term decline relative to the market. Yesterday's 6 per cent rise in the shares is therefore encouraging. The promise of a maintained dividend limits the downside in the near term: the yield is a match for the return on cash. But the act of demerger is unlikely to unlock much further value. Assuming a yield of perhaps 7 per cent for the degeared, demerged chemicals side results in a share price close to 500p. Given the market's suspicion of pharmaceuticals stocks and Zeneca's lacklustre performance, a yield over 5 per cent might be required to get the rights issue away. That suggests a valuation for the group not far from yesterday's closing price. The real test is whether liberated management can transform the fortunes of the group. Shorn of cash-generative pharmaceuticals, ICI chemicals will be under particular pressure to eliminate losses and take out costs. Yesterday's Pounds 516m rationalisation provision is another step in that direction. But ICI still looks over-manned, judged against the best of the competition. If ICI's management does not deliver this time around, someone else may be tempted to step in and do the chemicals job for them. Split, the business looks much less imperial than when Hanson bought its stake.</p>

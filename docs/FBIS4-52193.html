			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The death of Chang  Tok-su, a student of the faculty of business economics of Sejong  University in Seoul, in a reserve force training at a puppet  Army unit of South Korea on May 3, has turned out to have been  caused by a live bullet, not by a blank shot as had been  announced by the puppet Defence Ministry, according to a radio  report from Seoul.    This was verified when a M-16 gun bullet was found in his  body in an autopsy done by the Scientific Investigation  Institute on May 5.    Prof. Yi Yun-song of Seoul National University, who had  participated in the autopsy, also stated that the death of the  student was by a live bullet.    The bereaved family of the student and representatives of  Sejong University are angrily denouncing the criminal act of the  warmaniacs and strongly demanding the resignation of the puppet  minister of defence.    The General Student Council of Sejong University at a press  conference on May 4 urged the resignation of the puppet  minister of defence, declaring that Chang Tok-su died because of  the unprecedentedly intensive, murderous training.</p>

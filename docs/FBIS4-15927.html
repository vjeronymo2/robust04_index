			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Girgoriy Yavlinskiy, economic expert, Duma </F> deputy, and chairman of the "Yabloko" reform party, by Gemma  Poerzgen in Germany; date not given: "Russia's Change Must  Begin at the Roots"]    [Text] [Poerzgen] You are a deputy of the new Duma, the  Russian Parliament. What can you achieve there in political  terms?    [Yavlinskiy] We have no election law, no civil code, no  economic law, and no penal code. We have to create all this.  This has the utmost priority. And as long as this is the case,  work is very difficult. Sometimes this looks a bit wild and  exotic to the West.    [Poerzgen] In what respect is the new parliament different  from the old Supreme Soviet?    [Yavlinskiy] It has greater legitimacy. However, it is  nevertheless a transition parliament, rather a constitutional  assembly. Its role primarily is to amend the Constitution. In  short, our Duma must solve a number of basic tasks.    [Poerzgen] You are in Germany for a week to present your  book "Reform From Below -- Russia's New Future," which has now  also been published in German. In this book you write that an  era of reform has come to an end in Russia. The reform from  above must not be followed by reconstruction from below. What  does this mean specifically?    [Yavlinskiy] Reform begins only when the people's lives are  changing. The economic system, which we created 80 years ago,  is rooted very deeply. Thus, if we really want to change this  system, we must begin at the roots. If we bring about changes  there, we can also solve the bigger tasks. Russia is an  enormous country, where very different people live, and they  have very different ideas of success and of how one should live.  If we really want to achieve something, these people must be  permitted to act as they consider right. Moscow cannot answer  all these questions.    [Poerzgen] This means that the Russian Federation needs  stronger decentralization and regionalization?    [Yavlinskiy] Moscow must look to the regions and listen what  the people there want and help them to do what they want. If  one region wants to implement reform in this own way, it must be  supported in this. And if other regions take different paths,  Moscow must help there, too. This is very important regarding  the entire legislation, for instance. It is impossible that  someone in the capital city thinks up the laws. They should be  shaped in such a way that they take the interests of those  people who have to live with these laws into consideration. The  central power is needed to implement the laws as soon as they  have grown from below. It must take care that they are indeed  observed. This would then be a rule- of-law state with a reform  from below and control from above.    [Poerzgen] Another point that clearly distinguishes from  other reformers is the importance that you attribute to social  security.    [Yavlinskiy] As long as the people do not have the  possibility to earn their living themselves, this is  unavoidable. We can take a more liberal economic course only to  the extent to which we manage to give the people the opportunity  to earn their living. Just imagine for a moment what would have  happened if eastern Germany had not had western Germany. The  government would have been deposed and it would have been said:  Do what you want: laissez faire. And what would have  happened? No system can work in this way. Liberalism must  include the people are able to earn their living. If a country  has been structured like one big single enterprise for 80 years,  one cannot turn it into a market economy overnight.    [Poerzgen] Now you are trying to implement your approach of  a different reform policy in the region of Nishniy Novgorod?    [Yavlinksiy] In Nishniy Novgorod we have set ourselves a  very specific task. We have changed the system of social  safeguards and, at the same time, we have begun with  privatization. Thus, in Russia there are, for instance, a large  number of apartments that are administered by the enterprises.  The enterprises must use 90 percent of their profits to  maintain the apartments, for kindergartens, and for other social  tasks. Such an enterprise cannot develop, no one is going to  invest in it. If such a company is closed down, the entire town  is closed down.    In Nizhniy Novgorod we take the money that has so far been  used to maintain the apartments and channel it into the people's  income. At the same time, we give them housing. Interestingly  enough, the costs immediately go down to one-third. And  therefore one must not frighten the people. One must not tell  them that the apartments are privatized, but it is better that  one calls them housing cooperatives. That is something that the  people understand. As soon as the cooperative has been  established, the people find it possible to rent certain rooms  and can afford craftsmen for repairs. And this continues to  develop. If many of these cooperatives develop, they can become  shareholders, for instance in the gas sector or waste disposal.  In this way it is possible, bit by bit, to take social services  out of the enterprises. This is what I call the conversion of  social infrastructure.    [Poerzgen] Do you find support for your ideas in the  government?    [Yavlinskiy] Somehow, no one is really against it. But no  one does anything for it, either. Everyone talks more about how  high the dollar exchange rate is than about the budget deficit.  Of course, this is very important, but we will never achieve a  normal dollar exchange rate and an acceptable budget deficit as  long as we do not put the institutional framework of our  national economy in order.    [Poerzgen] What kind of support do you expect from the  West?    [Yavlinskiy] The most important thing is intellectual and  moral support. For us it is primarily important that the West  understands the problems that we have to solve.    [Poerzgen] Do you find this understanding?    [Yavlinskiy] Unfortunately no. First, it is probably not  easy. Second, politics in the West has long become a show in  many respects. Fortunately, most people in the West live and  work far removed from politics. However, the principles of this  show are also applied in the relationship with our country.  Therefore, times of ardent love for Russia are again and again  replaced by times of hysterical cooling down. Perhaps this is  good for Western policy. We, on the other hand, need a calm and  sober look at what we are doing. We do not want do be praised  to high heaven, nor do we want to be damned. We need calm and  sober cooperation that remains independent of personal political  ambitions. We would want the West not so much to be oriented  toward individual persons, but to look more at the processes.  Then our cooperation would be more solid.    Regarding financial aid, I am, first, of the opinion that we  must repay our debts. Second, it is not the scope of aid that  is most important but specific projects. For instance, I would  prefer seeing $100 million spent on providing farmers with  technical equipment, for instance mini-transporters. This is  better than getting billions of dollars so that the government  uses them for stabilizing the ruble. I think that it is more  important for the stabilization of the ruble that the farmer is  able to take his potatoes to the shops.    [Poerzgen] How do you assess the work of Western advisers in  this connection?    [Yavlinskiy] First of all, I am grateful to all who help  Russia. However, I would like to recall that, in  pre-revolutionary Russia, engineers who built bridges stood  under them when the first train went across. After all, the  lives of many people are involved. One must be aware of this  responsibility.</p>

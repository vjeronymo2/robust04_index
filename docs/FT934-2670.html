			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / MoD trains its big guns on commercial target By any international standards, Britain's Ministry of Defence has already gone a long way down the road to privatisation and commercial management. But while senior defence officials are convinced that market-testing will bring significant savings, the benefits so far are hard to evaluate. Ten years ago the MoD made its own ammunition and refitted its own ships. But since 1987 the Royal Ordnance munitions factories have been part of British Aerospace. The dockyards have been under commercial management and are now to be sold. In April this year the 6,800 employees at the Atomic Weapons Establishment, which makes nuclear warheads, left the civil service when Hunting-Brae, a private consortium, took over full managerial responsibility. In all these areas, the workload from the MoD has fallen drastically. The government wants to keep both the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards, and plans soon to invite separate tenders for their privatisation. But top navy officers have argued that a single dockyard, working to capacity, could be tens of millions of pounds a year more efficient. The Commons public accounts committee earlier this year found that uncertainty and falls in workload 'made it difficult for the commercial managers to operate on a fully commercial basis and improve efficiency', but costs had been cut (the two dockyards, like Royal Ordnance, have cut workforces by two-thirds in 10 years). Recent contracts include the MoD's computer services centre, now run by Hoskyns, the information-technology company. The initial stages of RAF and Navy flying training, at Topcliffe in North Yorkshire, have been contracted out to Hunting. The Army Base Repair Organisation, which repairs army fighting vehicles is being market-tested. The National Audit Office recently estimated that savings from private-sector competition averaged 24 per cent, or Pounds 64m a year. It said the policy had cut 17,300 posts since 1979. Defence activities figure strongly among the government executive agencies currently being reviewed. The MoD's experience with private contractors has not all been good, however. It recently cancelled a contract with a company, Airwork, which it blamed for causing damage 'of a very serious nature' to Tornado fighters which it was modifying. And when the NAO asked the opinion of MoD officials monitoring cleaning contracts, it found that only a third considered the ministry was getting value for money.</p>

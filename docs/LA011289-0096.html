			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERN PHONE;  </P> <P> DIAL F FOR THE FUTURE -- IT'S HERE  </P> <P> When telecommunications executive Lee Cox begins the daily commute to his  office in San Francisco, he presses a button on his car phone to hear a summary  of traffic conditions. By punching another button on the phone, he can retrieve  a stream of voice-mail messages recorded overnight by colleagues stationed  around the world.  </P> <P> With other buttons, Cox can tap into stock market reports, pick up scores of  ball games or get a rundown on the weather outlook for the weekend.  </P> <P> Cox, president of PacTel Corp., clearly has far more at his fingertips than all  but a handful of telephone customers. But that won't be true for long. The once  basic-black telephone is about to become supercharged with new computerized  features and capabilities that are expected to come into widespread use in the  1990s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wider Possibilities  </P> <P> And Cox is barely scratching the surface of what can be done with the telephone  today -- not to mention what will commonly be done tomorrow. Although rarely  used as such, the dozen push-buttons on the common phone can actually function  as keys on a computer terminal. By pressing a button or combination of buttons,  a caller can choose among a broadening array of information services, enter a  pledge in a fund drive, reply to a recorded opinion poll, or select and charge  merchandise from catalogues.  </P> <P> As phone companies finish converting their switches to carry information in  digital form, the old twin strands of twisted copper wires linking homes,  offices and factories will be transformed into high-speed conduits that carry  voice, computer data and video transmissions -- all at the same time and over a  single phone line.  </P> <P> And the key to unlocking that wealth of information is the common and  ubiquitous telephone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expanding Market  </P> <P> The types of services Cox receives through his car phone already are widely  available to people who subscribe to databases and have computers linked to  phone lines with communications devices called modems. But the phone system of  the 1990s promises to dramatically open the market for these and other services  by making them easier and cheaper to use. No longer will the user have to buy  or learn how to use comparatively costly computer equipment; anyone with a  push-button phone will be able to tap in.  </P> <P> Once the power of the computer becomes readily accessible through a phone's  key-pad, it produces a sort of "superphone" that may change life styles and  work patterns before the start of the 21st Century, said Richard Adler, a  futurist specializing in such "teleservices" for the Institute of the Future in  Menlo Park, Calif.  </P> <P> "You will more and more have the option to do at home what you had to do at the  office before," Adler said. "People will choose to do at home what is  convenient, and when they leave home it will be a matter of choice -- for  socializing, business, recreation or diversion."  </P> <P> Larry L. (Butch) Brown of Natchez, Miss., is part of a tiny minority of  telephone customers getting a taste of the future today, and he is clearly  enthusiastic about his phone's new powers. "It's an incredible instrument,"  Brown said. "I couldn't live without it."  </P> <P> The local phone service available to Natchez's 22,000 residents through South  Central Bell offers features few consumers are familiar with. For one thing,  the Brown household's busy phone now can vary its ring to let each of the four  family members know for whom the bell sounds.  </P> <P> "If there are three short, quick rings we know it's for our son," Brown  explained. "If there are two short, quick rings it's for our daughter. If it's  the regular ring we know it's for us."  </P> <P> The Browns' phone also can intercept unwanted calls, answering these with a  message explaining that the call will not be accepted. If the Browns can't get  to the phone before it stops ringing, no problem: Push a button and the phone  will call back whatever number was last on the line. And if the family becomes  bothered by crank or obscene calls, it can signal South Central Bell's computer  to record the time of day and phone numbers of the parties on the line.  </P> <P> And that's not all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technological Wizardry  </P> <P> "If I only want to get one call, I can program that into the phone, which will  reject all other calls but put that one through, or forward it to wherever I'm  headed," Brown said. "And if I dial a line that's busy, I can program the phone  so it keeps calling every 10 seconds or so until it gets through. Then it calls  me!"  </P> <P> Each of these features adds $4 to $5 a month to the family's phone bill, but  Brown said he considers the enhancements worth the extra cost.  </P> <P> In communities here and there across the nation that are served by a similar  computerized switching system, such services are now on the market. Over the  next three to five years, these features will become widely available as  switches everywhere are upgraded. Pacific Bell, for example, plans to begin  offering them next year, first in the San Francisco Bay Area. And GTE  California is conducting tests in Lancaster, Carpenteria and Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> By the early 1990s, the technology should spread worldwide and be far beyond  the testing phase. Plans are in the works for a seamless, global network  capable of carrying conversations, computer data and video signals  simultaneously over the phone lines already running into homes and businesses.  Consequently, callers will not get a busy signal, as now, when the phone line  is carrying computer data.  </P> <P> Just last month American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, British Telecom and France  Telecom inaugurated a new transatlantic, fiber-optic cable that extends that  capability across the ocean; another consortium expects to offer transpacific  service next spring.  </P> <P> The key to supercharging the telephone lies in completing a network  "intelligent" enough to understand computer and video "talk" without requiring  customers to hook on special devices such as the modems now needed to send data  over telephone lines, said Richard Brennan, a senior consultant for AT&amp;T  Technologies in San Ramon, Calif. Brennan calls this intelligent network "the  major revolution in the telephone since Alexander Graham Bell invented it."  </P> <P> The beauty of this transformation is that it requires changing the big central  switching devices but nothing between there and the customer, Brennan said. And  once these potent switches are interconnected, what emerges is an "integrated  services digital network," or ISDN. This is a network built to a common set of  electronic standards, or protocols, that convert communications signals from  devices of all kinds to a single format that then can be transmitted at the  speed of light rather than of sound.  </P> <P> The ISDN technology splits each existing phone line into three communications  channels. That makes it possible, for example, for one member of a household to  send computer data while another uses a phone on the same line to call a  friend; the same line also can be used for such chores as monitoring a  household security system, turning on lights or an air conditioner, or letting  a utility company read water, gas and electric meters from its office.  </P> <P> At that point, said Sudhir (Sid) Ahuja, who heads a research unit at AT&amp;T's  Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, N.J., true electronic meetings become possible.  "You and I can literally have a meeting as if we were sitting across from one  another."  </P> <P> In an electronic meeting, participants don't gather around a table but before  phones and video screens in any locations linked by ISDN technology. The  screens can display small images of each participant as well as documents and  charts to be worked on during the meeting, with movable, color-coded "pointers"  -- one keyed to each participant -- so that all hands know who is proposing  what changes.  </P> <P> "You can share information, and you can shift from one 'meeting' to another by  putting someone on 'hold,' or bring in a third party," Ahuja said. GTE  California operates a similar network linking 60 computer terminals and  telephones in its offices in Ontario and Norwalk with company headquarters in  Thousand Oaks. "We use it on a day-to-day basis," said Lennard D. Glogauer,  general manager of business applications.  </P> <P> Is this all too complicated for most people? Adler, the futurist, acknowledged  that there are human limits. For one thing, he said, electronic meetings work  best with teams and groups accustomed to sharing and coordinating activities  and information.  </P> <P> "Where it doesn't work so well," he said, "is in sensitive negotiations --  where, as someone put it, you want to go in and pound on somebody's table."  </P> <P> The effect of the technology on social behavior can be overstated, Adler  warned. He recalled the unfulfilled predictions of a few years ago that  computers would create "paperless" offices. For example, he said, electronic  meetings might seem likely to reduce the need for business travel but in fact  seems to encourage it.  </P> <P> "Studies over more than a decade show that the more people communicate the more  reason they have to get together," he explained. "What it does do is let people  work together more intensively on a regular basis."  </P> <P> Moreover, changes in the way people live may be no greater than those triggered  by such previous major technological advances as the automobile or television,  Adler said. Broadcasting, for example, "brought the salesman into the home,"  and advanced telephone technology will extend that phenomenon to "bring the  stores into the home."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Major Test Planned  </P> <P> On a national scale, advanced telecommunications will get its first major  commercial test later this year as the federal government begins phasing into  operation an integrated telephone system that soon will tie together its vast  and dispersed civilian work force. To perform the work, the General Services  Administration awarded a pair of multibillion-dollar contracts last month to  teams headed by AT&amp;T and U S Sprint to install the new system to serve the  government's civilian employees nationwide into the new century.  </P> <P> And in California, Fresno recently awarded a $2.9-million contract to Pacific  Bell to build the state's first such advanced system. The city now must  maintain two separate networks -- one to carry conversations, the other data,  explained Paul Romito, assistant director of general services.  </P> <P> "We needed something that would be good for 10 years," he said.  </P> <P> These advanced phone systems, said Ahuja of Bell Labs, allow "even more  flexibility in your working hours. If you get a great idea at midnight, you can  get up and work on it. Or you can cross time zones" -- sending messages for  retrieval during normal business hours -- "and yet, you can work the  information in an integrated fashion -- voice, data or video."  </P> <P> "It's just pushing along the natural thrust right now to make things more  flexible," he said. "Communications are already going that way -- for example,  with car phones. This does the same with information generally."  </P> <P> Most local phone companies are testing such information services on a limited  basis. In Cerritos, for example, GTE California is about to begin an ambitious  program that will offer to a sampling of residents information services and  cable television by phone line, with a wide selection of films and starting  times. Eventually, these connections will be upgraded to high-capacity,  static-free, fiber-optic cables, making live video transmissions possible,  among other things.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consumer Interest  </P> <P> One marketing goal is to learn just what services appeal to consumers -- not to  mention what they are willing to pay for them, said Donald Bache, the project's  general manager. "This is a real-world test of new services and technology."  </P> <P> There will, of course, be a price to pay for the technology that makes these  advanced phone services possible. The basic phone bill of those who subscribe  to the new features will easily double from the $25 a month paid today by the  typical California residential customer. Consumer groups are worried, however,  that all of this new technology will inevitably also mean higher costs for all  customers -- even those who only want inexpensive, local phone service.  </P> <P> But AT&amp;T consultant Brennan maintains that "the bottom line is that if you  don't want to do any of this you don't have to. It's kind of like broadcast TV  versus cable TV versus pay TV.  </P> <P> "There will be levels of telephone service," he said. "This will give you more  options and greater flexibility. You'll be able to design your own telephone  network."  </P></p>

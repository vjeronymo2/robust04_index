Mohamed Salah Dembri  delivered a message from Algerian President Liamine Zeroual to  President Konare. His discussions with the Malian leaders  centered on the internal situation in Mali and Algeria and on  major subregional issues.    [Paris AFP in French at 0802 GMT on 9 March, in a  Bamako-datelined item, adds: "Malian President Alpha Oumar  Konare held talks yesterday with Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri on the Tuareg issue. Their talks focused  mainly on obstacles to the implementation of the national peace  pact signed in April 1992 between the Malian Government and the  Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad, MFUA, whose guarantor is  Algeria. MFUA has called for Algerian participation in a  meeting in Bamako on the integration of former rebels into the  regular Malian Army. This appeal comes at a time when divisions  within the Tuareg movements who signed the peace pact have led  to the death of four Tuaregs including Colonel Bilal Saloum, one  of the main architects of the peace pact."]</p>

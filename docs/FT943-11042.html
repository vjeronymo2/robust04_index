			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / MMC to put more work out to tender The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to develop further the selective contracting out of its work on references and demonstrate more fully how it spends public money. The changes follow a review commissioned by the government from Price Waterhouse, the management consultants, on the MMC's financial management. Price Waterhouse made a number of recommendations on how the management of the commission's work could be improved. Overall, however, these will not change greatly the way the commission works. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the review had concluded that the commission had been effective in its role as an investigative body and had carried out its responsibilities 'in an independent, professional and fair manner'. One of the most important improvements will be the publication of annual accounts from 1995-96 in addition to the regular annual review. The commission will also be increasing the contracting-out of reference work. It said yesterday it had always used outside contractors, but was bringing its practices fully into line with European Union rules on open bidding for public contracts. Mr Hamilton said the commission would also improve liaison with the Office of Fair Trading to minimise duplicate burdens on businesses. The commission employs about 90 staff and has an annual budget of Pounds 5.5m.</p>

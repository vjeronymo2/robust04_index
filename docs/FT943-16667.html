			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Mannesmann share jolt as chief faces inquiry Shares in Mannesmann, one of Germany's largest companies, were jolted yesterday by news that state prosecutors had launched a wide-ranging investigation into Mr Werner Dieter, the company's chief executive, for alleged fraud. Mr Rolf Chanteaux, a spokesman for the state prosecutor in Dusseldorf, where the engineering conglomerate is based, said investigations had begun into Mr Dieter's alleged 'activities which are likely to harm the company'. The probe could damage Mr Dieter's chances of becoming chief of Mannesmann's supervisory board. 'On the basis of preliminary inquiries we have launched a full investigation,' Mr Chanteaux said, declining to give any further details. Mannesmann's share price fell to DM397 from an opening price of DM404 but recovered in afternoon trading in Frankfurt to close at DM402. The shares stood at DM446 before Spiegel magazine published an article three weeks ago alleging irregularities in Mr Dieter's private business activities. Spiegel alleged that Mr Dieter had forced Rexroth, a Mannesmann subsidiary, to buy hydraulic accessories from Hydac, a company mainly owned by Mr Dieter's family. Mr Dieter yesterday said his family owned 57.5 per cent of Hydac and a further 50 per cent of Hydac Filter, another company. Family shareholders held up to 75 per cent in a variety of smaller, related companies. However, he said, the relationship between Rexroth and Hydac had existed since 1963 and had been fully discussed when he took over as Mannesmann's chief executive in 1985. He said the business supplied by Hydac represented only a fraction of Rexroth's activities and could have had no impact on the latter company, whose turnover has grown from around DM10m (Pounds 4m) in 1960 to DM3.3bn now. Both companies were 'entirely competitive' and Rexroth had been able to offer its international clients much better service through its long-term relationship with Hydac, Mr Dieter said. The Mannesmann group lost DM513m last year on sales of DM27.96bn. Mr Dieter is due to step down as chief executive and take over as chairman of the supervisory board, a non-executive body. The move was to have been announced at the group annual meeting next Friday but Mr Dieter, 64, admitted his chances of securing the post were now diminishing.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The language in 5(e)(1)(A) is amended to provide that the answer to the show cause order state the reasons for contesting ``that the facts alleged in the order to show cause constitute a pattern of violations.'' In subsection 5(e)(1)(C), the words ``to comply with IC 13&hyph;4.1, 310 IAC 12, or any permit condition required by IC 13&hyph;4.1 or 310 IAC 12'' are added at the end of the clause. The Director finds that these changes add to the clarity of the provision are consistent with 43 CFR 4.1192(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 5(f) is amended by replacing the word ``response'' with ``an answer.'' The word ``permittee's'' is added before the word ``receipt.'' ``Show cause order'' has been amended to read ``order to show cause.'' The Director finds that these non-substantive changes add to the clarity of the provision and can be approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In subsection 5(g)(1), ``a response'' is replaced by ``an answer.'' A new second sentence is added to read ``[t]he proceeding is commenced when the permittee files an answer under subsection (e).'' In the third sentence the phrase ``complaint and proposed order'' is changed to ``order to show cause.'' The Director finds that these changes improve the clarity of the provision and are consistent with 30 CFR 843.13(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 5(g)(2) is amended to provide that the administrative law judge (ALJ) shall ``issue findings and a written recommendation to the commission that the permit either'' be suspended or revoked. Prior to this change, the language provided that the ALJ shall ``order the permit either suspended or revoked.'' The second sentence is amended to provide ``[i]n issuing findings and a written recommendation to the commission'' the listed standards shall apply. The Director finds that this change is consistent with Indiana law that the Natural Resources Commission (the commission) is the ultimate authority for decisions to revoke permits, and the provision is consistent with 30 CFR 843.13(c) and 43 CFR 4.1194(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection 5(g)(2)(C) provides that the ALJ shall comply with the requirements of IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27(a) through IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27(d) and IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27(g). Subsection 5(g)(2)(C) also provides that the provisions of IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27(e) and IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27(f) shall not apply to show cause proceedings. The Indiana statutes at IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27 concern the preparation of findings for final orders. IC 4&hyph;21.5&hyph;3&hyph;27 (e) and (f) appropriately do not apply. Subsection 27(e) authorizes the ALJ to allow the parties time after the conclusion of the hearing for the submission of proposed findings. The substance of subsection 27(e) is contained in proposed new subsection 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5(g)(2)(D) and is, therefore, unnecessary. Subsection 27(f) provides for a 90-day deadline for the issuance of written findings following the hearing. Subsection 27(f), therefore, is inconsistent with the 60-day time limit for the filing of written findings following a hearing provided for by 30 CFR 843.13(c). The Director finds that these proposed provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 843.13(c) and 30 CFR Part 4 concerning hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New subsection 5(g)(2)(D) provides that any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing of record, the ALJ may allow the parties to submit briefs and proposed findings. The Director finds that this provision is consistent with the Federal hearing procedures at 43 CFR Part 4.1126. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New subsection 5(g)(3) sets ten-day deadlines for the written recommendations of the ALJ following a hearing or following the permittee's answer if no hearing is requested. The Director finds this provision to be consistent with 43 CFR 4.1194(c) and that it partially addresses the required amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New subsection 5(g)(4) prohibits the filing of objections to a director's recommendation under 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5(f) by a person who did not comply with 310 IAC 0.6&hyph;1&hyph;5(e) concerning contesting an order to show cause. The Director finds that in total, the Indiana program contains the same or similar procedural requirements as the Federal regulations, and in particular, the proposed provision is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 843.13 and 43 CFR 4.1191 and 4.1192. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Marriott to split into two units MARRIOTT, the large US hotels and food services group, is to split its management operations and its property assets into two separate stock market quoted companies. Under the 'demerger', Marriott will place its lodging, food and facilities management operations and its retirement housing in Marriott International. Shareholders will receive shares in the new company pro rata to their holdings in Marriott Corporation. Marriott will retain most of the group's property assets and its airport and tollroad concessions. This company will be renamed Host Marriott. Shares in both companies will be listed in New York. Marriott saw rapid profits growth during the 1980s through a strategy of developing and selling hotel assets but retaining operating control. However, the group has since been held back by a heavy debt burden and the difficulties of offloading property assets in a depressed market. In 1991 Marriott made an operating profit of Dollars 478m (Pounds 268m) on sales of Dollars 8.33bn, but profits after tax and interest of only Dollars 82m. Long-term debt (including Dollars 200m of convertible subordinated debt) at the start of 1992 topped Dollars 3bn. Mr J. Willard Marriott, chairman, said: 'This transaction will permit Marriott International to focus its efforts on expansion of management businesses, where individual opportunities require relatively small amounts of capital.' Marriott International will be the larger company, with annual sales (on 1991 figures) of about Dollars 7.4m, and operating cashflow, before interest, of nearly Dollars 500m. It will take on very little of Marriott's long-term debt. Chains managed by Marriott include Courtyard, Residence Inn, Fairfield Inn, Marriott Ownership Resorts and Marriott Hotels. Host Marriott will have annual sales (on 1991 figures) of Dollars 1.7bn, and operating cashflow of more than Dollars 350m. It will own 141 Marriott lodging properties and 16 retirement communities, and retail 'most of Marriott Corporation's long-term debt obligations'. Marriott rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 in New York. The demerger could be completed by mid-1993, conditional on tax and shareholder approval.</p>

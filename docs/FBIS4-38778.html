			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- At the evening plenary sitting of the  Supreme Council on 1 June, at which the situation in Crimea was  considered, the resolutions offered by the president of Ukraine  and the working commission which was drafting deputies'  proposals, was not approved. The working group was charged with  drafting this resolution. A resolution of the Supreme Council  "On the implementation of the resolution by the Supreme Council  of Ukraine of 20 May 1994 `On terminating the effect of the Law  of the Republic of Crimea,' `On the restoration of the  constitutional fundamentals of statehood of the Republic of  Crimea'" was approved after its new wording had been discussed.  It indicates that the resolution by the Supreme Council of  Ukraine of 20 May 1994, in that part of it which stipulates the  termination of the effect of the above Law of the Republic of  Crimea, is valid. The resolution determines that the Supreme  Council of Crimea failed to fulfill the demands stipulated by  the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine "On putting  into effect the law of Ukraine `On introducing amendments and  additions to the Law of Ukraine,' `On the status of the  autonomous Republic of Crimea'" of 30 June 1992 which did not  allow to put this Law into effect. The commission for issues of  legal policy and judicial and legal reform was charged with  submitting in two weeks' time a resolution for the consideration  of the Supreme Council on bringing the entire legislation of  Crimea in line with the legislation of Ukraine.    The president of Ukraine, as a guarantor of the Constitution  of Ukraine, was proposed to submit within six days a list and  sequence of measures which stem from the Constitution and the  current legislation of Ukraine and which can be taken by the  bodies of state power of Ukraine.    Also considered at the sitting was the proposal by the  president of Ukraine, which was contained in his message to  parliament, on the inexpediency of holding the elections to the  president and local self-government bodies on 26 June.  Oleksandr Moroz submitted a draft resolution envisaging that  postponement of the election is inexpedient. However, the  majority of deputies were inclined to the need for more  substantial consideration of this issue in the groups and  commissions. Some of the deputies proposed that the  presidential election and the election of the chairmen of the  oblast councils be cancelled and elections at other levels be  held. Mykhaylo Kosiv of Rukh [People's Movement of Ukraine]  emphasized the need to introduce amendments and additions to the  Law on local self-government before the 26 June elections and  thus remove Leonid Kravchuk's arguments about their  inexpediency.    Representatives of the communists' group supported the  holding of elections and proposed that Leonid Kravchuk "meet the  day of his defeat worthily." It was resolved to postpone  consideration of this issue and the adoption of a decision on  this issue till the morning sitting on 2 June.    At the request of the provisional credentials committee "in  connection with new facts concerning the election of Volodymyr  Hrynyov and Pavlo Kudyukin as people's deputies of Ukraine" it  was decided to give the commission another week to ascertain the  results of the election. During this week the commission is to  pay a second visit to the electoral districts.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Project design <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Had all important aspects of project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design been considered?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transmission availability <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Were transmission capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or wheeling services available to deliver the energy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the BPA grid?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site control <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Developers were asked to provide copies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of lease documents or other evidence of site control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Development schedule <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Was the development schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realistic, well thought out, and logical? Did it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all important activities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Environmental impacts/siting issues/permits and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licenses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . To what extent had environmental and siting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues been identified? What progress had been made in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtaining permits and licenses? BPA staff consulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with land management agencies in the project areas, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested additional information from developers, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost of energy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This was used more as a starting point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for negotiations than as a selection criterion. BPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not expect developers to commit to a price until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terms and conditions of the power contract were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better known. Another reason for not selecting based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on price was to avoid being forced to select weak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects with unrealistic power prices and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discourage ``low-ball'' bids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evaluation process included a preliminary evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals, followed by requests from the BPA project team for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information and a final evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An issue of site control affecting the two proposed projects at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Newberry Volcano was examined. The ownership or ownership share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of three leases_OR 11987, OR 11992, and OR 45506_was a matter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dispute between CEC and Vulcan. Since both developers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered it likely that litigation would be necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolve this dispute, and because BPA's decision to purchase only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output was thought to place all risk of nonperformance on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developer, this was not a critical factor in the selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BPA team selected three projects for further consideration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the Administrator was briefed and a final decision made on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 17, 1991. The proposers were notified of BPA's decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by registered letter between December 18 and December 20, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The December 18 letter to Vulcan Power Company, which was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected, explained the reasons for BPA's decision. The CEC/EWEB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project was stronger in many respects and met BPA requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for utility cost sharing. Also, Vulcan lacked a history of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful project development (the one project it attempted was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unsuccessful). As noted in the December 1990 Geothermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Resources Council BULLETIN article mentioned above, only one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project would be chosen at each site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Contract Negotiations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The three projects selected for contract discussions were Glass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountain, Vale, and the CEC/EWEB Newberry Project. All three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects were considered capable of meeting the goals of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Total output from the three projects exceeded the 30 aMW  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA agreed to purchase in the solicitation. But because the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the power purchase contracts and the degree of participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by other utilities were not known at this time (only one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects had identified a utility partner), and in the interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of meeting program goals, BPA agreed to consider purchasing more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 30 aMW. The Glass Mountain and Vale Projects will, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, be the subject of separate Records of Decision, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not be discussed further in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Negotiations for the Newberry Project began in January 1992, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were completed in December 1992. The negotiations resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three proposed agreements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A Power Purchase Agreement between CEC and BPA; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A Billing Credits Generation Agreement between EWEB and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A Power Purchase Agreement between CEC and EWEB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under its Power Purchase Agreement with CEC, BPA would purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 20 average megawatts of output from the project and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive an option on an additional 67 megawatts, if available in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the future. Under its Power Purchase Agreement with CEC, EWEB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would purchase 10 average megawatts from the project and receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an option on 33 megawatts, if available. BPA would give EWEB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billing credits for 10 average megawatts under a Billing Credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generation Agreement. The term of the agreements is 50 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the commercial operation date of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The price of energy will not exceed BPA's Alternative Cost, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established in BPA's 1990 Billing Credit Solicitation. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Cost is the estimated cost which BPA would incur as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of acquiring new resources, and is the upper limit on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of a billing credit other than conservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Memorandum of Understanding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between CE Newberry, Inc. (a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidiary of the California Energy Company), EWEB, and BPA was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> executed on December 17, 1992. The MOU acknowledged that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties had reached agreement on contract principles, and defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the roles of the parties during the environmental review required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by NEPA. The MOU noted that BPA had not made a final decision to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sign any power purchase or other agreements, and that such power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase obligation would not arise, if at all, until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts of the proposed Newberry Project had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyzed in accordance with NEPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Considerations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national charter for protection of the environment. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes policy, sets goals, and provides means for carrying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out its policy. NEPA requires Federal agencies to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental information available to public officials and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citizens before decisions are made and before actions are taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accurate scientific analysis, expert agency comments, and public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrutiny are essential to implementing NEPA. The NEPA process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to help public officials make decisions that are based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on an understanding of environmental consequences. NEPA mandates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Federal agencies use all practical means to protect,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restore, and enhance the quality of the human environment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid or minimize any possible adverse effects of their actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon the quality of the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Environmental Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 2, 1992, a Notice of Intent to Prepare an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in accordance with NEPA was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This EIS would analyze the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of various alternatives related to the development of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project (Newberry Project).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Forest Service (USFS) would be the Lead Agency in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process; the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and BPA would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cooperating Agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA adopted the Newberry Geothermal Pilot Project Final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (DOE/EIS&hyph;0207, June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994). The FEIS was tiered to the Resource Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statement (RPEIS&hyph;DOE/EIS&hyph;0162), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered the environmental tradeoffs among the resource types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to meet BPA's need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FEIS evaluated the exploration, development, utilization,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and decommissioning phases of the Newberry Project as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related transmission, wheeling, and billing credit components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative A is the CEC/EWEB proposal, and Alternative B is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three Federal agencies' modification of the proposal. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to identifying and analyzing the environmental impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these two alternatives for the proposed Newberry Project, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FEIS also evaluated the No Action alternative. The Power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purchase and Billing Credits Agreements require that the Newberry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project meet all Federal, state, and local requirements. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FEIS fulfills the requirements of the National Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Policy Act (NEPA) and meets the needs of the USFS and the BLM,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who have documented their decisions in a separate, joint Record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Decision (ROD). BPA has also determined that this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the Council's 1991 Power Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following alternatives were considered in the EIS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative A is the proposal as submitted by CE Exploration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CEE, a subsidiary of the California Energy Company). It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes exploration, development, production, utilization,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and decommissioning of the geothermal resources on CEE's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal geothermal leases on the west flank of Newberry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volcano. Highlights of this alternative, which is described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in more detail in the FEIS, include development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploration/production well pads at 14 specific locations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction and operation of one 33&hyph;MW (gross output) power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant at a specific site; construction of associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pipelines and access roads; construction and utilization of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an H-frame, 115-kilovolt transmission line along the north  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> side of Forest Road 9735 to deliver power from the plant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an existing transmission line; and mitigation and monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures as proposed by CEE. These would be permanent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities with a contract life of at least 50 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE together with news of an improvement in US consumer confidence sent stock index futures sharply forward in the last hour of trading, enlivening what had otherwise been a mundane session, writes Joel Kibazo. The rather dull opening of the December futures contract on the FT-SE, at 2,722, seemed to indicate a quiet session was in store. A mid-morning seller of around 650 contracts sent the contract falling to 2,715 before settling to trade in a narrow range of 2,718 to 2,730 for the next 3 hours. The strong opening on Wall Street together with the favourable US economic data led to buying interest in December. The upward momentum was given added impetus when a leading securities house became an aggressive buyer, not only taking rival traders in Footsie futures by surprise but also pulling the underlying cash market sharply forward. The move led to some arbitrage activity and having traded around fair value for most of the session December jumped to a healthy premium. It finished at 2,753, up 30 on 8the previous session and around 16 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 9. Turnover was 7,051. Most of the day's activity in the traded options was was in the November stock options that expire today. Tesco was the most active with a total of 3,672 lots dealt. Total turnover was 25,972.</p>

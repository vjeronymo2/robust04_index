			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Doubts surround Indian oil expansion - Fears are growing about excess capacity India is planning a USDollars 30bn expansion of its oil refining and petrochemicals industries as part of its wide-ranging programme to modernise its economy. Undaunted by the recession in world oil and oil-product markets, the Indian government and private companies are planning to invest Rs500bn (Dollars 16bn) in existing and new refineries, to add 63m tonnes of capacity to the country's current total of 52m tonnes. They also plan to spend Rs240bn on nine new petrochemical ventures and double output of petrochemicals products to about 6.3m tonnes a year by the late 1990s. The total proposed outlay is greater than for any other sector except power. Most of the investment will be funded by Indian money. Mr Anil Ambani of Reliance Industries, a petrochemicals and textiles group, which is the first company in the private sector to obtain government approval to build a grassroots refinery, says 'the government will not be able to wave a magic wand and change the industry overnight, but at least they have started moving in the right direction'. The government believes the investments will help ease India's critical shortage of home-grown energy as well as greatly increasing supplies of oil-based industrial raw materials such as feedstocks for plastics and artificial fibres. But critics believe that if a substantial number of projects go ahead India could be saddled with expensive excess capacity in industries that already have plenty of capacity world-wide. They point out that oil-based industries are protected by stiff import duties and benefit from high government-controlled prices, without which the projects could be unviable. 'There's every likelihood there will be excess capacity,' admits one senior government official. The surge of private investment is highlighted by the government's recent clearance of Reliance's 9m-tonne, Dollars 3bn refinery project at Jamnagar in Gujarat, which will be the first for 11 years. The government has also cleared five other refinery projects - three in the public sector and two private. The nine new petrochemicals projects include Reliance's Rs40bn (Dollars 1.27bn) natural gas liquid/naphtha project at Hazira, Gujarat, and the state-run Gas Authority of India's Rs35bn project in Auriya, Uttar Pradesh. These plans are a radical departure for India, which until the late 1980s retained tight government control over the industry, partly to promote traditional materials such as wood and clay. The government now regards oil-based products as an essential part of a modern economy and wants to cut imports of petroleum-based materials. Private companies are being called upon to invest because of the shortage of public funds. India's oil fields produce only about a third of its requirements and petroleum topped the country's import list in 1991-92, accounting for Dollars 5.4bn or 27.7 per cent of the total. The country also has a vast potential demand for petroleum products. Per capita energy consumption of 231kg of oil equivalent is less than half of China's and a fifth of the world average. Its annual consumption of plastics at 1kg a head is way below the world average of 16kg. Demand for petroleum products is expected to grow at a rate of 6.9 per cent a year, from 62m tonnes in 1993-94 to 80m tonnes by 1996-97. The euphoria generated by liberalisation may be short-lived, however. Industry watchers say recession, coupled with excess capacity in many countries around the world, has led to a sharp decline in the prices of petrochemicals products. Indian companies, which will have to rely on exports to bolster their profits once domestic demand slackens, will find it difficult to survive in an already overcrowded marketplace. Moreover, new producers may be unable to rely on the high administered prices that the industry currently enjoys. The government is steadily dismantling price controls - last month it liberalised the prices of lubricant oils. The profitability of the planned investments will depend critically on how future price decontrol is managed. Indian producers will also suffer competitive disadvantages on the world market. Finance is scarce and capital costs are high; labour costs are low, admittedly, but refineries and petrochemicals plants are capital- not labour-intensive. In addition, infrastructure like pipelines and ports are inadequate and will have to be expanded, at substantial cost. Electric power is in short supply and tariffs are considerably higher than in other countries. Duties on imported capital equipment add to costs. The industry will face increasing foreign competition from low-cost production centres such as the Middle East and Singapore as import tariffs decrease. The sector will be crippled unless planned duty reductions are carefully co-ordinated with changes in domestic prices for products and inputs like power. Mr Ambani warns that the industry could 'perish overnight' if the government does not take adequate steps to co-ordinate reforms. 'The government will have to reconsider feedstock and energy prices, which are very high, and make it difficult for Indian industry to compete internationally,' he says. Mr KK Mathur, a senior official at the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, says: 'We have to allow for a certain adjustment process and introduce the reform process in phases. The total impact of the reform measures can only be assessed over a period of time. It is imperative that we do not force the pace'.</p>

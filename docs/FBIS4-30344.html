			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0046 GMT on 26 June carries a 22-minute live  interview with Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP], during its regular "Sunday Discussion" program.  The interview, conducted in the NHK Tokyo studio, is moderated  by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and guest commentator Naoki  Tanaka.    Yamamoto begins the interview by asking Kono: "As the  largest opposition party, the LDP bears great responsibility for  establishing a new administration. How do you intend to tackle  this in concrete terms?" Kono replies: "We need to follow an  orthodox procedure. I think one of the reasons for the current  confusion in the political situation lies in the fact that  proper the procedures of parliamentary democracy have not been  taken in an orthodox manner. I mean, the regular procedures of  constitutional government." Explaining the differences between  the presidential system and the parliamentary system of  government, Kono reiterates that it is important to follow  orthodox procedures based on the parliamentary system of  government and parliamentary democracy. Asked whether the  largest opposition LDP intends to call for policy talks with the  second largest opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan  (SDPJ), Kono says: "I think the opposition parties are  responsible for disentangling the political chaos."    Yamamoto then asks: "Do you mean the most desirable thing is  to form an LDP-SDPJ-Sakigake (Harbinger) coalition?"    Kono replies: "Theoretically, yes." He then notes the need  to reach an agreement on polices.    Guest commentator Tanaka next asks if Kono feels the  responsibility for forming a new administration. Kono says: "I  feel a very grave responsibility." Then Kono says the initial  reason for the LDP submission of a no-confidence motion against  the Hata cabinet was not because it was a minority  administration. In citing the actual reasons, Kono asserts that  the Hata administration had injured Japan's credit with foreign  nations and the administration was taking a negative attitude  toward economic pump-priming measures and political reform.  Kono adds: "Now that we have brought down the administration,  we -- not only the LDP but also the others who brought it down  -- bear a great responsibility. Therefore, we intend to call for  talks with various parties. Each coalition party that has lost  power has their own opinion. For this reason, we intend to ask  each party to talk with us. However, we have to think about  which party has the most similar views to ours on the current  politics. Policies are important, but, democracy is more  important."    Noting LDP criticism of the so-called Ozawa-Ichikawa  alliance  (between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa), Yamamoto asks if the LDP  intends to exclude Shinseito and Komeito from policy talks.  Kono says the LDP has no intention of excluding them from the  initial stage if they follow democracy. On policy differences  between the LDP and the SDPJ, Kono says he has the impression  that there are not many differences in policies between the LDP  and the SDPJ.    When Tanaka points out different views within the LDP, Kono  says: "As I was elected party president, I represent LDP views."  Asked how he intends to consolidate party unity, Kono says the  LDP members have become united over the year since he became  party president. Asked about the so-called  "conservative-conservative" coalition, Kono questions the term  "conservative-conservative" coalition.    Tanaka reviews the LDP's past political management, and asks  what Kono thinks about the leadership within the LDP. Kono  says: "The LDP has been reformed smoothly. The party has  drastically changed compared with last year." He adds: "The  biggest change is that the there is no more faction-oriented  management in the LDP."    Asked about Sakigake's idea of putting forward SDPJ Chairman  Murayama as candidate for premiership, Kono says it is desirable  to think about various options, and notes the need for a  transparent procedure for deciding the candidate. Kono adds:  "It took much time to establish the Hata administration after  Mr. Hosokawa (resigned as prime minister). At present, this is  by no means forgivable. We have only three days before the  current Diet session ends. And, the summit meeting (in Naples)  is near at hand. Although we can extend the Diet session, it is  impossible to postpone the summit. I think we have to make a  decision in a day or two." When Yamamoto asks whether Kono will  be a candidate for prime minister if an LDP headed  administration is formed, Kono says it is not time to jump to  conclusions. Kono adds that it is very important to reach a  policy agreement with other parties on such issues as tax reform  and security.    Asked about the coalition's stance of watching developments  in LDP-SDPJ talks, Kono says: "It is an orthodox attitude. If  Mr. Hata's resignation was based on the belief that he could not  survive a no-confidence motion, it will be impossible for Mr.  Hata to be reelected prime minister again."    Yamamoto asks: "Do you mean Mr. Hata will not become prime  minister again?" Kono asserts: "I think it is impossible."    The interview with Kono ends at 0108 GMT.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIRECTORS TACKLE STUDIOS, MEDIA GIANTS OVER CREATIVE RIGHTS;  </P> <P> MOVIES: GENEVA COPYRIGHT CONFERENCE PITS TOP CREATORS AGAINST BIG CORPORATIONS  AND THE UNITED STATES.  </P> <P> Proponents of artists' rights in Hollywood are making their case abroad this  week, in the scenic town of Geneva, Switzerland, where an international  copyright conference convened Monday. The debate positions some of filmdom's  biggest creative names against many of the nation's biggest media and  entertainment corporations.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Directors Guild of America delivered a statement Monday  that argues for "the right to object" to any defacement of their work -- a  right they contend that U.S. law does not allow. The directors, as well as  other members of the creative community, feel they lack the means to challenge  colorization, editing and other new technological factors that alter the movies  they created.  </P> <P> But the U.S. government took the position in Geneva that the country already is  in basic compliance with the Berne Treaty of the World Intellectual Property  Organization that governs the rights of artists worldwide. According to Dorothy  Schrader, general counsel for the U.S. Copyright Office, when the Senate  ratified joining the Berne Treaty in 1988, it acknowledged that existing state  and federal laws and statutes already provided safeguards for the "moral"  rights that other nations grant to creators. Schrader is in Geneva this week,  part of the U.S. delegation headed by Registrar of Copyrights Ralph Oman.  </P> <P> Also attending the conference is Norman Alterman, an executive of the Motion  Picture Assn. of America, an umbrella group for the major studios. Its  position, opposite that of the DGA, is essentially the same as the  government's.  </P> <P> The DGA's decision to take its case to Geneva represents the second major  effort in as many months by the creative community to bring attention to the  issue of artists' rights. In a separate move, directors Steven Spielberg and  Barry Levinson spearheaded a fund-raising drive in May that quickly generated  $100,000 in campaign contributions for Long Island Rep. Robert Mrazek, a  champion of artists' rights who faces a tough re-election battle this November.  </P> <P> Paul Bjorklund, a legislative assistant to Mrazek, said the size of the  contributions (unusually large for any congressional candidate) from Hollywood  indicates a desire "to send a signal to other members of Congress that there  are other players in Hollywood -- that it's not just the producers and studios"  who can lobby, donate money and play the political game.  </P> <P> "The sleeping giant is finally awakening," said Elliott Silverstein, chairman  of the DGA President's Committee, which is coordinating the guild's effort.  Silverstein is attending the Geneva conference with DGA executive director  Glenn Gumpel, and they are working there in tandem with Writers Guild of  America West Coast executive director Brian Walton and WGA president George  Kirgo.  </P> <P> Before leaving for Europe at the end of last week, Silverstein said the DGA  would argue that U.S. law isn't enough to meet even the minimal requirements of  the Berne Treaty. He believes that if other nations adopt model legislation  detailing artistic rights, it may "pressure Congress to upgrade our laws." The  main legal deficiency, as the DGA sees it, is that the creative community has  no status to even file a lawsuit to object to what they see as a "defacement"  of their work.  </P> <P> "What you're seeing is an alternative point of view emerging," he added.  </P> <P> The artists' "alternative point of view," however, runs counter to that of many  of the companies that employ them -- the major motion picture studios.  </P> <P> The efforts by the DGA and the political fund-raising by such directors as  Spielberg and Levinson also upsets the conventional wisdom that only the  producers and monied executives have political clout. Further, these efforts  are reviving the centuries-old confrontation between art and commerce. In this  case, who controls the fate of finished motion pictures -- the artists who  create them, or those who pay for their production?  </P> <P> Among the contributors to Spielberg and Levinson's pitch for Democrat Mrazek  were such major talents as Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Francis Coppola, Tom  Cruise, David Geffen, Dustin Hoffman, George Lucas, Michael Ovitz, Sidney  Pollack, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, Don Simpson and Bob Zemeckis.  </P> <P> On the other side is a Washington-based lobby known as the Committee for  America's Copyright Community, formed in early 1989. According to Michael R.  Klipper, counsel for CACC, its members include such powerful industry groups as  the MPAA, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Recording Industry  Assn. of America, the Assn. of American Publishers, and such corporations as  Time Warner, Times Mirror, Turner Broadcasting, McGraw-Hill and Harcourt Brace  Jovanovich.  </P> <P> The issue comes down to a matter of "corporate greed," Spielberg charged at a  luncheon he and Levinson gave at the Creative Artists Agency for Mrazek. "Who  controls the future of a piece of art? What's to stop Ted Turner from turning  'Gone With the Wind' into a rock opera?" Spielberg said that with the rapidity  that technology is changing show business, there no doubt will always be  as-yet-unknown ways that movies can be altered. "I used to trade on technology  to make my movies more effective. Now I fear technology because it is going to  make my movies more defective," he said.  </P> <P> The director cited advances in the technology of colorization, panning and  scanning, and time compression (speeding up a film to fit it into a specific TV  time slot).  </P> <P> "For all the power I think I have, I don't own the negatives to my films,"  Spielberg added, noting that his own success allows him to speak out against  the positions of many companies and executives he's worked for.  </P> <P> "We have no rights now," Levinson said. "(Movies can) become no more than a  canvas to be altered and we have no right to object."  </P> <P> The campaign contributions came flowing because, as Spielberg noted, it's no  easy task to buck the existing copyright laws and the forces that maintain  them. Mrazek and others in Congress have tried, but without much success.  </P> <P> In 1987, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) made a splash in Hollywood during his  bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He dabbled a bit in the  anti-colorization efforts of the moment. He even appeared with Woody Allen at a  Capitol Hill press conference. But the creative community's support of his  candidacy remained limited.  </P> <P> Eventually, in the face of strong opposition from many of the same corporations  who now form the backbone of the Committee for America's Copyright Community,  Gephardt let the issue slide. When he was accused of using the  anti-colorization drive as a way to attract Hollywood money, The Times quoted  him as saying, "The idea that this was a political effort is completely  wrongheaded. It probably has hurt my efforts," because, he suggested, many  studio chiefs and others are opposed to it.  </P> <P> Mrazek's chief of staff, Tom Barry, speculated that Los Angeles-area members of  Congress haven't had a high profile on the issue because "they have  constituents on both sides of the issue. (In Long Island) we don't have a  constituent economic interest."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Mrazek, with the help of Rep. Sid Yates (D-Ill.), sponsored  legislation creating the National Film Preservation Act, which became law in  1988. For the first time, it provided government recognition of movies as an  art form. It granted special status for the designation of 25 vintage films  each year to be added to a roster of "protected" works. If they are colorized  in any format, they must be labeled as such.  </P> <P> Most attempts at "moral rights" legislation have failed. One case in 1988  attempted to amend the U.S. Copyright Act to grant authors and creators the  rights of "paternity" and "integrity." The proposal, known as the Berne  Convention Implementation Act, was intended to bring the United States into  conformity with the Berne Convention Treaty. Portions of the act were adopted  but not the specific moral rights or artists' rights wording that the  directors' and writers' guilds would have liked. However, the legislation was  sufficient to allow the U.S. to become a signatory to Berne.  </P> <P> Following the 1988 debate, the Committee for America's Copyright Community was  formed to represent producers, studios and publishers.  </P> <P> In a position paper, the CACC contended that it is the economic incentives  given by producers to authors and creators that "encourages the creation and  dissemination of new works."  </P> <P> While the committee opposes changing the copyright laws that cover so-called  "works for hire," it is neither for nor against the Visual Artists Rights Act  of 1990, sponsored by Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier(D-Wis.) and Sen. Edward M.  Kennedy (D-Mass.), which is pending in the Senate (and already passed by the  House).  </P> <P> CACC's counsel Klipper said that the proposed act would grant "attribution and  integrity" rights to artists for limited-edition and single-copy works -- "a  very narrow category," he added.  </P> <P> But that's a distinction the DGA and the contributors to Mrazek would not find  relevant.  </P> <P> "This effort is about respect for film as an art form," Levinson said. "We  don't want finished films changed. They (the CACC) feel film can be recycled .  . . the CACC doesn't want to lose rights because films have proven to be  reusable in whole new frontiers."  </P></p>

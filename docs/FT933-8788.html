			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Mirror shares rise on report MIRROR Group Newspapers is still substantially undervalued, according to a study on the popular newspaper group's prospects by SG Warburg Securities. Warburg expects that, despite the problems still remaining from the late Robert Maxwell's ownership, margins will be improved by 2 per cent to 23 per cent this year and a further 2 per cent next year. The share price of the company - which publishes the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People, as well as the Scottish Daily Record and Sunday Mail - yesterday gained 8p to close at 167p. Warburg, which is MGN's brokers, expected that, allowing for the future resumption of dividend payments, the company would come more into line with a normal media sector rating. This would imply a share price of 220p in 1994, it said. The positive report on the company comes at a time of speculation that Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the administator to the private Maxwell companies, might be about to move on the disposal of 54.8 per cent of the company. This stake is effectively owned by a number of banks which lent to Maxwell. A private placing in the autumn is seen as the most likely outcome, although it is not clear whether a final decision has been taken. In her report on MGN, Ms Lorna Tilbian, Warburg's media analyst argues that the Daily Mirror has been only marginally hit by the price war with The Sun. The report suggests that the underlying position, including normal seasonal variations, will show only a 0.6 per cent circulation fall in July. The Sun, which cut its cover price by 5p to 20p, will show a rise of only 123,000 copies, or 3.5 per cent, in average daily sales. Ms Tilbian argues in the report that there now exists an opportunity for the new management, under chief executive Mr David Montgomery, to inculcate a culture of enterprise and efficiency to 'secure consistent earnings growth for the foreseeable future'.</p>

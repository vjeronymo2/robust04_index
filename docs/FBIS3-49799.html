According to him, the Muslim representatives rejected the  33.3 percent of the territory offered to them -- the percentage  the international community has insisted on -- in the talks  Bosnian Serb assembly president Momcilo Krajisnik held with them  at Sarajevo airport on Saturday [16 January].    "The most important thing is that we met the demand by the  international community, which requested 30 percent. The  Muslims then demanded 33 percent. The international community  supported that demand. We found even the additional 3 percent,  and then the Muslims rejected that too," Karadzic recalled  before today's session of the Bosnian Serb assembly in Bijeljina.    "The war is still going on. People are still getting killed,  and we have made many concessions precisely to end the war and  the killing and to have peace immediately," the RS president  said. "Since this has not happened, we have to decide today  which path to take in the future."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Excerpt] The Lusaka peace talks have taken a breather. At  a time when national reconciliation is being discussed, the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is  linking the resumption of the peace talks to an inquiry team  being sent to Cuito and Huambo to establish who was responsible  for the resumption of hostilities. At least, that was what  UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the  UNITA team to Lusaka, told the BBC yesterday.    [Begin Valentim recording] Our stance is quite clear: We are  prepared to continue the talks. The UNITA team will stay on in  Luanda, and it will continue to negotiate with the observers,  the mediators, and the government's delegation. However, to  save peace in Angola, we have asked that an inquiry team be set  up and sent to Bie and Huambo to establish the identity of and  condemn the aggressor so that peace can be saved in Angola. [end  recording]    Meanwhile, reports reaching us from Luanda are less than  encouraging. It appears that the government is also hardening  its stance. In fact, yesterday the Angolan authorities said  they will not give in to what they described as absurd proposals  by UNITA. Analysts see this as an indication that the government  wishes to make no national reconciliation package concessions.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] An extraordinary meeting of ministers took place  between from 23-24 June under the chairmanship of the interim  head of state, His Excellency Sylvestre Ntibantunganya. [passage  omitted]    Government ministers discussed the question of French troops  being sent to Rwanda. The Burundi Government stated that it  would not get involved in the internal affairs of other  countries, but it asked the Rwandan warring parties to stop  fighting and to continue peace talks. The government expressed  its concern over the continuing killing of innocents. That is  exactly the point which the interim president emphasized at the  Tunis OAU summit, although according to some rumors in Bujumbura  the interim president allowed France to use Burundi as a transit  point for its troops to enter Rwanda. The interim president  informed the Council of Ministers that this was surprising,  since he had never discussed the question with the French  authorities at the OAU summit. However, you should remember  that some people recently staged demonstrations in Bujumbura  against the dispatch of French troops to Rwanda. The Council of  Ministers confirmed that, under a democratic system, every  citizen is free to stage demonstrations, but should at the same  time respect the relevant laws. The Council of Ministers took  the opportunity to call on security services to ensure that laws  are respected.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Skiers deterred by overseas costs British skiers are abandoning the slopes this winter, put off by the strong currencies of Switzerland, Austria and France. Travel companies have said the number of ski holidays sold in the UK this year is down by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent on last winter, in spite of good snow falls and strong bookings in other European countries. The fall is in strong contrast to the overall holiday market, where bookings are at record levels. Thomson, the largest tour operator, said that by last week it had already sold 1m holidays for next summer. By Christmas last year it had sold fewer than 500,000. Thomas Cook, the travel agents, said bookings to Switzerland from the UK were down 25 per cent. Austria and France had seen bookings from the UK fall by 14 per cent. Bookings to Italy, however, were up about 20 per cent, helped by the weak Italian lira. Thomson said it was using larger aircraft on its weekly flights to Turin from Manchester and London's Gatwick airport. Thomas Cook said cheaper ski destinations such as Romania and Bulgaria had sold reasonably well, although they were also slightly down on last year. Operators and travel agents said they expected ski holiday sales to pick up after Christmas. Thomas Cook said an increase in late bookings could limit the final fall in the market to between 5 per cent and 10 per cent. Skiing has, however, been falling as a proportion of the UK winter holiday market for four years. Ski trips are expected to account for 11.5 per cent of UK winter holidays this year, according to Lunn Poly, the largest travel agents' chain. This compares with 13.6 per cent last year and 16.7 per cent in 1989-90. Ski holidays have fallen victim to the recession and the downturn in consumer spending. A ski trip is a second holiday for many consumers. While many experienced skiers have continued to head for the slopes, operators say there have been fewer first-time ski holiday buyers in recent years. Another factor in skiing's demise has been the growing popularity of winter sun holidays.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY TO HIRE MORE INSPECTORS FOR STORAGE TANKS  </P> <P> The city's lagging effort to inspect thousands of underground storage tanks --  many of them leaking -- got a boost Tuesday from Mayor Tom Bradley, who  announced plans to nearly double the Fire Department's inspection staff.  </P> <P> "This is a serious threat. There are 15,000 of these underground storage  tanks," Bradley told a City Hall news conference. "They present a real danger  to the community, and we are going to eliminate this danger."  </P> <P> The mayor said he has asked the City Council for an interim appropriation of  $440,000 to accelerate inspection and monitoring of underground tanks by  increasing the tank-inspection staff from 13 to 25 as part of a three-year  program.  </P> <P> The city has been responsible for inspecting and monitoring underground tanks  since 1983, when the state Legislature required it. But, Bradley said, a  three-year program started in the last fiscal year "fell behind" partially  because of an "underestimation of work."  </P> <P> Citing estimates based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency studies, Fire  Chief Donald O. Manning said Tuesday that about 20% of the underground tanks in  the city -- holding a wide range of material ranging from gasoline and paint to  "dirty" waste products -- are leaking.  </P> <P> "The ones we are concerned about are those that are leaking and no one really  knows that," Manning said. "There are tanks out there . . . that have been put  in illegally. One of our efforts is to discover and get those taken care of."  </P> <P> The Fire Department started sending permit applications and tank-testing  requirements to owners last May. And, starting July 1, inspectors began  examining tanks and insisting on pressure tests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number in Compliance  </P> <P> So far, according to Assistant City Fire Chief Marshal Davis Parsons, about  2,400 underground tanks in the city are in compliance. Parsons blamed the  seeming tardiness in enforcing the 1983 law on the time-consuming process of  determining the scope of the tank problem, developing technology and finally  getting the money and staff to deal with it.  </P> <P> When The Times surveyed local agencies statewide last summer, only about half  of an estimated 142,000 underground storage tanks in California had been  tested. Water officials in Southern California expressed fears that pollution  from leaking tanks could one day limit the region's "banking" of water in  subterranean basins for dry years.  </P> <P> It was reported then that of the 725 tanks owned by Los Angeles itself, just  199 had been tested for leaks and 62 monitored. At the same time, Los Angeles  County said that it oversees about 18,500 tanks in 80 cities and the  unincorporated area and about 5,100 of that number had met its standards for  testing and monitoring.  </P> <P> Up to this point, according to Parsons, the Los Angeles Fire Department has  dealt mostly with tank owners who are complying voluntarily. Inspections were  "cranked up" more in December, he said, even though no violators have yet been  cited.  </P> <P> An inspector reported last March that a layer of jet fuel up to five feet thick  had contaminated ground water beneath huge storage tanks at Los Angeles  International Airport, and airport officials began an assessment of the  problem. An airport spokesman Tuesday said a consultant has been retained to  help devise a cleanup plan.  </P> <P> In April, state officials ordered a multimillion-dollar cleanup beneath the  Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, where studies estimated that up to 252  million gallons of fuel had leaked into ground water.  </P></p>

The amount represents an increase of some 15.15 million yen  over fiscal 1993, the officials said.    At a cabinet meeting Tuesday, the government of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to adopt the 73.08  trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 which starts April 1 and  lasts through March 31, 1995.    The increase results mainly from 20.52 million yen earmarked  for surveys about the number of Sakhalin Koreans willing to  return to South Korea and prospective places of resettlement.  The amount provided for "survey costs" is four times higher  than in fiscal 1993.    In contrast, funds for temporary visits to South Korea will  remain at 120 million yen as in fiscal 1993.    An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Koreans were left on Sakhalin  island, the southern half of which was Japanese territory until  the end of World War II.    In a joint survey with South Korea several thousand Sakhalin  Koreans, mainly from the first generation, expressed hopes to  return to South Korea.    Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi, who is also secretary  general of a legislators' group for Sakhalin Koreans, welcomed  the government decision.    "The Hosokawa cabinet has been active in revising views on  (unresolved) postwar issues but has not come much further than  offering apologies. Such concrete results are rare," he said.    The Diet is expected to begin debate on the fiscal 1994  budget in early March.    Japan, which ruled the whole Korean peninsula between 1910  and 1945, took the Koreans to Sakhalin before the war as hard  labor workers, mostly in mines, but left them behind when the  island came under Soviet rule.    Repatriation talks have gained speed recently as Seoul,  Tokyo  and Moscow agreed to deal with the issue in trilateral  negotiations.    During most of the Soviet era, the Sakhalin Koreans were not  allowed to contact relatives in South Korea because Moscow only  recognized North Korea.</p>

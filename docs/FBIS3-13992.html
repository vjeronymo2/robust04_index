			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sankarshan Thakur: "Through a Kashmir Prism"] </F>   [Text] Few among the Youth Congress supporters tossing a  bloated effigy of Mr. Bill Clinton at Wagah last fortnight would  have realised the symbolic significance of their protest. The  image of Mr. Clinton being desecrated on the Indo-Pakistani  border was a statement on how yoked relations between India and  the United States remain to Pakistan. After all, it was not Ms.  Benazir Bhutto's effigy being bandied around at Wagah. It was  the U.S. head of state's.    Pakistan remains the thorn in India's side. The U.S. remains  the prime agitator of that thorn in India's flesh. Consider how  manageable Pakistan would be if the United States was taken off  the scene. Handling Islamabad suddenly begins to appear so easy.  None of that transcontinental arm twisting from Ms. Robin  Raphel. None of those irritable "My dear Ghulam" letters from  the Oval Office. None of those words of encouragement to  secessionist elements in Kashmir and Punjab.    There was a time Pakistan looked manageable even with U.S.  backing -- as long as the Soviet Union was around. Nothing  deterred India from liberating Bangladesh from Pakistan, not  Messrs Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger, not even the U.S.  Seventh Fleet.    But things have changed since then. And South Block gives  the  impression it has not quite adjusted to these changes. The  Soviet Union is a thing of the past. The great protector is no  longer hovering behind India's shoulders. There is no longer the  assurance of a Soviet veto at the United Nations security  council to shield India from U.S. bullying.    Russia votes with Washington at the UN on resolutions deemed  anti-Indian in New Delhi. On the nuclear nonproliferation treaty  and the missile technology control regime, Washington and Moscow  have the same thing to tell India. Sign on the dotted line.  Hence Russia's stalling the sale of cryogenic rocket technology  to India under pressure from the United States. Even on Kashmir  Moscow's position lies closer to Washington's than New Delhi's.    India can no longer behave like a foetus in a protected Cold  War womb. It needs to brave the new world and walk a hard path  alone. The Clinton administration has done little of late that  would not leave India wondering about US intentions in the  region. The pinpricks have not been limited to the outbursts of  Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of state for south Asia.  Mr. Clinton himself has repeatedly left South Block aghast, most  recently with his statement to the incoming Pakistani ambassador  to the United States.    Often representations to Mr. Clinton, like the recent one on  Punjab from a set of congressmen, have been products of myth and  ignorance. The letter referred to Punjab as the "Republic of  Khalistan" and spoke of 110,000 deaths in the state. If the US  president responds to such propaganda with kind lines of  cooperation, he is bound to raise hackles in South Block.    But then, like it or not, the US is in a position to get  away  with myth and ignorance. Such is the position it has come to  enjoy, particularly after the demise of the Soviet Union. It  does not serve to merely rail against a position, however false  and unjust, that the United States takes.    The present lot of disconcerting noises from Washington has  sparked a debate in the foreign office on whether the prime  minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, should go to the United  States for a summit meeting with Mr. Clinton. There are camps  for either side of the argument. But the reigning opinion in  South Block seems to be Mr. Rao should not make the trip unless  he wants his "nose rubbed in the ground," unless he is  "soliciting a blow to national honour". The debate is rather  presumptuous, if not also self-defeating.    It is not as if the U.S. administration is waiting with a  red  carpet to welcome Mr. Rao, terribly anxious to get bilateral  irritants out of the way. As it is Mr. Clinton has little time  for foreign policy matters and India would figure fairly low on  his list. It would hardly bother the White House if Mr. Rao were  to decide not to go. It has been argued the prime minister's  decision not to visit Washington -- and go to Moscow instead --  would send the right signals of annoyance to the United States.  What is more likely to be the case is there will be nobody in  Washington bothered enough to receive the signal.    Rightly or wrongly, the onus for correcting the current  imbalances in Indo-U.S. relations is on India. If India can say  it is not bothered about bad relations with the United States,  Washington would be even less so. The question is what will  India lose if its prime minister visits Washington for a meeting  with the U.S. president. The situation does not become worse if  a Rao-Clinton summit does not produce a positive turn in  relations.    The truth is India does not matter to the United States as  much as the United States matters to India.    Besides, as representatives of the U.S. administration,  including the belligerent Ms. Raphel and the U.S. charge  d'affaires in New Delhi, Mr. Kenneth Brill, have pointed out,  there is more to Indo-U.S. relations than just Pakistan and the  linked issues of Kashmir and human rights. If New Delhi chooses  to look at Indo-U.S. ties merely through Pakistan-Kashmir prism  it will only hurt itself.    As far as the United States is concerned India could only  benefit from continuously intensifying its economic and trade  relations. This is something the United States too appears keen  on. The United States is sending a high level trade delegation  led by the commerce secretary, Mr. Ron Brown, in August. The  effort should be to use such opportunities to expand Indo-U.S.  contacts in other spheres, rather than allow Pakistan or Kashmir  to overshadow all aspects of bilateral ties.  *</p>

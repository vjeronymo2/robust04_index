			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Fed's conflicting inflation signals buffet Treasuries US Treasury bonds were buffeted yesterday by conflicting signals on inflation from Federal Reserve policy-makers. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/32 lower at 87 9/16 , with the yield slipping to 7.277 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 5.755 per cent. After trading higher for most of the session, bonds changed direction and burrowed into negative ground at about 3pm. The reversal was triggered by Mr Thomas Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. He said the US was approaching full employment, touching off fears of inflation. Earlier in the day, remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, were supportive. Although he declined to make any specific forecast on inflation, Mr Greenspan said 'the numbers were clearly restrained'. His words brought a welcome response in the Treasury market, where bonds posted solid gains. Towards mid-morning, however, traders were distracted by renewed weakness in the dollar. The US currency suffered a fresh setback against the yen in the foreign exchange markets after Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, said the US would not rule out trade sanctions against Japan, although Washington had no immediate plans to use them. As a result, bonds trimmed their gains, but soon stabilised and began inching forward again. The dollar later firmed, but its recovery was overshadowed by Mr Hoenig's remarks. The strength of US bonds helped push German government bond prices higher. However, further comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, and data showing a slightly higher-than-expected rise in German manufacturing orders in April later unnerved the market and limited further advances. Mr Tietmeyer said that the German economy was 'at the first stage of recovery' and that he expected it to grow further. 'Bonds rose quickly in early trading, testing important technical levels,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt. He said that the bund future on DTB, the German futures and options exchange, was trading above its counterpart on Liffe, 'which is a rare occurrence'. He added: 'People were taking up positive positions which earlier they had liquidated.' But analysts said that retail investors had still not fully regained their confidence and that selling was still taking place. The September German bund future on Liffe ended up 0.63 point at 92.93. A stronger tone emerged in the UK government bond market yesterday despite data showing a surge in manufacturing output. Manufacturing output rose by 1.1 per cent in April, almost double the consensus forecast of 0.5 per cent. But analysts said that the underlying trend remained favourable. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, pointed to the 1.7 per cent rise in engineering output, which he said augured well for investment and exports. Mr Peter Fellner, gilt strategist at NatWest Markets, said: 'It has been a better day but the market is still nervous and volatile. The general feel in the international bond market has improved and this has fed through to gilts.' Mr Briscoe said gilts started the day higher, 'due to the fact that on reflection the sell-off yesterday looked unjustified and the UK market was weak in isolation. They then climbed higher with strength in continental markets.' Analysts reported overnight buying from investors in east Asia and buying at lower levels across all maturities. The long gilt future was up 1 7/16 point at 101 15/16 in late trade. French government bonds moved higher yesterday, due mainly to the strength in German and US markets. Analysts said the cut of five basis points in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase rate to 5.10 per cent provided some relief. Although largely in line with expectations, there had been some concern that the German central bank might set a fixed-rate repo. Support was also provided by remarks made yesterday by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the French central bank governor. He said: 'Inflation is under control, thanks to the vigilance of monetary policy and economic fundamentals in France.'</p>

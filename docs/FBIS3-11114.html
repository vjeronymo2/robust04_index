The exchange of protocols followed a meeting between Robaina  and Indonesian Trade Minister Satrio Budihardjo Joedono.  Robaina arrived in Jakarta last night on the first leg of a  three-week visit to the Asian region that will take him to Laos,  Myanmar (former Burma), Cambodia, India, Vietnam, and Malaysia.    During a news conference following the signing of the  agreements, the Cuban official affirmed that his visit to the  region seeks to explain the situation his country experiencing.    Robaina indicated that Asia needs to know what Cuba is and  that we need to know about this continent. That is the reason we  are making a big effort to bring an end to the unjust U.S.  blockade against our country, he added.</p>

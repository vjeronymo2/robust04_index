			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Manufacturing pay deals fall, CBI says MANUFACTURING pay settlements fell decisively below the rate of inflation in the final quarter of last year, according to the latest figures from the Confederation of British Industry's pay databank. The 4.1 per cent average increase disclosed for the three months to the end of December was lower than December's 4.5 per cent annual increase in retail price inflation and less than half the 9 per cent average for manufacturing pay settlements in the final quarter of 1990. Productivity among manufacturers rose as pay increases declined. According to the CBI, manufacturers reported average productivity gains of 5.2 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of last year, up slightly on the 5.1 per cent gain registered in the 12 months to the third quarter. The employers' organisation said that, since August, one in five manufacturing settlements have been at or below 2.5 per cent, while just under one in four were between 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent. A further one in four settlements were worth between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent, and slightly more than one in four between 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent. Pay settlements in service-sector companies are also falling. According to provisional CBI data, they averaged 6.1 per cent in the second half of last year compared with averages of 7.1 per cent in the first six months of last year and 8.9 per cent in the second half of 1990. In addition to those manufacturers that have reported for the fourth quarter, a further one in seven are deferring their pay awards for up to six months from their normal pay review date, the CBI added. The Treasury said yesterday that the CBI figures were 'encouraging'. Officials noted, however, that the pay data information has only been gathered since 1980 and therefore was not as well-established as an economic indicator as the CBI's industrial trends survey.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Risk and Reward: Charging the right price for futures fund performance Investors buy futures funds because they promise high returns. On the basis of those returns, futures fund managers charge fees which dwarf charges in most other areas of the fund management industry. But are these fees really justified? A growing number of observers, and even some managers within the industry, think not. Certainly, the high level of fees has had a negative impact on the growth of the futures fund industry, by discouraging institutions from investing in such funds. Most investors are high net worth individuals, who may not look too closely at fees so long as returns are attractive. However, when their fund's performance is disappointing, fees frequently become an issue. Standard fees for futures funds are 2 to 4 per cent for management, with performance fees of 15 to 25 per cent. The performance fees are charged on any profits, so even a return which only equals Treasury bill rates is stripped of this fee. 'There are very few futures fund managers who consistently produce excellent returns for investors,' said Ms Nicola Meaden of Tass Management, which tracks futures funds' performance. '(Those who do) have a strong case for justifying those levels, but for the industry as a whole I believe the fees are too high.' The timing of performance fees also causes some frustration. Some managers take fees every month, while others wait until the end of the year. The former, though, can earn performance fees even if their fund ends down on the year. Most futures funds are multi-manager funds - that is, an overall manager divides assets between a group of futures fund managers, known in the jargon as CTAs or commodity trading advisers. If there are six trading advisers and two make a profit, performance fees have to be paid to them even though the fund is down overall. However, some futures fund managers do not pass this charge on to investors. So are there any signs of change? Fees have come down slightly in the past few years, and there is increasing pressure from the hedge fund market, where management fees are about 1 - 2 per cent. Hedge funds have performed well this year and are proving more successful in attracting institutional investors. Futures funds have also had a good year. According To Tass, the average return for the year to the end of October was 15.37 per cent. But there is a large range in performance, with some funds down as much as 50 per cent and others up as much as 100 per cent. 'We only deserve to get paid if we perform,' said Mr Robin Edwards, a managing director of Sabre Fund Management, whose funds are up some 20 per cent in the year to end-September. 'There are people who don't perform. They don't last in the business.' He also points out that unit trusts in the UK charge relatively high fees (around 5 per cent up front, with a 1 - 1 1/2 per cent annual management charge) often for doing no more than tracking an index. If futures fund managers are serious about wanting to attract more institutional money, they will need to address the issue of fees. 'I don't see why anyone should be paid a performance fee if their performance is paltry,' says Mr David Moore, a director of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, which appoints external manage for its funds. 'It would make sense if there were a threshold - such as the T-bill rate - below which there would be no performance fee.' Given that investors are taking a far greater risk by investing in futures funds than by putting their money in US Treasury bills, this only seems fair.</p>

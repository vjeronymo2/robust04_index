			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Lords diminish suspected fraudsters' rights - Legal Briefs The rights of suspected fraudsters under UK law have been further diminished after a House of Lords decision which, it admits, erodes their protection from self-incrimination. The Lords had been asked to rule in the case of Mr Muhammed Naviede, former chairman of the Arrows trading company, charged by the UK's Serious Fraud Office with obtaining money by deception. His trial is pending. Mr Naviede was compelled to give evidence to the Arrows liquidators under section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986. A dispute then arose over whether transcripts of his interviews with liquidators could by passed to the SFO and used in evidence at his criminal trial. A Companies Court judge ruled the transcripts could be passed to the SFO, but the prosecuting agency had to undertake not to use them in evidence. This parallels the SFO's own powers to suspend the right to silence to obtain information under compulsion - material which then cannot be used as evidence in court. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, ruling a civil judge could not apply such a condition on criminal proceedings. Five law lords last week upheld the Court of Appeal's decision. They ruled that issues surrounding the admissibility in criminal trials of transcripts from section 236 interviews - whether or not this would prevent a fair trial - should be decided by the trial judge, not by a Companies Court judge.</p>

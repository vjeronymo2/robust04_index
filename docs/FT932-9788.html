			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: New I&amp;S trust seeks Pounds 172m A NEW investment trust, Ivory &amp; Sime ISIS Trust, is hoping to raise up to Pounds 172m via the issue of ordinary shares and convertible annuity shares. The trust will invest in a portfolio of UK equities. However, the income from these equities is being sold to institutional investors in the form of convertible annuity shares. These will have a negligible repayment value but a high dividend yield. The convertible shares will be issued in a ratio of 1 to every 10 ordinary shares. Institutions have agreed to underwrite the sale of 10m convertible annuity shares at 147p per share, with a maximum of 15m available. The ordinary shares will receive no income but will be entitled to all the assets of the trust. Proceeds from the sale of the convertible annuity shares will result in an uplift in the net asset value of the ordinary shares. Ivory &amp; Sime estimates the initial net asset value per share at 110p, compared with an offer price of 100p. Private investors will be offered a low-cost way of selling their ordinary shares in order to use their annual capital gains tax allowance. The aim will be to get a 7 per cent tax-free income. To reduce the risk of the ordinary shares falling to a discount, ISIS will also have a low-cost savings scheme, with holders being offered free warrants every year. The hope is that the demand from the savings scheme will mop up the shares sold by investors who take income. The offer is open until June 4.</p>

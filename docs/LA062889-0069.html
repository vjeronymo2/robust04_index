			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BAN ON AIRLINES' USE OF EL TORO BASE DUE VOTE  </P> <P> The House Armed Services Committee is expected to approve a measure today that  would prohibit commercial aviation service at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) quietly introduced the measure last  week and said that its enactment would fulfill his longstanding campaign  promise to keep El Toro from being used to reduce overcrowding at John Wayne  Airport.  </P> <P> "The people of the district have made it abundantly clear they do not want  joint (commercial-military) use at El Toro," Cox said. "Time after time, in  public forums during the (1988) election campaign . . . I've said no joint use  at El Toro. That's what (the voters) wanted to hear, and that's what we're  doing."  </P> <P> Cox's proposal will probably clear the House of Representatives if the Armed  Services Committee, as expected, attaches it as an amendment to the annual  defense authorization bill, congressional sources said. Whether it will become  law probably will depend on its acceptance by the House-Senate conference  committee, whose members will be appointed to reconcile differences between the  House and Senate versions of the bill.  </P> <P> In seeking the action, Cox is asking Congress to help resolve a key element in  the 20-year-old local battle over expansion of John Wayne Airport and efforts  to find an alternative site for commercial aviation. El Toro base, which some  have advocated as an alternative to John Wayne Airport, is located in Cox's  central Orange County congressional district.  </P> <P> Cox conceded in an interview that this step may not be popular with everyone.  It is "not an issue without controversy," he said.  </P> <P> Cox's preemptive strike against joint use of El Toro, accomplished with the aid  of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a member of the Armed Services  Committee, drew heated reaction from Newport Beach officials and members of a  private group of civic leaders that is evaluating sites for a new county  airport.  </P> <P> "I believe that any type of legislation that would short-circuit the  grass-roots effort is very, very counterproductive," Newport Beach City Manager  Robert L. Wynn said.  </P> <P> "It just doesn't seem to me to be the proper thing to do. I'm disappointed that  he (Cox) did that," said Clarence J. Turner, a Newport Beach city councilman  who is vice president of the Airport Site Coalition. "I'd like to see all of  these sites evaluated on a fair and equal basis."  </P> <P> The coalition, formed several years ago as part of a court settlement that  permitted expansion of John Wayne Airport, is due to release its  recommendations in about six months on sites for new commercial aviation  facilities in Orange County. El Toro base is among the locations under  consideration, Turner said.  </P> <P> The reaction to Cox's initiative was decidedly different from the leader of an  opposing group that is fighting plans to bring commercial aviation to El Toro  base.  </P> <P> "Hallelujah!" exclaimed Sally Anne Sheridan, an Irvine city councilwoman who  heads the Coalition for a Responsible Airport Solution. "The significance for  Irvine and all the surrounding cities is that we will not have to be fighting  the battle of joint use."  </P> <P> The Cox measure initially was introduced as a separate bill on June 20. With  Dornan's help, the bill was attached as an amendment to the massive 1990  defense authorization bill by the readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services  Committee. Aides expect the full committee to approve the bill today without  significant debate.  </P> <P> "Regardless of the merits of the issue, just from a political standpoint, it's  a very impressive feat," Orange County Washington lobbyist James F. McConnell  said of Cox's maneuver.  </P> <P> Debate over the proposed use of El Toro for commercial flights has been  building for many years.  </P> <P> The military and city officials from communities such as Irvine that are next  to the Marine base strongly oppose any commercial use, contending that it would  interfere with the base's military mission, create terrible traffic problems  and endanger lives.  </P> <P> Officials from Newport Beach, which borders John Wayne Airport, assert that  using El Toro for commercial flights would reduce overcrowding and noise at the  county's only major commercial air passenger facility.  </P> <P> The battle took an unusual twist in December, 1987, when a Michigan congressman  who had frequently been at loggerheads with former Rep. Robert E. Badham  (R-Newport Beach), who preceded Cox, persuaded Congress to order the Federal  Aviation Administration to study joint use of the El Toro base.  </P> <P> In a report released the following May, the FAA concluded that joint use was  "feasible," but stopped short of adopting a recommendation.  </P> <P> "We saw this done to us in the opposite way (in 1987)," Cox said. "So what's  fair, is fair. . . . I've now spent a year talking to people all over the 40th  Congressional District, and the areas most affected by this, Irvine and Laguna  Hills, will never stand for joint use. Therefore, as a political matter, it  ought to come off the table."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Wilton Named in Taiwan Scandal"] </F>   [Text] The Schiedam shipyard company, Wilton Fijenoord, has  been named in a major defense scandal in Taiwan involving a  large section of senior naval officers.    A top-ranking member of the military was sentenced to life  imprisonment this week. The 37-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Liao  Chih-wei apparently revealed military secrets to the agent of a  Netherlands company. In the CHINA TIMES, this company was  identified by civil servants of the Taiwan Defense Ministry by  the initials "W.F." Seven other officers have been charged,  together with 10 arms dealers. Chuang Ming-yao, the commander  of the Taiwan Navy, was forced to resign in April because of the  affair.    Director T. Jonker of the Schiedam shipyard company stated  that it was all "a complete mystery" to him. Jonker: "We have  not built any frigates since the 1970's, and we have never  supplied Taiwan with any frigates. In 1987 and 1988 Wilton did,  however, supply Taiwan with two submarines." Jonker also said  that the shipyard company has no agent in Taiwan, but  representatives often travel between the two countries to  maintain contacts.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EX-BAKKER AIDE SOBS FOR MERCY  </P> <P> Richard Dortch, Jim Bakker's right-hand man at the PTL Ministry, sobbed for  mercy today before a federal judge who said he probably would reduce Dortch's  eight-year prison sentence for fraud.  </P> <P> "For almost five years, I had been in a prison of my own, a prison I built for  myself," Dortch, 58, told U.S. District Judge Robert Potter between bouts of  weeping.  </P> <P> "I've come to see that prison is more than a physical place. I believe I've  learned my lesson well."  </P> <P> Potter said he needs time to consider the request for reducing the sentence for  Dortch, who reported in February to a country club federal prison in Florida  where prisoners live in unlocked dormitories and are free to play golf or  tennis if they choose.  </P> <P> Dortch, whose testimony was crucial in convicting Bakker, pleaded guilty in  August to four of 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. Potter said he could not  forget the fraud that Dortch, Bakker and others at PTL perpetrated against the  television ministry's loyal followers.  </P></p>

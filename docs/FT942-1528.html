			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Italy gives debt and inflation a higher priority Mr Lamberto Dini, Italian treasury minister, yesterday signalled a shift in economic policy of the new Berlusconi government, by emphasising the battle against inflation and the need to tackle the budget deficit and Italy's debt. His statement to the annual meeting of the Italian Bankers' Association was an attempt to win back the financial markets' confidence in the government's economic policy. It follows a Treasury statement, in a similar tone, on Monday and pledges by Mr Dini last Friday of a tough 1995 budget. 'The priority of Italian economic policy must be to deal with any risks that might arise from the recovery,' Mr Dini said. The economy is expected to grow next year by 2.5 per cent. The two fundamental guidelines were to 'maintain a low rate of inflation and restore the health of public finances'. The former director-general of the Bank of Italy added: 'Without restoring the health of public finances, none of the macro-economic objectives can be reached.' He criticised the Ciampi government for failing to pursue rigorously Italy's public finances and the debt stock, now exceeding 120 per cent of GDP. He warned of a big shake-up in the main areas of public spending - health, pensions and the public administration - and told the unions to sustain their level of moderate wage claims and be prepared for a more flexible labour market. In a further signal to the markets, he said the government was prepared to go beyond existing privatisation plans and divest itself of its entire stake in financial institutions, worth L13,000bn (Pounds 5.3bn). Since taking office a month ago, the government has given confused signals on policy priorities. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, has consistently played down the need for tough measures and has emphasised the need for job creation and business confidence to fuel recovery. As a result, initial measures have been directed at job creation and Mr Berlusconi has sought to avoid a mid-year mini-budget to hold the budget deficit to about 10 per cent of GDP. The government has yet to present an outline of its macro-economic objectives in the context of the 1995 budget.</p>

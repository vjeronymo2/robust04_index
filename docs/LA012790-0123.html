			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL SUSPENDS DEVILS' SHANAHAN FOR HIGH-STICKING NORDIQUES' PETIT  </P> <P> New Jersey forward Brendan Shanahan has been suspended for five games because  of a high-sticking incident with Quebec defenseman Michel Petit, the NHL said  Friday.  </P> <P> "In considering this incident, it is acknowledged that Shanahan did not strike  Petit out of retaliation for an earlier incident involving the two players,"  said Brian O'Neill, the league's executive vice president.  </P> <P> "However, it is clear that he used his stick in a very reckless manner when he  was checking his opponent, and this resulted in a serious injury.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, the full responsibility of the stick is that of the player."  </P> <P> During the incident in a Jan. 13 game, Shanahan's stick opened a cut on Petit's  face that required stitches. Petit had also opened a cut in Shanahan's mouth  with his stick. He was not disciplined by the league.  </P> <P> Both players received game-misconduct penalties.  </P> <P> The Devils said they will not appeal. Under NHL rules, Shanahan will be allowed  to play against Toronto, the New York Islanders and the Kings before the  suspension takes effect on Feb. 2. He will be eligible to return on Feb. 16  against the New York Rangers.  </P></p>

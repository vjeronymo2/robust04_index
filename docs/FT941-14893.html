			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff splits activities Pittencrieff yesterday announced plans to split its oil and gas interests from the rapidly growing mobile communications operation based in the US. The company proposes to offer shareholders the choice to vote for a simple demerger with a cash alternative, or to allow the mobile communications subsidiary to buy the parent's 54 per cent interest in it. The quoted company in the UK will then be liquidated, which will protect the company from capital gains tax arising on the transactions. The oil and gas division will be relisted under a new name. Pittencrieff last year floated off 46 per cent of Pittencrieff Communications, earning Dollars 68m (Pounds 46m) net of expenses. Mr Terry Heneaghan, chairman, said the oil and gas division had been inhibiting the 'frantic pace' of growth in the communications business, and vice versa. 'Neither could issue stock while they were linked because the value of each of the two parts was more than that of the whole'. Mr Heneaghan said Pittencrieff hoped to return to the market with an acquisition. It is also likely that it will seek to raise funds through a placing or share issue. The details are expected to be completed by March, with the full demerger or sale concluded in the summer.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According  to a "spring forecast" by economic experts at the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistical Bureau on  China's economic development trend in 1994, this year, China's  commodity retail sales price index will increase by 13.2 percent  and the citizens' cost of living index will rise by 14.5  percent, the rate of increase being similar to or a little  higher than last year. The price index of investment goods [tou  zi pin 2121 6327 0756] will rise by approximately 15 percent,  lower than last year.    This "spring forecast" points out that China's commodity  price level has kept rising since the fourth quarter of 1992.  The situation is even more serious in 1994. In the first  quarter of this year, the country's retail sales price index  rose by 21 percent over the same period of last year. Now, the  central authorities have taken various measures to control these  excessive price increases. In March, price increases began to  slow down.    The "spring forecast" indicates that if excessive price  increases are not stopped quickly, this will endanger reform,  affect development, and also cause instability in society;  therefore commodity prices should not be treated lightly.    Since the introduction of reform and opening up in 1979,  until 1993, China's average annual economic growth rate was 9.3  percent, and the average annual rate of price increases was 6.4  percent. This situation was comparatively ideal, the "spring  forecast" adds. But inflation and economic growth reached a  critical level in 1993, and the inflation rate has tended to  exceed the economic growth rate in 1994. Therefore, the first  task in macrocontrol and regulation is to maintain a rational  balance between economic growth and inflation and to strive to  bring about healthy development during which the national  economy will grow fast and inflation will be controlled at a low  level.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / People: Kermans finally bow out at BS Group A long and bitter boardroom struggle at BS Group, the Bristol-based property and leisure company, has come to an end after three members of the Kerman family resigned. The announcement was the culmination of the efforts of non-family shareholders to remove the Kermans, who have been associated with BS, formerly Bristol Scotts, since before the second world war. In August, Anthony Kerman was deposed as chairman and replaced by Sir Ian Rankin. Two months later Scotts Holdings, a property group based in Singapore, bought the Kermans' 26.97 per cent stake in the company for Pounds 3.1m. This was held by Anthony Kerman, his brother Nicholas and their father Isidore. Scotts is quoted on the Singapore stock exchange but is controlled by the Jumabhoy family, who at the time of the buy-out agreement received assurances from the Kermans that they would leave the board. Iqbal Jumabhoy, Rafik Jumabhoy and Bryan Burletson, a business partner of the Jumabhoys, have taken three seats on the board as non- executive directors. Sir Ian remains chairman. BS returned to the black this year for the first time since 1988, with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 429,000 for the six months to June 30. The interim dividend of 3p was the first distribution since 1989.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan has said that  Poland's and Hungary's application for membership in the  European Union will also facilitate Slovakia's integration with  West Europe. The Slovak minister's talks in Warsaw focused  primarily on economic cooperation. This is the first foreign  visit by the Slovak foreign minister after the recent change of  government in Bratislava.    After talks with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski, the  Slovak foreign minister said that Bratislava would submit a  formal application for membership in the European Union next  year.    [Begin Kukan recording, in Slovak with superimposed Polish  translation] The division of Czechoslovakia has delayed  negotiations on our membership in the European Union. Last  year, we had to negotiate from the beginning and sign an  association agreement. Now the 12 countries should ratify it.  Denmark and Great Britain have done it so far. We would like  the other union members to ratify the agreement by the end of  the year. [end recording]    The Slovak minister arrived in Warsaw with an invitation for  Waldemar Pawlak to pay a visit to Bratislava. Most probably the  visit will take place before the summer holidays. Economic  agreements, including an agreement on investment protection and  one on avoiding double taxation, are to be signed during the  visit.    [Begin Olechowski recording] The talks went smoothly and  easily and we now have a great many plans for the future. I am  not sure--we may have too many plans, and we will probably not  be able to implement them all. [end recording]    Our trade turnover last year amounted to only $300 million.  Poland is eighth on the list of Slovakia's economic partners.  The situation could be improved by the abolition of customs  duties, as part of the Central European Free Trade Association,  and by constructing more border-crossing points. Although  Poland's joint border with Slovakia is the longest--700  kilometers--only eight border-crossing points are in operation.  The construction of a further 11 points is planned.</p>

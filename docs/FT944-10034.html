			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): White sugar at 4-year high White sugar futures sprang into unaccustomed prominence at the London Commodity Exchange this week. After a period of steady but unspectacular progress values were lifted sharply by concern about developing supply tightness, news that the Russian beet crop would fall heavily and suggestions that Brazil's exportable surplus could be reduced as domestic consumption picked up. The March delivery price yesterday touched a four-year high of Dollars 378 a tonne, up more than Dollars 20 on the week and nearly Dollars 50 since the beginning of October. 'There are just no sellers in this market and the shorts are having to cough up,' one trader told the Reuters news agency. 'Technically there is really no ceiling for the market.' 'The western Hemisphere is looking very tight,' said another trader. 'If China and Russia had the wherewithal to buy the sugar they want right now, London would see Dollars 500 a tonne.' The LCE coffee market began the week in a highly agitated mood as it awaited Brazil's official assessment of its 1995-96 crop in the wake of the June and July frosts and the subsequent drought. Talk that the figure could be well below recent trade estimates prompted a flurry of buying that drove the January futures position up nearly Dollars 200 to Dollars 3,600 a tonne at one point. But Wednesday morning's announcement burst the bubble. The Brazilian government projected a crop of between 12.7m and 14.8m bags (60kg each), down from the 15.7m bags forecast after the frosts and the 26.5m expected before them, but more or less in line with recent market thinking. Prices retreated quickly in response, the January position touching Dollars 3,435 yesterday before closing at Dollars 3,471 a tonne, still Dollars 63 up on the week. Describing the Brazilian crop estimate as 'price-neutral' Mr Celsius Lodder, executive director of the International Coffee Organisation, said in Hamburg yesterday: 'There is no reason for prices to go up or down'. 'The adjustments the market needed were made over the last three to four months, perhaps a little too quickly,' he suggested. 'The current prices seem justified before a clearer crop picture emerges in January.' Mr Lodder said the Brazilian estimate looked accurate and well researched but added that the ICO would present its own statistics in January, in a new effort to provide better market services. After repaying last week's gains with interest London Metal Exchange copper prices got back on to their uptrend on Thursday and yesterday. A continuation of the technical correction that followed November 3's four-year highs took the three months delivery price down to Dollars 2,629 a tonne on Wednesday morning. But by yesterday's close the price was back up to Dollars 2,682.50, down just Dollars 11 on the week. News of another sizeable fall in LME warehouse stocks of the metal aided yesterday's Dollars 17 advance. Other base metals seemed reluctant to follow copper's upturn, however, and most finished substantially lower on the week. The sharpest faller was aluminium, which lost Dollars 30 of last week's Dollars 57 rise to close yesterday at Dollars 1,854.50 a tonne for three months delivery. A 10,525-tonne fall in LME aluminium stocks was announced yesterday, less than the recent average but enough to confirm that the producer's production-cutting agreement was working satisfactorily.  ------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium         -10,525  to  1,971,925 Aluminium alloy      +360  to  26,480 Copper             -6,050  to  319,200 Lead               -2,225  to  367,225 Nickel               +222  to  150,498 Zinc               -1,425  to  1,215,250 Tin                  -895  to  29,180  -------------------------------------------</p>

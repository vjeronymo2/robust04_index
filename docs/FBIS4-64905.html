			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gunter Hofmann: "Even the Center Is Tilting </F> Right"]    [Text] Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889. What had  long been a nondate suddenly became a day with fatal symbolic  force. And that is by no means just because the British have  called off a national match against Germany that was supposed to  take place on this day at the Berlin Olympic Stadium.    The fact that much has changed in the republic cannot be  described merely through Solingen, Rostock, Moelln, or the  firebombing of the synagogue in Luebeck. On the contrary, the  suspicion remains that resentment against "foreigners," German  national obsessions, and even anti-Semitism are becoming a part  of our daily life.    When it was pointed out to the DFB [German Soccer  Federation]  in its collective naivety what is now linked with the date 20  April, the gentlemen answered: all the better! The motive for  such intransigence is obvious: to show the world that "we" have  changed. In Olympic games in Berlin, therefore, the peoples of  the world are supposed to confirm to us Germans the innocence  that we have earned.    We are constantly craving, begging for, or extorting  gestures  of reconciliation. We would have been awfully glad to have  evidence of normalization. That is what was involved in Bitburg  and that is what is involved now when Chief of Staff Naumann  definitely wants to provide the war graves in central and  eastern Germany with the ranks of the fallen soldiers. First we  want to be with the victors and then with the victims. We always  want to be good and to have a confirmation of this. One would  call this demand for absolution almost neurotic.    It is no shame that there will not be a confrontation in  Berlin with the British players and their infamous fans. The  cancellation came at just the right time. Everywhere in the  republic, however, it sounds a lot like Berlin: Show firmness!  Do not give in to the Right! No appeasement! But this suggests  that the 20th of April brings to mind only a couple of wild  militants. The problem attains its real dimension, however, in  that the FRG is becoming insecure in its middle because we are  losing a sense of what the basic consensus has been. Certainly  1994 is not 1933, and why should it be? But one can also not  forbid the question of how illiberal, how forgetful of history,  and how national and rightist the republic is becoming.    But precisely that is what is being attempted today. It may  be that all questions about what must be called "rightist" in  Germany are being presented as the furor of a new political  correctness that only obeys the old cliche, or it may be with  the comment that the perpetual appeal to Auschwitz only serves  to give us a good conscience and once again to teach the world  what is what.    There are arguments and proofs for all objections of this  kind. Still, they only distract from the essence of the problem.  It is a matter of the center of society. There, in the middle,  it is only tiny steps between the world of those who now vote  for the CDU [Christian Democratic Union], FDP [Free Democratic  Party], or SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] and that of  the Republikaner. And the parties know that. They differentiate  themselves from the Right but they also give sustenance to the  rightists: appeasement did not begin with the decision to call  off the national match on 20 April. The language that was used  to deal with the right of asylum can be called appeasement.    Part of this is how politics accused itself or allowed  itself  to be accused of being oblivious to power for 40 years. It was a  matter of appeasement when most politicians maintained silence  in the dispute among historians in the mid-1980's. Will they  once again say nothing when Arnulf Baring babbles about the  return of Bismarck's empire in Central Europe? For years  politics knuckled under and showed its cowardice. That alone is  the shame and not the cancellation of a match on the "Fuehrer's  birthday." The intellectuals have also taken part in such  appeasement. No, Wolfgang Thierse, you did not keep silent too  long, you participated too often. The historian Ernst Nolte,  promoter of a past that ought to vanish, has gotten more and  more space in the newspapers and found more resonance in  people's minds.    Other thinkers or authors were also involved in this sense.  One does not have to go along with Ignatz Bubis and name the  dramatist Botho Strauss or some of the changed intellectual  rightist radicals from 1968, but their effect on the children of  the new rightists is obvious. They voluntarily put themselves in  this context. Even Ernst Nolte is now getting support from the  Left. After so many years of being taboo, the "rightists" are  now becoming a secret fascination for many. And a rightist  intellectual coalition is forming around young German historians  like Rainer Zitelmann with their songs of impartiality on their  lips.    It is too late simply to put all that back in the bottle.  Certainly one can introduce the denial of the holocaust as a  particular criminal offense, but that works two ways. The  Auschwitz lie as a taboo and myth? It would be better if German  justice had already been more consistent in prosecuting such  "national instigation" with the means that it has.    The same thing is true for the question of whether the  Republikaner should be banned. Even if the judges in Karlsruhe  were to decide that, what would it yield other than a deceptive  calm and some more legends of victims? And even the dispute  about whether or not one ought to talk with the "radical  rightists" is ultimately only a distraction. Naturally one would  like to have television where Schoenhuber or Hader are not even  invited. Still, one must try to talk with young people dressed  as Nazis. But real selectivity is lacking. It must also be  demonstrated in conversations with politicians, authors, and  intellectuals of the "middle," who are just as radical as others  when it comes to Maastricht, the "condolatory tourism," and the  "pack of asylum-seekers." If the established consensus were not  endangered there, then one would certainly not have to fear a  seductive force from Leni Riefenstahl or Hoffmann's photos of  Hitler.    Intellectuals supposed in 1990 that possibly the two  half-nations were getting a chance for the first time to face  their common past without false accusations and without  repression of past actions. That is proving to be an illusion  from today's point of view. Nevertheless, we face the first  debate since unification about whether tearing down the wall and  integration are only the motive for a national reordering of the  entire discourse about the past, for a final writing of history,  or for an honest definition of our place and republican  vigilance in the best sense of the word. One would like to  retain a bit of confidence against the prevailing longing for  normalcy. And at the same time, one cannot let himself be  dominated by the objection that all of that is the lyrics of  bewilderment. Such optimism is based on the everlasting nature  of the past itself.    "There is a wondrous healing power of nature but there is no  healing power of history," writes Hans Mayer in this connection  in his large book on the symbiosis of the Germans and Jews  (Der Widerruf [The Disavowal]) that was finally  destroyed on 30 January 1933. And further: "It is said: `Grass  must grow over that.' Only the dead still lie under the grass."</p>

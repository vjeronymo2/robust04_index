			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE MAY REGULATE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES;  </P> <P> SAFETY: THE CITY COUNCIL MAY CREATE AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD ALLOW A CITY  REGULATORY BOARD TO BAN CHEMICALS IT DEEMS TOO RISKY.  </P> <P> A proposal to regulate acutely hazardous chemicals in the city of Torrance  moved forward this week when a committee recommended that the City Council hire  a consultant to help design the necessary ordinance.  </P> <P> Torrance officials say the ordinance would give the city the power to ban  chemicals it deems too risky. And it would be more far-reaching than current  state guidelines for hazardous substances.  </P> <P> The ordinance would expand the role of an existing chemical board, making it  responsible for reviewing the use of acutely hazardous chemicals. The board  could grant a company a permit to use a chemical, require changes in the  handling of that chemical -- or simply decline to issue a permit.  </P> <P> "We have an inherent right to protect the citizens of our community against  acutely hazardous materials," said Councilman Dan Walker, a member of the City  Council Public Safety Committee, which recommended Wednesday that the  consultant be hired.  </P> <P> City staff developed a draft ordinance, and the consultant would add specific  guidelines to be used in enforcing the law.  </P> <P> A spokesman for an industry group said it does not oppose the creation of the  ordinance. He warned, however, that an ambiguous ordinance could affect  Torrance's relations with industry.  </P> <P> "It's been a fantastic city because they've been able to achieve a balance  between residential, industrial, light industrial and office space," said Steve  Whitehead, a Dow Chemical Co. employee and chairman of a special committee  studying the ordinance for the Torrance Area Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "It would be disappointing and not good for the city if that balance was  disturbed," Whitehead said in an interview after the meeting Wednesday. "You  have to be aware of that when you're writing ordinances."  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance is only one of several actions that followed a series of  explosions, fires and accidents that have claimed three lives and caused more  than a dozen injuries since 1987 at the 750-acre Mobil refinery in Torrance.  </P> <P> Considerable attention was focused on hydrofluoric acid after a massive  explosion and fire in November, 1987, released an estimated 100 pounds of the  toxic substance. Authorities said none of the acid escaped refinery grounds and  no one was injured by the release.  </P> <P> The city of Torrance filed suit against Mobil in April, 1989, asking the court  to declare the refinery a public nuisance and allow the city to regulate it.  The case is due to go to trial in October.  </P> <P> A ballot initiative spearheaded by Walker attempted to ban the use of  hydrofluoric acid at the refinery, but the measure lost by a 3-1 margin earlier  this year.  </P> <P> Hydrofluoric acid is only one of a number of acutely hazardous materials being  used in Torrance, city officials say. The state classifies about 360 chemicals  as "acutely hazardous."  </P> <P> The city began discussing the possibility of a chemical review ordinance in  August, 1989, and city officials have spent months drafting the broad outlines  of the ordinance.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to take up the committee's recommendation in early  September. Although the council technically would be deciding whether to hire  the consultant, several council members say that a "yes" vote would also  signify approval of the ordinance in concept. The city has already allocated  $100,000 for a consultant.  </P> <P> Several industry representatives attended the Wednesday committee meeting,  although most of them did not comment on the proposal.  </P> <P> Whitehead, speaking for the Chamber of Commerce, tried unsuccessfully to  persuade the committee to delay forwarding the ordinance to the council, saying  he had not had time to review it. But committee members countered that the  Wednesday meeting had been publicized well in advance.  </P> <P> "I've been announcing this thing for the last six weeks," said Councilman Tim  Mock, chairman of the committee.  </P> <P> Whitehead later said he is concerned about the standards that still need to be  developed for the ordinance -- a job that city officials are leaving for the  consultant.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see guidelines and standards established before it's submitted for  approval by the City Council," Whitehead said.  </P> <P> As envisioned by city officials, the Torrance ordinance would mesh with a state  code that requires certain companies using hazardous materials to draw up a  so-called Risk Management and Prevention Program (RMPP), a wide-ranging report  of chemicals, equipment and controls.  </P> <P> Those companies would also be reviewed automatically by the city chemical  board, said Torrance Fire Chief R. Scott Adams.  </P> <P> The chemical board then could approve a permit, deny it or ask a company to  take steps to improve safeguards. A company that is denied a permit could  appeal directly to the City Council.  </P> <P> However, Adams said, the proposed Torrance ordinance goes a step further than  the state code.  </P> <P> "In practice, it's entirely possible for a facility to do an RMPP that the city  accepts and, at the same time, our community would say, 'We don't care; we  think the risk is too great.' That's the crux of what's happening here," Adams  said.  </P> <P> How the board would determine whether a chemical poses an unacceptable risk is  still to be worked out.  </P> <P> The city's three-member chemical board was formed in the late 1960s but has met  rarely, city officials said. Members of the new board would represent the fire  department, the building and safety department, and the city manager's office.  </P> <P> City officials said they have not heard of any other cities that have developed  an ordinance like the one proposed in Torrance. Spokesmen contacted Thursday at  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the National League of Cities and the  California League of Cities said that although they are not familiar with  similar ordinances, they could not confirm that the one in Torrance would be  the first of its kind in the country.  </P></p>

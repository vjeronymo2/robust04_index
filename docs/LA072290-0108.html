			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MIND'S EYE: GRIZZLY YEARS IN SEARCH OF THE AMERICAN WILDERNESS BY DOUG  PEACOCK (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 296 PP.)  </P> <P> Doug Peacock experienced just the kind of absurd Vietnam mishaps made legendary  by filmmakers such as Oliver Stone: One day, he tried to keep his commander  alive while American helicopters mistakenly rained bombs from above; the next,  he watched his entire platoon fire rounds at an unarmed, but "suspicious"  10-year-old. No wonder, then, that his behavior after the war also fit the  filmic part: He blasted down a phone booth with shotgun salvos when it guzzled  his last bit of change; left for a camping trip after packing all the necessary  gear (a .22 magnum derringer, .357 and .44 magnum Ruger single-action handguns,  a bolt-action rifle and 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun); and found it easier  talking with bears than with priests.  </P> <P> During one of these "conversations," however, Peacock finally began to regain  some peace. While a grizzly he had met on a park trail was "gnashing his jaws  and lowering his ears," the former green beret, deciding that his "shooting  days were over," lowered his pistol. "I felt something pass between us. The  grizzly slowly turned away from me with grace and dignity and swung into the  timber at the end of the meadow."  </P> <P> The experience distanced him from the mentality he had assumed during the war  by helping him realize that deciding not to attack -- despite inner fears or  officers' orders -- could be as much a sign of strength as attacking. "The  grizzly radiated potency," Peacock explains. "He carried the physical strength  and thorniness of disposition that allowed him to attack or kill most any time  he cared. But, almost always, he chose not to. That was power beyond a bully's  swaggering. It was a kind of restraint that commands awe -- a muscular act of  grace."  </P> <P> "Grizzly Years" is particularly compelling, though, because it is not the  simple story of a man rediscovering serenity amid nature. In fact, Peacock  seems to spend most of his time seeking out grizzlies because they are the one  truly threatening creature in the forest. As with other rebels, from T. E.  Lawrence to Hunter S. Thompson, Peacock lives on the edge of death because  doing so sharpens the dimensions of life.  </P> <P> By book's end, Peacock never manages to reestablish the ordinary social ties he  lost during the war. He breaks up with his girlfriend even though they recently  have had a child and remains in touch only with those who take a deliberate  stand counter to the culture: solitary outlaws such as novelist Edward Abbey  (who modeled the character George Hayduke on Peacock) and a biologist who,  according to his boss, " 'lacked sensitivity in dealing with public-relations  situations.' This meant that he had tried to bite a journalist from People  Magazine."  </P> <P> But loneliness is apparently the price Peacock has paid for the realization  that the war he fought was not his own. It's a process of rebellion that seems  to have begun when he crawled deep into a Viet Cong tunnel, passing rooms  filled with corpses before hearing some live breathing. When he left the  tunnel, his fellow soldiers asked him whether it was worth bombing. "I told  them I had not found anything down there," Peacock replied, "that the tunnel  was cold."  </P></p>

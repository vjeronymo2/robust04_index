			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: DAF unveils key truck ranges DAF, the loss-making Dutch commercial vehicle maker, is spending Pounds 170m (Dollars 302.6m) to bring into production two new truck ranges, which the company described yesterday as 'crucial' to its future. The new ranges, under development for four years, were unveiled at a dinner to mark the retirement of Mr Aart van der Padt, DAF's chairman. However, the trucks are not due to enter commercial production at DAF's Eindhoven plant until the final quarter of this year. The west European market for such vehicles is 110,000 to 120,000 a year, of which DAF has 8 per cent. Its total truck output last year was 24,000. The new ranges offer the prospect of a production boost for Leyland DAF, the company's UK subsidiary. This is in spite of a decision to concentrate production of all trucks over 17 tonnes in the Netherlands, and production of lighter trucks and vans in the UK - at Leyland DAF's plant in Leyland, Lancashire, and at the former Freight Rover facility near Birmingham. 'This is a very comprehensive and far-reaching range of vehicles. There is every prospect the Leyland plant will need to share some of the (production) load,' said Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's managing director, sales and marketing. He said common material supply systems developed for DAF's British and Dutch plants over the past two years had given DAF greater flexibility to switch production between the two countries. DAF, in which British Aerospace holds a 16 per cent stake, has been one of Europe's hardest-hit manufacturers, mainly because of its heavy dependence on the UK market, which accounts for nearly 30 per cent of group turnover. Fiat, Italy's largest car maker, is studying the possibility of manufacturing four-wheel-drive vehicles in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, AP-DJ reports. Mr Renato Ruggiero, Fiat's international affairs director and Italy's former foreign trade minister, recently led a Fiat delegation to Kazakhstan to explore the opportunity of developing industrial ties with the republic as part of its strategy to expand in eastern Europe. 'We examined the possibility of developing a plant to assemble the Panda four-wheel-drive and light commercial vehicles,' Mr Ruggiero was reported as saying. He also said Fiat had reached an agreement with Mr Nasultan Nazarbaev, Kazakhstan's president, to conduct a feasibility study for the project. Mr Ruggiero said that the project 'could be expanded to include other sectors: tractors, earth moving equipment, civil infrastructure and treatment of agricultural products.'</p>

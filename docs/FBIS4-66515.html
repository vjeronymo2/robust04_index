			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hamdi Rizq: "Asyut: Crisis Between Governor and </F> NDP"]    [Text] In Asyut there is no single reality on which people  agree. People say that there has been a sharp disagreement  between the NDP's [National Democratic Party] group of 26 and  the region's governor, Major General Samih al-Sa'id, in a  scenario that repeated the crisis of the current interior  minister, Major General Hasan al-Alfi, with the same group  before he took over the ministry last April.    People are also talking about how the Asyut police now have  a  list of the most notorious families involved in supporting  terrorism, especially the Abu-Sayf family of al-Qusiyah and the  Abu-'Aqrab family of Abu Tij. Secret reports now call for  disarming these families of their licensed and unlicensed  weapons. Implementation actually began in al-Qusiyah among the  members of the Abu-Sayf family.    On the basis of unnamed sources, people hint that the NDP  still has failed to confront terrorism, despite its village  grass roots organizations known as committees of 20. Some people  react to these with ridicule; others ignore them, regardless of  the stress that the party's secretary, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Muhsin,  places on them.    People in Asyut talk of these and many other things as they  sit at the Majestic Cafe across from the station. What is not  talked about there or at the Lu'lu'ah Cafe is anything related  to the terrorist groups--their number, their spread, their  various weapons, their recent entry into the university and  enlistment of a number of its students, and the explosion in  Bank Square and the Badr Tourist Hotel during the last week of  Ramadan.    Here in Asyut the fire is not only under the ashes; it is on  top of them and around them, as shown by the mounted patrols,  the nighttime and daytime ambushes deployed everywhere, and the  search and investigate operations that allow no one to pass  without an identity card to serve as a permit. Everyone is  subject to suspicion until someone higher up intervenes to  release him.    No sooner did suspicious cases begin to increase in the city  of Asyut, neighboring villages, and the 11 district centers,  than NDP members began to intervene in every village and hamlet  to free suspects. They had two motives. First, most suspects  were from these families, related to these families, or had  rallied under their banner. Second, primary elections for the  People's Assembly were close; and these measures, though largely  successful in preventing terrorists from entering populous  cities and in keeping them and their activities on the  outskirts, would have a negative effect on the popularity of  each member in his constituency if he were unable to have his  constituents released from police hands immediately.    This was how the split developed between many district  police  officers in the villages and NDP members from the People's  Assembly, the Consultative Council, and the local council. It  was not unusual to find a member of the People's Assembly  sitting with his family to have suspects released and brought  back to the villages they had left.    Some of them approached Governor Samih al-Sa'id, asking him  to soften these measures, especially as the security chief was  also busy with his security plans on which he would make not the  slightest concession, given last month's rise in terrorist  operations. These included the recent Sidfa incident and the  attack on a police car, with the response that killed six  terrorists. The governor told us that the measure was necessary  to tighten control and that he was fully satisfied with it and  in agreement with the security chief on the matter. The measure  had led to positive results that Asyut citizens now could see in  the streets. The Interior Ministry in Cairo knew about it and  had not objected.    The other cause of the split was that the governor was  widely  reported to have accused NDP members publicly at several  meetings--despite his good relations with them at funerals,  weddings, and so forth--of being passive and not having done  anything against terrorism. Both Siraj Abu-Sayf, the People's  Assembly member from al-Qusiyah, and Muhammad Ahmad Husayn from  Asyut stated this. The two are on opposite sides, but both agree  that the governor is accusing the members of being passive: "We  ought to have grabbed a machine gun and run after the terrorists  who are challenging the police! Are we stronger, or are the  police, with all their weapons and equipment? Our role is to  educate and help; entering a war with terrorism is another  responsibility."    Perhaps it was the governor's most recent accusation--for  his  part, he has utterly denied it, claiming it was a mere  difference of opinion, nothing to spoil friendship, and that  they were united against terrorism--that opened wide the door to  the rumor of a split between the governor and the NDP's  so-called group of 26. Furthermore, the governor proclaimed this  accusation in a public meeting with members during the 'Id  al-Fitr vacation. All of them reacted badly, particularly since  the governor repeated the charges in his private meetings. He  even accused Siraj Abu-Sayf of passivity, greatly incensing  Abu-Sayf, who is now talking to officials in Cairo to discuss  the matter and settle the disagreement. He asks everyone he  meets, "What shall I do? Am I to fight terrorism with my own  hands?"    All the NDP members say they are working against terrorism.  According to Mahmud Abu-'Aqrab, the NDP's youth secretary in Abu  Tij, the party's 20-member base committees are touring villages,  alerting the people, and asking them to cooperate. "But not all  our services to security or to the public are announced in the  newspapers, lest they become a target for terrorism."    The governor told AL-MUSAWWAR in a recorded interview that  they are trying to portray the situation between him and the  People's Assembly members as a repeat scenario of the previous  crisis of Major General Hasan al-Alfi. "However, there is  absolutely no disagreement. The charges have absolutely no  truth. I deny it in the press and to everyone. We are in  complete agreement."  <H5>  Denial of the Denial </H5>   The sole fact in the case is that security chief Majdi  al-Basyuni issued an order for 'Abd-al-Ma'bud Khalifah Abu-Sayf,  Rushdi Khalifah, Hisham Salih, and Khalid Mursi Salih to  surrender their weapons as soon as they received the  notification. They were given 10 days, which ended last  Sunday--the time these lines were written.    According to our information, the first has a semi-automatic  German pistol. The second has a German pistol and rifle. The  last has a German pistol. The third has a pistol. Rushdi turned  in his gun, but the three others are awaiting the results of  efforts by family head Siraj Abu-Sayf with officials in Cairo,  particularly as all these guns are licensed and details about  them are known to the Interior Ministry and State Security  offices in Asyut.    Perhaps this was the beginning of a campaign to collect guns  from families in Asyut. Major General 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Hilali  had already collected 60 guns from the Abu-'Aqrab family in a  single campaign. Strangely, the weapons were returned to the  family after al-Hilali was removed and transferred on orders  from Cairo.    No one answered our question about why these two families in  particular. However, there is information that the dangerous  extremist Murtada Muhammad Khalifah Abu-Sayf comes from the  Abu-Sayf family. He was on the list of suspects in the events of  1981. From the second family comes the leader of the military  wing in Abu Tij, 'Abd-al-Hamid Abu-'Aqrab, who assassinated  Major General al-Shimi in one of the most serious terrorist  incidents ever to occur in Asyut. The former has fled to Saudi  Arabia; the second is still in the center of Asyut.    Siraj Abu-Sayf told AL-MUSAWWAR: "We expelled this terrorist  long ago. Everyone knows that he has lived outside the country  for more than six years. Are they holding the Abu-Sayf family,  which has lost two members as victims to terrorist incidents,  accountable for a man outside Egypt who has not been proved  guilty of the recent actions? The opposition is the cause of all  this. The governor listens to them and keeps repeating after  them that Siraj Abu-Sayf is uncooperative. I am more cooperative  than any person in Asyut. If police officers, men, and  detectives now are afraid of terrorism, are we to stand against  it? My area is completely secure. It is they who are doing  this--first of all the governor. I won't keep quiet about it. I  will turn the world upside down. Instead of honoring us, they  came to take our guns. So how are we to fight terrorism and ward  off those guys?"    He continued: "What's strange is that the MP's [members of  Parliament] are afraid to talk lest people say, `Are you going  to cause trouble with every governor?' Fine, and what the  opposition keeps saying, about there being a repaying of old  accounts with Minister al-Alfi--how are we to reply to it? I am  in Cairo. The MP's telephoned me from Asyut and said, `We are  with you all the way.' I am going to talk to all the officials  until the problem is resolved and the weapons come back to our  home. What happened was unreasonable."    Mahmud Abu-'Aqrab, the spokesman for the family that is the  other party to the case, told us: "We turned in more than six  extremists, including the emir of Abu Tij itself. What more can  we do? Al-Hilali charged us with concealing 'Abd-al-Hamid  Abu-'Aqrab. He knows we were the first people who became targets  of his group. It got so bad that I was shot at in the town. We  politicians can do nothing but talk, educate, and move the  masses. If you tell me to pick up a gun and fight terrorism,  then you are advocating civil war in Asyut. Furthermore,  'Abd-al-Hamid was on the streets, not hiding in his home. All  the terrorists are known by name--yet who has taken them? If I  picked up a rifle, I'd be a terrorist!    "Accusing us of terrorism is shameful. We are sacrificing  ourselves for the country. Everyone is doing it. Shall I or my  family agree to sacrifice our entire history because of one  fellow who is an extremist? As for the matter of the 60 guns,  they were all licensed. They cost one-half million pounds.  Ninety percent of us are farmers. How can we guard our farms and  livestock? The rifles are for guarding, not terrorism. They  can't be smuggled out for terrorism."  <H5>  Witness for the Prosecution </H5>   Muhammad Ahmad Husayn is a People's Assembly member for  Asyut. People classify him as being by himself, apart from the  26. If the latter choose the right, he chooses the left without  a thought. He strongly rejected moving through the NDP when they  contacted him to begin moving at the village level--the ones  that the governor indicated in his noisy meeting on the second  day of the holiday, or, as people call it, "the problem  meeting." Husayn's argument is that such moves serve no purpose  or goal, especially if they come from executives and if  executives or even popular figures prepare them. Before any such  moves, the NDP must be cleaned up. "I said in the most recent  meeting that the NDP first must be cleansed from inside from  drug traffickers and previous offenders. Corrupt people are not  going to fight terrorism. I told the governor to clean up the  party."    The governor told AL-MUSAWWAR that he was responsible for  NDP  members and that the party secretary consulted him about  options. As an example of this coordination, he told us how the  two together had tried to settle the al-Badari People's Assembly  seat on the Murad household in an unopposed election as a kind  of honor to the memory of the late Murad Husayn, the holder of  the now vacant seat. The governor added that he was completely  satisfied with these choices because they were in no way  deficient. The matter had been submitted to everyone: anyone who  found something wrong should hasten to set it right.    The information being handed about is that improper choices  have been made in the party and that with some village-level  party secretaries no consideration was given to good behavior,  ethics, or reputation. One of them in the village of Naj' Sabu'  is accused of wiretapping the telephone booth in the village,  like another in the village of Rifa, a third in al-Zawiyah, and  so on. Is this what Ahmad Husayn has in mind when he speaks  about cleaning up the party? Perhaps. We repeat that in Asyut  there is no single reality on which people agree.    The chasm between the governor and the NDP members is  widening--if it is indeed the case that during Samih al-Sa'id's  entire year in Asyut, Siraj Abu-Sayf has entered al-Sa'id's  office only three times, after which he decided not to enter  [again] because the governor was always busy for hours.  Similarly, Hamid Hisham from Abnub has threatened never to enter  the governor's office during his tenure in Asyut. Jamil  Abu-'Aqrab has asked only to be given equal treatment with the  journalists who go in and out of the governor's office.    In fact, while I was interviewing the governor for  AL-MUSAWWAR, I noticed on his desk two envelopes packed with  papers from Husam al-Kilani from Dayrut and from another member  that the two wanted signed. The governor pointed to the  envelopes and said, "These are requests from [parliamentary]  deputies. Where are the disagreements about which they are  talking?"    The same scenario that happened with al-Alfi. This time the  members are not speaking openly about it to the press, but they  are speaking critically in private sessions. However, when they  are confronted with it, they deny it. In sessions with the  governor they turn into butter and honey, and it's "All's well;  the grass roots committees are working according to your  excellency's plan." Nevertheless, the split is apparent. There  is no one in all Asyut who cannot see it.  <H5>  The Islamic Group? </H5>   All this is happening now on the bright side of the picture  in Asyut. As for the hidden side--we mean the  extremists--according to our exclusive information there are at  highest estimate no more than 40 extremists to be found in the  11 districts. Each works in his district without a single link  or central planning. In particular, the Islamic Group has have  not yet settled the question of their amir after the recent  death of Tharwat Hajjaj in Cairo. A virtual struggle is now  taking place. On one side is the faction of Rif'at Zaydan  'Abdallah. His police dossier says that he was born on 2 July  1970 on the 'Abd-al-Baqi estate in Dayrut district. He is a  student at the Commercial Art Institute. His father was an  al-Sharqiyah peasant from the village of Bani Yahya, but they  fled the village because of a vendetta, his father and uncle  having been accused of killing their cousin, the  government-employed night watchman. He is among the 11 dangerous  terrorists whom the Interior Ministry publicized after the  attempted assassination of Minister Safwat al-Sharif.    The other faction--relatively newer--is led by a face  completely new on the Asyut scene: Najih Mahmud 'Abd-al-Latif.  He is 35 years old and from Tall Zaydan on al-Badari Island. He  is thought to be the leader of that area, which is still  difficult for the police, given his long experience in military  work. He was a major, but was discharged for belonging to the  extremist groups. People say that his entry into the terrorist  team lies behind the recent upsurge in terrorist actions and  that he was primarily responsible for the 23 February attack on  al-Badari Island's police detachment, which killed a police car  driver, Ahmad Hajjaj, and wounded six other members of the  detachment. The attack made off from the island with 12  Kalashnikov rifles, a Carl Gustav machine gun, and eight  assorted guns. The case is now under investigation by the  al-Badari prosecutor.    The rest of the terrorist list includes Salih 'Id  'Abd-al-'Azim Khalil, alias "al-Sadat." He was born in 1971 in  the village of Bani Qurrah and holds a vocational secondary  diploma. His brother, 'Atif 'Id, 30 years old, holds an  agricultural diploma and lives in the same village. Ahmad Sanusi  Hilal Jr., 25 years old, holds a bachelor of law degree and is  from the village of 'Arab al-Jahmah. He is considered by far the  most dangerous. Police believe that he is probably responsible  for the Dayr al-Muharraq incident. Mukhtar Husayn Kamil  Farajallah is from al-Qusiyah. 'Adil Fawzi 'Abd-al-Sami' is from  Bani Qurrah. Sa'd Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahim is an expelled high  school student from the village of Mir. Hasan Khalifah 'Uthman  is from al-Qusiyah. These ten persons are now moving freely in  al-Badari, Sidfa (where operations are being led by Najih  'Abd-al-Latif), and al-Qusiyah (where Ahmad Sanusi is active).    Apart from these three districts, we can say that the police  are now in control of all areas. However, two new developments  on the scene require a change in security plans.    First, the Islamic Group recently have begun to summon their  members from nearby governorates--from Mallawi in al-Minya, the  oases in the New Valley, and Tima in Sawhaj. In the recent train  incident the police ascertained that one of the most important  suspects was from the village of Salamun in Tima district of  Sawhaj governorate. Also, the person who engaged the police on 2  January in the Ibrahim Mosque in the town of Sahil Salim was  'Abd-al-Hamid Muhammad Hasan 'Abd-al-Majid from Mallawi in  al-Minya governorate. This somewhat complicates matters now for  the police and requires that ambushes be set up on the borders  of Asyut, with increased vigilance, especially at night, because  the overland linkage of Middle Egypt's governorates makes things  difficult. Samih al-Sa'id, the governor of Asyut, has therefore  stressed that the governorates of Sawhaj, al-Minya, and Asyut  should be proclaimed a single sector in which security plans are  jointly implemented to prevent the Islamic Group from moving  freely around Asyut.    Second, the Islamic Group have again tried to enter the  university. Two students were involved in the attempt to bomb  Bank Square in the heart of Asyut and in leaving an explosive  parcel in front of the Badr Tourist Hotel. Their arrest within  24 hours aborted the two operations, but it did not abort moves  by student members of the Islamic Group in the university, who  attempted to carry out a strike in support of the two students.  The university president, Raja'i al-Tahlawi, responded by  expelling four students for inciting the unsuccessful strike.    Finally, a number of facts remain to be mentioned:    First, all the differences between the governor and the NDP,  which certain persons known by name in Asyut are feeding, will  benefit only the extremists in the end. Therefore a degree of  clarity and frankness is needed between the two sides. Polite  visits to funerals and weddings will not be enough to bury the  causes of the conflict soon; neither will attempts at denial by  all sides.    Second, harassing certain families for reasons known to  everyone and attempting to drag the police into the problem will  completely alienate those families from the ranks confronting  terrorism. If these families do not give their support, they  will stand neutral; which is extremely dangerous, particularly  since the decisions have not paid attention to the principle  that equality in wrong is justice.    Third, terrorism is limited to the numerical level of the  Islamic Group. However, those active on the scene not only have  considerable fighting experience, but are good at moving. The  entry of persons from al-Minya, Sawhaj, and the New Valley will  prolong the battle. It will have to be decisively resolved by  security integration at the level of all these governorates--the  one-sector policy that the governor of Asyut stressed.    Fourth, Asyut University's current policy of forbidding  those  who are the source [of evil] must continue. The picture must be  clarified as soon as any measures are taken, so as to contain  any student sympathy with the extremists.    The final fact is that in Asyut there is no single reality  on  which people agree. This is what a thorough reading of this  report confirms.</p>

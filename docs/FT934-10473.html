			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Insurer faces pay-out claims GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the UK-based life insurance company, said yesterday it may have to pay compensation to investors who were mis-sold insurance policies in 1990 and 1991. GRE, which has already been the object of disciplinary action and a fine from Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry, said the latest problems were also uncovered after a Lautro compliance review. The review, earlier this year, raised concerns about the appropriateness of advice given to clients, particularly by former 'tied agents' of GRE, who sell the company's products exclusively but are not directly employed by it. GRE said it had agreed with Lautro to review the business of those representative firms and of any others where either documentation sampling or the complaints level suggest further cases of mis-selling. It would make compensation where necessary. The conduct of tied agents in the life insurance industry has been the main focus of Lautro efforts to curb sales of unsuitable products to investors. Last week Lautro, in its enforcement report for the 12 months to June 1993, said disciplinary actions were being considered against several 'household name' life insurance companies. Industry sources said that at least three such cases were pending and that all were owned by shareholders. The company said: 'To ensure continuing high standards in the future, GRE has revised its business and compliance procedures.' GRE said yesterday that after a two-year moratorium beginning August 1991 on the recruiting of tied agents, it had recently resumed doing so. Meanwhile it had cut the number of tied agents to less than 150 from about 950.</p>

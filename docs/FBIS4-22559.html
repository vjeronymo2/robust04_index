			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman Shpek by </F> UKRINFORM correspondent Oleksiy Trotsenko; place and date not  given: "Roman Shpek: `Economic Situation in Ukraine Is Complex  and Dangerous, But Not Hopeless'" -- questions published in  boldface]    [Text]    [Trotsenko] Roman Vasylovych, what should be done, in your  opinion, to lead Ukraine out of the current complex situation?    [Shpek] Primarily, in my opinion, we should pay special  attention to the owner. History has shown that a state is an  inefficient owner. Thus, we should make all possible efforts to  change the structure of ownership.    The issue of structural reconstruction of our economy is  also  very acute, as well as the change of forms of property:  Enterprises, which are no longer needed for Ukraine in the  present and in the future, should take their choice. No, this  does not mean that they must be categorically closed. New  owners, new people with their own capital will come, and they  will be able to inspire them with new life and change their  profile. Great hopes are set here on foreign investments, and  everything must be done to create the possibility for the best  conditions for such investors.    [Trotsenko] However, this requires social and political  stability.    [Shpek] Undoubtedly. It is necessary to form a new  parliament and government, which would have vast powers. I am  not sure, however, that we will be able to improve our economic  situation befor the first six months of this year.    We have to be more thoughtful while developing the future  model of our economy. Here is one example: The coke-oven  industry is currently not paying the coal industry, and miners  are not paying power industry workers. What is the solution?  In my opinion, we can unite them in an association. The  Economy Ministry has already elaborated documents according to  which we can establish financial- industrial groups. We should  unite enterprises of the coal industry, thermal electric power  plants, metallurgical plants, and machine-building plants that  produce equipment for these branches, so that they do not  increase prices for one another, but are led by common  interests. Otherwise, we will not achieve anything.    We must be trusted abroad. Today, we are not, and this  relates to Ukraine which owns a great portion of the world's  blacklands. At the same time, the average milk yield per cow  last year was 2,100 liters. How can butter and other diary  products be cheaper today? Obviously, our production costs are  higher than usual, and the results are well known.    Briefly, there are a great many problems. On the one hand,  we will be unable to resist a flood of foreign goods, because  our technologies are too poor; on the other hand, competition  cannot exist without the liberalization of external economic  relations, and without competition, our products will never  enter world markets. It should be kept in mind, however, that  the United States, Japan, and other developed Western countries  also protect their producers. Today, we have to find out how to  liberalize prices, improve the quality of our products, and  reduce production costs. Prices will then be lower, more  moderate.    [Trotsenko] Our trade deficit with Russia and other CIS  countries is alarming. Can you see any ways to overcome it?  What, in your opinion, should be done to achieve a trade  surplus, or at least reach the zero mark?    [Shpek] It is true that we have a trade deficit with Russia.  We should remember, however, that Ukraine was extracting 14.5  tonnes of oil in the 1970's [as published]. Later, there was  Tyumen with larger deposits, and Ukraine could buy oil and gas  cheaper. Now, I emphasize, this has changed, since the Tyumen  oil producers have increased their prices to the world level.  Estimating that in Ukraine the yield of gas products in oil  refining amounts to 57-58 percent, and in the West to 80  percent, it is not hard to guess that we lose one out of every  five tonnes of oil we purchase. The inefficiency of our  economy, the inefficiency of our petrochemical enterprises, and  intensive use of power have led to a situation when the demand  for oil and gas does not decrease as sharply as production.  Energy should be conserved considerably. We therefore  submitted legislation on energy conservation to the Supreme  Council, but it was not adopted.    As everybody knows, we are always compared with France, in  terms of territory, population, and economic potential. But in  France the use of power is five times lower than in Ukraine.  This allows France to compete at world markets. We are still  not able to do so. Here is another example: A Kharkiv plant has  recently begun production of tractor engines. This tractor is  20 kg heavier than other countries' models. Thus, more energy  is used for smelting, and other processes also consume higher  expenditures. Can we sell this tractor on international  markets, where Western companies offer their better and  environment friendlier products? Neither Bulgaria, nor  Mongolia, nor Poland, nor the Czech Republic, nor Angola would  buy such equipment. Moreover, there will be no demand for it in  our country either.    We must be seriously engaged in the development of modern  technologies and Ukraine's participation in conversion programs.  This should be done wisely however. There are demands that the  Pivdenmash company produce trolley buses. Everybody understands  that we need such products. But, Pivdenmash is one of the best  space industry plants. Perhaps it is useful to continue such  production, since there is a great demand for space equipment  all over the world. Therefore, during our recent visit to the  United States, we discussed this issue with our American  colleagues. It was fortunate that the issue was included in the  agreement we signed there. The point is that Ukraine wants to,  and will, participate in international space programs. We can  earn hard currency on our intellectual potential.    We must constantly increase exports if we want our trade  balance to reach the zero mark. I recall that the late Yustyn  Todorovych Lychuk, a hero of socialist work, had the following  slogan in his office: "Economy is rich not thanks to many  purchases, but wise expenditures." We also should think about  wise expenditures, because we cannot live on credit forever.    [Trotsenko] Why does a state, which produces great amounts  of raw materials, on whose territory a third of the world's  blacklands is located, and which has well-developed metallurgy,  machine- building industry, and a great scientific-technical  potential, have a foreign trade deficit?    [Shpek] I will reply in brief: Because of its low economic  efficiency. You understand, even when we sell our products at  world prices, they sometimes do not compensate our costs.  Almost the entire agricultural production has losses, meaning  that costs exceed profits. The same situation exists in the  chemical industry. One must remember that not the producer and  consumer, but the dealer and customer determine economic policy  in a market economy.    [Trotsenko] Currently, there are many discussions concerning  Ukraine's joining the CIS economic union. What will our state  profit, by taking such a step?    [Shpek] A union means equality. I support equality, but if  we join the economic union, and we obtain prices for oil and gas  eight times higher than Russian consumers do, what kind of a  union is that? We were discussing free trade with Russia.  Russia, however, came forward with an amendment according to  which free trade does not apply to oil, gas, lumber, and  nonferrous metals. What kind of free trade is this? If it is  supposed to be free, let it be free. If it is supposed to be a  union, let it be a union. But, it is unfair to use one name and  another structure.... I am against such unions. This is simply  injustice and discrimination.    [Trotsenko] After World War II, many countries stood up on  their feet thanks to foreign assistance. Huge investments were  pumped into their economies, their industries received new  technologies. No country has ever entered world markets  unaided. Can we do that?    [Shpek] Of course, Ukraine cannot do that unassisted. To  implement reforms, to introduce structural reconstruction, and  to revive our enterprises we primarily need money and time. It  is extremely hard for us to earn money now. We therefore have  to attract foreign investors and producers.    It should be kept in mind that no country in the world can  exist without loans. We should adequately participate in the  world's distribution of labor. We can receive substantial funds  from foreign partners for our reforms and the development of a  strong, independent, and united Ukrainian state. If someone  thinks that he will be given money, simultaneously restoring the  socialist, administrative, command, and planning economy, his  hopes are vain, and he must abandon them. We are obliged to  develop our country in friendship and cooperation with all our  neighbors.</p>
